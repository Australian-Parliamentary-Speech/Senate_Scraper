Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Collings) criticized the Government for its handtomouth policy is regard to many matters that affect the rural industries. Criticism of that sort leaves out of account the fact that Australia not long ago passed through the greatest war in history, the effects of which are still being felt, and, possibly as a consequence of it, experienced the greatest depression in our history. It would be a great mistake, I think, and I believe that honorable senators will agree with me if we were to choose a time when the world was suffering from the consequences of a very grave war or depression to embark upon some great change in our social and economic system. The time for such a change is when normal conditions prevail. The conditions through which we have passed are, in themselves, a justification for measures of a temporary character; and in that respect the Government feelsthat it has not failed. In successive years since the prices of rural products generally, and possibly wheat in particular, dropped in 1930, financial assistance has been given by the Commonwealth to the wheat industry. Justification for that lay in the fact that other industries had been assisted, and that the wheat industry is of such importance to the community that, if it were not saved, the rest of the community must go down with it. More than 70,000 persons, it is estimated, are directly connected with the wheat industry, and in respect of production it is now second in importance only to wool. At the same time, the Government has not been unmindful of the need for doing something which will obviate these yearly appeals to Parliament which the Leader of the Opposition (SenatorCollings) yesterday deprecated. To a certain extent, I concur in his objections. In 1933 a royal commission was appointed for the very purpose of discovering whether something could not be done to obviate the necessity for these yearly appeals to Parliament for assistance by the wheat industry. The second report drawn up by the. commission, which has now completed its labours, contained u recommendation that something in the nature of a homeconsumption price should be created.","N/A","WHEAT GROWERS RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[2]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","BRENNAN, Thomas","K2Z","N/A","UAP","N/A","248","It did; but there are constitutional difficulties in the way of the establishment by the Commonwealth of a compulsory pool. Even if a pool were established, its purpose as I understand it and I think honorable senators agree would be to fix a homeconsumption price. That is to say, the end to be attained is a home consumption price; and attainment of that end may possibly be achieved through the agency of pools, excise, a flour tax, or other means. The outstanding fact that emerged from consideration of the wheat industrys plight was that, to carry out any recommendations of the royal commission, it was necessary that complementary legislation should be passed by the parliaments of the Commonwealth and the States. Some of the States have not passed the necessary complementary legislation. The Commonwealth Government had promised that, in such a contingency, or in the event of other factors preventing the homeconsumption price from being established for the harvest which has just ended, in order to provide assistance for the industry, it would reimpose the flour tax. That tax, as honorable senators know, was reimposed, and it was recently lifted.  The prices ruling for wheat with respect to this seasons harvest have been consistently higher than had been obtainable in the preceding few years. The prices obtaining in the three months December to February this year have been better to the extent of about ls. a bushel than those which obtained for the same period last year. If this difference be maintained the increase of the total cheque which will be received by the growers this year as compared with last year will be between £5,000,000 and £6,000,000. The shippers limits for wheat f.o.r. Williamstown during the three months December to February in the years 193435 and 193536 compare as follows: Honorable senators are aware that the flour tax was reenacted to provide assistance pending the enactment of the home consumption price legislation. The bill now before the Senate embodies the Governments proposals regarding the distribution of relief to growers for the harvest just reaped. The total amount provided in the bill for distribution is £1,878,906. It is proposed to make available this sum by way of grants to the various States, which in turn will effect distribution amongst the growers. The amounts to be made available to the various States are as follows: In making this allocation amongst the States, the Government had regard to the crops which it was estimated would be harvested, and also to any unfavorable seasonal conditions experienced. In so far as the crops basis is concerned, the allocation includes provision for a payment to the States of ls. a bushel for that proportion of the crop in each State which is equivalent to the proportion of the total crop in Australia that will be used for human consumption within the Commonwealth. This does not mean that growers are to be paid ls. a bushel on the home consumption quota. It is simply a basis for calculating the amount to be paid to each State for the relief of wheatgrowers. The latest estimate of the total crop is about 140,000,000 bushels. The quantity required for human consumption in Australia is about 32.000,000 bushels, which represents 23 per cent, of the total crop. The allocation under this heading will therefore absorb £1,610,103. The balance of £268,803 has been distributed amongst the States on the basis of the degree of adverse seasonal conditions experienced by them. From the information that is available Western Australia has suffered in this regard more than any other State. An amount of £161,600 has accordingly been allotted to that State from the £268,803 provided in this connexion. Of the balance, South Australia is allotted £69,896, and New South Wales £31,784. The remainder will be divided amongst the other States on an acreage basis. With regard to the manner of distribution by the States amongst individual wheatgrowers, the bill provides that payments may be made by the States on any basis deemed reasonable in the circumstances existing in the respective States, subject to the proposed method of distribution being first approved by the Minister. As the Commonwealth is providing the money, it thinks that it should have a voice in the methods of distribution. The methods which the various States propose to adopt in distributing the Commonwealth grant are New South Wales proposes to distribute the greater portion of the Commonwealth grant on an acreage basis. Approximately £93.000 will be used for relief of wheatgrowers who suffered serious loss through adverse seasonal conditions. Victoria has decided to distribute £50,000 amongst growers who suffered losses through drought, hail, storm and other damage, approximately £200,000 on an acreage basis, and the balance of the grant on a production basis. Queensland will distribute 25 per cent. of the grant to wheatgrowers suffering from specially adverse conditions, and the balance on an acreage basis. South Australia proposes to distribute the amount specially added to that States grant in respect of adverse seasonal conditions to those farmers who reaped 3 bushels an acre and under. Of the balance of the money 50 per cent. will probably be distributed on an acreage basis, and 50 per cent. on a bushelage basis. Western Australia proposes to distribute the amounts specially added to that States grant in respect of the adverse seasonal conditions as sustenance to those growers who suffered losses through drought, whilst the balance will be paid on an acreage basis. Tasmania will distribute the money on an acreage basis. As certain of the States propose to distribute some of the money as a bounty on production it will be necessary, under the Constitution, for both Houses of this Parliament to pass a resolution empowering the States to pay a bounty on production, where they desire to do so, out of the funds provided under this act. A resolution to this effect will be submitted as soon as the present bill has passed through all stages. The flour tax of £2 12s. 6d. a ton was reenacted to provide for these payments. When the tax was reimposed it was estimated that it would produceabout £1.600,000, if allowed to remain in operation for the full term. As the result of representations made to it, and particularly in view of the buoyancy of the revenue, the Government decided to discontinue the flour tax as from the 25th February, 1936. The total revenue derived from the tax will be about £1,200,000. The balance of approximately £680,000 will therefore have to be provided from revenue.","N/A","WHEAT GROWERS RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[2]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Meanwhile, I hope that the proposals in the bill will commend themselves to honorable senators.

All honorable senators and, for that matter, honorable members of all Australian Parliaments, knew that these proposals were to be submitted to the Commonwealth Parliament. The distribution, in respect of both method and amount, is on a basis which cannot be said to be unfavorable to any one State as compared with another, and any complaints against renewal of temporary measures of this character can be met with the reply that we have bad them from year to year.

That has been made more obvious to me this morning by the opening remarks of the Acting AttorneyGeneral (Senator Brennan) when introducing this bill. There is a great difference between the viewpoint from which the Opposition regards all these measures and that from which the Government regards them. It should be remembered that, although the Opposition supports Government measures occasionally because members of the Labour party consider that in the main they are desirable, it does not follow that we accept every dot over every  i or every crossing through every  t .

That, I think, should be the attitude of this chamber in all its deliberations. If the Senate does not have an Australian outlook, there can be no excuse for its continued existence on the present basis on which it is elected by the people. Each State enjoys equal representation in the Senate; therefore, I take it that we should not be merely Queenslanders, or Victorians, or Western Australians, but that at all times we should be Australians legislating for all Australia.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","COLLINGS, Joseph","K7P","N/A","N/A","N/A","250","I am delighted to find that on this occasion Senator Sampson agrees with me surely I cannot be wrong. What is the Australian outlook, and what should be our approach to measures such as the one now under consideration? In my opinion, the Senate should conform at all times to the declared national policy of Australia, which is to give full and adequate protection to all primary and secondary industries. Such a policy, I believe, would be accepted by a great majority of the Australian people regardless of their political persuasions. Honorable senators of the Opposition advocate that the wealth producers of Australia should enjoy the full results of their toil. We stand for giving the wealth produced to the wealth producers. Of course, I realize that ito put such a scheme into practice we would require to introduce an entirely different social order.  We support measures designed to relieve the distress of primary producers, because we believe that by that means we are giving more and more the full results of their toil to the producers of wheat, wool, sugar, and the various other commodities which constitute the primary production of Australia. I realize that the Government would argue, if it considered it worth while to argue with the Opposition, that we do not believe in giving the full results of their toil to all those who produce wealth. But that is incorrect. The Government would probably also contend that we place a narrow interpretation upon the term  wealth producer  that we believe in giving the farm labourer a fair return for his work, but do not extend the same consideration to the farm owner. In reply to such criticism, I state that in Australia there is, at any rate, one State, Queensland, which has gone as far as it has been able to go in that direction. The Labour party maintains that any industry, whether primary or secondary, or any unit contributing anything to the final result in wealth production and distribution, would get its full reward if the Labour policy were in operation. We do not believe that the coupon clippers, the interest mongers, and the men who batten on the primary and secondary industries, should participate in this reward, because they contribute nothing to the production or the satisfactory distribution of wealth. For these reasons, the Opposition today gives its support to this bill; but I take this opportunity to inform the Minister that we shall offer criticism of certain of the provisions of the measure which, in our opinion, ought not to be there, and we shall suggest the inclusion of provisions which should be in the bill but are not. When introducing the bill the Minister, if he was not being ironical, was quite a comedian. By way of correcting my apparent obtuseness yesterday, he said that the Government was obliged to bring down this piecemeal kind of legislation foi the relief of the primary producer because of some of the disastrous experiences through which the nation had recently passed. He alluded first to the Great War. Doubtless, I would be ruled out of order if I alluded to the attitude of the Government and of honorable senators opposite on that great issue. I shall content myself by reminding them that the war concluded eighteen years ago, and asking: Have not this Government and its predecessors, during the period since the signing of the Armistice, had ample time to realize the effects of the war? Surely governments should have been prepared to cope with the results which they must have been aware would follow on the termination of the war. It was quite obvious to some of us, even though we have not had the advantage of the better education of some other honorable senators who oppose us, that there cannot be destruction of wealth without somebody, somewhere, and at some some time, having to pay for it. The Minister, in his capacity of either instructor or comedian, also said that we had experienced a very serious depression. I venture to assert that numbers of people outside this Parliament realize the seriousness of that depression. For a number of years this Government was satisfied to tell the people that prosperity was just around the corner, but now it is continually telling them that prosperity has arrived in Australia. Only last week I heard the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) assert, quite seriously, that his policy had now brought about prosperity and that his  wonderful  Government had achieved wonderful things. The Minister stated that the Government realizes that if the wheatgrowing industry is not saved, the community will go to the wall with it.","N/A","WHEAT GROWERS RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[3]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Government, which he now strongly supports, although a few months ago he condemned it, is in the saddle. On it devolves the responsibility of providing remedies, and it is the task of the Opposition to indicate the weaknesses in its proposals. At least we should be given credit for not having been guilty of merely factious opposition. When we believe that a bill does not call for opposition, we allow it to pass without discussion; but when we consider that it vitally affects the interests of the nation we yield to none in our desire to state our case. I desire to ask the Minister and honorable senators who support the Government whether they consider that the wheat industry or the community will be saved by proposals such as the one contained in this bill. Nevertheless, the Opposition will support this measure, because it realizes that it is one extending relief to a section of the community that is in dire need of assistance.  What has been the attitude of the Government in regard to this matter? We realize how the hearts of Ministers bleed for the primary producer, particularly for the wheatgrower. But let us look at their record. I recall that a conference was held in Canberra on the 4th October of last year, the delegates to which were not altogether a happy family. It was convened by the Commonwealth Government for the wheatgrowing interests throughout Australia to consider the situation. In my opinion, the Government should have been able to collect the necessary data without summoning that conference. It could have been obtained without difficulty by correspondence with the interested parties. Represented at that conference were some sections of the industry which were in favour of the establishment of a compulsory wheat pool. I do not intend to read the remarks in that connexion, because I quoted extensively from them in a similar debate last year. Suffice it for me to say that the representative of the Commonwealth Government, the Minister for Commerce (Dr. Earle Page) refused to test the committee on a scheme for the establishment of a compulsory pool, such as has been tried with success in Queensland. Owing to the pool, wheatgrowers in that State obtained higher prices for their product than did growers in other States.","N/A","WHEAT GROWERS RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[3]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Acting AttorneyGeneral (Senator Brennan) said that the wheat problem would have been settled long ago, if certain States had implemented the necessary legislation ; but I ask, in all seriousness, whether he expected the States to implement a measure which had not been introduced in either branch of this Parliament. The bill was not passed until December, and sufficient time was not available to enable the States to pass complementary legislation between then and the Christmas holidays. If the contention of the Government is that this Parliament has not had sufficient time to deal with the problem, let me ask once again why we were not called together earlier last year, and kept sitting later, so that we might do the job for which the taxpayers employ and pay us.  What is the position disclosed by the report of the royal commission that inquired into the conditions in the industry? The difficulty cannot be overcome by merely tinkering with it, and granting an annual distribution of alms. Sooner or later, we must get down to bedrock, or make way for a government that understands the problems of the industry, and is prepared to set it on a proper footing. The report of the commission shows that 40 per cent. of the growers in Australia can meet their working expenses, including interest, and earn, in addition, £125 a year as their share of the wealth produced by them. Of course, the commission points out that £125 a year means more to a farmer than it would to a city worker. It is said that it is equivalent to about £200 a year, because a farmer can produce a good deal of the food required by himself and his family, and does not usually spend so much in certain directions as city dwellers. Does the Government imagine that it will solve this problem by passing piecemeal legislation? The report of the commission is most illuminating. It shows that various interests are taking a heavy toll of the industry; yet no proposal is submitted by the Government to compel predatory vested interests to disgorge some of their profits.","N/A","WHEAT GROWERS RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[3]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Speaking from memory, about £1,200,000 was raised by the flour tax up to the end of January last. The levying of that impost showed the utter incapacity of the Government to finance the bounty on a just basis, seeing that the bulk of the tax fell on the working classes, who are the largest consumers of bread. Up to the 24th February, when the tax ceased to operate, the total sum raised by it was about £1,500,000, and, therefore, a comparatively small amount is required from the Consolidated Revenue to enable the bounty to be paid. At the committee stage, the Opposition will endeavour to see that the assistance is given to those who are most entitled to it. Whether that can best be done by making the bounty payable only to those having no taxable income, or whether some other plan should be adopted is a matter for inquiry.

I have heard the Leader of the Opposition and also exSenator Daly and exSenator OHalloran, speak at length in advocacy of a compulsory wheat pool, but when we have asked them, as we have done on numerous occasions :  Show us how a compulsory wheat pool can be established constitutionally , they have had no reply for us.  During the course of the debate on the Wheat and Wheat Products Bill towards the end of last year some of us made specific inquiries from Labour senators to ascertain whether they could show us some constitutional means of establishing a compulsory wheat pool, but they could not do so. We have to face the fact, however, that there are other than constitutional difficulties in the way of a compulsory wheat pool. Such an organization could not be established without the full consent and cooperation of the State governments unless a change were effected in the Constitution, and the States are not unanimous on the subject. During the wheat conference held some time ago, Mr. Bulcock, Minister for Agriculture in the Queensland Labour government, said that if a referendum were held with the object of securing an alteration of the Constitution to make the establishment of a compulsory wheat pool possible, the main issue would undoubtedly be obscured and the decision turn actually upon what would be the effect of such an alteration on the price of bread. I remind honorable senators that this wheat conference was representative of the industry in every respect, and was not simply a clique gathered together under the patronage of this Government. It was generally agreed at that conference that it would not be practicable to secure an alteration of the Constitution at present to make a Commonwealth pool possible yet in spite of that fact, honorable senators of the Opposition continue to attack the Government for not taking steps to set up a compulsory pool. Even if the constitutional situation were clear we have no guarantee that all the State governments would favour the establishment of a compulsory pool. I invite the attention of honorable senators to the following extract from a speech which I delivered in this chamber on this subject on the 6th December last:","N/A","WHEAT GROWERS RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[4]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

But the Western Australian representative said: We cannot pledge ourselves to a compulsory pool. All that we can do is to promise to consider it. And the Tasmanian representative said :  I am personally in favour of a compulsory pool, hut if I submit it to my growers they will want to shoot mc off the planet. Mr. Butler, the Premier of South Australia, definitely stated his opposition to a compulsory pool.

When their charge against the Government is analysed it is shown to be completely ineffective, for they cannot indicate how a compulsory wheat pool could be established.  Before the adjournment of parliament for the Christmas recess a measure was passed which provided for a home consumption price of wheat. It required however, the collaboration of the State governments to make it effective. I do not wish to weary honorable senators by discussing various aspects of the constitutional position, as the issue will shortly come before the Privy Council, but I desire to put this whole subject in a clear light. It is easy to demand, in broad and vague terms, as the Leader of the Opposition has done, that a compulsory pool shall be established, but it is quite a different matter to indicate how it can be done. After all, we must live within our Constitution. The Leader of the Opposition has said that this Government has done nothing to assist the wheatgrowers, but let us remind ourselves for a moment or two of what has happened in the last few years, and consider the probable effect of a restoration of the price level as a contribution to the solution of the difficulties of this industry. Since the beginning of the depression, when the price of wheat fell so badly, the Commonwealth Government has provided £12,52S,000 in grants and otherwise for the assistance of the wheat industry. 1 feel sure that even honorable senators of the opposition will agree that that is very liberal assistance, which, I am convinced, was not undeserved. It was, in fact, a due recognition of the perilous plight of the industry. Instead of occupying time in dealing with the details of these various grants, I wish to point out that the tendency revealed in this bill which comes before us at a time when the price is less depressed than it has been for some time, is to taper off financial grants in aid of the industry as the price of wheat rises. I believe that a reduction of the amount of assistance offered is being effected because prices have recovered to some extent.","N/A","WHEAT GROWERS RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[4]/para[4]","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","HARDY, Charles","KNZ","N/A","N/A","N/A","256","I am aware of that, but I leave that issue on one side for the moment. I ask whether a restoration of prices will enable the wheatgrowers to recover their position, and in doing so, I am not attempting in any sense whatever to decry the work of the Government in assisting the industry. We must face the fact, however, that since the partial recovery of prices a tapering off has occurred in the financial assistance granted to the industry. Carrying this consideration to its logical conclusion, we must assume that when price levels again become normal, financial assistance to the industry by bounty and otherwise will disappear. We have excellent grounds for that assumption. In 193334, when the price was 2s. 8&d. a bushel, relief to the amount of £3,053,000 was granted to the wheat industry ; whereas in 193536, when the price is estimated at 3s. 6d. a bushel, the relief to be granted is £1,800,000. That undoubtedly justifies the conclusion that, as the price recovers, financial relief to this industry will taper off until it ultimately disappears. Comparing the price this year with the price last year, the recovery of gross revenue to the industry represents approximately an additional £5,000,000 to £6,000,000. I particularly ask the Government and honorable senators to consider whether such an increase of the gross revenue earned by the industry will put it back on its feet. I mentioned earlier that the royal commission which inquired into the wheat industry made a careful investigation which cost the Commonwealth £45,000. One of the most alarming features of its findings a feature that should perturb all who study the industry was its analysis of the debt structure of the industry, which really controls the industrys economic value. The commission found that the debts owed by the industry totalled £150,000,000. The commission, working on a hypothetical production of sheep to the acre, also found that the assets of the industry totalled only £135,000,000. Applying a business test, we can say, on these figures, that the industry is bankrupt by an amount of £15,000,000. For these reasons I ask whether the restoration of a high price is going .to put the industry back on its feet. The commission also found that £10,000,000 would be required to restore the plant and equipment necessary for the carrying on of the industry. Even at prices which would give the industry an increase of revenue of roughly from £5,000,000 to £6,000,000 a year, two years will be required for the industry to reestablish its plant from earnings, even without touching its debt structure, and this must be done before we can say that it is able to carry on economically. An examination of these facts must raise in the minds of honorable senators very serious problems, because we must deduce from them that the slightest reverse suffered by the wheatgrowers in respect of prices will mean that the industry will be forced again to approach this Parliament as a mendicant. Because of the economic recovery during the last few years, due mainly to the wise administration of this Government, interest rates are beginning to harden. This was bound to happen, through the operation of the law of supply and demand. In other words, the value of money is going to rise on account of the increasing demand for it. But it must be remembered that while it is evidence of returning prosperity, the hardening of interest rates will increase the costs of production for the wheatgrower. Dealing with the effect of interest rates on the industry, the royal commission disclosed an alarming position. It showed that 21.5 per cent, of the farmers have to pay an interest charge of 3d. or less a bushel; 25 per cent., an interest charge of between 4d. and 6d. a bushel; 14.6 per cent., an interest charge of between 7d. and 9d. a bushel; and 14.4 per cent, an interest charge of between lOd. and ls. a bushel. While the nation generally may possibly be able to stand a hardening of the interest rates, which is bound to come as a consequence of returning prosperity, we have to realize that such a develop ment will increase the production costs of the wheatgrower. Therefore, I submit, we have to watch very closely the future of the wheat industry in Australia.

The reduced amount of the grant made by the Commonwealth Government this year for the assistance of the wheat industry is disappointing, particularly to the wheatgrowers of Australia, and to those who have suffered from the drought, which has been exceptionally severe in Western Australia. Of course, those sufferers have received no benefit whatever from the present increased value of wheat in the markets of the world. The bounty proposed to be appropriated under this measure is the smallest amount that has been voted for the assistance of the industry from federal finances during the last five years; that is since, owing to the depression, prices for wheat on the world markets fell to a low level. The basis of allocation of assistance among the States is also unsound and disappointing, and it has proved very detrimental to the wheatgrowers of Western Australia, the northern and northwestern areas of which have experienced the worst drought since the widespread drought of 1911. In his last policy speech broadcast through national stations on the 14th August, 1934, the Minister for Commerce (.Dr. Earle Page), pointed out that the Country party had been compelled to fight for temporary assistance to the wheat industry. That is true. He claimed that the Country party had been instrumental in securing grants of £3,500,000 in 1931, £2,000,000 in 1932, and £3,000,000 in 1933. In respect of the harvest for the following year, the Parliament, acting on the advice of the royal commission which inquired into the industry and recommended a grant of £4,000,000, appropriated £4,000,000 for the assistance of wheatgrowers. For this year, however, the recommendation made by that important and expensive commission in favour of the establishment of a compulsory pool was not given effect to for reasons which have been fully explained, and which I need not discuss at this juncture. However, the assistance to be given to the industry under this measure has been reduced to a total of £1,878,546, as compared with over £4,000,000 in the previous year.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","JOHNSTON, Edward","KP8","N/A","N/A","N/A","258","I am dealing specifically with the unsympathetic treatment and lack of adequate assistance given to the wheatfarmers in the droughtstricken areas of Western Australia. The Governments revenue for the first eight, months of this financial year exceeds by £4,432,000 the surplus for the corresponding period of last year; yet the Government has reduced its grant to the wheat industry this year as compared with that made last year by £2,221.000. Reverting to the remarks made by Dr. Earle Page, which I have just quoted, I point out that there is more discrimination made in this bill than in any wheat legislation introduced into this Parliament during the last five years with the object of assisting the grower. Unfortunately for the growers in Western Australia this measure discriminates against the States and the wheatfarmers most severely hit by drought conditions. As the grant of £1,878,546, with the exception of £268,000 is being distributed on the basis of production, more money will be given to those who have had the best crops, and less to those who have had poor crops or no crops at all. Unfortunately the majority of the latter class of farmers are in Western Australia. I knew perfectly well that some honorable senators would remind me that the price of wheat on the worlds markets has improved quite substantially. We hope that that improvement will be permanent, but, as I have already pointed out, growers who reaped no crop or very little crop, have received no benefit at all as a result of the increase of price. On the contrary, many of them, in addition to sustaining these losses, will have to pay more money for seed wheat this year than they would under ordinary conditions. Only £208,000 is being voted this year for special drought relief by the Commonwealth Government throughout Australia, as compared with a grant of £1,600,000 distributed to the States on a bushelage basis. Over £580,000 was voted last year for the assistance of necessitous farmers, as compared with this grant of £268,000 to be voted for the relief of . needy farmers this year. Following on Dr. Pages argument that the protection afforded to secondary industries through the tariff is given without discrimination, I point out that the protection given to such industries is not halved because some of them are prosperous. Although the price of wheat has risen the wheat industry is still in an unsatisfactory condition. Farmers are using wornout machinery and plant, and for many years their operations have been conducted at a loss. Yet the moment the price of wheat shows an improvement, the Government reduces the grant to the industry generally, and also the grant to necessitous farmers by more than half of what it was last year. We do not find the iron and steel, and the textile and sugar industries treated in that way immediately their operations are conducted on a profitable basis. The wheat industry of Australia, particularly of Western Australia, is not yet established on a profitable basis. Last year £872,578 was granted by the Commonwealth to assist wheatgrowers in Western Australia, whereas this year, following a severe drought and a much smaller crop only about 20,000,000 bushels compared with 37,500,000 bushels two years ago there is a reduction to £392,850. Moreover, the moment the price of wheat rises, the Government hastens to reduce last years grant of £4,100,000 to necessitous farmers by £2,221,454 and the vote for special drought relief in an even greater proportion.

The figures show a decrease of the Australian distribution and also of the total amount granted to Western Australia for the assistance of the wheat industry £392,000 this year, compared with £872,578 last year, when there was a better season. The Government of Western Australia, the Primary Producers Association, and the Wheatgrowers Union of that State, have protested to the Prime Minister against the total inadequacy of the proposed grant, particularly that for the assistance of farmers in the areas which have suffered from drought. When in Perth on the 17th February last, the Minister for Commerce (Dr. Earle Page) admitted that the grant for drought relief was inadequate, but, although the Commonwealth Treasury is overflowing, no increase of the proposed grant of £161,600 for drought relief is shown in this measure. At a later stage, I shall deal more fully with that subject, and with the remarks of the Minister for Commerce. In 1934, when Western Australia was granted £872,578, the distribution was made on the basis of 3s. an acre plus 3d. a bushel. As the average return for the State was just under 10 bushels an acre, that basis meant an average of 53. 6d. an acre, plus £137,000 for necessitous farmers. This year, only £382,S50 is being granted to that State.  I object most emphatically to the unjust basis of distribution of the £1,878,546 to be made available under this bill to the various States.

It appears to the people of Western Australia that, owing to the wheat crop in that State being lighter than was anticipated, a further reduction of the grant from £430,000 to £393,000 was decided upon. Owing to drought conditions, the wheat production in Western Australia has been reduced to 20,000,000 bushels, and under this measure that State is to receive reduced instead of increased assistance from the Commonwealth Government. A few years ago the honorable member for Wakefield (Mr. Hawker) described the wheat policy of the Federal Government as one of  taking from the needy to assist the greedy. That principle is being followed in this measure. At any rate, money has apparently been taken from the needy State of Western Australia during a drought year, because the returns in that State were not nearly so good as were anticipated originally. I protest strongly against a policy which deprives Western Australia of financial assistance to the amount of £37,000, because the drought is more severe than was anticipated. Probably the amount is a great deal more, because the drought conditions were more severe in that State than in other parts of the Commonwealth. Under this bill, the following grants are to be made :  Included in these amounts is £161,600 drought relief to Western Australia, £69,896 to South Australia, and £31,784 to New South Wales. The Minister for Commerce (Dr. Earle Page), in his letter of the 6th February, said that the allocation to each State was to be based on the crops in each State, and would have due regard to the adverse seasonal conditiwis in the respective wheatgrowing States, lie further stated that it would be left to the State governments to make the payments subject to the approval of the Commonwealth Government on a Hat acreage basis graduated according to the yield. Yet, under this measure, the sum apportioned to each State, with the exception of £26S,803, is allocated solely on the basis of production. This works out unjustly, particularly in the case of Western Australia and of South Australia, which have experienced drought conditions in some areas. If the States Are to distribute the grant on an acreage basis, the allocation should also be on that basis, and the Government should have acted in that way. Although the States were informed that their distribution could be on an acreage basis, £1,600,000 was distributed on other than that basis, which benefited the wheatgrowers in those States with heavy crops, but was to the detriment of wheatgrowers where the crops were lighter.","N/A","WHEAT GROWERS RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[5]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If the States are to distribute grants on an acreage basis, the allocation to the States should be on that basis. I regret that under this measure the Commonwealth Government has ignored the request of the Government of Western Australia, the Primary Producers Association and the Wheatgrowers Union of that State, that the allocation as between the States should be on an acreage basis and that special assistance should be rendered to the wheatgrowers in droughtstricken areas. Despite the fact that the crop in droughtstricken areas was one of the lowest on record, and that the wheatgrowers in the eastern States had bumper harvests, the Commonwealth Government proposes to pay a bounty on a bushelage basis as follows :  If drought relief is included New South Wales receives 2s. ll^d. an acre, Western Australia 3s. 2|d. an acre, and South Australia 2s. 9£d an acre. These figures, carefully computed on an acreage basis, show that the Commonwealth Governments allocation is unjust, and contrary to the spirit of the Constitution, which provides that there shall be no undue discrimination between States. In view of the figures quoted it is clear that the Commonwealth Government is not rendering special assistance to droughtstricken farmers, and that the relief afforded is given at the expense of other farmers in the States concerned. When the Minister for Commerce (Dr. Earle Page) visited Perth he said that the Commonwealth Government was making to that State a grant of 3s. 3d. an acre. The 3s. 3d. an acre includes the whole of the drought relief of £161,000. That means that if the growers of Western Australia receive 33. 3d. an acre under this measure, they are contributing the whole of the £161,600 provided for drought relief. If the drought relief is excluded, they are getting only ls. 10^d. an acre for the whole of last years crop, which is most unjust when compared with the higher sum paid to other wheatgrowers in the Commonwealth.","N/A","WHEAT GROWERS RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[5]/continue[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

At any rate, the whole of the allocation of £161,000 is being taken from the Western Australian wheatfanners, who, according to Dr. Earle Page, were to receive 3s. 3d. I protest strenuously against the payment of only £231,256 as an ordinary bounty, plus £161,600 as a special measure of drought relief to Western Australia, because the amount is entirely inadequate to meet the needs of a State which has suffered more severely from drought this year than has any other State. Surely the policy of the Commonwealth Government, as expressed in this bill, is that to those who have much wheat, much shall be given. The Western Australia grant, which was £S72,000 last year, has now been reduced from the £430,000 forcast by the Secretary of the Department of Commerce to £392,850. The Government of Western Australia, the Primary Producers Association, and the Wheatgrowers Union have protested to the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) in no uncertain terms against the proposed allocation. In 193031 South Australia experienced drought conditions, and the Federal Government properly granted drought relief to the amount of £850,000, as compared with £161.600 to be granted to Western Australia this year, under comparable conditions. It is estimated that there are 8,000 wheatfarmers in Western Australia. The wheat yield in that State for the last harvest was estimated at 20,000,000 bushels, as compared with 27,000,000 bushels for 193435, and 37,500,000 bushels for 193334. The State average for 193334 was 11.7 bushels, in 193435 9.8 bushels, and this year it is estimated at 8.3 bushels an acre. Up to 1933 the State average was 11.86 bushels an acre. These figures show that the decline in the last two years has been 17,500,000 bushels, or almost 50 per cent.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","JOHNSTON, Edward","KP8","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I endorse those statements in their entirety; they are quite correct. I hope that the Government will supplement this measure, which I intend to support, with another bill making an adequate grant to those States which have suffered from drought. According to figures collected by the Wheatgrowers Union, 3,500 farms were affected by last years drought, and it is estimated that 1,200 of them have no crop at all, that 1,500 will average less than four bushels an acre, and that 600 others will average between 4 and 6 bushels an acre. These figures demonstrate the necessity for the granting of immediate assistance to the droughtstricken areas. In this connexion the request from Western Australia has the support of the State government and of both organizations representing the whole of the wheatfarmers of that State.  I now desire to refer to some quite remarkablestatements made by the Minister for Commerce (Dr. Earle Page) in an interview with a deputation representing the Wheatgrowers Union which waited on him during his recent visit to Perth. The union made three requests to him; they are reported in the West Australian of the 18th February as follows (1) The setting up of a compulsory pool, with power to fix a homeconsumption price for wheat. As the question of a compulsory pool had been postponed by the Federal Government, ponding the result of a Privy Council appeal, the union asked at least for an assurance that the Government intended to honour the recommendation of the Federal Wheat Commission that the wheatgrowers would be brought into line with other sections of the community and given a home price for their product. The flour tax would be repealed on 25th February, and the union sought an assurance that, in repealing the flour tax, the Government would make permanent and more satisfactory arrangements to give the wheatgrowers a homeconsumption price. (2). The making of a sufficient Federal grant to refinance the wheatgrowing industry. The chief cause of abandonments in this State, and a cause which must have increasing effects in the future, was that the farmers power unit was below standard, his machinery was worn out, his farm improvements had deteriorated and he had no money to finance a partial change over from wheat to wool. The Wheat Commission had stated that the Federal tariff policy raised the cost of development of the average Western Australian farm by £500. The wheatgrowers of this State now asked the Federal Government to return portions of this £500 by means of lowinterest loans to refinance their industry. (3). The suspension of the tariff on such vital farming necessities as wirenetting, to permit of the exchange on a barter basis of wool for wirenetting from Germany, and other foreign countries whose markets had been lost by the Australian tariff policy. Cheap wirenetting was essential to the continuance of wheat and stock farming in Western. Australia. Farmers could get netting from Germany at 35 per cent. less than the Australian price, and in exchange, Germany would take wool at a price above parity. In the course of his reply, Dr. Earle Page said","N/A","WHEAT GROWERS RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[5]/para[17]","N/A","N/A"

Had that legislation been passed in time, there would have been available this year for the assistance of distressed farmers a sum of £900,000, which had been collected from the flour tax.

The least the Commonwealth Government could have done was to have made available the £900,000 originally earmarked for drought relief in this industry instead of the comparatively meagre sum of £268,000 proposed in this bill. We were led to expect better treatment from the Government, in which the Country party has half of the say. Particularly should the original sum of £900,000 have been made available when we recall that the. Government voluntarily suspended the operation of the flour tax, which could have been continued indefinitely. I take strong objection to the position which has resulted from the repeal of the flour tax. Relief has been given to the consumers at the expense of distressed farmers of three States, particularly of Western Australia, who are receiving special drought relief. If the sum of £900,000 had been distributed among the wheatgrowers of Australia, Western Australias share would have amounted to approximately £580,000. I have never read more puerile excuses by any Minister than those made by Dr. Earle Page in regard to the Governments failure to carry out its obvious duty to the wheatfarmers of those districts which have unfortunately suffered from the recent drought. He said that as the complementary legislation had not been enacted by all the States the Commonwealth could only make available £250,000. I much regret that such an attitude should be adopted by any member of the Government towards the weakest section of our farmers those growers who have suffered so severely from drought conditions and who have derived no benefit whatever from increased wheat prices. The Commonwealth Government must be hed entirely responsible, because of its failure to convene the Agricultural Council earlier than October last, for the delay in imple meriting the homeconsumption legislation. Four of the States, including New South Wales, failed to implement the Commonwealths proposals for a homeconsumption price of wheat in time for the last harvest, but it is grossly unfair that farmers in the droughtstricken areas of Western Australia should be made to suffer. The position taken up by the Commonwealth Government towards wheatgrowers, as evidenced by the remarks of the Minister for Commerce in Perth, is most unjust, and it is no wonder that growers are, through their organizations, protesting strenuously to the Prime Minister against the partial abandonment of the Governments proposals to aid wheatfarmers in droughtstricken areas. The discontinuance on the 24th February last of the sales tax on flour has had a serious effect on the position of wheatgrowers in my State. If the Government had continued that tax it could have paid to wheatfarmers in drought areas the £900,000 which the Minister for Commerce had assured them would be available in the form of a homeconsumption price for wheat. Because of the Governments action the measure of assistance being given to the wheatgrowers in Western Australia this year is smaller than in any season for the last five years.

Even at this late hour I appeal to the Government to make this amount available for special drought relief purposes in Western Australia, instead of the sum of £160,000 to be allocated under this bill. This £900,000 was definitely promised by the Minister for Commerce for drought relief, subject to the Governments proposals for a home consumption price being implemented by the States, and bearing in mind that Commonwealth revenue for the eight months of the present financial year is £4,500,000 in excess of the amount received for the corresponding period of last year, I urge the Government to make available the amount of £900,000 originally decided upon for drought relief. My sympathy is with the Government of Western Australia, regardless of its political affiliations in its request for £872,000 for drought relief this year, because I realize that, in dealing with its drought stricken wheatgrowers under these inadequate Commonwealth proposals, it is expected to repeat the miracle of the loaves and fishes.

We on this side are not opposed to assistance being given to primary producers who are in need of it. With Senator Johnston, we realize that there are in this country many thousands of wheatfarmers whose position is desperate in the extreme, and we consider that it is only fair that they should receive some measure of assistance from the Commonwealth. It is also interesting to note that Senator Johnston has changed his mind with regard to the distribution of this money, and it is pertinent to inquire the reason for this change. Apparently, the wheatgrowers themselves have their own opinion of the attitude of this Government. At the annual conference of the Wheatgrowers Union in Western Australia, on Saturday, the loth February, certain resolutions were reached.  Many controversial topics were debated at this conference, which, I understand, represented over 140 branches of the wheatgrowers in Western Australia. Many of these farmers are actually situated in the droughtstricken areas, and are among those on whose behalf Senator Johnston made a splendid plea for more assistance from this Government. I hope the Government will take notice of that plea for which I commend Senator Johnston. He takes his work as a Country party senator very seriously. However, I cannot commend him on the whole of his speech, because in his concluding remarks he advocated a continuance of the flour tax, to which members of the Opposition are opposed. But that was the only fault I could find with his speech. Possibly in time, we may influence him to change his views on this matter. At the conference of wheatgrowers to which I have referred, Mr. W. Bagshaw, who is a member of the Country party, moved that a vote of no confidence be recorded against all Federal Parliamentary members of the Country party, except Senator E. B. Johnston, for failing to implement the whole of the recommendations of the royal commission which inquired into the wheat and associated industries. This conference accepted Senator Johnston as the only real representative of the Country party in this chamber. Of course, members of the Opposition claim to be true representatives of the farmer. Whether the Country party is in office or out of office, we stand for the f farmer all the time. We believe that he should be enabled to enjoy, to the full, the products of his toil. Senator Johnston believes that the farmers interests should always come first and invariably he stands up for them. We must commend an honorable senator who fights so earnestly on behalf of a section of the people whose industry constitutes an important part of the economic structure of Western Australia. Senator Hardy criticized severely the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Collings). He asked what proposal we had to suggest. He said,  Criticism is generally destructive ; let us have something constructive. I ask him what is the use of honorable senators on this side of the chamber continually expounding the Labour partys programme, if no notice is to be taken of it by the honorable senator and others opposite. In season and out of season, wc have urged that the Government should tackle the fundamental problems confronting the wheatgrowers, and that it should put an end to its present policy of expediency. We say that the Government should take cognizance of economic developments throughout the world, and deal basically with these problems. I point OUt, particularly to Senator Hardy, that although this Government has been in office for the last four and a half years, it is still carrying out its same old policy of distributing, from time to time, certain sums of money which give only temporary relief to the wheatgrowers. I admit that in December last, rather belatedly, the Government introduced legislation for the establishment of a homeconsumption price. So far as that is a step towards stabilizing the industry on a thorough and efficient basis, we support it, because we believe that we must constantly progress towards the goal of efficient organization and control for every industry in Australia. So far as the organization of the wheat industry is concerned, the Labour partys policy was expounded in a statement made by me on behalf of exSenator OHalloran, when he was a member of this chamber. ExSenator OHalloran, who possesses one of the keenest minds in the Labour movement, and is himself a wheatfarmer, showed in his scheme how the industry could be stabilized, and how each farmer could be guaranteed a certain price for his wheat. Whether he be a member of the real Country party, like Senator Johnston, or the camouflaged Country party, like Senator Hardy, or a dyedinthewool supporter of the United Australia party, no honorable senator can justly charge the Labour party with having failed to place before the people of Australia constructive proposals to deal fundamentally with the problems confronting the wheat industry. We submit that this Government, since it assumed office in 1931, has failed to stabilize that industry.","N/A","WHEAT GROWERS RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[6]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Daily, we see evidence of the fact that they are anxious that their industry should be thoroughly organized, so that they will be enabled to receive a decent return for their work. No one can deny that today the farmers are not receiving a fair return for their labour; that is the reason for the introduction of this measure, the faults in which have been revealed by Senator Johnston. However, we, as an Opposition, support any proposal that will assist the farmers. Although £47,000 has already been spent by this Government on trips abroad by its members, Dr. Earle Page has just gone to the United Kingdom. No reason has been given for his trip, although I suppose, according to his lights, he will do his best on behalf of this country on his present mission. No one is better acquainted than is Dr. Earle Page with the problems confronting the farmers. Last session he brought forward a measure to appropriate £12,000,000 to rehabilitate primary industry, but up to the present only a few thousand pounds of that sum has been distributed. Senator Hardy continually speaks of what the Government intends to do for the farmers, and the Government from time to time brings forward measures of this nature which are relatively drops in the ocean. The royal commission which inquired into the wheat industry revealed that the wheat farmers alone owe £140,000,000, and Senator Hardy has pointed out that £10,000,000 will be required to enable the growers to secure efficient machinery to enable them to carry on their industry economically. In contrast to those huge requirements we find today that a mere £1,600,000 is to be distributed through the States to the wheatgrowers, whilst another small sum is to be apportioned for the relief of necessitous growers. We do not oppose the granting of such assistance because we believe in giving assistance to every person who is in need of it. Because of the stupid economic system under which we live these number thousands. The Governments policy of continually tinkering with the situation will never prove effective. Although it claims that it has endeavoured to stabilize the industry, it has taken a long time to move towards that goal. Furthermore, it has only dealt superficially with the farmers problems, because it refuses to take cognizance of economic happenings throughout the world, so far as they affect the wheat industry. ExSenator Elliott, who was pushed out of this chamber by the United Australia party, repeatedly pointed to events happening in other parts of the world and warned the Government of the danger of com petition in a few years from other countries which have placed their industries on a sound economic basis. The honorable member for Macquarie in the House of Representatives (Mr. John Lawson), in addresses delivered at gatherings of United Australia party supporters, since his return from Europe has corroborated the statement of exSenator R. D. Elliott, and said that it is more than likely that in another ten years the Australian wheatgrower will be no longer in the export business. The Government should take notice of the remarks of these men, and not be content with a policy of expediency. There is need for planned action to solve the problems confronting our primary industries, but unfortunately, the attitude of honorable senators opposite is such that it is difficult for honorable senators on this side of the chamber to make them understand the real position. Not until the crisis arrives will they try to do something. We on this side prefer to prepare for the crisis. The statement of Senator Johnston bears out what has been said with regard to expediency. Had the Government been courageous, it would not have left the distribution of this money to the States. My understanding of clause 6 is that, under it, any State which receives a grant from the Commonwealth will be free to distribute the money as it likes so long as the Minister consents to the general basis of distribution whether it shall be an acreage basis or a bushelage basis. I now ask the Minister to say whether or not the States will be absolutely free to distribute the money as they wish, subject to the general approval of the Minister.

As a representative of one of the major wheatgrowing States, and also having had considerable experience of the wheat industry, although not now financially interested in it, I desire to address the Senate on this bill. Despite what Senator Johnston has said of the injustice done to South Australia, I am of the opinion that the farmers of that State are grateful to the Commonwealth Government for the assistance which will be rendered to them under this legislation. In his opening remarks the Acting AttorneyGeneral (Senator Brennan) said that there was nothing new in the bill. That is true; but I find consolation in the belief that it is the last measure of its kind that will come before the Senate. This Parliament enacted legislation last year which should make the introduction of similar bills unnecessary in the future. The Minister said that the shrinkage of wheat prices was the biggest factor in making this legislation necessary. While agreeing with that statement in the main, I point out that there are other factors and circumstances which have placed the wheatgrowing industry in its present unsatisfactory condition. Fortunately the prices received by wheatgrowers some years ago enabled their operations to be remunerative. In fact, wheatgrowers were urged by the various Governments, particularly the Commonwealth Government, to produce more wheat. These and other factors had the effect of inducing large numbers to undertake wheatgrowing on land totally unsuitable for the purpose. One of the main difficulties today is that many wheatgrowers who are in necessitous circumstances have been endeavouring to produce wheat on land quite incapable of growing a remunerative crop. Some time ago wheatgrowing appeared to be so easy and so profitable that some overlooked the fact that years of training were necessary. Some thought that ail that they had to do was to take up a block of land, purchase a team of horses, scatter the seed and sit on the fence and watch the crop grow. Difficulties occasioned in that way cannot be removed by the Commonwealth authorities, but they can me rectified by State Parliaments. These and other matters must be faced quickly and in a determined manner, because it is useless to endeavour to keep men on marginal land when they must necessarily always be a burden on the State. It is a responsibility of governments in wheatgrowing States to reorganize the wheatgrowing industry, so that some land now used for wheatgrowing may revert to grazing areas.  There has been a good deal of discussion this afternoon in connexion with the allocation of grants to the various States, but I contend that it is wise to leave the allocation to the State Parliaments, which are quite capable of making the distribution on an equitable basis. I should like to inform Senator Brown, who said that the Federal Government should be responsible for the distribution of the grant, that the members of State Parliaments are quite as capable as are the members of this Parliament. There are certain provisions of the bill of which I do not approve, particularly in respect of the allocation of the grant. The measure provides that the State Governments shall have the power to deal with necessitous farmers, and to pay a bounty on an acreage basis. I am opposed to both these features, but I am not unmindful of the position of many necessitous wheatgrowers. Abnormal conditions prevail in all States at different times, when some farmers owing to their crops being destroyed cannot pay their way, and it is only fair that those who suffer in that way should receive financial assistance from the Government , but if a bounty is to be paid on an acreage basis, the Commonwealth Government will be disposing of large sums of money to persons who merely sow wheat instead of those who are actually endeavouring to grow it profitably. In South Australia, and probably in some of the other States, men are being assisted by governments merely to sow wheat. They are provided with seed wheat, fertilizers and horse feed and if they receive a bounty on an acreage basis, what is to prevent some sowing seed wheat in such a way that a profitable crop cannot be reaped?","N/A","WHEAT GROWERS RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Those producing the smaller yield may be working poorer land, and do not have to pay either Federal or Commonwealth land tax, but those on land producing 24 bushels to the acre, may have to contribute substantially. A man producing 24 bushels an acre may be working land assessed by the Taxation department at £10 an acre, and I maintain that those in that position have to expend more in producing a bushel of wheat than those who do not have to pay any land tax at all.","N/A","WHEAT GROWERS RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[7]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Its work cost the country £45,000, and very few of its recommendations have been adopted by the Government. The commission devoted a good deal of its time to tabulating sets of figures which could have been obtained at a much lower cost. I am still in favour of the imposition of a flour tax, because the difference between that tax and a homeconsumption price is in name only. The same persons pay the tax in each case. Politically, a home consumption price sounds better than a flour tax, but at the same time I point out that a home consumption price will cost the country a good deal more than a flour tax. It would have been preferable to assist the farmers by the retention of the flour tax than to incur the heavy expenditure associated with the fixing and administration of a homeconsumption price. Senator Johnston complained bitterly because the grants to the States have been reduced, but it is only right that those reductions should be made.

The honorable senator should also remember that for a time Western Australia, which produces gold in large quantities, received a gold bounty, which was of great benefit to that State.

Last year the amount allocated for drought relief and for the relief of other necessitous cases amounted to £137,000, and I am very happy indeed that the Government this year has seen fit to increase that grant to £161,600. That is only a slight increase, but definitely, as I interjected when Senator E. B. Johnston was speaking, it is not a decrease. The whole tenor of the remarks of the honorable senator was that everything, including the amount of Commonwealth grants, was reduced. That is true, and we have the sole consolation that we are in company with the other States, whose grants also have been reduced ; but with regard to the distributions to necessitous farmers, Western Australia is certainly receiving an increased grant this year. However, the increase I contend, is insufficient to meet those conditions which have operated this season to the detriment of our farmers in the northeast province. I am not alone in holding that opinion because the President (Senator Lynch), Senator Collett and I, accompanied by members of the House of Representatives, waited upon the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) when we received from the president of the Wheatgrowers Union of Western Australia, an urgent request to endeavour to persuade the Government to increase the grant to that State. At the interview the Acting Minister for Commerce (Mr. Thorby) explained fully the process of allocating this sum, including the extra amount given for necessitous cases. There is no doubt in my mind that every factor was taken into consideration by the Minister when those allocations were made. The arithmetic of Senator E. B. Johnston is quite correct in regard to the distribution on an acreage basis, omitting the amount for necessitous cases. With him, I would have liked to have seen that amount distributed on that basis, plus an extra sum for the relief of the necessitous grower. But unfortunately, the Prime Minister and Mr. Thorby could not see their way clear to increase the grant for needy cases. I regret that the Government adopted this attitude; I can only join with Senator E. B. Johnston in hoping that a complementary measure to increase the amount of the grant will be introduced.  With regard to the bill itself, I draw attention to clause 2 which defines a wheatgrower. I would like the Minister to explain whether by any chance that definition includes a corporate body such as a farmer and his sons who have formed themselves into a limited liability company and are, in fact, wheatgrowers. I understand that on the distribution of the allocation last year for necessitous cases, a registered company in Western Australia was held to be not entitled to receive a portion of this grant. I pricked up my ears when I heard the Minister remark that the Commonwealth Government, having to find the money, should have some say in its distribution. I hope that the Minister will elucidate that point when he replies to the debate. In that regard I endorse the contention of the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Collings) that every man shall be paid according to the extent of his labour. These producers, although they are a registered company, and are excluded from the grant, are bona fide wheatfarmers and all such, whose crops suffered disaster, whether they be corporate bodies or individual growers, should receive assistance.","N/A","WHEAT GROWERS RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I do not object to the honorable senator citing the Labour Government in Western Australia in support of his case, but I do object to hisusing New South Wales for a similar purpose. TheState of New South Wales, I am pleased to know, has always been generous in its support of Commonwealth proposals to assist other States, and I resent Senator Johnstons suggestion that the senior State in the federation is not willing to act fairly and reasonably towards its partners. The honorable senator read extracts from a letter written by the Department of Commerce containing reference to £400,000 to be made available for assistance to wheatgrowers, and, by innuendo, he asked us to believe that the leader of his own party was robbing Western Australia of between £30,000 and £40,000. Altogether the speech of the honorable gentleman was not fair. He complained of the reduc tion of the amount to be made available for wheatfarmers in Western Australia, but did not mention that there had been a reduction of the grant for wheatgrowers in other States, including New South Wales, which this year will receive £650,000 less than last year. Let me place on record the amounts allocated by the Commonwealth to the various States last year and the proposed allocation under this bill for 1936:  If Senator Johnston had wished to be fair he would have mentioned the whole of these figures and shown a general reduction of Commonwealth assistance to all the States this year. But obviously his sole intention was to use the figures for propaganda purposes in his own State, even at the expense of his colleagues in the United Australia party, because he endeavoured to create the impression that whatever was gained for Western Australia from the Commonwealth was the result of representations by Country party members, and he placed on the United Australia party blame for the reduced amount to be made available under this bill. Whilst he was speaking I interjected with a view to putting the position in its true light before the Senate, because I resented the unfair and unreasonable method adopted by the honorable gentleman for the purpose of tickling the ears of the farmers in Western Australia. It is about time we exposed his tactics, if he is not willing to play the game fairly. He quoted the assistance to be given to Tasmania, which, for all practical purposes, is a nonwheatgrowing State, and showed that the amount allocated would represent about 6s. a bushel; he adopted an altogether unsound basis in order to bolster up his claim for further assistance for Western Australia, which is one of the larger wheatproducing States of the Commonwealth. The honorable senator knows that a flour tax is the accepted means of raising money to grant assistance to wheatfarmers, and that this tax falls heavily upon citizens in the eastern States. Up to the end of February this year the amount raised by this tax in New South Wales was £486,000, in Victoria it was £330,000, in Queensland £160,000, in South Australia £97,000, in Western Australia £75,000, and in Tasmania £36,000. Notwithstanding the huge amount of tax paid by the people of New South Wales, the honorable gentleman says that New South Wales is not playing the game.","N/A","WHEAT GROWERS RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[9]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honorable senator should know that much of the money which has been given to aid the farmers is the yield of a tax on bread. The amounts paid for the relief of wheatgrowers during the last four years were: 193132, £3,296,465; 193233, £2,132,499 ; 193334, £3,044,458 ; 193435, £4,072,656. This year it will amount to £1,800,000, making a total, for five years, of £14,300,000. The taxpayers, as a whole, provide this assistance. It is right that farmers who are in need of assistance should be given aid. I do not agree with the prophecy that we shall soon be finished with this form of legislation ; I believe that we shall have to deal with similar measures for some time to come, because the wheat industry will be seriously affected by future world production and falls in price. Probably production, not only here but throughout the world, will have to be controlled. This may sound like a prophecy, but the production of wheat is a very big problem. Russia has resumed the exportation of wheat and China is now appearing as a seller on the worlds markets. China, particularly, is growing good wheat on areas which are markedly suitable for its cultivation. However, big as this problem may seem, we should be able to arrive at a better method than that embodied in this measure, of helping the farmers. This method is not equitable. I do not believe in  greasing the fat sow . I hold that the rich man should not benefit, and that this assistance should be given only to the man who is in need of it, or sectionally where the industry needs assistance to function.

Senator Hardy was rather severe in saying that the Labour party has no economic plan to deal with the wheat industry. Most decidedly it has. In fact, if there is anything from which the Labour party suffers, it is a superabundance of constructive ideas. I do not agree with some of these proposals, but the party is certainly not barren of ideas. It has advanced quite a number of plans by which the wheat industry could be helped a little further along the road to prosperity than the Government or even Senator Hardy and Senator Johnston can help it. The Labour party believes in the establishment of a compulsory wheat pool which, I hold, would be of more benefit than a homeconsumption price, although a homeconsumption price would effectively meet many of the needs of the industry as the Labour party sees them. As a representative of Queensland, I have every reason to discuss such proposals, because Queensland taxpayers contribute much money for the benefit of the wheatgrowing States. We contend that the Government should take definite steps to deal with the farmers costs, including rates of interest on mortgages and loans. It could investigate, also, transport and handling charges, as they affect the industry in this country and overseas. Mr. J. P. Abbott, who was recently elected president of the Graziers Association of New South Wales, is reported in the Sydney Morning Herald as having said in an address to a conference of graziers and woolgrowers ","N/A","WHEAT GROWERS RELIEF BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Hughes established a Commonwealth shipping line to minimize transport difficulties, similar to those described by Mr. Abbott, whose speech proves that the Labour party and Mr. Hughes, in his time, were quite right in establishing that line. The Government could profitably direct its attention to these matters, which have everything to do with this measure, because we cannot for ever bear the heavy costs involved in maintaining the wheat industry by the methods at present in use. For instance, we could not operate a home consumption price for ever if we applied that principle to every industry. Yet, it is quite possible that we may have to extend it, even to the wool industry. The Labour party has advanced practical plans in regard to these problems. The wool industry has complained of exorbitant freights, and it is probable that the wheat industry also has reason to complain of transport charges. This matter should be completely overhauled. Whenever the sugar industry comes under the consideration of this chamber, every item of cost is examined and the relevant figures are supplied, but, despite the extensive assistance given to the wheat industry, it escapes this inquisition, although Ave could justly demand such information. The Labour party has every sympathy with necessitous farmers and supports this measure. However, we have to remember that, bad as is the lot of the wheatfarmer, he has at least a settled home and can produce the wherewithal to live. To this extent, he is not so badly off as practically onethird of the potential workers of this country, who cannot find a job today. Even if some of them find employment they receive very little for it. Forty per cent. of the breadwinners in Australia today have no income, or are earning less than £1 a week. Thus, bad as the lot of the wheatgrower is, a very large percentage of workers are in an even worse position. We should consider this fact when dealing with recurring requests for assistance, not only to wheatfarmers, but also to other primary producers. The royal commissionwhich inquired into the wheat industry showed that out of the 2s. 9d. a bushel which the farmer received for his wheat, fully 1s. was absorbed in handling and transport charges. It is obvious that the Government should closely investigate the costs of production in the industry, particularly those of handling and transport. It could then ask with more confidence than it can today for support from honorable senators to assist the wheatgrowers of Australia.

In view of some of the remarks made this afternoon, particularly by Senator Johnston, in criticism of the Commonwealth Government, and of the amount of the grant proposed to be made to the wheatgrowers of this country, from which it might appear that the Commonwealth had dealt not only ungenerously but also meanly with the farmers of Western Australia, who have been so unfortunate as to have had little or no crops this year, I rise to say something in reply. I point out that this is a Federal Parliament, not merely a parliament of a State, and the Commonwealth Government governs the whole of Australia, not merely one part of it. This bill is evidence of a recognition on the part of the Commonwealth Government of the plight of many farmers in Western Australia, by making to them a free grant of £160,000 a sum which has never to be repaid by them and is not to be regarded as a liability. Yet Senator Johnston says that the contribution is not sufficient and is indeed miserly.

The honorable senator described the assistance proposed to be given by this measure to the wheatgrowers of Australia as the least generous help given in five years. He spoke as if it were the duty of the Commonwealth Government to vote sums of money year after year for the relief of wheatgrowers. That is not so. The grants which have been made from time to time have been the result of a recognition by the Commonwealth Government of the exceptional circumstances which have operated during recent years. A complete answer to the charge that the amount this year is smaller than it has been for five years is that the position of the wheatgrowers of Australia today is better than it has been at any time during the last five years. The honorable senators constant references to the unsympathetic action of the Government are, I am afraid, due to an unconquerable tendency to criticize the Government whatever it does. We, in this chamber, are aware that the honorable senators speech is the outcome of his great solicitude for the wheatfarmers of Western Australia, but other persons, more cynical and censorious, may attribute his attack to entirely different causes. If they do so, it will be the misfortune of the honorable senator, and we shall be able only to sympathize with him.

The Opposition has always advocated a flat rate, and has contended that, in the payment of bounties, there should not be any inquiries into the circumstances of any individual. It is true that under this clause certain rich wheatgrowers may receive the bounty provided in the bill. For instance., Senator Johnston, who does not require the money, and who possibly will not collect it, can benefit under the measure in its present form; but it would be peculiarly discriminatory if the measure were so framed that Senator Johnston and others in a similar position were precluded from participating.

The Government has given full consideration to their requests and I propose to set out the reasons why we are asking the Senate to pass the measure in its present form.  The bill provides for the distribution to growers of apples and pears of £80,000 a portion of the amount of £100,000 which was placed an the Estimates for the assistance of necessitous fruitgrowers in respect of the 1935 export season at the rate of 4d. a bushel on all fruit exported during the year ended the 31st December, 1935. In 1933, following urgent representations on behalf of growers for assistance to compensate them for losses incurred in the export trade during that year, the Government caused an investigation to be made of the position of growers in Tasmania, which State suffered more acutely than other States, with a view to determining the best means of rendering assistance to the industry. Many proposals were examined, but most of them were found to be impracticable, and the Government finally made available £125,000, in the form of grants to the States, for assistance to growers of apples and pears. This sum was apportioned between the various States in proportion to their share in the export trade. In 1934, although export prices for apples were much better than in 1933, the industry was still in a difficult position, and again Parliament was asked to set aside £125,000 for the purpose of assisting the industry. For the financial year 193536 an amount of £100,000 was provided for the same purpose, and as I have said, the Government has given considerable thought to the best method of distributing this money. The Department of Commerce has been at some pains to examine the financial results of the 1935 export season, and it has ascertained that the net realizations f.o.b. Australian ports were much better than any price obtained since 1929. In 1935 the average f.o.b. price for all overseas shipments of apples in Tasmania was 6s. 5d. a bushel, compared with ls. Sd. a bushel in 1933, and 3s. a bushel in 1934. Tasmania is responsible for the export of over 50 per cent, of the total Australian export of apples. Growers in all the other States also reported much better prices in 1934 than in previous years.","N/A","APPLE AND PEAR BOUNTY BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[1]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

There are undoubtedly many directions in which the  Commonwealth and the States can combine for the permanent good of the industry. These include the encouragement of central packing sheds, improvement of wrapping and packing methods, advanced cultural methods, and improvement of construction of the export case, including standardization of the size of the case. In addition, there is need for scientific research into transport and marketing problems if a permanent improvement is to be effected in the marketing of our fruit overseas. Exports of apples and pears during the years 1933,1934 and 1935 have been as follows : The bulk of the export trade is to the United Kingdom. In this bill, provision is made for the distribution of approximately £80,000 by way of a bounty on apples and pears at the rate of 4d. a bushel case on the quantity exported during 1935. The grant in 1933 was equivalent to approximately 6d. a case, and in 1934 to approximately 7d. a case. The figures which I have quoted show, of course, that in each of those years, there was a larger export trade.","N/A","APPLE AND PEAR BOUNTY BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[1]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have some personal knowledge on this subject, and I know there is room for improvement in our marketing methods. The Government is anxious to bring about an improvement of the conditions affecting the industry, particularly as regards the export of apples and pears. If we are to hold and expand our markets for Australian products, it is essential that we aim at achieving the highest quality in the goods that we produce. Action has already been taken under the commerce regulations to eliminate many unsuitable varieties from our export pack, and to raise, the standards of quality in respect of apples and pears exported overseas. I am sure that Tasmanian senators will admit that some years ago there was room for improvementin this connexion in Tasmania. Many of the varieties of apples then grown were unsuitable for the export trade, butnumbersof growers were not in a financial position to work their trees over to the standard export varieties. Growers of apples in South Australia and Western Australia, who came into this business later, profited by the experience of Tasmania and the older exporting States. I know that in Western Australia the great bulk of the planting was of the approved export varieties. In Tasmania there has been, during recent years, a grafting over from the older varieties to the export varieties. The Government desires to expedite that work in order that the fruit sent overseas from all the States will he of approved export varieties. As further work is necessary on this important problem, the Government has recently appointed a fruit supervising officer in London to examine shipments of fruit arriving in the United Kingdom, and to arrange for investigation and research into any faulty consignments which may arrive there. This officer will be in a position to advise the producers in Australia of the requirements of the British market, and of the difficulties which they have to overcome. It is essential that we in Australia should be prepared to give effect to any recommendations that may be made in this direction, and continuous investigation and research are necessary here if we are to derive the full benefit from the reports made by this officer.

Many growers who would be willing to give effect to the recommendations of experts lack either the technical knowledge or the cash to enable them to do so. From this fund assistance will be given to enable them to carry out the recommendations made as a result of these investigations. The ?20,000 is for that purpose, and I feel sure that its expenditure will have a beneficial longterm effect. After ali. our aim should be to obtain lasting markets. It is not a healthy sign that our exports depend on bounties. It would bo far better that the quality of the fruit should be such as to command a payable price in the world market than that the industry should be assisted by a bounty.

The honorable senator says that private enterprise has fallen down on the job, but that is not so. The Country party, ever since its formation several years ago, has believed in orderly marketing. I listened attentively to the Ministers secondreading speech, and although I recognize that .the financial assistance granted to the industry has decreased as a result of the better prices which have obtained of late, I am glad that a large amount is to be set apart for scientific research. Every honorable senator, irrespective of party, realizes that if our export industries are to maintain their place in the markets of the world, there must be a greater application of science to industry. Under existing conditions the amount of scientific research that is applied to our export industries is dependent upon the financial grants made by the government of the day. In my opinion, there is no body of greater value to the economic life of Australia than the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Spasmodic grants for research cannot permanently benefit an industry : there must be a longrange policy. Research of any nature whether in connexion with wheat, apples or pears, or pasture improvement if its results are to be successful, always requires a long range policy, and, therefore, financial security over a long term is necessary. Recently I was privileged to discuss this problem with the executive officers of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. I then stressed the need for some national plan, involving perhaps, a levy on export, to provide a scientific trust fund for the development of a longrange policy in order to enable research to be continued over a fairly lengthy period. The Government is to be congratulated on having set aside in this bill the sum of £20,000 for research in connexion with apple and pear growing. One feature of this industry which is unsatisfactory is that, despite the increased prices, the export value of apples and pears in the aggregate is now less than it was a year ago. During 193334 Australia exported apples valued at £1,654,241, expressed in Australian currency. In the following year the value of the apples exported fell to £1,307,791, a reduction of £346,450. As prices were higher in the second year mentioned, the falling off in the value of the apples exported, must have been due to a shrinkage of exports. That raises the subject of Empire preference. During 193334 Australia sold to the United Kingdom 3,821,357 bushels of apples, representing 74 per cent, of the total apples exported, and in the same year 1,326,055 bushels of apples, representing 26 per cent, of the total export in that year, was exported to other countries. During the following year 3,797,500 bushels of apples, representing 87 per cent, of the total export for that year was exported from Australia to the United Kingdom, and to other countries we sent only 565,842 bushels, or 13 per cent, of the total eport of apples. In other words, Australia sold both to Great Britain and to other countries, smaller quantities than in the previous year. What is the reason for that falling off? Under the Ottawa Agreement Australia was entitled to a preference of 4s. 6d. a cwt. but that preference has been eliminated by factors beyond our control. American subsidies, plus the depreciation of the dollar to the pound sterling has made the Empire preference given at Ottawa to the fruit growers almost valueless. I understand that the Apple and Pear Export Council advocates that the preference granted to the Australian fruit should be raised from 4s. 6d. to 7s. 6d. a cwt. and I hope that the Government will do its best to obtain that increased preference or alternatively, to support a scheme which will produce a close market in England for Empire fruit. I support the bill because it gives financial assistance to the industry, and I congratulate the Government on having set aside £20,000 for scientific research.  Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate.","N/A","APPLE AND PEAR BOUNTY BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

They are regrettable, but I do not propose to say who was to blame. The need for support for the industry was borne in upon the Government, and it decided to assist financially the export of oranges during the 1933 season with the object of opening up other overseas markets. That assistance took the form of a guarantee of outofpocket expenses up to a maximum of 13s. an export case on all oranges shipped to countries other than New Zealand during the 1933 season.  The export in that year was 97,000 cases and the cost to the Government in respect of the guarantee was only £3,829. This form of assistance was continued in 1934 with the result that in that year there was a tremendous expansion of exports. Nearly 217,000 cases were exported under the guarantee. Unfortunately, a large quantity of the fruit arrived in poor condition, the prices realized were generally unsatisfactory, and it appeared that the Government would be called upon to pay out considerable sums in satisfaction of the guarantee. Certain exporters, however, had taken out a comprehensive insurance policy on the fruit exported during 1934, the premium charged in addition to the ordinary marine risk being 5d. a case. Where this was done the Government increased the guarantee to 13s. 5d. a case. Any moneys paid to exporters under these insurance policies were regarded as part of the proceeds of the fruit and were, therefore, taken into account by the Commonwealth in calculating the amount to be paid under the guarantee. The saving to the Government as a result of these policies cannot be determined definitely, but it is certain that as the result of the action of the exporters a considerable expenditure was avoided. The amount . provided on the Estimates for payment in the year 1934 was £20,000 ; but the sum actually paid amounted to under £10,000. Despite the saving both to the Government and to the industry in respect of the 1934 exports the net results for that season were still very unsatisfactory. Many growers suffered severe losses in respect of their exports. Strong representations have been made to the Government for further assistance, and having regard to the saving effected by the Government, and the desirability of rendering some further aid to exporters for the year in question, it is now proposed to pay a bounty of 6d. a case on all oranges exported in 1934 to destinations other than New Zealand. The exports of oranges in that year totalled 216,482 cases, excluding exports to New Zealand, and a bounty of 6d. a case on this quantity should, therefore, amount to approximately £5,500. Parliament has already provided sufficient funds to meet this commitment as the export bounty of 2s. a case for the 1935 season will, it is estimated, absorb only £8,000 of the amount of £20,000 provided for this purpose. Bearing in mind the disastrous results in 19341, growers were chary in 1935 of shipping their oranges to the United Kingdom. The exports to that country fell to 80,000 cases in 1935 as compared with 177,000 cases in the previous year. Having regard to the losses experienced the assistance being rendered, although small, will be of considerable benefit to exporters.","N/A","ORANGE BOUNTY BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[1]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

I cannot allow this opportunity to pass without bringing under the notice of the Senate the desperate plight of the citrus fruitgrowers of New South Wales, and of again appealing to the Government to make an additional effort to recapture the New Zealand market. Although we may do everything possible to exploit the market in the United Kingdom, there is no gainsaying the fact that New Zealand is the most profitable market to the Australian citrus fruit growers. Those who suffered most severely owing to the collapse of that market were the growers, not in Queensland, but in New South Wales. In discussing the bill to provide a bounty for the 1935 season, I had an opportunity to survey the conditions prevailing in the industry, and to direct attention to the fact that in 193132 the total quantity of citrus fruits exported from Australia was 166,250 centals, and of that quantity New South Wales exported 116,557 centals, or 70 per cent. It will, therefore, be seen that when the New Zealand market collapsed the New South Wales growers who were responsible for 70 per cent, of the total export trade suffered most severely. Of the total of 116,557 centals exported by the New South Wales growers, New Zealand purchased 113,578 centals, or 79 per cent. In these circumstances, is it any wonder that we should again appeal to the Government to do everything possible to recapture the New Zealand market? I suggest that the Government should send a Minister immediately to New Zealand to ascertain whether the prejudice which now exists can be broken down.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","None","K0F","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Following on representations made to the Government by prunegrowers from the States of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, the Government has decided to pay a bounty of3/4d. per lb. on prunes exported during the year 1935. In that year export prices fell seriously and the returns to growers decreased to such an extent that they found themselves in financial difficulties. Increased plantings of prunes since the war have resulted in a tremendous expansion of production, with the result that today practically 50 per cent, of the crop has to be exported. Markets have been developed in the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Canada, and under normal conditions, with the aid of legislation by the Commonwealth and State Governments, a reasonable average return on exports and local sales is obtained. Conditions over the past eighteen months, however, have been most difficult. Prices f.o.b. of prunes exported from California to the United Kingdom fell from 53/8 cents per lb. in January, 1934, to 41/8 cents per lb. in January, 1935, and to 27/8 cents per lb. in January, 1936. As Californian prunes practically dominate the United Kingdom market, this serious fall of prices has caused a corresponding reduction of the returns to Australian producers. In view of all the circumstances the Government has decided to render some assistance to the industry to enable it to meet the immediate losses. The bill now submitted gives effect to the Governments decision in this direction.  In view of the fact that prunes are subject to the provisions of the Dried Fruits Act 19281935, and to the Interstate Trade Regulations made under thatact, it is necessary to make provision for the payment of the bounty to growers who export under what is known as the  proxy arrangement. It is proposed that a grower shall be deemed, for the purpose of payment of bounty, to have exported such quantity of prunes as the respective State Dried Fruits Boards determine. This can. he readily ascertained from the records of the boards. Whore the grower sells his prunes outright to a packer, the quantity deemed to be exported will be determined in the prescribed manner by the Department of Commerce. In submitting this bill, the Government does not desire to encourage this industry to seek a continuance of bounties on export. Realizing the difficult position which obtains at present, the Government has indicated that provision will he made at a later date for a further bounty of id. per lb. on exports during the year 1936, but that no further bounties will be paid on this commodity. In this connexion the Government is taking steps to improve the efficiency of the industry which at present is not of a very high standard. Due regard has not been paid by the industry to the market requirements overseas, and a large quantity of smallsized prunes has been exported, although the major demand is for prunes of larger size. This high proportion of small fruit is in itself a very unsatisfactory feature of the export industry. There are many other directions in which improvements can be effected, and the Government, therefore, proposes to arrange, through the Agricultural Council, an inquiry into the production and marketing methods of the industry, with a view to placing it permanently on a sound footing. Cultural methods, picking and drying of the fruit, elimination of unsuitable areas, and stimulation of local consumption, will be investigated. It is anticipated that the bounty for the 1935 exports will total about £8,500, and that, as production for the current year is not nearly as high as in 1935, the bounty will he considerably less in respect of the 1930 exports.","N/A","PRUNE BOUNTY BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[1]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

Being deprived of his Continental market, the American grower immediately dumped his surplus production, with the aid of substantial subsidies, on the British market, and this action caused the collapse of the price in Australia. While I do not for one moment advocate bilateral trade, instances of this nature make one cease to wonder that people do support that policy. One needs only to consider the position of the prune and dried fruits industries, the New Zealand embargo on citrus fruits from New South Wales, due to American influence, the subsidized shipping lines of America, and Australias adverse trade balance with America, amounting to £8,000,000 a year, to realize why many people are becoming converted to the policy of bilateral trade agreements. I venture to say that, although Australia has an adverse balance in its trade with the United States of America, the adoption, of a bilateral trade policy by the Commonwealth would materially affect the relations of that country with us. I have nothing but commendation to offer the Government for the granting of this assistance to the prune industry. The growers are doing everything in their power to improve the quality of their product, and to eliminate prunes of small size, which present the major difficulty in regard to the export trade. Honorable senators will join with me in hoping that prices will improve so that the Government will not be obliged to render assistance to the industry beyond the current season.
