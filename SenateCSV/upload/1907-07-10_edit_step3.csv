At the same time, one cannot shut his eyes to the fact that it has criticised the conduct of the business of the Senate, and if in a similar criticism I used here the language which is often used in the columns of the Age, it is probable that the President would pull me up, and insist that I should withdraw my statement. However, as I, with some other honorable senators, have a record for last session of having remained silent during the whole of the session, I take advantage of the present opportunity to make a few observations on the AddressinReply, and I trust that other honorable senators will follow the same course, in order that the Government may learn what is the voice of the public on the various matters touched upon in the GovernorGenerals Speech, rather than that they should have to depend upon a public opinion which is manufactured sometimes by the daily press. The Government will thus be in a position to frame their policy, and the debate on the AddressinReply will be of very great importance indeed if it serves such a purpose, and the Government of the day recognises the statements made by honorable senators as voicing public opinion. I am not in the secrets of the Government, and do not know in what order they intend to submit their measures, but I hope that it will be in the reverse order to that in which they appear in the GovernorGenerals Speech, because I notice that some of urgent importance are mentioned in the last paragraph. I do not think that I am at all unreasonable when I suggest that the Kalgoorlie to Port  Augusta Railway Survey Bill should be dealt with by the Senate at the very earliest opportunity, because of the way in which it has been buffeted about in previous sessions. It has never yet received the attention and fair play to which it is entitled. It is only fair to the people in Western Australia that an opportunity should be given for its consideration at an early period of the session. As there has been an alteration in the personnel of this Chamber, we ought to know exactly how we stand about this question at the earliest possible opportunity. I have no wish to refer to what happened in the past. The most charitable attitude that I or any other honorable senator can take up about that matter is to be silent. I hope the Bill will be brought forward early, and that when a vote is taken it will be upon the merits of the Bill, without any resort to any of the tactics which every honorable senator must regret were practised when the question was last before the Senate. I will say no more until the measure is before us, except that it is a matter of very great importance to Western Australia. I do not wish honorable senators to regard what I am saying as in any degree a threat, because I know that honorable senators will not be coerced into any particular attitude by any words of mine or of any other individual senator. As honorable senators, however, may not know the feeling that prevails in Western Australia, which is so isolated that a great number of them may not be acquainted with public opinion there regarding Federation, I think it is my duty to warn them that the feeling of a very large section of the community in that State I will not say the majority is far from friendly towards Federation. There is no denying the fact that in Western Australia Federation is on its trial. For these and other reasons I hope that there will be no attempt to do other than treat this measure justly on its merits when it comes before us, and that the Government will introduce it at the earliest possible opportunity.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESSINREPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[1]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Another very important matter to honorable senators, quite irrespective of what party they may belong to, is the great social reform question of oldage pensions. I do not want to drag that question into the arena of party politics. Its history, so far as Federal politics are concerned, shows that it has never yet been brought into that arena, and I hope that it never will. I trust that a measure to provide for oldage pensions will be placed before us by the Government at an early date, and that we shall have an opportunity to take the question right out of its present position by placing that measure on the statutebook. It is not a party question, notwithstanding the gibe thrown at the Labour Party by Senator McColl, who I see is absent today. I could have wished that the honorable senator was in his place, because I have a reference or two to make to him. He made a reference to the Labour Party that I think his better judgment would counsel him not to give expression to. He said the Labour Party was out for all that it could make.

I take it that the honorable senator belongs to the Protectionist Party, and no one can say that they have shown any great amount of unselfishness when it has come to be a question of seeking for political advantages from other sections of the community. The honorable senators charge is perhaps best met by quoting what happened a few days ago at a farmers conference held in Victoria. The honorable senator attended its meetings and spoke, and every one of the resolutions dealt with at the conference, as published in the daily press, embodied demands of more or less magnitude on the public purse for money for that particular section of the community.

That honorable gentleman said he had no doubt whatever, judging by the resolutions carried at that farmers conference, that the farmers were very pronounced Socialists. Senator McColl, who spoke immediately afterwards, repudiated any such leanings on the part of the farmers, and instead of claiming that the farmers were Socialists, the honorable senator thought he was making his position better when he said they were not asking for Socialism, but for paternalism. I have listened on many occasions to individualists dealing with the question of Socialism. They always seemed to think that when they had hurled a charge of paternalism at Socialism they had thrown the hardest and biggest brick in their possession, yet here was Senator McColl actually admitting that it was paternalism and not Socialism that the farmers of Victoria asked for. One thing the honorable senator did not claim for it was that it was antiSocialism. He did not claim that the farmers desire to get public money, as expressed at that Conference, had anything of the nature of antiSocialism about it. What I am asking for on this occasion, the farmers and every other section of the community will get their due share of. There is nothing of a graball nature about it, and no section of the community will get more than they are entitled to at the expense of any other section. I can claim further that we shall not scramble amongst ourselves, nor claim that the action of the Government in bringing in a measure for oldage pensions is a concession to the Labour Party. We know the history of the oldage pensions question in the Federal Parliament, because we have been talking about it for the last six or seven years. We submitted it to a Royal Commission, who inquired and reported that the Commonwealth should establish an oldage pensions system as soon as possible, and that the funds to finance it should be taken from the Consolidated Revenue. As this matter has been talked of so long and so often, there is very little need for me to enlarge upon the arguments which have been placed before the Senate on several occasions to show that an oldage pensions scheme should be introduced as soon as possible. The Government propose to bring forward a Bounties Bill, which must of necessity mean the expenditure of a very large amount of public money that would be better devoted to public purposes if it was used for oldage pensions. That would give more general satisfaction than any Bounties Bill which could possibly be introduced, because, after all, the bounties would not be spread over the whole Commonwealth in anything like a general way. One or two little industries, or a few parts of the Commonwealth, would get the whole of the benefit from them, whereas every part of the Commonwealth would get its fair share of any money expended on oldage pensions. I hope, therefore, that, before the Government think of introducing a Bounties Bill, they will see their way to find money to finance an oldage pensions scheme. I recognise that the Braddon section of the Constitution as it stands now is an obstacle in the way of financing perhaps the whole of the oldage pensions from the Customs and Excise revenue. Under that section of the Constitution, we are permitted to retain only onefourth of the Customs and Excise revenue. I do riot think that amount would be sufficient to finance a proper oldage pensions scheme, which it has been calculated would require something over ,£1,000,000 per year.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","DE LARGIE, Hugh","JU7","N/A","N/A","N/A","253","I dare say there are numbers of better methods, but that was one we could have applied at once. I took the opportunity of supporting the Bill for that reason, and not because I was particularly in love with the proposal to impose special duties for oldage pensions. That proposal having failed, and as we shall not have another opportunity of altering the Constitution for nearly three years, I shall not be content to wait that time before we do anything towards the settlement of the oldage pensions question. I therefore hope the Government, when the Budget is presented, will be able to propose a means by which we can secure sufficient money to finance oldage pensions. I do not know whether honorable senators are quite aware of the fact that we have been paying back to the States a great deal of money out of the onefourth of Customs and Excise revenue that we could have retained. I was surprised when, in conversation with one of the officers of the Treasury, I was told that in the six and a half years during which the Commonwealth has been in existence, the Federal Government has paid away to the States something like five millions and threequarters that it could have retained. That information came as a surprise to me, because I did not think that we were paying more than halfamillion a year out of the onefourth that we are by the Constitution permitted to spend. But the extra sum that we pay amounts to nearly a million a year. If those figures are accurate and I take it that the gentleman who supplied them to me is in a position to give correct information on the subject; I have no reason to doubt their accuracy they show that we have not to search very far for such a sum as we require in order to pay oldage pensions. We do not need a great deal over a million pounds per annum for that purpose. As we are paying out of our onefourth very nearly one million pounds more than we are called upon to pay, we require something like a quarter of a million more to finance an oldage pension scheme. I am aware that Senator Walker made the suggestion to the Senate on one occasion that, even under the Braddon blot section of the Constitution, as in operation at the present time, sufficient money could be secured for oldage pensions purposes if the States showed a reasonable frame of mind in dealing with the Commonwealth Government. If the States were prepared to hand1 back to us the amount that would be spent on their account on oldage pensions, it would be an easy matter to settle the difficulty. New South Wales and Victoria have their own oldage pensions systems ; and those States which have not oldage pensions systems have charitable institutions, which have to be maintained out of the public funds. It is therefore evident that a considerable amount of relief would be afforded to the States by the establishment of a Federal oldage pensions system. New South Wales is paying away £500,000 a year, and Victoria ,£300,000. Those great loads would be lifted from the shoulders of those States if they were agreeable to work with us in this matter. But, judging from the confusion exhibited at the Premiers Conference, it is almost hopeless to expect to arrange anything practical with the States Premiers. Almost every resolution passed at those Conferences has been arrived at after an exhibition in which each State has been shown to T5e pulling against every other State. We are sometimes inclined to think that there are too many parties in the Federal Parliament. But here we have only three parties. If Federal politicians were in the same frame of mind or were constituted in the same way as the States Premiers, I think that, instead of having only three parties in the Federal Parliament, every member of it would be a party unto himself. This, however, I do say, that it is a duty placed upon the shoulders of the Federal Parliament by the Constitution to establish an oldage pensions system. We have had a Royal Commission inquiring into the subject, and it has recommended that the financial burden should be borne out of the Consolidated Revenue. It is the duty of this Parliament to legislate on the question, and not to wait for the States Premiers to make recommendations. We all admit that taxation is not a pleasant thing. None of us like it. We are more inclined to look upon it as an evil. But taxation is one of those things that are necessary to carry on the functions of Government. At the present time we are collecting as much mons through Customs and Excise as it is possible for us to collect. I do not think that it is possible for us to obtain a. larger sum than our present Tariff is bringing in. The pressure of taxation levied in this manner falls principally upon the poorer people of the Commonwealth. It is a load that every working man has to bear. The poorest man is taxed as heavily as the richest. It would, be a shame on our part to make that load any greater than it is now. Personally I am totally opposed to increasing the indirect taxation imposed through Customs and Excise. Instead, I would adopt a method of direct taxation ; and for that purpose I know of no better scheme than that which has been placed before the country by the Labour Party. I refer to the progressive land values tax proposals which our party advocated at the last election. I have been told that a progressive land values tax would bring in a very small sum, because the result of it would be to break up large estates, and consequently to decrease the revenue from that source. I have no doubt that such a tax would have the effect of breaking up large estates, but it can hardly be expected that it would do so all at once. I consider that it would bring in quite sufficient money for the purposes of oldage pensions, and would at the same time be beneficial in decreasing the size of estates.

In New South Wales there are 722 men owning on an average 31,000 acres each. That is altogether too much land for those people to utilize profitably to the country. In South Australia a very great deal of land is held in a similar manner. There are 304 men in that State holding on the average 12,000 acres each. For the life of me I cannot see how we are going to make the people who hold these large estates pay their fair share of the taxation of the country, unless we apply the progressive land values tax policy of the Labour Party. The value of these estates has been greatly increased by the expenditure of public money in building roads and railways, and in other directions, as well as by the growth of population. None of that increased value comes to the Government of the country. No man can possibly defend that sort of thing ; and seeing that we have no direct taxation, I trust that the Government will in the near future see its way to adopt the progressive land values tax proposition of the Labour Party. I am sorry that Senator St. Ledger is absent from his place, because I desire to make one or two remarks in reply to statements by him. If, however, he chooses to be absent when a reply to him is made, it is, of course, his own lookout. I could not help remarking that the two speeches delivered by Senator St. Ledger during the short time that he has been a member of the Senate were marked by a great deal of spite towards the Labour Party.  Spite  is the only word I can possibly apply to his attacks. His remarks concerning the Labour Party consisted of jibes and sneers. He seemed to begrudge the party the name under which it has been sailing for the fifteen years during which it has been in existence, and said that iri future he intended to refer to it as the Socialist Party. Personally I have no objection whatever to Senator St. Ledger or any other .person calling me a Socialist, because I have prided myself on that name for many years past. I have never lost an opportunity in public of making it known that I am a Socialist. I should not like to say, however, that every member of the Labour Party would subscribe to the Socialism in which I believe. They are not, perhaps, quite so extreme on the question as I am. We know that there are degrees of Socialism. I am quite prepared to take full responsibility for the views I hold. I do not wish to embarrass or place any responsibility on others for holding those views. Knowing the confusion of thought which prevails as to what is meant by Socialism, I have not the slightest objection to being called . a Socialist, but I certainly do object to what our political opponents very often call Socialism. I object, for instance, to what the Treasurer has time and again, in Western Australia, called Socialism.

The Socialism I have heard Sir John Forrest seriously define is that sentimental kind which we read of in books such as Sir Thos. Mores Utopia, Platos Republic, Bellamys Looking Backward, and like literature. I have not yet heard Sir John Forrest refer to the scientific modem Socialism which I and other members of the Labour Party hold ought to be practised in State affairs. I have not yet heard of any of those gentlemen making an effort to understand it. When we consider that that kind of Socialism is so generally known to the working classes, and its literature is tq be found almost everywhere, there is no excuse for those gentlemen being ignorant as to its tenets. When I hear a man of Sir John Forrests standing constantly repeating a statement which has as often been contradicted, I wonder if our political opponents desire to understand the Socialism of the Labour Party. However, Senator St. Ledger seems to be one of those antiSocialists whose ideas are confused. But I can assure him and other opponents of the Labour Party that if they desire to understand our views on the subject, they ought to make an honest effort to understand our case. If the honorable senator desires to have a grip of a political question, it is his duty not only to know his own side in politics, but also to try to understand his opponents case. Whether he refers to the Labour Party as Socialists or not, I think it will not matter a great deal. Because, after all is said and done, names do not count for very much. It is the substance which we keep in view. To give an idea of the confusion which prevails in regard to names, I may mention, if it will be any consolation to Senator St. Ledger and others, that recently in Melbourne there was a gathering at which a few ardent spirits connected with the Socialist movement met, and, in an ex cathedra way, declared that the Labour Party were nonsocialistic. Whilst we have that declaration on the part of the  pure merino  Socialists, we have Senator St. Ledger declaring that the Labour Party is not entitled to the use of the word Labour. It looks as if between the pure merino Socialists and the honorable senator, the Labour Party will be without a name.

He said that the indignation which was seething in his bosom was so great that he could not give expression to his feelings and at the same time observe the Standing Orders.

I do not know why Senator St. Ledger, or any other senator coming from Queensland, should be ignorant of the true state of affairs. It is not a very long time ago since a Federal parliamentary party visited Queensland.  When at Maryborough they were shown through one of the largest iron foundries in the State, that of Walkers Limited. We saw there very large works supplied with uptodate modern machinery, and yet the cry of the manager of the works was that he had no trade, and that the machinery was lying idle. That was the state of affairs only a short time ago in the State from which Senator St. Ledger comes. In the same town of Maryborough we visited a sawmills and sash and door factory, the proprietor of which explained that he was very busy. He admitted that Federation had done a great deal for his industry, because he had the raw material for the making of window sashes and doors at hand, and the breaking down of the Tariff barriers between the various States enabled him to do a big trade with the cities of Sydney and Melbourne. Here we found an industry which, to all appearance, was in a flourishing condition, and what was the state of affairs as regards the wages paid, and conditions of the workers in that industry ? I made some inquiries amongst the men I found working there. I questioned one of the most likely labourers I found working in the yard, and he informed me that he was receiving the highest wages paid to men working there. Honorable senators will be surprised to learn that this man was paid the handsome wage of 5s. per day ! I questioned some of those working inside the factory, and I found, amongst others, a boy working at finishing off window sashes and receiving a wage of 6s. per week. Senator Lynch. Where was this; in Scotland ? In Maryborough, Queensland, and only a few months ago. We noticed that one of the machines in use, a joint mortising machine, was doing very neat work, to which the manager of the place directed our attention with great pride. I questioned the man in charge of this machine, and he informed me that he was receiving a wage of r 6s. per week. Here, in a flourishing industry, wages were being paid at the rate of 16s. per week to a man attending an. important machine, and 5s. per day to a  topnotcher  amongst the labouring men. This was in the State from which Senator St. Ledger comes, and the honorable senator is evidently quite ignorant of it. In spite of these facts, the honorable senator says that the Standing Orders do not permit him to adequately , express his indignation as to the statements made by Mr. Hughes that there is no room for additional artisans in Australia. That information is only what has been supplied to the people of the old country for the last twenty or thirty years by AgentsGenerals and those in charge of immigration offices, and it is perfectly correct. If Senator St. Ledger desires further information on this question I am in a position to supply him with no end of it, because the State which he represents is not the only State in the Commonwealth about which such information can be given. I notice Senator Cameron smiling, and for his benefit I shall read something concerning the state of affairs in Tasmania. A Royal Commission has quite recently inquired into the working conditions that obtain in that State, and, bad as I have shown they are in Queensland, they are worse in Tasmania. I find from the report of the Commission, which was published no later than the 16th May of this year, that in almost every branch of industry in the tight little island State a condition of sweating obtains that is scarcely creditable in a new country. The report is very lengthy, and I shall not attempt to read the whole of it, but I shall direct the attention of honorable senators to some short paragraphs referring to a few industries that will give some idea of the state of affairs existing in Tasmania.

Although the Conference failed perhaps to do all that was attempted, yet, seeing the contentious nature of the questions brought before it, as much as we could reasonably expect was achieved by it. Knowing how difficult it is to get men to agree on the fiscal question, we cannot wonder that the Imperial Government disapproved of the attempt that was made to bring that question forward at the Conference. I, who know something of the old country, having lived longer there than I have yet lived in Australia, know what it means to the people of the old country to raise the fiscal question, if by raising it you interfere with the cost of the food of the workers there. We know that preference means interfering with the cost of the workers food in the old country, and notwithstanding the fact that I am an outandout protectionist in Australia, if I were in the old country I should undoubtedly be on the side of the Labour Party in the stand they are taking on this question against any interference with the cost of the food of the people.

If I were in the old country tomorrow the probabilities are that I should be found fighting on the side of the freetraders there quite as strongly as I am fighting here on the side of the protectionists. I recognise no great fundamental principle underlying the fiscal question that would compel me in the old country to differ from the majority of the working men there. The question of what kind of fiscal policy suits a country depends greatly on the state of development that country has reached in its industrial affairs. Whilst in some particular lines in the old country the people may have retained freetrade too long, I firmly believe, speaking general tv that freetrade is the policy best suited for that country. I am quite as confident that protection is the right policy for this country; but I do not wish to anticipate the debate that will take place this session on the Tariff by putting forward my arguments on this occasion. Honorable senators will then find that I am just as strong a protectionist for Australia, as I might be a freetrader if I were in the old country. We must admit that the food question is a very important one to the people of the old country, and seeing that the present Imperial Government took office on the strength of the victory they secured at the polls after contesting the elections as a freetrade party, and obtaining a very large majority on that principle, we in Australia could not reasonably expect them to agree to any preferential scheme that we might place before them so soon after they took office.

When we remember the statement made by the present Prime Minister of Great Britain, Sir Henry CampbellBannerman, not long ago, during the time when the fiscal question was agitating the people of the old country, to the effect that there were twelve millions of people in the United Kingdom I am not sure that he did not say England who were constantly on the verge of starvation, can we wonder at any Imperial Government hesitating before they agree to interfere with the food supplies of the population? I can assure honorable senators, as one who has lived in the old country iri the midst of a large industrial district, that the food of the people is so very scarce, and the struggle for life so intense, that we cannot possibly realize the position.

They are decidedly opposed to it, and I am quite prepared to act on their advice, knowing as I do something of the history of the old country and of the workers in it. Senator St. Ledger, when he said that never since Waterloo had the magnificence of Great Britain been so great as it was at present, must have known very little indeed of the old country. I do not know, whether the honorable senator has lived there or knows much about it, but to talk of a country being magnificent and glorious when it contains 12,000,000 starving people is to boast of a kind of magnificence that we ought all to deplore, instead of shouting it from the housetops. I shall be quite prepared, when the question of preferential trade comes before us, to consider any tangible proposal on its merits, and if I can assist the people of the old country by giving them a preference as against the rest of the world, I shall be willing also to consider a proposal in that direction.

I thoroughly indorse that opinion. I am not one of those who deal in political polemics.

Senator Lynch drew attention to the absurd statements made about immigration, and I was glad to hear him deny the allegation, which is frequently circulated, that the Labour Party are opposed to immigration. The honorable senator said they were not opposed to it, so long as it was suitable immigration. Many of us who sit on this side of the Chamber would be glad to know what the suitable immigration is to which they will agree. We have heard it clearly stated that there is no more room for artisans. I believe that statement is correct. During the recent election campaign, when referring to the question of immigration, I mentioned myself on more than one occasion that I was not in favour of increasing the number of artisans brought out to this country. Then we are told that there is no room for miners. I have seen that statement made several times. I am not a mining man, and I am not prepared to say that there is room for more miners ; but I notice that Mr. Maxwell, a member of the Queensland Labour Party, stated the other day that up at Etheridge they were short of miners.

The Sugar Workers Union at Mackay, Queensland, wrote to the Trades Hall Council, Adelaide, and asked them if they could supply labour to go up to Queensland; and I have it on the authority of a member of the executive of that body that they were obliged to reply, stating that there was no labour available. So far as the condition of the labour market in South Australia is concerned, an honorable member of another place informs me that there is not a man in his State who need be unemployed at the present moment if he chooses to > work. It will be remembered that last April the Commonwealth Government was approached with a view to giving permission to import men from the old country, and as a consequence the names of a large number of unemployed in Melbourne were collected, and steps were taken through the local Labour Bureau to see if they were suitable to go to Queensland.

There is at present no surplus first grade labour, but a shortage.

I also take it that, as the information comes from official sources, it cannot be expected to be characterized by any particular desire to serve the purposes of Queensland or of the sugar planters. I come now to Queensland itself. The Queensland Government, some time ago, adopted the policy of introducing labour from Europe. The present Premier of Queensland was only recently a member of the Labour Party, and is a man who I feel certain still has some sympathy with them; and though he has absolutely refused to introduce any labour unless the people who want it put down £5 a head towards paying the passages of the labourers, still, the fact that he is willing to do so much may be taken as proving that he is absolutely convinced of the necessity to bring out fresh labour. I think it may be taken that there is a shortage of labour in every State of Australia except Western Australia; and I contend that it is the duty of the Government to do something more than they have done in the past to induce people to come here to make up that shortage. It is of no use to encourage settlers to come and take up land in Australia if when they arrive they find that there is no labour to build homes for them and cultivate their soil. On the question of Naval Defence, I probably see eye, to eye with honorable senators opposite, rather than with many of those on my own side of the Chamber. But I am faced with the inevitable question where is the money to come from? The question of penny postage has also been brought forward, and . probably we shall hear more of it in the course of the session. But, again, how is the expenditure to be borne? There are also the Federal Capital question and the question of taking over the Northern Territory and peopling it. A large amount of money will be required before that Territory cart be peopled. There is the question of oldage pensions, which will bring a large expenditure. Where is the money to come from? We have adopted the policy of a White Australia, and that policy itself compels us to take prompt steps to people the northern areas of this Continent. What opportunity have we to do so with our present rate of natural increase? According to Mr. Knibbs, the Federal Statistician, our natural rate of increase is something like fifteen per 1,000. That rate, as far as I can see, is higher than the natural rate of increase in any nation in the world. Yet we find that it will take us fifty years, before our population will rise to the number of 8,000,000, and at least thirty years, before we shall have the same population as Canada has now. . If we are going to maintain our present rate of expenditure and place the whole of the burden on the shoulders of the few people we have in the country, our industries will break down under the weight. Our duty is to populate the country, and we cannot hope to do that with anything like our present rate of increase.

The conditions under which it is proceeding call for serious consideration. The appointment of a Commonwealth High Commissioner, urgent on many grounds, will supply the necessary authority in the mother country.  That is delightfully vague; and I think it is a matter of regret that the Government did not see its way to define more accurately what it is proposed to do. Last year Parliament voted for the purposes of immigration £5,000. Canada is spending about £250,000 a year for that purpose. We find, however, that our Government did not spend the whole of the small vote granted to them: In the different States, there are certain immigration leagues, which, by means of pamphlets circulated locally and in the old country, are encouraging persons to come out on their own account and settle here. In some cases, the Government have given small grants to these bodies to enable them to carry on their mission. But when some days, if not weeks, before the 30th June, similar applications were made, the Government said,  No. The matter was not regarded as being of sufficient importance to be dealt with promptly. It was postponed beyond the 30th June because the applications had come in too late to be dealt with during the financial year. The vote of ,£5,000 was not all spent, and the promise we have in the GovernorGenerals Speech cannot be taken as an indication of what the policy of the Government in the future will be. Referring to the introduction of men from Europe for the purpose of peopling the northern parts of Australia, especially in connexion with Queensland, I would draw attention to the fact that we find the best argument in favour of immigration in a letter addressed by the Secretary for External Affairs to Messrs. McDonald and Bamford, members of the other House The seriousness of the situation from both standpoints, those of the growers and of the men they employ, cannot be overlooked. The circumstances of last season afford no proof of those which will require to be met this year. It is obvious that, unless there has been a considerable influx to Queensland, of which the Department, has not been advised, the fact that upwards of I,000 kanakas have already been deported, and that in the course of the next few months, at least 2,000 more will probably go away, must create a shortage of labour which requires to be made good.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESSINREPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[3]/quote[4]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","CHATAWAY, Thomas","K6L","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","That letter clearly represents the anxiety which was felt in the sugar districts in the early part of this year and the latter part of last year. In the latter part of 1906, the farmers round Cairns found it necessary to meet in conference and discuss the question of obtaining an increased supply of labour to get off the coming years crop. In 1906, in the Mossman and Mackay districts alone, at least 30,000 tons of cane were left on the ground unharvested. From a purely commercial standpoint, a ton of cane is worth practically £1. Sometimes it brings more; at other times it brings less ; but ,£1 is the average price. That meant a loss, not only to the farmers, but also to the community generally, and to wageearners. In those two districts there was a loss of practically £30,000 last year. Recently the Registrar General for Queensland has issued his statistics on the local sugar industry, and he gives some startling figures. We find that, comparing 1906 with 1905, in the four most northerly sugar districts Ingham, Mow.rilyan, Cairns, and Port Douglas 3,610 fewer acres of cane were cultivated in 1906 than in 1905 ; and, what is more, we find that, in the crushing season of 1906, 2,635 fewer acres of cane were crushed in those districts than in the previous year ; clearly showing that the lack of labour is beginning to make the farmers draw in their horns and curtail the area under cultivation. Precisely the same thing was brought out in the Cairns Conference. Later on, a conference was held in Townsville, and there again the farmers and farmers delegates foretold a decrease in cultivation, not so much in the south, where the farmers are getting along without much trouble, because they are mostly connected with the railway, but in the far north. That will necessarily mean that few white men will be employed generally. In those circumstances, it is hardly a matter of surprise that the farmers consulted and tried to see what could be done towards meeting the difficulties which threatened them, and that they accepted the offer of Mr. Kidston, the Premier of Queensland, to bring out labour from the old country. Subsequently to the Cairns meeting, in December, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company made the farmers an offer that they would send Home an agent and try to collect men from Europe. Before the farmers could employ these men they would practically have had to mortgage their own fortunes to .the extent of £20 per immigrant. When subsequently Mr. Kidston brought forward a new scheme for bringing out men, and the farmers were asked to pay only £5 per immigrant, it was only natural that they should prefer his scheme to the other. Yet what do we find? We find that the farmers have paid down £3,000 to bring out men from the old country. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company, on behalf of the farmers who cultivate cane for them, and who, of course, will have to pay back the money eventually, have incurred an expenditure of ,£2,400, and the Queensland Government are spending £4,000 in bringing out men. I ask honorable senators whether it is reasonable to suppose that if the farmers in the north could send down here and get men who would be likely to do their work, they would incur an expenditure of many thousand pounds, whether the Queensland Government would spend public money in that direction, or whether the Colonial Sugar Refining Company would risk the expense of bringing out men from the old country ?

I have made those quotations to show that not only the farmers, but Federal officers who are supposed to be unbiased, hold that view. When Mr. Hughes left England for the Continent he endeavoured to secure labour. We know that he secured 120 Spaniards. It has been stated that he could not get any Italians, but that he got a few men from other countries. The reason why he could not get Italians will probably be explained by a quotation from the Rome Avanti, a Socialist organ. It published the following . letter, which purported to come from its Australian correspondent at Sydney. Amongst other things he urged Italian toilers to oppose by any means at their disposal the sugar planters scheme, amounting, in his opinion, to a  Chinesisation of the Italian labour, on the grounds that :  (1) Work at the canefields, hitherto manned by Chinese and Polynesian semislaves, is unhealthy, enervating, unsuitable to Europeans, and spurned by Australians, Britishers, and whites in general ; (2) the wages are low, the hours of labour excessive for a country like Australia, and the diet, although plentiful, unpalatable and unfit for a Latin stomach ; (3) in the event of our countrymen leaving the plantations through impossibility to endure life there they would be necessarily compelled to accept work on any condition somewhere else, and thus cause an unfair competition against the toilers of the small centres of population of that region ; (4) by accepting an occupation which is looked upon is fit only for Asiatics our agricultural workers would ruin the credit of the Italian labour generally in this Continent, and would substantiate the charge now and then levelled against us by some prejudiced people of being the  Chinese of Europe. In the face of that statement published in a wellknown Italian newspaper, it is not at all surprising that in Italy Mr. Hughes was unable to get labour. But seeing the urgency of getting some labour, and also seeing that Spaniards are white, very respectable, and decent just the same as any of the other European races I fail to see why men, because they are Spaniards, should specially be debarred from coming out here. The same story was told us when some Italians were brought out. In 1891 310 Italians were brought up to the Herbert district. A certain number of them, I believe, were induced to leave their work, and went woodchopping round about Charters Towers, but with the exception of those few, a large number of them remained in the sugar district, and some of the finest farmers in the Herbert, Burdekin, and Mackay districts are the despised Italians who were brought out in that year. If we think that we can keep this country nearly empty, and entirely to ourselves; if we believe that we can keep out people from the old country, or admit only those who pay their passages ; if we debar immigrants from coming out, and helping to build up the country, we make a fatal mistake, and one which must recoil upon ourselves. In the day when Germany comes into her heritage of Holland, and occupies the Dutch Indies, we shall have a powerful nation possessed of armies and fleets right at our front door. Then we shall know what it is to have left this country empty. Then we shall understand the nature of our present folly. At times when the country is prosperous, and every official and private report goes to show that there is ample room for additional labour and the introduction of more people, the Government submit a paltry vote of £5,000 for immigration, and do not spend even that amount. I say that a great responsibility rests upon the Senate and upon the Government to initiate some scheme, and not to rest satisfied with the excuse that, because the States Governments own the land, while the Federal Government controls the question of immigration, it is impossible to carry out a system until the two authorities can be induced to act together.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESSINREPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[3]/continue[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

But if the Government neglects or refuses to introduce people who are necessary for the carrying on of our industries, what are the private individuals engaged in those industries to do? Honorable senators may_ be sure that no private individual desires to go to the expense of bringing out halfadozen men all the way from the old country on the offchance that when they get here they will represent exactly the sort of labour he requires. Not only should private individuals be able to look to the Government to see that sufficient labour is supplied to meet the requirements of the growing industries of the country, but the Government should make sure that no excuse is. given to private individuals to go to Europe, Great Britain, or elsewhere to engage labour to be brought out here. It is. undesirable that private individuals should make labour contracts of that kind. If it is true, as is often stated, that there is any amount of labour to be had in Australia, and I think I heard Senator Findley say that miners were working in Victoria for 20s. a week, why do not the Government adopt a system which has recently been suggested, and to which I directed attention on several occasions during my election campaign? They should adopt a system similar to that in vogue in the old country, where the Board of Trade collects returns from various unions and trades, and from employers organizations, and publishes them weekly or fortnightly, so that men in search of work may learn where it is to be obtained, and employers may learn where men are to be found who will work for them. I do not propose to keep honorable senators much longer, as I have dealt with the particular subject, which, it seems to me; underlies the successful carrying out of the programme of the Government or any programme that involves considerable expense. I am not one of those who wish to see a large number of Europeans, and especially of low class Europeans, brought into this country, but I say that Australia must be populated, and we cannot expect to import only millionaires. We must import people who will be prepared to settle in and develop the country. I feel strongly on this question. Coming, as I do, from.  North Queensland, and knowing the sugar districts of that State, and especially those north of Bundaberg, I can say that, while the people in those districts dreaded the action taken by the Federal Parliament on the coloured labour question, that action having been taken they have gradually fallen into line, and are now doing their level best, honestly and fairly, to carry out the desire of Australia in the matter.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESSINREPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[3]/continue[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If that should be brought about, the people of Queensland will have a very serious grievance. If the ideas of the New Zealand Government, so far as they have been formulated, are carried out, the Commonwealth will save a few thousand pounds a year, since the New Zealand Government will pay a larger portion of the subsidy, and the Commonwealth will be proportionately relieved. But Brisbane should not cease to be a port pf call for the boats engaged in this ser vice. We have, I think, .a right to claim that the service which, under existing conditions, has developed a considerable trade with Brisbane should be continued. I have figures regarding that trade for the last three years. In the first place the people of Brisbane, save under existing conditions, a very considerable amount of money which, if the proposal now made were carried out, would be involved in the cost of transhipment from Sydney. In addition to that, a certain amount of local trade has grown up at the port of Brisbane. The services of lighters and other services required in connexion with the boats, though representing an amount which does not call for special mention, go to swell the earnings of the port, but I may inform the Senate that in 1904 the Brisbane trade by the Vancouver line represented y##>7>## 296. In 1905 the value of the trade had risen to £27,597, and in 1906 to £33,403. In the three years the value of the trade had practically doubled. In the circumstances, as the existing contract may be terminated at four months notice, I hope that the Government will keep the Queensland authorities and the Senate advised before any serious alteration of existing arrangements is made. The trade is of importance to Queensland, and is increasing, and it should not be forgotten that at present the people of that State, in addition to their share of the Commonwealth subsidy for the existing mail service with the Orient Steam Navigation Company, are paying a special subsidy to induce the boats of the Orient Steam Navigation Company to call at the (port of Brisbane. I hope that for the sake of Queensland, if not for the sake of the trade involved, the Government will act very warily in making any compact with New Zealand, which will benefit that Colony at the expense of Queensland.

I have here a copy of the report of the last Sugar Growers Conference, held at Townsville, in the early portion of this year, which is at the service of any honorable senator who cares to peruse it. If, after having read that report, he comes to the conclusion that the statement made by Senator Chataway is correct, I shall be quite satisfied that nothing I could say would alter his judgment. When the honorable senator says that the northern sugar planters are now trying to carry out the ideal of a White Australia, let me point out that it is only after they had made the most strenuous exertions to defeat the White Australia policy. It is only when they cannot any longer help themselves that the sugar planters consent to fall into line with that policy at all. When the legislation intended to replace coloured labour with white labour was introduced, it was contemplated that the change would extend over a period of five years, but, owing to the action of the sugar planters in strenuously setting their faces against what was then proposed, the transition had to be brought about in one year instead of five, and consequently for the difficulties which have arisen in consequence of a scarcity of white labour they themselves are responsible. Some honorable senators may be inclined to challenge that statement as a very strong one, but I am prepared to prove what I say up to the hilt. In 1903, in the far northern district of Cairns, no less than eleven of the largest sugargrowers connected with the Mulgrave Central Mill, and including two of the directors of the mill, desired to be allowed to work their plantations with white labour, and so earn the sugar bonus. One would think that in a free country like Australia a man would be allowed to cultivate his farm and harvest his crop with any labour he chose, but it was found that that could not be done in this instance. That is proved by a letter written to the sugargrowers referred to by the Mulgrave Central Mill Company. They might have harvested their crop with white labour if they chose, but they could not then have got any one to crush it or to buy it from them, and so the whole of the crop would have been lost. The eleven sugarfarmers, including two of the directors of the mill, and representing nearly a third of the cane grown for the mill in 1903, requisitioned the company in the terms I have stated, and here is the reply they received : (Copy.) Mulgrave Mill Co.  Several farmers in the company having represented that they desired to avail themselves of the bonus payable on cane cultivated by white labour, desired to know on what terms the company was prepared to deal with them. They stated the quantity of their cane to be from 10,000 to 14,000 tons. After due consideration, it was resolved that the company will permit the farmers in question to cut and trash their cane by white labour as requested, provided r.That the farmers engage their own white labour, and that they work in gangs of not less than 30 (thirty). 2.That the gangs be under the control and paid by the farmer (by an order on the mill, if desired), subject only to the general direction of the company as to fields, &c. 3.That a daily quantity of cane, to be arranged between the farmers and the company, be delivered under a guarantee during the whole season. 4.That those farmers electing to use white labour pay for any stoppages of the mill caused by want of supply of cane under their guaranteed quantity. 5.That they relieve the company from all responsibility for cutting their cane in the event of the white gangs failing to do so. 6.To pay any loss on a fro raid basis caused by the indent boys being idle during the slack season. That meant that not only would those farmers have to pay for the white labour engaged in trashing and harvesting the cane, but they would also have to pay for the kanakas whom the company wanted to put on, but whom they would not put on if white labour was employed. The conditions laid down by the company continue","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESSINREPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Mulgrave Central Mill Co. Ld. (Sgd.) S. W. Davids, Genl. Manager. February 1S/03. That was the sort of encouragement the company gave to the farmers who desired to grow cane by white labour. The result was that none of those farmers grew cane by white labour. That company had 250 kanakas illegally engaged, because under the State law a man could only employ kanakas for his own work in tropical agriculture, and he had not the option of hiring them out, but this mill company did not own an acre of land under sugar, and yet it was allowed to employ 250 boys under contract, and to farm them out to the men who required them. In the slack season, the year before last, they were not Content with having these coloured people working in the sugar plantations, but they actually sent kanakas back to places on the cool tablelands behind Cairns to take away from white men work which kanakas were not supposed to do at all. If that is the loyal way in which the sugarplanters are falling in with the White Australia policy, I do not want to make the acquaintance of any more loyalty in my lifetime, lt might be said that this was a mere isolated instance of the discouragement of white labour, or the misrepresentations indulged in by the sugargrowers about the employment of white labour in the sugar plantations. But I will show honorable senators some of the other methods which they used in their attempt to discredit white labour. When the sugar legislation was first enacted by this Parliament, although the sugargrowers were very fond at that time of saying that white men would not or could not do the work, and that even if they could or would do it, they should not be allowed to do it, because it was such cruel and killing work, even at that time gangs of white men were at work in the Mossman district, the furthest north portion of Australia in which sugar is grown at the present moment. As far back as 1902, a gang of men made a contract with the Mossman Central Mill Company to supply a certain number of tons of cane per week. They had to cut the cane upon areas of land registered by the owners for the bonus. About a couple of months after they started work, the company asked them if they could not increase the quantity of cane delivered to the mill. They agreed to about double the quantity that they had contracted to deliver, and then on the 24th December, 1902, the company tried to break the contract on the ground that the men were not delivering a sufficient quantity of cane. This was in face of the fact that the men had first agreed to deliver double the quantity originally contracted for, and afterwards to reduce the quantity in obedience to a request from the mill company. This is shown by the following letter:","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESSINREPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[4]/para[5]","N/A","N/A"

They reduced them accordingly, and yet on Christmas Eve the company told them that they had only been delivering 38J tons per day for some time past, and therefore gave them notice, practically at the end of the crushing season, that the contract must cease and be determined. I want to show honorable senators what truth there was in that statement, and how unreliable were the gross misstatements uttered by men animated by a desire to discredit the White Australian policy and to prevent white men from working in the industry. To show how little credence can be placed on the statements of the company, I shall read the certificate of the Customs officer of the amount of cane harvested and delivered at the mill by this very gang during the last week of the contract. The certificate is as follows :  H.M. Customs, 29th December, 1902. Honorable senators will notice that the amount sent in on 24th December, the day on which notice to determine the contract was sent to the men, was over 40 tons, while on Christmas Day, when of all days in the year it would be excusable for the men to wish to knock off and have a spree, they delivered over 22 tons. These are men who have been denounced as drunken, vile beasts, who are not to be relied upon. They worked on Christmas Day and Boxing Day, and in fact for the whole week, yet they have been denounced in those terms by men whose sole desire was to discredit the White Australia policy. On 27th December a Saturday the day on which their contract expired according to the notice given them by the company, they only cleared up the cane already cut. They did not cut any more, and yet they sent in over 16 tons. The total of 251 tons for the week was 11 tons over the average of 40 tons per day. Those are facts that cannot be denied. I produce my authority for them in the shape of the letters written by the company, and the certificate given by the Government official. The whole action was taken by the company with the idea of discrediting the White Australia policy, and with the object of proving that these men could not do the work, and that it was useless to employ white labour in the sugar industry. Before that gang could get the contract at all they had to pay down , £100 as security for the due performance of the work. Then, in order to terrorize the men, the company without any justification whatever broke the contract and dismissed them, and threatened to forfeit the£100 unless they signed a memorandum stating that it was impossible for them to do the work. That is the sort of tactics the company resorted to.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESSINREPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[4]/para[11]","N/A","N/A"

These men had to send home their money. I know that the ganger, Taylor, had to send home every shilling he earned to keep his family while he was at work. How can these men go to law? How are they to keep together until the law case comes on? The sugar planters, knowing well the advantages they possessed, issued an ultimatum to them that unless they signed a document stating that they could not carry out the contract and had to break it, their deposit of £100would be forfeited. I came along about that time and took a hand in the matter, with the result, I am pleased to say, that the men got their £100 back, and we did not hear any more about signing such a ridiculous document. I could multiply instances to show how every possible discouragement is placed in the way of any sugargrowers engaging white labour in the industry. I can also produce proofs of how men were terrorized by influential mill companies and sugar people into refusing to register their cane for the bonus. It is needless, however, for me to take up the time of the Senate in that connexion. I am only bringing these cases forward now to disprove the statements of Senator Chataway, which I think are totally incorrect, and do not represent the true feeling of the sugar districts themselves on the question. If a difficulty has arisen in securing a sufficiency of labour to carry on the sugar industry, it has been mainly of the sugar planters own creation, because, as I have pointed out. their action in seeking at all costs to defeat the White Australia legislation prevented the transition from coloured to white labour occupying five years as contemplated, and compelled it to be completed in the one year. Notwithstanding that the transition had to be somewhat sudden, and in spite of all these difficulties, I have yet to learn that there has been any scarcity of labour whatever in any of the sugar districts. None or very few of the contract immigrants have arrived in Australia yet, and none of them have so far reached the sugar districts. That is a certainty, and yet in North Queensland at present, in the furthermost north district where sugar is grown, there is no scarcity of labour. It is only a little over a fortnight ago that I left the Cairns district, and at that time there was not only a sufficiency of labour there, but there were plenty of men walking about unable to get work.

Further, they tried to get the unemployed to engage for twelve months, on conditions which meant lengthening the hours and reducing the wages paid in the industry. The wages in the farming districts of North Queensland have always been 25s. per week in the off season, and at least 30s. in the harvesting season, with rations. As a matter of fact, there are men there who are getting 30s. a week all the year round.  But wages were sought to be brought down by the Government in this precious document.

I would add a word of comment upon that last, telegram. The Collector of Customs who sent it was evidently misled in saying that at the start of the crushing season 1,000 men would be required. In the Cairns district there were never more than 500 kanakas, and how 1,000 white men could be required to ta;ke the place of 500 kanakas was more than I could understand. The statement calls for too large a stretch of credulity, and I should not think much of the intelligence of a person who believed it. As to the planters and their present attitude, I wish to point out that, while they desire to bring in large numbers of men in order that they may have labourers competing against each other, and by that means bring down rates of pay to the lowest possible level, these very planters do not believe in competition amongst themselves. When it is a question of their competing with one another they raise strong objections. We sometimes hear members of the Senate and of another place speaking about the glories of free competition; but very few of them like it to apply to themselves. At the Townsville Conference of sugar planters which was held in February, 1907, a proposal was made, as intimated by Senator Chataway, by the Premier of Queensland, to bring in labourers if the planters who required them would pay each as a guarantee that they really wanted the men, and as some sort of recompense to the Government for the expense to which it would be put. That was one of the conditions which the Queensland Premier intimated that the Government required to be fulfilled. He wrote  It is further to be understood that the paid by the employer to the Government in part payment of passage money is not to be refunded by the immigrant, and that the wages agreed to be paid to him are to be paid without deductions. It was also intimated that the employer who offered the best terms to the immigrants would get priority in having the first call upon the immigrants services.

In 1905, in the Cairns district, the growers got 20s. 5d. a ton for cane delivered at the mill. That was entirely apart from the bonus, which would amount to 5s. a ton, and which, this year, will amount to 7s. 6d. a ton in the northern districts. If the cane is worth £1 a ton, a man who is asked to produce cane at that sum, without reckoning the bonus, is very well off indeed compared with a man who, before Federation, had to produce it for 12 s. or less per ton.

Employers of labour favour it because they know that if there is a continual stream of labourers coming in and looking for work they can keep down wages to the lowest possible level at which men will consent to work and live. Again, property owners favour that line of policy because they know that the pressure of population will tend to increase more and more, as the years go on, the value of their properties, and allow them to reap a larger harvest of unearned increment.

The necessary expenditure should be a charge upon the Consolidated Revenue, just as is the cost of administering the Department of Defence, or any other Department that could be mentioned. It would, in my opinion, be an exceedingly bad thing for Australia if we established a scheme which would be open to the slur that it involved a poor rate. I do not think it right that oldage pensions proposals should bc mixed up with any special taxation proposals. They should stand by themselves, and, when accepted, we should find ways and means to increase the Consolidated Revenue Fund in such a way as to enable it fj sustain the additional charge upon it. The reference to the oldage pensions scheme which is contained in the GovernorGenerals Speech will be but a poor consolation to the old men outside who are awaiting the establishment of such a scheme. I am aware that in some of the States oldage pensions schemes are already in operation, but they are associated with conditions which prevent some old persons from obtaining pensions. A State, for its own protection, is obliged co impose a condition that the applicant for an oldage pension must have been a resident of the State for a certain time. Every one knows that in the early days of Australia many of the pioneers, and especially those who followed the diggings, did not stop sufficiently long in any one State to qualify them for the receipt of an oldage pension under the conditions imposed by the State legislation.

Therefore, to mix the oldage pensions question up with another proposal was, I was going to say, a mere subterfuge. Perhaps that would be unparliamentary, and I shall not say it. I shall say instead that it was a mere clouding of the issue. The people would have been led by the Bill introduced last session to believe that an amendment of the Constitution was necessary before oldage pensions could be provided. No such amendment is necessary. If the Government and Parliament have only the courage to impose the necessary taxation, as every Government and Parliament should do to carry out anything they think ought to be carried out, we could have oldage pensions established in the Commonwealth tomorrow. I hope, therefore, that the question will be tackled in an earnest way, so that we may have an early solution of it. In looking over my notes of what Senator Chataway said regarding the sugar industry, I find I have not replied to one or two of his statements. I think I ought to do the honorable senator, who comes from a large and important sugar centre, the honour of replying to his assertions. The reason 1 did not go through them seriatim before the dinner adjournment was that he was not present. He is not present now either, but that is not my fault, and I shall proceed to discuss his remarks just the same as if he were here. He was insistent that every facility should be given to planters to have .as much labour as possible available for the cultivation and harvesting of their crops. I think that is a fair statement of what he demanded. He also said that there would be a much larger quantity of labour required during the harvesting than in any other season of the year. How does he propose to get over that difficulty ? Does he want a sufficiency of labour to do all the harvesting work in three, four, or five months, and to leave that labour helpless and unemployed during the remaining seven or eight months Df the year ? The reason why there was not always a sufficiency of white men available locally in North Queensland to do most of the work at harvesting time was that in the offseason they could not get anything at all to do. The planters utilized the coloured labour available to do all the work in the offseason, and white men had to go elsewhere to look for work. Consequently, they were not there when the harvesting season came round again. It is cruel to suggest that there must be a sufficiency of men available to meet a rush without making any provision at all for them to live during the rest of the year. How do these advocates of unlimited and unrestricted immigration, of the pouring in of countless hundreds of helpless immigrants with absolutely no capital and no means of providing themselves with daily bread except the labour of their hands, propose to find work for them in the off season? That is a fair question to ask, and one which they ought to answer before they make such a demand.

Senator Chataway gave the whole show away when he quoted a letter written by a man named Horton, the President of the Johnstone River Sugar Growers Association. This gentleman, who poses as a great authority, wrote to the papers. I have his letter here, and I may perhaps regale the Senate by showing how much he knows about the matter. He says, in the letter quoted by Senator Chataway, and I take it that the honorable senator read it correctly, that the reason why men could not be got from the southern States was that they could get better wages and conditions than the planters were offering. Quite so. I think everybody knows it. If the planters were prepared to offer as good conditions and wages as anybody else they would get just as many men as any other industry. That shows that the whole thing resolves itself into a question of cheap wages. The planters want cheap wages. They want men who will work for them at the cheapest possible rate that they can force them to accept. It is no part of the business or duty of this Parliament to offer any facilities whatever to anybody to reduce the wages of the working men of this great Continent. I refuse to be a party to anything of the kind.

The planters say they want sympathy. They want facilities to give them a rush of labourers to do what? To give them a surplus of labour during the harvesting season. What is to become of those men in the off season? It is a callous cruel proposal, which should not be tolerated for one moment in this Chamber. I regret that this matter has to come up for discussion so often in this Senate. We had hoped that we had finally settled it. I believe the sugargrowers of Queensland got as fair and generous terms from this Parliament as any body of men could expect, and for that fair and generous treatment they owed a great deal to the party to which I belong. It was the Labour men of Queensland who advocated it, but all the thanks we got for it was to be howled at by the very men who Senator Chataway, says are now the loyal supporters of the White Australia policy. They continually howled at us and denounced us for daring to suggest that policy. If the sugar planters of Queensland and New South  Wales were well advised, they would, instead of disgusting the people of the Commonwealth by their continual clamour and howlings, gracefully acknowledge the fair and generous way in which they have been treated. When I speak of the sugar planters and growers as having done these things, I do not mean the whole of them. I mean those growers who have exercised a controlling influence in the industry. According to the letters I read out for the benefit of the Senate tonight, a number of the small sugargrowers have always been in favour of the White Australia policy They have done their very best to act loyally and faithfully in accordance with the policy and ideal of the people of Australia, but every difficulty has been thrown in their way. It is the influential controlling section of the sugar industry who are responsible for all the trouble, and who are continually bringing up the matter in this Parliament, constantly howling and complaining that they are absolutely ruined. Senator Chataway also stated I should like the honorable senator to see that I quote him correctly that lack of labour was causing the farmers to draw in their horns and cultivate less cane.

The Mossman Central Mill, which, as the honorable senator knows, is the most northern mill we have in Australia, this year produced more sugar than it ever did in its history. The amount of its production is only limited by the crushing capacity of the mill. If it could crush twice as much cane the extra quantity would be grown for it. The Mulgrave Central Mill, immediately prior to Federation, could not get enough cane to keep itself going four months in the year. This year, although its crushing capacity has been almost doubled, it has had enough cane to keep it going for seven months, and, in addition to that, has had to beg the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to crush a quantity of cane for it. That is the way the sugar industry is declining in North Queensland ! Where is the ruin of which we hear so much, and which Senator Chataway, when publishing a newspaper in Mackay, was continually howling about? Where does the ruin come in?

There is one other point in connexion with Senator Chataways speech to which I should like to draw attention. It may be remembered that shortly after the Senate met at the beginning of the session the honorable senator asked a series of questions with regard to statements put forward by the Imperial Government warning immigrants who intended to come out to Australia that they ought not to come to work on the sugar plantations as such work was entirely unsuitable. I think that he very properly drew attention to that fact. I consider that it was an improper statement to be made by the Imperial authorities, who had absolutely no actual knowledge of the facts. 1 believe that, it was rather calculated to deter British people. whom we are exceptionally desirous to have as residents of Australia, from coming here. But although I find fault with the Imperial Government for publishing such a statement to the British people, I can find a strong excuse for them in having done so, because they merely took the assurances given year by year bv the sugarplanters whom Senator Chataway is so fond of representing, and who were continually howling that white men could not work in North Queensland, that a colour line ought to be drawn across the State, that only black men ought to be employed north of that line, and that even if the white man could work there he would not, or that if he could and would, he ought not to be allowed to do so, as the work was so killing. How can honorable senators blame the Imperial Government for having published such a statement in those circumstances?

But I do say that it was a cruel thing to bring the kanakas to Australia, because they were killed off wholesale when we got them here. That is a strong statement to make, but the statistics of Queensland prove it to be perfectly true. Although the kanakas came to Queensland in the prime of life between the ages of eighteen and forty not old people, but strong and healthy young men whose deathrate ought to have been particularly low as compared with that of the white [population their deathrate was, as a matter of fact, two or three times as great as that of the whites. In other words, we killed them off at three times the rate at which the white people died. And really that deathrate does not represent a true proportion, because, there being no old people or young children amongst the kanakas, their deathrate ought to have been lower than that of the whites, who, of course, included the very young and the very old, amongst whom the deathrate would be naturally much higher. If we take that fact into consideration, the deathrate of the kanakas was four times as great as that of the white people.

Coming back to the GovernorGenerals Speech, there are in it one or two points to which I wish to refer before concluding. We are told by the GovernorGeneral that, after his visit to the Northern Territory, he feels confident that the tour of inspection made bv members of Parliament must prove of great value in our deliberations on the proposed transfer. I agree with Senator Chataway and with every other senator who has spoken in this connexion, that it is in the highest degree desirable for the wellbeing of Australia that the Northern Territory should be taken over by the Commonwealth. I am not one of those who intend to cavil at the cost of taking it over, or at any reasonable cost that may be incurred in developing it. I believe that even though the cost amounted to halfamillion a year, such money spent in developing that great territory would be well spent.

In other words, that we should guarantee the interest while they used the capital. That was a preposterous proposal, and one which should not have been entertained for a moment by any sensible business men, because if we are to be responsible for raising the money for the syndicate to render a service for us, why should we not raise the money ourselves and perform the service? Why must we have the syndicate as intermediaries? I have heard a great deal said about the action of Victoria. I heard a Victorian representative in another place say, not later than last night, that no State should interfere in the matter or should be responsible for any portion of the capital. I do not hold with that view. If Victoria owned a line of mail steamers, I should sooner treat with that State than with any private individuals.

I believe that it would be just as beneficial to the producing interests and the travelling public if the Commonwealth had a line of mail steamers a$ it is to the producing interests and the travelling public for the States to own railways. I believe it would be equally profitable to the people of the Commonwealth. When the negotiations were going on Ministers announced that there was a combination of capital organized absolutely for the purpose of preventing those who were contracting for the mail service from raising the necessary money in England. When we are face to face with a combination organized in that way in order to fleece the public of Australia, why should we not step in for the protection of the public and build a line of steamers for ourselves? In all seriousness, I ask what good reason can be advanced against the adoption of such a sensible and businesslike course. There is no business person who will not admit that if he can find the necessary means to carry out a certain work it will pay him better to do it for himself than to employ others who must, in their turn, look about for the means to perform the work.

The halves system of farming and dairying which obtains in Victoria and in parts of New South Wales is about the very worst form of rackrenting and landlordism that could possibly exist in any country.

I have gone through portions of New South Wales and Victoria in which there are just as many tenant farmers in proportion as in any part of the old country. That is a thing I want to obviate in this country if possible. That the land is the proper thing to bear the cost of defence will hardly be denied by anybody who studies the question impartially. Defence is mainly for the protection of the property of a country, because after all the number of lives sacrificed, especially if you let everything go bv the board, would be very small. What you are really defending is (property. Undoubtedly the highest ambition and noblest desire anybody could have is to defend and maintain the integrity and independence of his country, but behind that integrity and independence is always the question of property, and it is the propertyowners who would suffer most in the case of disaster. Many of them would be ruined, whereas the man who had no property might not be injured to any great extent. It is therefore only a fair proposition that by far the greater portion of the burden of defending the country should fall upon those who derive a benefit from the expenditure of the money spent in defence, and those are the propertyowners. It would only amount to a tax of about £ per cent, to spend far more even than Senator Cameron advocated in moving the adoption of the AddressinReply, and surely it is not too much to ask the landowners to contribute so much towards the defence of the property they value so highly and hold so dear.

That point is that we, as a national Parliament, have a right to demand that the country we are called upon to govern is put to the very best national use. We have to look at it from the national standpoint, and to enact such laws that the very best possible national results will follow without allowing a loophole for any national disaster to creep in. One of the first essentials for the national wellbeing of this country, for its safety and defence, is to have a large population. There is no inducement for that large population to come here when by far the best of our land the land most suitable and accessible at this moment for closer settlement is locked up in the hands of private monopolists. Go anywhere you like through Australia, on any railway line you choose, and you will find along it vast areas of really good land held by station owners and squatters and land monopolists of various kinds, who do not put it to the best use, but run sheep and cattle on it, and where those areas could support in comfort and prosperity hundreds and thousands of people, they do not perhaps support more than five. That such a system is possible is a danger to the national wellbeing, and it is the duty of this Parliament to devise a remedy, because anything that affects the national wellbeing of Australia is undoubtedly a matter that closely concerns this Parliament. 1 hat is why we propose a progressive land tax, in order to insure that the land shall be put to its best use. The tax which was proposed was an exceedingly mild one. I am afraid that it was rather too mild to be as effective as I should like.

One reason why we advocate a progressive land tax is that we want to burst up the big estates and to create a large population in the rural districts of Australia. That can be done in no other way that I know of than by a progressive land tax. Honorable senators can talk about the compulsory resumption of estates, but that scheme is absolutely useless. It simply means that when the Government proceed to buy land compulsorily, supposing they have £500,000 to spend, land increases in value immediately. There are forced sales, and the sellers put the price up. The consequence is that the men who go upon the land have to pay an increased price for it, and are probably handicapped for the rest of their lives by doing so; in addition to which there is no guarantee that the land will not revert at some future time to ownership as part of a large estate. But a progressive land tax, on the one hand, would make the land more accessible, and would also work automatically against the aggregation of estates. It is a national necessity to open up the lands of Australia for the occupation of the people. Impose a progressive land tax, and that will be done. Such a policy is not only desirable from a national standpoint, but is eminently fair and just. We are all agreed that a portion of the value created by the enterprise, energy, and ability of the people should be enjoyed by the whole people, and not be reaped by a few landowners. But while the party to which I belong advocates this policy, what do the Government propose to do? Not only is no proposal put forward which is adequate to meet the needs of the country, but we are not told how the money is to be found to carry out those schemes which the Government forecast. To show their tenderness of feeling towards the wealthy man, the commercial man, the propertyowner, and the landowner, as compared with the rest of the community, the Government have brought down a proposal for penny postage throughout Australia. It has been estimated that we should lose about £300,000 per annum by that reform. Now, who are the people who would benefit from the establishment of the penny postage? Is it the working man, who writes, perhaps, a couple of letters a week, or is it the business man, who writes 200? Undoubtedly it is the large importer, the merchant, the stockbroker, the exchange agent, and the manufacturer who would benefit. They, indeed, are the only people who would derive any substantial advantage.

Whatever critics of Parliament may say as to the old and musty practice of debating the AddressinReply, I hold that at least the present debate has not been by any means of a wasteful character. I rather incline to think that some very useful information has been placed before the Senate by several previous speakers. Such a debate affords an opportunity for honorable senators to express their views upon questions that probably would not be ventilated were such a debate to become a thing of the past. It enables us to hear the representatives of different States speak in advocacy of the varied interests of Australia, and we listen to points of view, to which otherwise we might be almost strangers. Take the question which has been discussed today by Senator Chataway and Senator Givens that of the sugar industry. On every occasion when I have heard that matter debated fresh information has been furnished in regard to it. The industry seems to be undergoing the same evolutionary process as is affecting almost every other industry in Australia. The debate has also given Senator St. Ledger an excellent opportunity of proclaiming that he comes to the Senate as a man with a mission. That mission is to bring about by constitutional means the entire abolition of triangular government and the establishment of what he chooses to call constitutional government. Well, other statesmen in Australia have set themselves the same task. It .will be remembered that not very long ago a prominent politician declared that he had thrown himself in the way of the Labour Party. Senator St. Ledger has not made his declaration so strongly as that, but undoubtedly the trend of his speech was to show that the aim of his politics is the abolition of the Labour Party.

Senator St. Ledger declares unflinchingly that he has copied from Mr. Deakin that powerful declaration of his in favour of constitutional government, and also, of course, in opposition to triangular government, showing clearly that Senator St. Ledger is quite capable of copying all the vagaries of even the Prime Minister. But whether he will attempt to copy some of his realisms is a matter which the future alone will reveal. For instance, the Prime Minister might talk, as Senator St. Ledger has talked, of a desire to establish constitutional government. I venture to say that he would take the support of any party, or of a member of a party, when it was needed just as willingly and gracefully as probably any other politician would accept it. The criticism levelled1 at the Labour Party by Senator St. Ledger was very unfair. I think that he, as a conscientious man, must realize that some of his statements were wide of the mark. He is scarcely sufficiently ignorant of the position of political parties in Australia not to know that he was speaking incorrectly in some cases. For instance, he talked about a. combination between the Government and the Labour Party. He ought to have been in possession of substantial facts before he made a statement of that character. I am a member of the Labour Party, and I refuse for a moment to believe that there is anything in the shape of a combination or a coalition with the present Government. I support the Government because I believe that otherwise I might sometimes have to support or oppose a Government which would be much further from my way of political thinking. Surely without a combination or a coalition a man may exercise his parliamentary vote in support of a Government when it comes in some degree nearer to his own political belief than do those who would possibly take their place were they selected from the Opposition benches ?

I also think that we have a right to be very pleased with the work done by our representatives at the Navigation Conference. I recognise that when they were appointed a great deal of very severe criticism was hurled at their heads by the whole of the Australian press, and by very many of our leading politicians. They could scarcely find words strong enough to express their disapprobation, but meagre as is the information which has yet reached us, we may rely sufficiently upon the cabled reports to believe that the work of our representatives was directed very much towards promoting the best interests of Australia. In fact, if they had done nothing else, I should feel satisfied with their success in obtaining conditions which will enable this Parliament in the future to legislate freely in regard to Australian shipping. That, I think, is a considerable gain, and one with which Australia may well be pleased. In regard to the question of preferential trade raised by the Prime Minister in London, I do not propose to speak at any length. Some time ago I expressed the opinion here that it was really a question which belonged to the English people. I still hold that view, and whilst a great deal of noise was made by the Prime Minister in regard to the matter, I think it is only fair to say that he knew long before Winston Churchill made the statement, long before he went Home, that the doors of the United Kingdom were bolted and barred in that regard. I think that Senator de Largie put the position clearly today when he said that those doors were bolted and barred bv the expressions of the English electors at the last general election. When the Tariff Bill is submitted, I shall be quite prepared to take my stand. I shall certainly be found voting with those who are legitimately seeking to promote the welfare of the great industries and the industrial classes of Australia as against all others. I shall also be. found prepared to assist in giving such protection as may seem necessary for the conservation of existing, and the establishment of new, industries. But I shall not be found ready to give to the manufacturers an absolute control of both the workmen and the consumers. When protection is fairly administered in the interests of Australia it will be a protection such as will not only secure the manufacturer in his industry, but will also safeguard the wageearner from becoming practically the slave df his employer, and prevent the consumer from becoming a mere plaything of avaricious manufacturers, if any such persons are to be found here. When I speak of protection for the worker I have no thought of the 25s. a week men, whom our honorable friends have been speaking of, nor do I think that 28s. or 30s. a week is adequate remuneration for a toiler in, say, the starch or any other industry in Victoria, or indeed, in any part of Australia. I believe that it should always be recognised that the livelihood of the workman depends on the value of his labour, and his labour should return to him such a recompense as will at least afford him a comfortable position in the community of which he is a member, and some of the benefits of the civilization to which he gives so many of the useful years of his life, and which he is doing so very much to establish and perfect. It is because I believe that what I suggest can be done that I take up the attitude indicated. The establishment of all industrial regulations in this direction will always be difficult.

I make a considerable distinction between the Australian employer and employers in the old country. Industry in Australia is not carried on under the conditions which applied to the industries with which I was connected in the earlier part of my life. I recognised at that time that workmen were being employed by persons who were approachable, and with whom they could get into immediate touch, but our industries in Australia are very largely controlled bv the men of whom I have been speaking, and who were never nearer than London to Australia in their lives, and probably never intend to be. Consequently I recognise that there is extreme difficulty ,in dealing with industrial questions in Australia in such a way as to make provision for the protection of the workman as well as of the manufacturer. The reason is that those who are merely the mouthpieces of the capital running the show, and the wirepullers of the men who sit abroad and take the profits of the industry, must devote their whole attention to the evasion of every industrial regulation that can be established, and to getting the longest hours of labour possible out of their working men, while giving them, in return, the very smallest possible amount of recompense that they can dole out to them. I recognise the difficulty of dealing with the extraordinary industrial conditions by which we are surrounded, but great as it may be, I do not believe for a moment that it is unsurmountable. Another matter referred to in the GovernorGenerals Speech is the provision which the Government intend to make by means of a Bounties Bill for the building up of new industries in Australia. I shall not now discuss the question whether the principle of bounties is good, bad, or indifferent, because an opportunity to do so will be afforded later on. But I do sincerely hope that when the Government brings before this Parliament a Bounties Bill it will not be such a puny little twopennyhalfpenny sort of thing as that which was before us on the last occasion when We were asked to deal with the question. If the proposed measure is to have any virtue in it it must be one which will really effect what is proposed, and not merely play with the question. So much has been said of what appears in paragraph 6 of the GovernorGenerals Speech that I hesitate to make any remarks in connexion with it. I think I should entirely refrain from doing so, but for the fact that the moment I heard the Speech I was impressed with the thought that there was an inordinate amount of insincerity displayed by the Government on the question of oldage pensions. If ever there was a question which found its way into a Government policy by the sheer force of public opinion it is the question of oldage pensions. As Senator de Largie has said, it is not a party question, because the whole of the people of Australia have clamoured for the establishment of a Federal scheme. The proposal has beer very much hawked about, but no substantial attempt has ever yet been made to secure its accomplishment. Its association with other matters in paragraph 6 of the GovernorGenerals Speech suggested in my mind a doubt as to whether the Government were at all sincere in the matter. Senator Givens fairly argued that it is a matter which should not be associated with any other large and debatable question. Seeing that ic . represents the demand of the people of Australia, it should stand by itself, and should be treated on its merits. It is a humane question, and deserves the best consideration we can give it. More than that, the provision for oldage pensions should be made now, and we should not continue to play with the question session after session, and Parliament after Parliament, and waste our time in little more than talk. Paragraph 6 of the GovernorGenerals Speech reads  The subject of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States has been further discussed by the States Premiers, and the results arrived at will be communicated to you. The great issues affected, including the federalization of oldage pensions, will be considered in this relation. What a glorious chance we have of realizing anything like our ambition in this connexion when such a question is to be handled by the States Premiers. So far as the present Government is concerned, it would appear that the establishment of an oldage pensions scheme depends entirely upon the generosity of what I call the antiFederal League.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESSINREPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[5]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I regret the position in which they have placed the question of oldage pensions. That position has given birth to the doubt whether they have any intention whatever of attempting to bring the matter before the Senate as a practical question. I have no intention of discussing all the paragraphs in the GovernorGenerals Speech. They have already been very fully and fairly debated. But I wish to refer to. the Northern Territory. Although, I have not had the pleasure of a trip to the Territory. I have tried to make myself acquainted with all the reports available concerning it. I presume they are from a fairly reliable source, because I do not believe for a moment that the South Australian Government would, send out reports that were likely to be very materially injured by any expert opinion the Commonwealth might seek on its own behalf. Having therefore looked up those reports, I begin to satisfy myself that this is a part of Australia that demands the very careful consideration of the Commonwealth. I have taken very great interest in the question of its mineral deposits. It seems to offer fairly good ground for an excellent mining industry. I regret that some of our friends of the yellow tribe have reached there. They seem to have a fair share of it.

I am speaking now more particularly of the mining industry in the Territory. I know the difficulties of mining very well. I appreciate the extraordinary difficulties in the way of opening up new mining fields where the means of communication are so infinitesimal as they are in the Northern Territory. I am hopeful that our best consideration will lead to something substantial being done with regard to the Territory, with benefit to the general welfare of Australia. I am exceedingly pleased that the Government propose to amend the machinery sections of the Electoral Act. The evidence of the last elections has been an eyeopener to many of us. It has almost made us doubt whether men are fit to be in charge of a ballotbox at all. Some of the information we have received through investigations leads one to conclude that it is almost too sacred a business to allow some men at least to touch. If men are incapable of doing their duty in electoral matters, or so naturally wicked that they will not perform, it, we ought to look for some other means to accomplish the work. I trust the Government will be able, when the Bill is brought forward, to make room for some provision in the direction advocated by Senator Pearce in the session before last, for the adoption of voting machines, in order to dispense, as far as possible, with the necessity for men conducting the counting of votes. In discussing electoral matters, I should like to refer to some of the proceedings of various candidates during the last election. The provision of the Electoral Act relating to the limitation of electoral expenses is being very seriously evaded. Just as in industries, so in electoral matters, there are always some men who are clever at conniving, particularly when they have plenty of money to pay for it. The Act provides that no more than a certain sum shall be spent. I was an eyewitness of an election proceeding in Perth. I watched what went on very carefully. I am not going to say who spent the money or where it came from, but the purest angel could never convince me that the expenditure of certain members of the Federal Parliament was kept within anything like the limit of  £100.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESSINREPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[5]/continue[14]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The sum of £100 would not pay for half the motor cars that were being run. If the Act can be evaded, we ought to have some other provisions. If a man is to be allowed to spend as much money as he can, or as he has at his command, we ought to have a .provision that will require some solid information to be given about that money. If, for instance, the money is the property of the National League, it ought to appear on the election expenses accounts as money collected and spent by the National League for their candidates.

It will be the means, at any rate, of settling the question one way or the other. Honorable senators who made it part of their policy to oppose the survey of this line during the last elections, will find themselves in an unfortunate position, because I am satisfied that a good deal of useful information can be gained by it which may be the means of materially altering the views of honorable senators when they come to face the question in reality.
