"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","TURLEY, Henry","K8W","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","That is very clear and definite, and shows that any Bill having to be recommended by message from the Crown, which comes before the Senate, and has not been disposed of when the prorogation takes places, cannot be covered by the standing order which I have quoted. Unless a message comes down to the House, in which the Bill originated, we cannot take the Bill up again, and deal with it in the same way as we can deal with a Bill of another kind. This is a matter which is outside all party interest, and should be dealt with on its merits. I bring up the point, not because it has any relation to the question involved in the motion, but because I think we should endeavour, as far as possible, to see that everything that we do is within the limits of the Constitution. One can easily conceive of a situation arising in the only House in which Bills involving the appropriation of revenue can be introduced namely, the other place where the Government might bring down a Bill at the commencement of a session, with a message from the GovernorGeneral. The Senate might take an opposite view of the measure. There might be a long discussion, and at the time of the prorogation that Bill might not have been dealt with. In the next session circumstances might have changed. The Government, according to this standing order, need not even introduce the measure afresh. There might be ian opportunity to get it pushed through at the end of the session. Suppose as we can easily conceive to be the case that a Bill has been left over at the time of prorogation, and that at the commencement of the next session there is no evidence that it is likely to be brought up again. Towards the end of the session, when members mav, perhaps, have become tired, or when many may have been called away, the Government may take advantage of the position, utilize this standing order, and so be enabled to get through a Bill of that description merely by keeping it back for a certain, time. But we have the protection of the Constitution in reference to Bills which appropriate revenue. I contend that a message must be brought down in the same session in which a Bill appropriating revenue is submitted to Parliament. I hold that section 56 of the Constitution absolutely prevents a Bill of this description from being brought forward without a GovernorGenerals message. Therefore, I submit that the motion of the leader of the Senate is altogether out of order.

There are two classes of appropriations, that for the ordinary annual services, and that which is covered by such a Bill as is now under consideration, namely, an appropriation for specific purposes. This section of the Constitution, therefore, applies to the present Bill. In addition to the point raised by Senator Turley, there is the question whether, in view of section 56 of the Constitution, such a Bill as this is one which properly comes under standing order 234 in regard to lapsed Bills. Without dealing with the narrower question as to whether a message can be brought in during the progress of a Bill, which has been introduced in another branch of the Legislature, there is the further question of substance, namely, whether this standing order is applicable to a Bill which requires a message from the GovernorGeneral to be brought down in the same session. That evidently means in the session in which the measure originated. I venture to think that this is not such a Bill as ought to be included within the meaning of standing order 234. Section 56 of the Constitution is evidently limited to Bills which go through their ordinary course Bills which are supported by a message from the GovernorGeneral and is not applicable to Bills which are covered by standing order 234. It is true that standing order 234 is an extremely useful one, but it ought not to be extended in its operation in a way which might interfere with the privileges and powers of Parliament, or with the objects which are intended to be safeguarded by section 56. As this measure was introduced by a Ministry of which I had the honour to be a member, I have no doubt that everything was done in regular order, and that there was a message last year. The Bill is practically at an end. Standing order 234 gives power to revive Bills of an ordinary character, but not, I submit, Bills requiring a message from the GovernorGeneral. Bills such as that now before us are on an altogether different footing from Bills of an ordinary character. Our Standing Orders are subject to the powers and provisions of the Constitution, and standing order 234 is subject to section 56. That section has, so to speak, been exhausted, and if it is intended to apply it again, there ought to be a new Bill with a new appropriation under a new message.

I am not at all sure that I find it in any way unpleasant to be addressing my fellow senators from this side of the chamber. I passed an exceedingly happy time for four months on the other side of the table, through the goodwill of honorable senators. During that time we got through some fairly satisfactory work, though perhaps we did rot absolutely satisfy everybody. I had not an opportunity before, and I therefore avail myself of this opportunity, to thank the two honorable senators who, with great goodness and ability, moved and seconded the AddressinReply to the speech of His Excellency the Governor General. I have also to convey to the Senate a message from our colleague, Senator Best, who recently communicated with me, and sent his kindest regards to myself and all his brother senators. I am sure we hope he has had an extremely pleasant holiday, and that we may have an opportunity to welcome him back here very shortly. In connexion with recent events members of the Senate have been very much in the position of onlookers, but I think it is due to the constitutional position which the Senate occupies, its status, and the influence it ought to exert, that honorable senators should take a hand, and not be mere dumb spectators of the movements of parties, or simply be in the position of silently registering action which may be taken in another place, or the changes that may ensue upon any such! action. Ministers formally introduced themselves about a fortnight ago. That was more or less a pleasing ceremonial, and yesterday they came to us in what we might call their working clothes, and accompanied by what I suppose they call a policy. The proceedings of yesterday were characterized by several innovations. In the first place, we had, I think, for the first time, certainly in my experience, a statement from Ministers, with respect to changes taking place after Parliament had been opened, put in writing.

That was no explanation, nor was. it any excuse for the innovation, because a statement of policy is always submitted on a change of Government occurring after the opening of a Parliament, through the medium of a .GovernorGenerals speech. Personally, I have no such reverence for those hoary traditions which require the formality of a GovernorGenerals speech, to induce me to extend them to an occasion when the flowing eloquence of my friend might be much more usefully employed, than that he should be bound down hand and foot within the four corners of a written instrument.

He is an old parliamentary hand, and I am sure that the last thing in the world he would wish to be would be a kind of marionette, and therefore he said that one reason why this course was adopted was to prevent any little divergencies which might be taken hold of.

But that Senator Clemons was most strongly opposed to this Bill last session I intimated on more than one occasion to Sir John Forrest, and therefore Senator Clemons was naturally incensed when this attitude was, quite inadvertently, I am sure, attributed to him by my honorable friend. I shall allude presently in very brief terms to two or three of the incidents which led up to a situation which, perhaps, is not customary in politics, and certainly is not very usual. I say this : that no defeat of a Ministry was ever less of a triumph to the gentleman who brought it about. I do not wonder that ever since he has been living in clouds of explanation and apologetics without number. The fact of the matter is, it seems to me, that Parliament is beginning to think that in defeating the late Ministry it really whipped the wrong boy. It reminds me of an old story about a school where the punishment was conducted on the old Eton principle of bringing the boys up on a particular day of the week before the headmaster and administering chastisement to them. On one Saturday the day set aside for the purpose a number of boys were called up by the master, who had a list in his hand, for the usual dose of punishment. When one boy was brought in he asked,  Well, sir, what am I to be punished for? The headmaster replied,  I do not know ; but you are on the list, and I have to go through with it. But after he had flogged the boy the headmaster found on> examining his list that he had flogged the confirmation class ! I think the country is beginning to feel that it is the boys of the confirmation class who have been punished by Parliament, and not the real delinquent, of whom they have formed, however, a pretty strong opinion. What was the situation? The situation was this that the present Prime Minister, having asked for fiscal peace, in October, 1903, declared it to be one of the permanent planks of the platform which he put before Australia at the general elections. He also denounced the continuance of what he called the threeparty system. As honorable senators are aware, Mr. Deakin was really the first who exhibited that threeparty spectre on the public platform. He had lived under it, and groaned under its servitude for three years, according to his own statement. He declared that parliamentary government had become impossible. It was intolerable ; it could not. continue. Only the other day at an Australian Natives gathering he said that unless the number of parties was reduced to two the working of constitutional government would be rendered impossible.

When the fiscal strife revives, if it ever does  This is only last year it may generate similar warmth of feeling which will lead to similar exaggerated expressions, but at the present time we have surely no need to resort to those personal weapons. That was in deprecation of the attempt of what was called the corner protectionist party to bring back this unhappy reaction, to reopen this sore. I say, therefore, that the position then was one of fiscal peace. The fiscal question was out of the way. But my honorable friend, Senator Styles, has said that that statement was made before the Tariff Commission was appointed. Mr. Deakin in that celebrated speech at Ballarat, did not say that the appointment of the Tariff Commission was a breach of the fiscal peace or a breach of the compact ; but whether he implied that or not, he said, on the 1 2 th October, that his own position in regard to the Tariff was unaltered. When the Tariff Commission was proposed, and Mr. Deakins attention was called to the possibility) of the motion being carried, and to the question whether it would not have an effect upon the position of parties, he derided the idea. During the course of hisspeech, Mr. Deakins attention was called to the matter by Mr. Isaacs, who asked to be permitted to explain, in order that there might be no misapprehension. The words used by Mr. Isaacs were It is our intention, as evidenced by the noticepaper, to make the Tariff question a very live one this session. Mr. Deakin,in reply to that, said It is to be made a live question by a motion that relates to an excellent object, but can have no immediate practical effect. That motion is to be carried by the votes of those who will support it only if there be nothing more important in the platform going at the time. We know that our friends of the Labour Party do not make a plank of the fiscal question. The remark of Mr. Deakin was ian allusion to what he had previously said in sweeping away the idea that any help to protection could be obtained from Mr. Watsons party. Mr. Watson, when quoting a paragraph of the alliance agreement, said As one who has always been inclined to a protectionist Tariff when matters more important to the Labour Partys platform were not involved..... That was Mr. Watsons comment on the suggestion that there should be an alliance between the Labour Party and the protectionists for the benefit of protection. That was the point to which the alliance had! screwed up the leader of the Opposition at that time; and I wonder to what point they have screwed up Mr. Watsons party on protection now. Mr. Deakin went on to say If there is nothing more important in hand, the honorable member is going to be a protectionist; if there is something more important in hand, he is not going to be a protectionist.

A coalition with Mr. Watsons party was impossible, for the reason, as Mr. Deakin himself explained, that, apart altogether from questions of policy and the fiscal question, there was the great obstacle of organization which Mr. Deakin, in a subsequent speech at Ballarat, said had to be swallowed together with the objects of the party. And even as recently as the 12th October last year, it was shown what little sympathy there was in the combined party on broad questions of policy, apart from the fiscal question which, as Mr. Deakin said, had disappeared from the arena. On being challenged, I think, by Mr. Mauger, Mr. Deakin repudiated, with something like scorn, the idea that he had ever had the slightest idea that on the formation of the Watson Government he would sit in the Ministerial corner. What was left ? There was left the coalition, of which, I say, Mr. Deakin was the chief architect the arrangement that was brought about between himself and the freetraders. The protectionists and the freetraders had, up to the time when the fiscal question disappeared, been separated by a strong line of demarcation. But that line of demarcation having been wiped out, there was nothing to prevent their, coalescing and working together, generally speaking, with regard to other points of the programme. Mr. Watsons party was strong, and I say it is largely dominant in. the country at this moment. This is due to the efforts and discipline of the party, and due to other causes, quite apart from questions of policy. But they are a dominant party, and they were placed, not in the position of arbiter as a third party, but in the position either of a direct opposition, or directly in power. I say that under these circumstances, Mr. . Deakin, first of all was the chief architect of the coalition. In fact, when the coalition Government was formed he joined in building it. But for Mr. Deakin, and what were at least regarded as his emphatic pledges, this coalition Government would never have come into existence. But for the assurances but for the sinking of the fiscal question by the voice of the country on Mr. Deakins initiative but for the pledges which, at any rate, we believed we had of his loyal and general support, I am quite certain that Mr. Reid would never have formed that Government. Whether Mr. Reid would, or would not, have formed the Government, I am perfectly certain that one member of the Government, namely, myself, would never have entered it. Further, as honorable senators are aware, Mr. Deakin, as leader of the Protectionist Party, contributed from that party half of the Ministry ; he was literally the leader of four members of that Government.

Those gentlemen, so to speak, were the cement of the coalition, their presence in the Government was the assurance that was stipulated for and given, that, the fiscal question having been buried, the Administration, upon the other great lines of policy on which they were agreed, would carry on under the auspices of Mr. Deakin.

I am certain that the honorable and learned member for Indi, who has served with two out of the four protectionists in the Ministry, will admit that no more trustworthy men have ever represented us in Parliament, and, certainly, no men whose adherence to that policy has been launcher. What better guarantee for its future can we obtain than their presence in the Cabinet? They are there to give effect to their pledges. They were there to give effect to the pledge that the fiscal question would not be raised, and that the Government would harmoniously proceed on the very broad lines agreed to by Mr. Deakin. When they cease to do that, it will be time for us to reconsider the situation. But I do nod anticipate that any such occasion will arise. First of all, it will be seen that the coalition was established in the way I have described. We had Mr. Deakins own basis made its foundation; we had the guarantee and the cement of the four Ministers who represented him and his party, and upon that footing, and that footing alone, the ReidMcLean Government took office I admit that there was one uncertain element at least, I admit that now, in the light of subsequent events and that was Mr. Deakin himself.

I refer to his first Ballarat speech, on the 2nd of August last year. What did he go up for?

I give credit to my honorable friends for their belief that protection may be a good thing, though I do not agree with them; protection may be all that they think it is, and freetrade may be all I think it is, but there is a greater thing than either protection or freetrade for the interests of this country, and that is an opportunity for the peaceful development of a mans avocation, instead of the perpetual strife and turmoil which are incidental to the continual tinkering with the Tariff. Tinkering is an expression of my honorable and learned friend at the head of the present Government. We cannot sit here as practical men, and not see that a difference of a small percentage of duty, which may for the moment mean an increase in connexion with a particular manufacture, would not justify the opening of the sluice gates of the whole of the Tariff. What has always been felt is, that the moment that, from, either the  freetrade or the protectionist side, you endeavour, on points of duties, to open up some line with a view to redress an inequality, or a mischief if you please,, that moment you give opportunities to others, who are as justly entitled to make their claims, to come in, and seek the same kind of redress.

Notwithstanding the previous statement that in terms it was not broken, that was equivalent to an announcement that the fiscal basis of the coalition was at an end. It is a marvellous thing to me that Mr. Deakin should not have taken that view, and stated that he considered the fiscal basis of the coalition at an end when the Tariff Commission was moved for and granted in October, 1904. If such an intimation, as was given in that Ballarat speech had been even hinted at or whispered by the honorable and learned member, either the Commission would not have been issued or the step which was now taken would have been taken there and then. We had no right to exist.

Then comes a long attack on the Prime Ministers views on Socialism.

They had taken office on the foundation of fiscal peace and loyal coalition in opposition to the Labour Party. The Ministry was founded on a belief in the assurance they had received, and on the pledges which they believed they had.

There may be an indifference to reputation, an indifference to selfrespect. But there are limits; and when the honorable and learned member for Ballarat significantly intimated that at any moment those questions which we had agreed to drop might be reopened, that he was free to bargain with the Labour Party whom he assisted us into office to oppose, our course was clear. It was not merely like taking away one vote or two votes from the Government. It was changing the whole foundation of the existence of the coalition. When that was brought about, to suggest that we were to go on from day to day, liable to humiliation and to surprises, is to suggest something that it would be impossible for any selfrespecting Government to do. It was impossible to conduct the business of the country honorably under those conditions. I am not questioning whether the honorable and learned member for Ballarat thought he was right in doing what he did. I am not inquiring into the reasons which he mav flatter himself satisfied his conscience. I am merely pointing to the facts. His Ballarat speech was recognised as a  notice to quit  by the press. Of course we pay no attention to that. But what is Mr. Deakins explanation ? He does not say that it was not a  notice to quit.  He says that it might be a notice to quit of one month,, three months, six months, or twelve months hence. We preferred to be tenants for a definite time, such as we understood we were, not to be at the beck and call of any party under those circumstances. Personally, i am as perfectly satisfied to be of use to the country, and of assistance, if I can be, in this Senate, where I am now, as where my honorable friend Senator Playford is sitting. Surely no one could hold office upon any such tenure on an intimation, not by one or by halfadozen members of their disapproval, but after an intimation by the leader of half the Government. That was quite a different thing. Honorable senators will see that the four protectionist members of the Government were placed in an extremely painful position. Naturally enough, our loyalty to them our sympathetic loyalty was a considerable element in determining our action. When the motion of noconfidence was moved in October last, the members of the protectionist corner wanted a dissolution. They stated their desire over and over again. Honorable senators will find it in the pages of last sessions Hansard.Mr. Mauger, the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, when Mr. Deakin said he was quite aware of the fact that the Tariff was working injustices in some particulars when he advocated fiscal peace, and that if there were new facts the thing would have to be considered again at another election Mr. Mauger said very emphatically, Let it come at once. Mr. Isaacs on another occasion was similarly emphatic a,s to the need then for a dissolution. Looking at the general uncertainty which existed in the arena of politics, every one recognised that there were two alternatives dissolution and appeal to the country to settle things somehow or other, or coalition. First coalition was tried. We came to Parliament, and believed that the coalition rested upon a good foundation. That having failed, the 0111\ course was to tell Parliament that it had failed, and that in our belief the alternative was to appeal to the country. Senator Playford said yesterday that the late Government did not bring down the usual GovernorGenerals speech containing a list of measures. The usual GovernorGenerals speech was brought down, and it contained what we believed to be the only piece of public business which it was imperative to settle that is the Redistribution of Seats Bill. We believed and through the GovernorGeneral we invited Parliament to believe that it was necessary to transact that particular piece of business with a view to an early dissolution. Of course a dissolution  is not a pleasant thing to members of Parliament : but that was the course which we believed to be the only possible one for the best interests of good government under the circumstances. We believed that it was the only way to reduce the state, of chaos into which parties and programmes had, got into something like order. How did the Ballarat speech come to be made? There was a parliamentary visit to Western Australia. Mr. Reid went over. I do not know whether it was at the invitation of the right honorable member for Swan or not.

"0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","SYMON, Josiah","K7V","N/A","N/A","N/A","208","Naturally, I am very fully informed on the matter ; perhaps no one is so familiar with the facts as myself. It may be necessary to say a good deal and I am disposed to sa.y a good deal at some other time on this matter. At present, in the absence of information and documents, I believe it to be in the interests of the tribunal itself to abstain from1 discussing! these particular aspects. There are other aspects which I hope will be the subject of specific treatment. One is presented in the question whether the Court is to determine absolutely without reference to the Executive, or, indeed, Parliament, where.. and when it shall sit whether, as at present, it is to sit at uncertain times in uncertain places and for uncertain business, and expenditure incurred at the will of the Court without control, or whether the sittings are to be specifically prescribed and a proper clear footing established. There is the question whether, as at present, Melbourne, which is the seat of the Court by law, is to be practically ignored in that character. But those questions will be better determined, and better discussed under a Bill which months ago I intimated it was my intention, had I remained in the Government, to introduce, and which I hope the present Government may bring forward. If not I shall take an opportunity of doing so. I may say, quite frankly that I do not think it would be in the interest of the country or of the tribunal itself that matters should be left in the present uncertain position. But there is another matter which has been alluded to, namely, the travelling allowances. On that question, seeing that the Orders in Council have been made public already, I have a word to say. When I took office last year there was no limit whatever to the travelling allowances. Whatever accounts the associates presented, certified by the Justices, were paid without question.  Mr. Watsons Government interfered in several of these matters. I do not wish to go into details now, as there will be another opportunity to do so. But on this particular matter, Mr. Watsons Government sought to put a limit upon the daily allowances, and they took steps to that end, but up to the time we assumed office nothing was done. Their effort came as a legacy to me. I did not open the matter up. It was a proper thing to do, but I did not open it up. On The Estimates, as honorable senators will recollect, I reduced the amount put down for travelling allowances by about £700 to £2,000, although I had not then had an opportunity of going into the matter in detail. When the item came up for discussion here, some honorable senators called attention, to it, and took exception to the amount. Eventually the item was passed, and one honorable senator, I remember, said, Why, that amounts to £40 a week, which is a very great deal. But I did not know then that the travelling expenses for November came to something more like £110 per week. I promised the Senate, as it was my duty to do, to exercise supervision, and investigate these matters in detail. It is not a pleasant thing, it is rather a hard and thankless task, to economize. It was the last thing in the world that I personally would have taken up, except as a matter of public duty. In fact, it is very much easier to spend £1,000 than to save one shilling. We. know that if these things are allowed to go on they not merely feed expenditure, but are apt to feed the spirit of expenditure. I found on investigation that the total expenditure on travelling allowances to the 31st December last these are facts in public possession amounted to £3,294 iis. 1 id. for twelve working months, or for fifteen calender months, three of which were occupied by vacation. I then fixed a maximum. The Watson Government had proposed a maximum, and I fixed a maximum of three guineas per day, including the associate. A fixed daily rate was then requested it is a matter of history and the Government then, upon my recommendation, fixed two guineas per day for the travelling allowances of each of the Justices. That I thought, and still think, ample. We were then asked to undo this, and tol go back to the old method1 of allowing actual expenses up to £4 per day that is, for £1 a day more for each Justice with the associate. The Government adhered to the two guineas proposal as most liberal, and the Orders in Council, which have been published, were passed. That so far as I know is the position in which, unless it has been altered since the present Government took office, the matter now stands. There is a Supreme Court in Canada identical in scope and in station with the High Court of Australia. That Supreme Court was constituted, I think, in the year 1876. It consists of a Chief Justice and five Justices. Those Justices were originally Justices of the Court of Exchequer, because no additional Judges were appointed for what was called the Exchequer Court, which was merely a Court to transact the business in original jurisdiction, and the business in original jurisdiction was transacted until recently, when a separate Exchequer Judge was appointed, by the Justices of the Supreme Court, just as it is done now by the Justices of our High Court. The Supreme Court of Canada, in its appellate jurisdiction, is a great appellate tribunal, which in common with every other Court of the same kind throughout the British Dominions, holds its sittings in one place Ottawa. It is not a perambulatory Court. It sits at Ottawa, and what is more, the Judges of the Court are compelled by the statute under which the Court is established to reside in Ottawa, or within five miles of that city. So that that Court, as an appellate Court, does not travel at all. But each individual Judge did travel, and the Judge of the Exchequer Court travels now, 10 transact original jurisdiction. Only within the last day or two I have obtained information on this point from an authoritative source in Canada. The Judges of the Supreme Court in Canada, acting as Exchequer Judges, and travelling for original jurisdiction, got a travelling allowance of six dollars per day each, which is about 25s. I have not been in Canada for some twentyfive years, but I was under the impression that hotel, travelling, and living expenses were not, as a rule, less in Canada than they are in Australia. My belief is that they are perhaps more. ","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech/interjection[124]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have mentioned these facts to the Senate, and I wish only to add that my position in regard to economy on this question is not new. It is over twenty years now since I first became a strong advocate of Federation in the House of Assembly in South Australia, as Senator Playford probably remembers. I have never ceased to hold that it is desirable that there should be a strong, dignified Supreme Federal Court. I looked to the establishment of a Court which would fill the place and discharge the functions which have been filled and discharged by that exalted tribunal iv the United States of America, which Chief Justice Marshal, and other great, but simpleminded men, have made illustrious. When you go into the Supreme Court of the United States, as I have done, you feel that you are in the presence of a very great tribunal, which is doing justice, and, if I may use the expression, loving righteousness, clothed with the dignity of a great simplicity.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","SYMON, Josiah","K7V","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","So that, before the Bill was passed, and. when its fate was more or less, perhaps,, in doubt, I took exactly the view which I have held all along. If I may repeat what I said before, although I am no Republican very far from it I am a believer in, simplicity and economy, and I do not entertain the idea that you can add to the strength or wisdom of the judgments of a great Court by unnecessary expenditure. There is only one other word which has been referred to, and that is the use of the word concession in connexion with these Orders in Council. The rule of computation for travelling expenses that was laid down by the Order in Council, is that travelling expenses must compute from the sitting of the Court. It is the Court that travels, not the individual Judge. It is the Court that goes about, whether in the person of a Judge or not, to administer justice, and that is the basis of computation. We were asked, however, to give travelling allowance for sittings in Melbourne. We agreed to make that exception. The Order in Council therefore went on to provide that whilst sittings were held in Sydney, and so on, the concession of Melbourne expenses should be made to such of the Justices as lived1 in Sydney. That merely meant a concession not in the sense of favour, or anything of that kind, but in the sense of an exception to the rule, in respect of the expenses during a state of things of which, personally, and from my view of the situation, I do not approve, but which does exist, and which was met in that broad way. Having mentioned these facts, I leave the matter for the present. I do not propose to say more about the items of policy, except the reference to the redistribution. The statement which was read by. ray honorable friend, and which is now in print does not correctly represent, it seems to me, the situation. The introduction of a Bill is really a policy of delay,, which will retain for Victoria, if she is not entitled to it, an additional member, and which, if she is entitled to it, will take away one from New South Wales. My view of the law is quite unaffected by the proposed Bill.. In my opinion, the only question is with regard to the Commonwealth statistics. I am not going to trouble honorable senators at this stage by referring to the matter in detail , because we shall have another opportunity. Ido not think it is competent for Parliament to legislate with regard to the  whenever necessary, in section 24 of the Constitution, but it is competent for Parliament to legislate with regard to the basis on which the quota shall be ascertained. As the law stands now, this was the position which the late Government had to face, and which the present Government have to face. A condition of things exists with regard to the constituencies, at least in New South Wales I am not sure as to Victoria which, in the estimation of many persons, is a scandal, and redistribution is emphatically demanded. Last year the Government pledged themselves to redistribution, and my belief was that it was with the assent of the House. That redistribution has to be carried out under the Electoral Act, and you need to have a Commissioner in each State to divide the State into divisions. The first question he will ask you is,  How many divisions are there to be? You have to tell him how many, and if, staring you in the face, you have statistics which, assuming, for the present, that they are the best in the world, showed that Victoria is entitled to only twentytwo members, and that New South Wales is entitled to one more member than she has, surely your duty is to tell the Commissioner the truth, and say that he is to divide Victoria into twentytwo districts. But when he has made his division, and his distribution comes before Parliament, it is not correct to suggest, as the printed statement of Ministerial policy suggests, that this was proposed to be done by the Government as an Executive act.

My view on that point is, whether right or wrong, as plain and as simple as can be. It is said by the present AttorneyGeneral that the term means statistics collected by officers of the Commonwealth, that you cannot have Federal statistics unless they are collected by a Commonwealth Statistical Department, by, it may be, Commonwealth police, or a host of other agents who are sent over the country, as Commonwealth officers, to make the collection. I do not take that view at all. A man in the street is as good an interpreter of this phrase as the best lawyer who ever was discovered.
