The measure does not contain any important principles. It is largely like the one we dealt with yesterday, its object being to fill up gaps which have been discovered. The most important thing it deals with is fixing the application of the Army Act. Under section 55 of the principal Act, when Defence Forces of the Commonwealth are called out for active service, the Army Act applies, but the Act is somewhat vague. It is desired to make the Act more definite, to show that it applies within or without the limits of the Commonweal tli, and an amendment is submitted for that purpose. At the beginning of this session we passed an amending Defence Bill, which was intended to legalize the raising of Expeditionary Forces. As honorable senators are aware, on the outbreak of war this Government took the necessary action to raise Expeditionary Forces. There was really no complete authority in the Defence Act for that purpose, and the Bill then brought in was to legalize the action, but, unfortunately, it was not dated back to the commencement of the war, and, therefore, it only had effect from the date of its being assented to, which, of course, was subsequent to the raising of the Expeditionary Force sent to New Guinea. It is desirable that we should bring these actions of the previous Government within the scope of the law. I may say that certain action in connexion with the first Expeditionary Force, although it has been disbanded, has become necessary; and in order to make quite sure that we can take that action under the Defence Act, it is essential that we should date the amending Bill back to the 1st August. Therefore an amendment is brought forward in this measure.","Second Reading","DEFENCE BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","PEARCE, George","K0F","N/A","N/A","N/A","2582","Certain action was taken as soon as it became known that the position was strained, Snd that war was likely to be declared; it was thought best to make sure. Again, in raising permanent forces, there are restrictions as to the kind of forces which can be raised. It has become necessary that we should have a survey branch associated with the Defence Department. There are certain portions of the Commonwealth, notably near defended ports, where it becomes essential for defence purposes that there should be a vary minute survey of the land, and that survey has been going on for some time. But there had to be an authority in the Defence Act to authorize the appointment of a survey corps, and therefore we now ask for an amendment to be made. In connexion with these surveys, the surveyors have to enter upon private lands and put marks there in order to determine the contour of the country. At present there is nothing to safeguard the Department if any of the marks are removed or tampered with, and therefore it is necessary that we should have power to protect them. Of course, if any damage is done to land, the owner is entitled to compsnsation, and provision is made by which compensation can be recovered. That provision is made in the principal Act, but it is necessary that the survey parties should have the power to put up marks on private land in order to carry out their work. The Bill contains a clause of a rather important character, dealing with the allocation of money to the dependents of soldiers in the Expeditionary Forces. On this matter the Department has come in for a considerable amount of criticism. But in very many cases the delay in the payment has on investigation been discovered to be due to the fact that some married men gave to their wives an undertaking in some cases a letter that they would allocate a certain amount of their money to them, but they signed the attestation form as single men, and did not fill out an allocation order after the troops had left Australia.  Honorable senators will see that allocation orders would not come into effect until after the troops had left Australia. A soldier is paid directly until he leaves the Commonwealth. The position in regard to these men would not be discovered until some little time after the troops had left. Very frequently the first information the Department received was by means of a letter from a member of Parliament complaining that some woman had not received any payment, or of a letter in the press, complaining that a woman had not received the amount allotted to her. On investigation it was found in very many cases that no allocation order had been left by the soldier, and in some cases that the soldier had signed as a single man. Where the woman was able to establish that she was married to the soldier or to produce a letter and this applied in some cases to other than married women and we could compare the signature of the man with the signature on the attestation form, and satisfy ourselves that it was a genuine case this occurred in the case of illegitimate children where the man had promised the woman that certain payments would be made, and given an undertaking that he would issue an allocation order the Department, acting upon that information, and without any authority from the man, has allocated money, and I think honorable senators will agree that it is the right thing to do. We want legal authority for that action. There are many cases where, unless that authority is given, it is quite on the cards that if these soldiers come back the Defence Department may be held liable to pay them the full amount of the money so allocated, because we have acted without authority from the soldier concerned in what we have done. It is only right that the persons whom these soldiers have left behind, and who were dependent upon them, should receive a certain amount of their pay. We are, under this Bill, asking that where no allocation order has been made, and the Minister is satisfied upon proof submitted that an allocation order should have been made, we may allocate a certain sum. In order to legalize what has already been done in this way, it is provided that this clause shall operate as from the 1st August.","Second Reading","DEFENCE BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Another matter with which the Bill deals, and which I admit requires some con sideratiou, is the provision sought to be made where a citizen soldier is discharged by an employer because he has absented himself in order to attend to his military duties. Under the principal Act, an employer is liable to a fine if he discharges an employe because he has absented himself from his service for the purpose of carrying out military duties, such as attendance at camp, or at a drill or parade properly called. It is provided further that the onus of proof that the citizen, soldier has. not been discharged for this reason lies upon the employer. The opinion was expressed at the time this section was passed that it would be found to be inoperative, but I can assure honorable senators that I do not know of a single case of a prosecution under the section in which we have not succeeded in having the employer fined. Of course, every case reported is sent on to the Crown Law authorities to say whether a prosecution would be likely to be successful. An important point has arisen for consideration. The citizen soldier discharged for having attended his military duties suffers the loss of his employment, and it is no recompense to him that his employer should be fined. He loses his employment and his wages, and may for some time be out of work. We consider that in such a case the Minister should have power to direct that the whole or any portion of the fine imposed upon an employer under the section should be paid to the soldier to recompense him for the loss of his employment. These cases are Vied before stipendiary magistrates, and when such Courts find that a soldier has been discharged from his employment by reason of the fact that he has absented himself for the purpose of carrying out duties which he is compelled by law to perform, we think it is not unreasonable that the Minister should have power to say, if a fine is recorded against the employer,  This man lost three weeks wages, and I award him so much of the fine imposed upon his employer as amounts to three weeks wages.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","PEARCE, George","K0F","N/A","N/A","N/A","2584","The employer in such a case may be fined up to £100 under the section. The highest fine I know to have been recorded was £50, and usually the fine imposed has been £25. The practical operation of the section at present is that both employer and employe are punished. The employer is fined for discharging his employe, and the employe is penalized by the loss of his employment for faithfully carrying out his military duties. We do not think that that should be so. Where it is proved that a man has been discharged from his employment because of his attendance in the performance of his military duties, he certainly should not suffer. It is generally regarded as a vicious principle that a private person should benefit pecuniarily as the result of the prosecution of another person by the Government. Lawmakers generally set their faces against provisions having that effect, because it is said that they have a tendency to encourage bogus prosecutions and tha getting up of faked cases. But in cases arising under this section, the military authorities first satisfy themselves that there is a prima facie case. The papers are then sent on to the Crown Law officers, who go into them, and recommend whether a prosecution should follow or not. I do not know whether honorable senators will consider an adjournment of the debate on the second reading of this Bill necessary. I spoke to the Leader of the Opposition on the subject; he had a copy of the Bill, and he told me he did not see that there was anything in the Bill that necessitated delay in passing it. If honorable senators are prepared too go on with the consideration of the Bill now, I shall be pleased ; but if they require an adjournment of the debate, I shall raise no objection.

It rests with the Senate to say whether the measure shall be proceeded with now, or the debate adjourned. The third reading will have to stand over till Wednesday in any case.","Second Reading","DEFENCE BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I saw the Bill for the first time this morning, when I received it with my papers. I have listened carefully to what the Minister said in moving the second reading, and so far as I have been able to look through the Bill in conjunction with the Defence Act 190314, there appears to be nothing in it demanding a lengthy consideration by the Senate. There is one clause, the purport of which I have not quite grasped. It refers to section 7 of a Defence Act we passed this session, and makes that section operative as from the first day of August last. As the session is still continuing, the Acts passed during the session have not yet been bound, but a loose copy of the Act referred to is obtainable. The Defence Act 190314 is the Defence Act as originally introduced, and amended up to date, and it requires some little search to ascertain how section 7 of the Act of this session affects that Act. It would seem that the clauses of this Bill are really machinery provisions found to be necessary to perfect, strengthen, and tighten the sections of the existing Defence Act. We are now actually engaged in war, and the provisions affected by these proposed amendments were drafted at a time when war was not immediately contemplated. I direct attention to the last matter to which the Minister referred, namely, the appropriation of penalties which may be imposed upon persons who prevent their employes from rendering military service. There is much to be said for the proposal to allow an employe discharged for attending his military duties to receive a portion of the penalty imposed in such a case upon his employer. I should like to suggest that when we come to deal with the clause referred to it would be well to consider whether the appropriation of the penalty or any portion of it, should rest with the Minister or with the Court which imposes the penalty. At first blush I am inclined to think that the Court is the better authority for determining the matter. If it rested with the Court to appropriate the penalty, or any portion of it, for the benefit of the employe prevented from rendering service, the Court would be able to take that fact and all facts into consideration when imposing the penalty. I make the suggestion in no spirit of hostility to the present or any other Minister of Defence, but I should like honorable senators to seriously consider whether the Court imposing the penalty would not be the better authority to determine the matter.

No one will object to give the fullest powers necessary for the proper carrying out of all defence operations. I am pleased to hear that the Government has taken action to compel members of the Expeditionary Forces who have gone abroad to make some provision for those whom they have left behind and who were dependent upon them. I hope that the appropriation of the wages of members of the Expeditionary Forces will not be confined to the rank and file.

I am quite certain thai every honorable senator will sympathize with the case which has been brought under our notice by Senator de Largie. It is a gross scandal that a member of our Expeditionary Forces should be able to do what is alleged to have been done by Major Mills. But I think we should only be raising false hopes if we imagined for a moment that that case would be covered by clause 6 of this Bill. The Minister, by way of interjection, while Senator de Largie was speaking, made his position in this matter abundantly clear. He has exercised his undoubted powers in cases in which men who have gone to the front have left no allocation orders at all. But in cases in which men who have enlisted have expressly directed that their wages shall be paid to certain individuals, I do not think there is any law which can empower the Minister to ignore such direction. It may be true that Major Mills has practically deserted his wife and three children. It may be as has been affirmed by Senator de Largie that he lias ordered his wages to be paid to some relative other than his wife. But the Minister has no authority to nullify that order and direct that the money due to Major Mills shall be paid to the woman who is declared to be his wife for her maintenance and that of her children. To assume that this Bill contains provision under which such an injustice can be remedied would be only to raise false hopes.

I intend to offer no opposition to it, but it affords me an opportunity of making a few remarks upon clause 6. I suppose that when a man gets a fixed idea in his mind he can scarcely resist ventilating it upon, every conceivable occasion. But, notwithstanding that I may be charged with entertaining a fixed idea in regard to military service, I feel that I would be lacking in my duty if I did not say something upon the question of enlisting married men. When our first Expeditionary Force was being recruited, I took exception to the manner in which married men were being taken from the ranks of our Australian population. Some time ago I asked the Minister of Defence if he could inform me what was the percentage of married men who had enlisted as part of the first Expeditionary Force.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","BAKHAP, Thomas","K18","N/A","N/A","N/A","2589","That is quite true. At that time I formed the opinion that many men had enlisted as single men when, as a matter of fact, they were married; and the sequel has demonstrated that this was so. The discussion has also proved how injudicious it was to enlist so many married men as members of our overseas Forces. We are bound to have some married men in our Forces, and I do not think that the principle of not using married men at all, especially wb«n they possess sound military knowledge, should be insisted upon. I know that many officers with family responsibilities were in a position to make satisfactory provision for those left behind, irrespective of the fact that they were in receipt of military pay. Notwithstanding that I have no English blood in my veins I have some British blood I am as strongly desirous of British supremacy as any other member of this National Legislature. I confess, however, that I have systematically dissuaded married men from enlisting; and, on the other hand, I have done all I possibly could to encourage single men to become members of the Expeditionary Forces in the service of their country. Apart from the fact that an unsatisfactory position is sometimes likely to arise in the allocation of pay for the dependants of married men remaining in Australia, it is impolitic that we should have such a large number of married men in the Forces, because of the probability that this course is likely, sometimes, to bring about an undesirable state of affairs in respect to the greatest of all social relationships. I simply wish to stress the arguments which I used at considerable length two or three days ago, in order that honorable senators will see the undesirability, from a social and economic standpoint, of enlisting married men for overseas service. Of course, if Australia is attacked at any time it will then be the obligation of every man, whether married or single, to do his best in that sphere which might be allocated to him under military law. I pointed out a few days ago that we have 500,000 single men of military age in the Commonwealth, and, in view of that fact, I hope that some step will be taken to check what I regard as a bad policy, the systematic enlistment of married men, more particularly as we are enlisting our Forces rather leisurely, and are preparing them still more leisurely, for the front.

I have no objection to Senator Keatings suggestion to invest the Court with power to allocate money, but 1 can certainly see very great possibilities of the Minister being put into a difficult position. The case brought forward by Senator de Largie is entirely different to the position I outlined when moving the second reading of the Bill. I was dealing there with the case of soldiers who had made no allocation of their money ; and in the case quoted by Senator de Largie it has been shown that the officer had made an allocation. It has to be remembered that the pay of the officer or of a soldier is his own property. It belongs to him by right of his contract with the Defence authorities.

In this particular case, it is not desirable that we should go into that part of it which concerns only the man and his wife. I understand there has been a dispute of longstanding between the two, as the result of which they are not living togetherThe officer, in allocating his pay to his sister, made the further statement that it was to be paid to his sister on behalf of his wife and children, so that they should be provided for. Now, it appears that Senator de Largie says that we should set aside that order and that I, as Minister of Defence, should be the judge, and take upon myself the responsibility of allocating the money to his wife. If I did that in this case, I would have to do it in other similar cases, and therefore I would constitute myself a judge of matrimonial causes.

It seems to me that the debate on the Ministerial statement has been fairly well threshed out, but I desire to offer a few remarks to the Senate. First, let me congratulate the Prime Minister and his colleagues upon the very capable manner in which they have handled the affairs of Australia in the most unparalleled stress which, so far, we have had to face. According to their own statement, and I think according to the opinion of a majority of the people of Australia, if not of all, the Government have done extremely well in securing the financial stability of the Commonwealth in undoubtedly a most serious situation. Therefore, I think that we may fairly congratulate Ministers upon having spared no pains and performed every duty requisite to the well being of this growing country. The magnitude of the work which has been performed by the Government, and the efforts which have been put forward by Australians generally, have been fully recognised throughout the civilized world. Of course, we must make an exception of Senator Bakhap. I admit that he had a sort of complaint to level against Australia in regard to what might be called the general apathy she had shown towards the position as it now presents itself in the Empire. Were I to say that he actually complained, the probability is that he would deny my statement, and plead that he did not complain of Australias failure to do something, but of Australia not having done just enough. That is, I think, the position he would take up. But the distinction between the two positions is so fine that I am inclined to regard his statement as, in a morbid way, a complaint against all concerned. I propose to quote an opinion expressed some time ago by an authority that I am sure  Senator Bakhap will not repudiate. I refer to the London Times. It takes quite a different view of what Australia has done, and is doing, from that which was expressed by my honorable friend. According to the Sydney Daily Telegraph of 20th April, the London Times, in a leading article, on the 6th March, said","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENT : PAPER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is a record which must appeal vividly to all who have sufficient imagination to perceive what lies behind an imposing column of figures and a varied list of commodities. The three thousand odd bales and cases of hospital stores and clothing represent between 40 and 50 consignments sent at various times and from many parts of the Australian Commonwealth. Thousands of blankets and pillows, bandages, splints, crutches, and even safety pins show that not only a spirit of unstinting generosity, but an immense amount of careful thought, has gone to the choice of the gifts.  But Australia has not stopped there. Her richest industries have contributed each in its kind. A thousand carcases of frozen mutton, 1,079 crates of rabbits, 10 tons of butter, groceries, wines have been shipped to the stores department of the Red Cross, in order that, after the direct needs of the hospitals have been supplied, those goods not required for consumption in the hospitals might be sold to swell the funds of the joint committee. Other countries have contributed similarly according to their means. Egypt sends cigarettes; South Africa offers grapes as well as clothing. The isles also have brought gifts. Guava jelly from Montserrat, honey and walkingsticks from Jamaica, oranges from Dominica, Malta, and Trinidad they pile up a wonderful miscellany of good and useful things. We may well take pride in the spirit of helpfulness which has produced so remarkable a result, and, while our gratitude goes out to all who have taken part in it, we would pay a special tribute of admiration to the signal effort of Australia.","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENT : PAPER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech/quote/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

I have now to refer to the matter which was really underlying Senator Bakhaps complaint. He has told us that he believes in the principle of conscription. The honorable senator would conscribe every single man in Australia physically fit to perform military duty. I hope that there is no other man in Australia who favours the adoption of such a course. I believe that there is sufficient manhood and patriotism in the British race to make it unnecessary ever to adopt so barbarous a principle. We are in Australia providing by law for the compulsory military training of our youth. We are teaching them how to handle a gun and something of the art of warfare. When we have done that I have no fear that the British race in Australia has so deteriorated that our people will be found unwilling to face any foe in the defence of a righteous and legitimate cause. It is so that the whole of the people of the British Empire regard the cause for which they are fighting today, and in the defence of which they are prepared to expend not merely their last shilling, but their last man. We have been informed by the statement read by the Minister of Defence that over 70,000 of the manhood of Australia have been sent to the front, or are being prepared to go to the front. That is no inconsiderable proportion of our small population, and I have no doubt that the number can be brought up to 100,000 if necessary in the near future. I hope that the war will not continue much longer, but if it does, I. am satisfied that our trainees will show that they have the pluck and the patriotism to volunteer their services iD the defence of the Empire. Australia has done well up to the present, and has in fact done all that she could do. I have no doubt that she will continue to do equally well until the war is at an end. I should like to refer to what Senator Bakhap had to say as to the wages paid to our soldiers. He has told us that we might do better than we have done if we paid our ment ls. 2d. per day, which is the price put upon the services of the British soldier. The British soldier is a very cheap man.","N/A","MINISTERIAL STATEMENT : PAPER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It should show us the absolute necessity of utilizing every resource we have to make Australia a selfdependent country. When the Tariff comes before us for consideration, I shall on every occasion endeavour to have everything which is not produced in Australia placed upon the absolutely free list; but on the other hand I shall do all that lays in my power to impose as nearly as possible prohibitive duties upon everything that can be made in Australia. The war has shown us that we are in about the most dependent position that a country could be in. Where should we have been a few days after the war broke out if we were still paying a subsidy to the Old Country for the naval and military protection of the Commonwealth ?

It will thus be seen that his original statement deals with quite another matter. Senator Long did not inform me of his intention to raise this question today, and consequently in the statement which I am about to make I shall have to rely on the memory of those who have been dealing with it. When I sent my secretary to the Library for the papers relating to this matter, I found that they had been taken out of the Library. I was under the impression that nobody was allowed to take papers from the Library unless for the purpose of bringing them into either branch of this Parliament. But the papers to which I refer were not in the Library last night or this morning. I sent my secretary for them, not because Senator Long had told me that he intended to bring this matter before the Senate, but because of his threat to make my Ministerial position uncomfortable. Now the fact is that, owing to some instructional officers having been attached to the Australian Expeditionary Forces, the Department has had to adopt the system of getting quite a number of militia officers to temporarily fill their positions. Lieutenant Payne was in the militia, and consequently was not a permanent officer. The first question which arose was as to the appointment of a temporary officer on the Administrative and Instructional Staff. At that time the question of the command of the camp at Claremont, near Hobart, had not been raised. The authorities wished to strengthen the Administrative and Instructional Staff by filling up the gaps which had been created by the departure for the front of a number of permanent officers. The Commandant was asked whether he would recommend Captain Payne. He said that he would not recommend him as a captain temporarily on the Administrative and Instructional Staff unless Lieutenants Tackaberry and Davis who. were not temporary, but permanent officers were promoted to the position of captains. Honorable senators are well aware that the militia officers take rank in their regiments. The permanent officers are on a list by themselves, which is entirely distinct from the militia regiments. The promotion of permanent officers is governed by the vacancies which arise from time to time on the permanent officers list.

When he had fulfilled these conditions he was entitled to promotion. His promotion did not hinge on that of anybody else. If he w«re promoted nobody on the permanent list would be injured thereby. His promotion did not give him any prior claim over them, or in any way interfere with their rights. The Commandant took up the position that Payne should not be placed on the Instructional Staff unless these other permanent officers were promoted to the rank of captain.

The AdjutantGeneral, who deals with such questions, refused to do as the Commandant recommended. He refused to promote these two members of the Permanent Forces as a condition precedent to appointing Payne to the Administrative and Instructional Staff. But Payne had passed his examination for the rank of captain. He was eligible for appointment in that capacity, and when he was asked to accept the appointment with a lieutenants pay and rank, he refused to do so. He said in effect,  I have passed my examination. I have been promoted to the rank of captain, and if you require my services I have a right to the pay which is due to ray rank. Then he was appointed to the Administrative and Instructional Staff to fill a position until the war has ended, or until the permanent officer returns. He was appointed with the pay of his rank. Lieutenants Tackaberry and Davis, two permanent officers, knowing what the Commandant had stipulated, protested against Paynes appointment to the Administrative and Instructional Staff with the rank of captain. Their appeal came before the member of the Military Board whose province it is to deal with such appeals. The AdjutantGeneral promptly ruled out their appeal, as he was perfectly entitled to do. As he pointed out, Paynes appointment is a temporary one, whereas the other two officers are permanent officers, whose positions are not affected by his appointment in the slightest degree.

Captain Payne is now connected with the Instructional Staff, and when an officer was wanted to take charge of the Claremont Camp in Tasmania, the Commandant himself then recommended Captain Payne for the position. The file will show this. Senator Long said that we put Captain Payne in charge of the camp against the recommendation of the Commandant, but he is confusing two things. The Commandant did recommend the appointment as I have said, but that had reference to his appointment on the Instructional Staff, and when he was there it was on the recommendation of the Commandant himself that Captain Payne was put in charge of the camp. Therefore, Senator Longs statement is wrong. It is not splitting straws to separate these two questions, because they are entirely distinct one from the other. One was Captain Paynes appointment to the Instructional Staff, in which the AdjutantGeneral did not accept the condition laid down by the Commandant. The Commandant said that Captain Payne ought to be appointed, subject to certain conditions concerning the two other officers. In Captain Paynes appointment to the Claremont camp, there was no difference between the Commandant and members of the Military Board.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","PEARCE, George","K0F","N/A","N/A","N/A","2599","Yes. Senator Long seems to be under the impression that something was done to hurry up Captain Paynes promotion in order to get this position for him, but that was not so. He was due for promotion in the ordinary course of events; it was his right under the regulations, and we should have had to strain the regulations to prevent him getting his promotion. There was a vacancy, he had qualified, he was the senior officer in his regiment, and was due for promotion. Now I only want to say a few more words, in conclusion, concerning this matter. There is room for a genuine difference of opinion as to whether it is wise to do what we are doing, moving militia officers up to fill these vacancies, or whether it is best to move up the permanent officers. There are objections to both courses, but I do say that, because there is room for a difference of opinion, there should be no imputation about favoritism, or anything of that kind. I think the results are showing that the course we adopted is working very well. Because Senator Long cannot see eye to eye with me on this matter, the Government should not be charged with favoritism, or anything of that character. It is not worthy of the honorable senator to make such a charge. Looking at the facts as I have given them and I have every reason to believe that they are correct I think Senator Long would have been better advised not to have brought the matter before the Senate.
