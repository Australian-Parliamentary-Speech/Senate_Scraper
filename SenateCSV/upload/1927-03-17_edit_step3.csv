It appears to me, from some observations that have been made during the debate on this bill, that it. would be as well to say a few words as to the reasons which have actuated the Government in persevering with it. Although repetition of the history concerning the origin of section 87 of the Constitution may be a little tiresome, I venture to think that remarks which I propose to make upon it will be, at least, instructive. The provisions of section 87 were  a bone of contention with the framers of the Constitution. A perusal of the debates leave.? one in no doubt whatever as to the manner in which they regarded this problem. Unquestionably, they regarded as absolutely unsound the principle embodied in section 87, which we desire now to abolish by the passage of this measure. To the late Sir Edward Braddon, the great Tasmanian statesman, is attributed the parentage of section 87 ; but, having been intimately associated with some of those who assisted to bring this great Constitution into being, it is within my personal knowledge that, it was the fertile brain of the late Sir Frederick Holder that was responsible for the provision to get over what was regarded as an insuperable difficulty in connexion with the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. In subsequent references to that principle, he seemed to be displeased that it had been received so coldly by the delegates at the various conferences. I notice the following comments concerning those financial provisions, in Quick and Garrans Annotated Constitution:  The basis of distribution provided by the Adelaide sliding scale ha? not found favour. As Mr. Holder said, it v. as a child of misfortune misfortune in that it was laid before the convention and accepted (in Adelaide) on the faith of those who recommended it; never discussed, never explained thrown into a cold world without anybody to be the father to it. It may have been a child of misfortune, but I think it could be more accurately described as the child of expediency out of ambition. Without some such provision it is doubtful if .federation would have been consummated, and the people would have been compelled to continue under the various d inabilities that existed regarding the larger questions with which this Parliament concerns itself.","N/A","STATES GRANTS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is within my own personal knowledge that one of the root objections to the Braddon section was that it was an application of a vicious and unsound principle. We have been told that this is merely an academic question that has no real, practical significance, and that the Government ought to drop it.

The Government does not desire to tie the hands of either this Parliament or the Parliaments of the States. A perusal of the bill will show to honorable senators that the quantum will not be varied in any way until June, 1928, but that, on the contrary, the per capita payments will continue to be made in another form.

It is manifest that a change was considered desirable in 1910, and again in 1919, when the Right Honorable Mr. Watt, as Treasurer in an administration led by Mr. Hughes of which, I believe, my friend Senator Greene was a distinguished member submitted his proposals to the States. Mr. Watt, in 1919, and the Prime Minister (Mr. Bruce), in 1923 when the matter approached very close to a settlement and again in 1926, did not call together the Premiers of the States to discuss a matter of merely academic interest.

In 1926, a further conference was held. It has been said that the Prime Minister was brusque in his declaration on the eve of that conference, that he endeavoured to bludgeon the States, and really refused to meet them in conference. The real position is that the State Treasurers, driven from one argument to another, in the dying hours of that conference, raised the plea of moral rights. That waa done at the instance of Mr. McKell, the Minister for Justice in New South Wales, who was supported by an equally astute Minister from Queensland in the person of Mr. McCormack. Seeing their defences broken down, they raised the new plea. Mr. McCormack retired from the conference, hurling, as it were, the verbal brick of moral rights. The State Premiers, finding no other argument open to them, claimed the continuance of the, per capita payment as a moral right. That argument, as admitted by their friends in another place, is entirely indefensible. Until the Commonwealth Parliament takes this matter in hand and terminates the per capita payments, as is proposed in this measure, conferences will be unavailing. Where one party claims a moral right to these payments, it is futile to hold such conferences. Many Premiers conferences have been held to discuss a variety of subjects, but from most of them very little has emerged. With the exception of the 1923 conference, there has been no serious attempt on the part of the State Treasurers to settle the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. They agree with Mr. Allan, the Premier of Victoria, who, with a candour that is one of his characteristics, referred to the per capita payments as easy money. Naturally, the State Treasurers do not like the odium of imposing extra taxation; but I remind honorable senators that that responsibility . would have been theirs had the Commonwealth not embarked on this wrong principle. The Governments proposal does not mean that the Commonwealth will devour or strangle the States. To do so would be to injure our own creators a part of ourselves.

When the Prime Minister returned recently from his visit to Great Britain, he expressed his willingness to appoint a royal commission, composed of independent persons, to examine carefully the figures dealing with the proposed financial arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States. That offer, as we know, was rejected for the simple reason that the States did not wish to face the position; they desired a continuance of this  easy money  which comes from imposts levied by another Government. I say without hesitation, that the people wish the Commonwealth to get out of the field of direct taxation at the earliest possible moment. The Constitution .clearly intends that, except to meet a great emergency, the Commonwealth should not embark upon a policy of direct taxation at all. That emergency did arise, and the Commonwealth, as was its duty in order to meet its obligations, levied direct taxation, which, broadly speaking, up till then, had been the special privilege of the States. I wish it were possible for the Commonwealth to retire altogether from all avenues of direct taxation, but, since we cannot, the Prime Minister recently made a gesture to the States that he was prepared to go a certain distance along that road, on the definite understanding that the States would not be worse off than they are at present. As a matter of fact, they will be better off if this bill is adopted. The Prime Ministers offer to appoint a royal commission, composed of economic experts, to examine the figures was, with the exception of Tasmania, rejected by the States. A suggestion has been made that this vexed problem should be submitted to the people in the form of a referendum. Obviously, that is not a proper solution of the difficulty. If the representatives of the Commonwealth and the States face the position in a truly Australian spirit, rather than with the object of securing political advantage, it should be possible to arrive at an agreement satisfactory to all parties. When this bill passes, as I am confident it will, I believe that the States will quickly realize the obligation laid upon them to put their houses in order. They can rest assured that the Prime Minister will deal with them generously.

I have no doubt that what has been said will prove to be in the interests of the Commonwealth and the States. Mr. Browne, the chairman of the Taxpayers Association of South Australia, in his evidence before the South Australian commission, urged that pressure should be brought to bear on the Federal Government to get out of the arena of direct taxation. He also suggested that the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States should be settled in conference, acting on the advice of the best economic experts that could be obtained. How are wo to attain that end? This bill is brought down for that purpose. When it is carried, we should be able to make some headway in our negotiations with the States. It has been urged that the Government in seeking to pass this bill to abolish the per capita payments, and then calling a conference to discuss the financial arrangements of the Commonwealth and the States, is not acting in a sportsmanlike way. On that point I submit that experice has shown that if the provision relating to the per capita payments is not repealed, the States will continue, as heretofore, to do nothing. It has also been said that people of the States are opposed to the course mapped out by this Government. I contend that if the people knew what was going on, and if they understood the application of the vicious principle embodied in the present arrangements, they would say,  End it immediately. The one cry throughout Australia is that the Commonwealth should get out of the field of direct taxation. Whether or not that is possible will be determined by the conference to be convened after the passage of this bill. We know that, unless wo impose undue hardships upon the people, no further taxation can be levied. The Governments proposal will lead to economy in administration. It will prevent overlapping and duplication of taxation services. The States have been asked time and again to define their attitude. They have declined to do anything, except to hurl at the head of the Prime Minister this verbal brick of  a moral right  to a share of the Customs revenue. This is no academic question. It is more essential that it should be settled now than it was in 1923, and the only way to bring the controversy to a head is to pass the bill now before the Senate.

The Government desires to simplify and straighten out what is now a chaotic condition of affairs. Personal antagonisms and political animosities should not be introduced in the debate on an issue of this nature, because we are considering a problem that vitally affects the people of Australia. The electors of the States and the electors of the Commonwealth are one and the same people. Upon the Commonwealth devolves the duty, in the event of trouble arising in any particular State, of protecting it financially and otherwise. It has been said that in the passage of this measure the Government is desirous of strangling the States. Any action of that kind, I put it to honorable senators, would have a boomerang effect upon the Commonwealth. Therefore it is not likely that the Government would lightly embark upon such a course of action. The argument that the Government is endeavouring to strangle the States, or do them some great injustice, is utterly unfounded. The duty imposed upon the Commonwealth under the Constitution is to protect the States. No State could go under without the Commonwealth as a whole being affected. I ask honorable senators to dismiss that suggestion from their minds, because it is an unworthy one. The Government desires to have the opportunity of negotiating with the States. It has demonstrated that fact time and again. The States have nothing to fear. Whatever fear is felt has been engendered by gentlemen in State politics who are anxious to get this easy money without having to levy the necessary taxation. [ Extension of time granted.] Yesterday we were told that this measure would promote hostility and enmity and that the Commonwealth Government would proceed to demolish and devour the States. That is contrary to fact. The attitude of the Government throughout has been one of friendship, even of tolerance, towards the States. At the eleventh hour before the introduction of the bill in another place an effort was made to induce the States to meet the Commonwealth at the conference table and to show wherein the Commonwealths figures were wrong.

No friendlier attitude could have been taken up towards the States.

There is thus no cause for complaint on the part of the States. As has already been said, they are not concerned in the question. The only persons really concerned are the taxpayers, those who bear the burden. With the financial position of the world such as it is, it behoves us to take steps to put our own financial house in order, and see that the system of the Commonwealth levying taxation on behalf of the States and handing it over to them terminates, leaving to them the responsibility for raising their own taxation. That having been done we, perhaps, will have to come to some understanding in regard to State debts. That is a more difficult question. Unless we get the whole of the States agreeing to the Loan Council, or whatever body is formed to carry out the policy of liquidating the State debts, there will be lack of that unanimity which is necessary.

Senator McLachlau has attempted to justify this, saying that it has not been done with any intention of embarrassing honorable senators or Parliament; but the fact remains that it places in an unfair position honorable senators representing two States, who are expecting and who have been promised financial assistance. I cannot understand why the Government has persisted in the? attitude. I was glad to have an assurance from the Honorary Minister (Senator McLachlan) that even if this bill is defeated Western Australia and Tasmania will receive the special grants for which it provides. We have not had such an assurance before. As the Government has never informed the Tasmanian Government that the grant to Tasmania will be paid even if this measure is defeated, the Tasmanian people have been in a state of fear and doubt. That is a most unfair position in which to place us. Although the Premier of Tasmania informed me the other day that if this measure were defeated, and Tasmania in consequence were deprived of the special grant, those who opposed it would have to take the responsibility, I intend to vote against it, because I believe that the Government will honour its obligations no matter what the result of the division may be. The Government has now shifted its ground. When the measure was submitted last session we were told the per capita, payments would be discontinued and that the States were to be given the right to operate in the field of income taxation payable by individuals to the extent of 40 per cent., as well as take over the land tax, the amusement tax, and estate duties. Apart from the straightout abolition of the per capita payments, that was the only proposal put before us. The Government, I repeat, has shifted its ground. It says that that is only a tentative proposal, and that if the per capita payments are abolished some other alternative may be substituted. The Honorary Minister (Senator McLachlan) let the cat out of the bag this afternoon when he said that the taking oyer of the State debts was indeed a difficult proposition. Personally, I am not opposed to the abolition of the per capita payment provided a suitable alternative is substituted; but before it is discontinued I want some guarantee of permanency regarding the future financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States. I want a written bargain, sanction or bond for the State which I represent. I am not prepared to take the word of a. government or a minister as to what may be done to enable the States to carry out their duties and obligations. We are told that the responsibilities of the Commonwealth have largely increased as a result of the war. That cannot be denied; but if it be true of the Commonwealth it is equally true that the responsibilities and obligations of the States have also increased. The States have had to accept the responsibility of a great proportion of the expense of soldier settlement, which is really a Federal obligation.

The States control education, the maintenance of law and order, the police force, the development of timber and mineral resources, as well as many other functions. No agreement or financial arrangement should be made under which the States will be absolutely dependent upon the Federal Treasurer for the means whereby to carry out these functions.  It is not my intention to go into the early history of the federation, but I should like to remind honorable senators that the two principal subjects which dominated the very important discussions at the convention were finance, and the representation of the States in the Senate. In the absence of a settlement of these two subjects, federation would have been impossible. In the first place, it was considered necessary that the States should have sufficient revenue to function, and some special protection to preserve State rights and State interests. Consequently a compromise was reached whereby the Senate was constituted so that the States should have equal representation, and senators should be elected by the whole of the people in each State. These questions were unsolved at the first referendum taken in June, 1898, and which was defeated as a direct result of the imperfections of these two provisions. The Honorary Minister (Senator McLachlan) said that section 87 of the Constitution was only a tentative arrangement and the objection to it was based upon the fact that one government was spending the revenue which another raised. Such a consideration was never mentioned. The first referendum was taken in 1898, and was defeated by the vote of New South Wales owing to the arbitrary majority which the late Sir George Reid insisted should be obtained in that State before the measure could be carried. The main objection was m regard to the financial provisions. The New South Wales Parliament considered that the Braddon clause, which gave the Commonwealth only onefourth of the Customs and excise revenue, and required the balance to be handed to the States, would mean that New South Wales, which was then supposed to be a freetrade State, would have to raise too much revenue through the Customs to meet its obligations. There was no limitation on that provision when it was originally passed by the convention, and it was only after the failure of the first referendum that the limitation of 10 years was provided. Later the proposal was submitted to the people after giving New South Wales some of the spoils in the nature of the Federal Capital and the bill was carried on a simple majority as agreed to by New South Wales, when it was resubmitted in 1899. I base my objections to these financial proposals of the Federal Government on two grounds : First, that the proposal is temporary and uncertain, and secondly that insufficient provision is made for the smaller States to properly carry out their duties and obligations. There is another reason, which I shall refer to later, and which has to do with the constitutional aspect, which entails upon this Senate a very serious responsibility. If we are to base our calculations upon the proposals submitted last year, the States are to receive 40 per cent, of the income tax payable by individuals. The States will not be able to raise the same amount of money from that source as is now collected bv the Commonwealth.","N/A","STATES GRANTS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[2]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The two points I have mentioned are sufficient to justify my objections to the bill. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Needham) read a long document showing that the objections which apply in regard to income taxation apply also to land taxation. What is likely to happen when the Labour party is returned to power, as it will be some day, and will want money for its various projects? When that time arrives the honorable member for Dalley (Mr. Theodore) will probably be Prime Minister, and I think honorable senators will admit that he knows how to spend money. He will be seeking sources of revenue apart from Customs and excise duties, and will probably invade the field of direct taxation. The Government is offering a premium to extravagance. It wants complete control of revenue from Customs and excise for some future extravagant government to spend, and when it has control of this source of revenue, it will impose further direct taxation. The effect will not be to prevent extravagant expenditure upon hairbrained schemes. It will be the opposite of that. Many people, including myself, are of the opinion that the present Federal Government is not altogether guiltless of extravagance. It has an enormous surplus each year; indee(d, its difficulty is to appropriate its surpluses in a way that will defeat the object of the Constitution. For that reason the Commonwealth has indulged in many fanciful schemes. It has subsidized cotton mills, and granted bonuses on canned fruits. Most of those grants will go into the pockets of the canners, and not of those who grow the fruit.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","OGDEN, James","JZR","N/A","N/A","N/A","563","My interpretation is correct.  This question has been considered by the various State Parliaments and State Ministers. They have all condemned it. So far as I have been able to find out, the only people in favour of it are Government supporters, and another section which hopes to benefit by reduced land and income taxation. Large landholders know very well that the Legislative Councils of the several State Parliaments will protect their interests, and that State Governments will find it extremely difficult to pass land tax legislation, to make good any loss sustained through the abolition of the payments. Similarly large income tax payers having financial interests in more than one State naturally favour the Government proposals, because if they are accepted, they will be able to evade a considerable portion of taxation which at present is levied upon them. But I am chiefly concerned about the financial position of the States, and I say that under this bill it will be impossible for the Government of the smaller States to function satisfactorily. I know very well that it is a waste of breath to attempt to sway those honorable senators who favour the measure; heads have been counted already, and the numbers are up. The Government is assured of its majority. We know exactly to one head what the division lists will show. The fate of the bill has been decided outside this chamber. That is my objection to the introduction of party politics in the Senate. All legislative proposals should be decided on the floor of this chamber, and not be considered secretly in a room outside, then brought in and thrown on the table. Any discussion, in such circumstances, is a farce. I am opposing the bill because I believe it will seriously embarrass the States, and because there is no guarantee that in the future those fields of taxation, which the Government proposes to abandon, will not be reinvaded with results disastrous to the people, especially of the smaller States. I represent one of those unfortunate States, which has to come to the doorstep of the Federal Treasury pleading for assistance. Not long ago, when Tasmania made application for a grant the Treasurer told the Premier of that State that he would have to go back and impose further taxation on the people before he dare ask for further financial aid from the Commonwealth. Notwithstanding that direct taxation in Tasmania was then higher than in any other State, based upon the capacity of the people to pay it, the State Government was obliged to increase income taxation by 25 per cent., and further penalize its people in order to get a financial grant from the Commonwealth. In my State we always have to look for this assistance. It is humiliating to me to know this, because I desire the finances of every State to be on a sound basis, so that its Government may function without continually appealing to the Federal Government. We are told that we should trust the Government to do justice to the States.","N/A","STATES GRANTS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[2]/continue[23]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

During the discussion which took place on the budget I defined my attitude with regard to the principle of the per capita payments, and stated also my position concerning the Governments proposals which were then before the Senate. Quoting from the report of the Premiers Conference in 1923, I showed that the finance committee of the conference had estimated that duplication of taxation in Australia was costing not less than Â£600,000 a year, and I stated that I would go a long way to avoid this huge waste of the taxpayers money. I further stated that I would support the proposals put forward, which would eliminate some of that costly duplication if it could be shown that every State would benefit to the extent of ?50,000, as stated by the Government. Direct taxation in 192122 yielded ?22,048,483, made up as follows :  The collection of that amount of direct taxation, I remind the Senate, cost Australia ?600,000. Wherever one goes, one finds the man in the street and the man on the farm complaining about the evils of duplication in taxation. It is surprising that this public demand for its elimination is not made a feature by the daily press now that we have a chance to eliminate it.

At the expiration of that period it became necessary for Parliament, in whose hands the responsibility was placed, to make a new arrangement. A fresh defence policy was contemplated, and the Australian Navy was established. It was also considered that the Commonwealth should undertake the payment of oldage and invalid pensions. These additional responsibilities altered the whole prospect of Federal finance, and reduced very considerably the amount of revenue which could be returned to the States. As honorable senators are aware, provision was then made whereby the States were to receive 25s. per head of the population for a period of ten years, or until Parliament otherwise provided. The responsibility having been placed in the hands of this Parliament, it should be shouldered. 1 can see no reason for the submission of the question to a referendum of the people. If the time has arrived for abolishing the per capita payment, it is the duty of this Parliament to deal with the matter. A possibility which was foreseen at the time of the Federal Convention, was the war, which altered the whole financial position of the Commonwealth and .increased its liabilities tremendously. This year, the interest on our war debt amounts to no less than ?20,700,000, and we have also to provide ?7,400,000 for war pensions and ?1,120,000 for repatriation. In addition to our war liabilities, we have also to make provision this year for ?2,000,000 for road grants to the States, and ?9,000,000 for invalid and oldage pensions. The total expenditure of the. Commonwealth this year is ?53,066,000. Of this amount we receive revenue totalling ?4,000,000 from sundry sources, excluding direct and indirect taxation, leaving ?48,768,000 to be met from other sources. As our Customs and. excise duties will not yield more than ?42,000,000, if will be necessary for us to get ?6,768,000 by direct taxation. In these circumstances, it is clearly impossible for the Commonwealth Government to abandon all direct taxation.  It has been said by Senator Barwell and Senator Greene, that, by passing this bill, we shall be signing a blank cheque. I do not see it. The proposals put forward are definite enough. The Government asks Parliament to pass this bill, providing for the abolition of the per capita payments, and it proposes to call a conference at which the whole question of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States can be looked at from every angle. It is prepared to consider any method which may be suggested, and if it is thought that there is a mistake in the figures on which its calculations are based it is prepared to appoint a royal commission of independent experts to examine them. It will not limit the discussion to any particular matter the whole field of taxation may be reviewed and proposals for the establishment of a sinking fund for the liquidation of the State debts, or for the assumption by the Commonwealth of some portion of the State debts, will be considered. In fact, the Government has intimated plainly that it is willing to consider any proposal or suggestion brought forward by the States. Are we to bludgeon something through this Parliament without the approval of the States, or are we to meet them in conference and make an arrangement with them before legislation is introduced here? The subjects suggested for discussion at the proposed conference are of two classes. One class related to schemes anon as for taking over the States debts or for the establishment of a sinking fund for the liquidation of those debts. Those schemes cannot be put into operation unless they have the approval of all the States. One State standing out, could wreck such proposals. If all the States agreed to it, would honorable senators oppose a bill to carry it into effect? It is not a case of signing a blank cheque when we make it possible to set in operation a scheme which can only be adopted with the unanimous consent of all the States. The other class is a scheme which can be put into operation by this Parliament without consulting the States, ar.ci the only proposals which nave been suggested in this direction are those which were previously before Parliament. The action taken is the only step the Government can take to bring about a conference with the States at which the whole question of the financial relationship of the two authorities may be fully discussed, and the result brought before this Parliament, which has the final say. Surely that proposal is definite enough. At any rate, we know what we are doing in passing this bill. It is often said that the position of the States will not be secure if this measure becomes law. It will be much more secure than it is today, because now any Government can como forward with a proposal to wipe out the per capita payments to the States, without compensation, in order to provide it with money to embark upon some fancy scheme.","N/A","STATES GRANTS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[3]/para[12]","N/A","N/A"

Reference has been made to the real reason for the introduction of this bill. Senator Greene said that Mr. Bruxner, of the New South Wales Country party, had given the show away. I do not think we need go to that gentleman to ascertain the reason for its introduction. The Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) informed certain Sydney manufacturers a few months ago that the Government intended to abolish the per capita payment so that the public would know whom to blame for taxation and its incidence. That is the reason. Cannot any protectionist see the dominating influence exercised by the Country party in this administration? The members of that party are pledged to bring about a reduction in duties. For what purpose? To swell the Customs revenue which, towards the end of the present financial year, will amount to approximately Â£44,000,000. If this dominating influence in the Cabinet continues it is likely that we shall have further revenue duties, and thus make more money available to the Treasurer, who then will be able to satisfy the section which he represents in this Parliament that he is faithfully carrying out its promises. These members are not concerned with real protection, but are seriously concerned with the effort to obtain additional Customs revenue. When these members go to the country they will say,  Have not we made your pathway easier by reducing certain duties, by vacating the field of direct taxation and thus removing a burden from your shoulders for some time at least? They are endeavouring to shift the responsibility on to the shoulders of the States, so that they will not be associated with direct taxation to which they are opposed.  When the Government say it is extremely anxious to arrive at a permanent solution of the position with which it is confronted and which it says is difficult, I am surprised. It is not a difficult problem. This bill is mischievious, muddlesome, and meddling. The Government has muddled in this matter from beginning to end. Many unsuccessful conferences have been held, and in order to permanently solve the problem, a further conference is proposed.

In giving reasons why this bill should be passed, the Honorary Minister (Senator McLachlan) said this afternoon that, in Queensland, at least, State enterprises had been embarked upon to such an extent that the State had been involved in serious financial losses. He gave that as one of the reasons why the per capita payment would not be continued. The Government sets itself up as both judge and a jury. It is saying that the States should not receive financial assistance from the Commonwealth if they persist in launching State enterprises. There is no such thing as an individualistic state in any part of the world. In every State there are socialistic enterprises. If socialistic enterprises must be discontinued because they are unprofitable, in what way are we to deal with our postal, telegraphic and telephonic services? What is to become of our Commonwealth railway system, the Australian Commonwealth Shipping Line, and many other enterprises established and carried on by governments, Labour and antiLabour, in the Commonwealth? If the losses sustained by these enterprises had to be made up by the taxpayers, the Honorary Minister said, the electors would not support members who favoured them.

That loss was not peculiar to State enterprise; it was general. But what the Queensland Government lost on its stations, it made up in other directions. The Trade Commissioner for Queensland, in his report three years ago, said that the stations and State butchers shops in different parts of Queensland had saved the consuming public at least Â£3,000,000. That was three years ago. The probabilities are that the saving to the consuming public by this time is between Â£4,000,000 and Â£5,000,000. The Honorary Minister did not mention that.

Notwithstanding that, the Minister argues that we should pass this bill in order to prevent the States from embarking on such enterprises. While he was speaking, I interjected that in Victoria the Government had embarked upon one of the biggest socialistic schemes in the world. I referred to the Yallourn electricity scheme, to which all parties in Victoria are pledged. On this undertaking, so far, there has been a considerable loss. Does Senator McLachlan seriously suggest that because of this result the per capita grant should be taken away from Victoria ? Honorable senators opposite have delved deeply into ancient history to bring to light the attitude of the Labour party in years gone by in respect of the per capita grant. I. listened with interest to quotations from my speeches which Senator Pearce read. All that he could say about me was that at that time I was not opposed to the per capita grant, but that I was opposed to the Constitution being altered to embody a provision for the continuance of the payment. The Labour party has never been opposed to the granting of money to the States. The question which is uppermost is whether federation would have been possible had not certain conditions been first agreed to as to the adjustment of the finances of the Commonwealth and the States.

From time to time, since federation, they have received this money. Indeed, they have relied upon it, believing that they were justly entitled to it. When Senator McLachlan mentioned the amount of the per capita grant which had been paid to Victoria I interjected that it was not enough. The Minister replied that he wondered what amount I should consider sufficient. Since 1910, the States have been paid by the Commonwealth 25s. per head of population. I remind honorable senators that that rate was fixed prior to the war, and that the purchasing power of the sovereign today is much less than it was in 1910. If it was right to pay 25s. per head to the States in 1910, in justice to them, the rate should now be much higher. The proposal to discontinue the per capita grant has caused alarm throughout the Commonwealth. The Governments proposals include the abandonment of the Federal land tax. If there is one measure of direct taxation with which I feel proud to have been associated, it is that tax. It was imposed in 1910, by the Fisher Government of which I was a member. That measure gave intense satisfaction to the advocates of land taxation throughout Australia, and was a source of gratification to many Australians who had been eagerly awaiting the subdivision of big estates. It had a twofold object the subdivision of huge estates, many of which had never changed their virgin state, and the raising of additional revenue. Those objectives have been achieved. Innumerable estates have been subdivided, with the result that where a few years ago a few sheep and cattle roamed, there are today thousands of men, women and children permanently settled, and apparently, doing well.

More people came to Australia during the Fisher administration than can be induced to come here now, despite the thousands of pounds spent in the establishment of agencies, and in advertising. In those days, they came unsolicited and unaided, because they knew that they could obtain land or secure employment. That legislation also stimulated activity in the capital cities. Land on which dilapidated shacks and old tenements were erected had greatly increased in value by reason of the development of surrounding areas. The imposition of the Federal land tax caused those lands also to be developed, because it did not pay their owners to keep them idle or unreproductive. The tax was first imposed in 191011, during which year it produced Â£1,370,345. The amount received during last financial year from the same source was Â£2,521,910. Since the tax was first imposed it has added a total of Â£31,901,135 to the coffers of the Commonwealth. Yet it is proposed by this Government to forgo that source of revenue. It must be remembered that if the Commonwealth vacates that field, the States will be unable to obtain by the imposition of a land tax anything like so great a revenue. The States have not the power to aggregate estates. The Government desires no longer to impose land taxation, because it wants to relieve the wealthy landowners of Australia from the necessity of paying their just proportion of taxation.

It is all very well to be generous with easy money from Customs and excise duties which the present Government has enjoyed in large measures since it has been in office. Ministers talk about the indebtedness of the Commonwealth and its obligations.

We have had it before us, in different forms, on several occasions during the last seventeen years. Many proposals and counter proposals have been made from time to time and have appeared in the daily press of the several States. We now have the scheme before us in concrete form. Briefly, the bill proposes to repeal the capitation payments embodied in the Surplus Revenue Act of 1910. I agree with previous speakers that this is one of the most important subjects that has ever come before the Senate. I feel, therefore, that we should approach the discussion of it with due regard to its effect upon the people; that we should discard all personal prejudices and consider it with an open mind and in a manner that will reflect credit upon this chamber.  Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. When the Senate adjourned, I was directing attention to the importance of this measure. This is the second attempt which has been made in 27 years to divide the public revenues between the Commonwealth, on the one hand, and the States, on the other, and from all appearances this is likely to be the final attempt. Of course, finance  is not a simple matter with governments, any more than with individuals; and when the task is essayed of making a fair division it necessarily follows that the parties are watchful of the outcome. Knowing that the Commonwealth and the States have not, except on rare occasions, been what might be called a happy family during the last 27 years, one can understand the negotiations being embarrassed on the present occasion by considerations that ought not to have been allowed to intrude. The manner in which this question was handled in 1910 is altogether dissimilar from that which has been in evidence on the present occasion. At that time the whole of the States cooperated with the Commonwealth in an endeavour to arrive at a solution of the problem. Happily they succeeeded in doing so, and, more happily, the result was embodied in an act of the Commonwealth Parliament which has operated for the last seventeen years.","N/A","STATES GRANTS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","LYNCH, Patrick","KRZ","N/A","N/A","N/A","572","That is so; but up to the stage of deciding upon a fair division there was unanimity between the States and the Commonwealth. The sole difference of opinion was as to whether the provision then made should be guaranteed to the States for all time, or whether it should be left to the will of this Parliament to maintain the payment at 25s. per head for a certain period only and then increase, decrease, or abolish it. The difference between the situation seventeen years ago and that of today is that the Federal authority now occupies a position of almost isolated grandeur. It has adopted the attitude,  This much only will I give to thee, and the States have no option but to accept holus bolus what is offered to them or place their case before a higher authority. This is likely to be the last occasion on which this subject will be reviewed by the Commonwealth Parliament. Such being the case, honorable senators should approach the matter as free agents, with absolutely open minds, and as the Constitution intended as the guardians and custodians of the States which they represent. I go further, and say that the Senate should collectively act in such a way as to do itself not only present, but also future, credit. The first requisite is that the Senate should not prejudge the case; but I am very much afraid that that is being done. The case for the Commonwealth Government is placed before us in the bill that we are now considering ; but we have not yet had the opportunity to find out what are the wishes of the States, and how far they are prepared to assist in the making of a bargain that will be mutually acceptable.  I have been told that the Government has offered a royal commission. What was to be the nature and the terms of that commission? It was to be an independent body of men, before whom witnesses could be called. As is the case with all commissions, it was to be carefully and jealously circumscribed. In the interests of the States? No ! In the interests of the Commonwealth ? Yes ! The ambit of its authority, and the area of its research, should have been so fixed that the case for both the States and the Commonwealth could have been examined without any limitation whatsoever. Let us recall the terms upon which it was to be appointed. It was to inquire into and report upon whether the figure Â£7,600,000 put forward by the Commonwealth was correct or not. Such an inquiry could be carried out by any body of accountants. The question could bo settled by an examination of the books of the Treasury. Then the commission was to say whether or not the States could, by legislation, obtain the amounts which they would be called upon to raise in lieu of the capitation grant. That is not a very extensive authority. The question is a simple one, and could be answered by a competent legal authority. It is significant that one line of inquiry was excluded from the terms of the commission : Whether or not the States have an inherent constitutional right to the payment which the Government proposes to withhold from them. The Government is the best judge of why such a line of inquiry was not to be pursued. The absence of that allimportant provision completely nullified the value of the commission. If it were desired that the position should be investigated, why could the commission not inquire into everything relating to the status of the two authorities? Seeing that their case would not be adequately represented, the States said: We cannot agree to this commission because circumstances make it a onesided, partisan body, from which we can expect no good  ; and they rejected the offer of the Commonwealth. I congratulate Senator McLachlan upon his elevation, but I am sorry that during, his speech he was either hazy or noncommittal in respect to vital points that were raised by previous speakers. The Government has been asked,  Wherein is your mandate or authority for doing this thing? The Minister did not reply to that, so I shall endeavour to fill the blank caused by his want of thought or good generalship. At the last elections in Western Australia I travelled with Senator Pearce, who enunciated the policy of the Government; and I distinctly remember that there was only one reference to finance in that campaign. It was, that a conference would be called during the life of the ensuing Parliament for the purpose of dealing with the finances of the States and the Commonwealth. In nearly every policy speech during the last seventeen years either that sentence, or something similar to it, has appeared. The question was not ventilated. Throughout the length and breadth of Western Australia it was urged that the matter of outstanding importance was to see that established law and order should prevail over disorder. Therefore, so far as the people in that State are concerned, no warrant exists for the introduction of this bill. The Minister (Senator McLachlan) was also asked to consider the position of the States subsequent to the withdrawal of the per capita payment, and to say whether they would find themselves better or worse off, richer or poorer, their status improved or lowered. T am not aware that he addressed himself to that matter; so, in my humble view, I propose to make good the deficiency. I remind the honorable senator that we are living in a curious age. I remember the time when the party of which the present Government is largely the lineal descendant was very pronounced upon this particular question. Where did it stand? The majority of its members left no doubt in the minds of any person that the rights of the States vere to be jealously preserved. They would not. allow anybody to suggest, or to even hint, that they were in the least degree inclined to make an incursion upon the preserves of the States. The descendants of that party have wedded themselves to a policy which shows a considerable declension from that of their forefathers. It is the very opposite of that which the progenitors of this party once propounded. The fathers of the Constitution, who were to a great extent the forerunners of this party, placed section 87 in the Constitution, and at a later date in altered circumstances sought to insert in it another provision equally jealously guarding the interests of the States. But the present party, the relict of the earlier party, is saying,   No matter what our forebears did, we stand today to rob the States of everything then given to them. This criticism applies equally to the party opposite, on whose banner is to be found the one word Unification. Strange to say, in the whirligig of politics #nd interchange of opportunities we now find that instead of being the unificationists they want the electors to believe they are, they are stout defenders of State interests, and will not budge a single inch from that position. In the circumstances, seeing that party policies and party opinions are so much in the melting pot, it is our duty to find out exactly where we stand today. Just as the fathers of the federation recognized this duty, so today we are called upon to see wherein lies the wellbeing of the citizen apart from parties and governments, and to ascertain how he will be affected by this bill. 1 propose to direct brief attention to what has been said by previous speakers as to the respective spheres and functions of the State and Federal Governments. Before doing so, let me say that I shall never subscribe to a doctrine that would have the effect of lowering the prestige of the National Government. Just as we outgrew our adolescence 27 years ago, and as a leading parliamentarian said, put on the toga of manhood, so in the natural order of things we shall grow to a lustier manhood. We need, therefore, to have, on all occasions, a. central or national government strongly and securely entrenched, and able to defend the citizens of this country from attack from within or without. But side by side with that declaration I stand stoutly for the maintenance of the States, rotating on their own axes, and performing the functions which the founders of the Constitution knew they would be called upon to perform, without being harassed or handicapped as I contend they would be if we pass this bill. I want now to picture the position of the average workaday citizen, the man, so to speak, whose head is down to his work from early morn to late at night, and who takes little interest in politics. I refer to the man, who, once he has elected his representatives to Parliament, has sense enough, and sometimes overconfidence enough, to think that they will act fairly towards him. We may imagine him setting out for the interior from any big centre of population. How will he fare ? On what authority will he depend for his progress on the road of life? If he makes up his mind, as, unfortunately, not too many are inclined to do, to turn his back on the crowded city, and lead a pioneering life by engaging in that class of work which is the basis of all our prosperity, he will take a railway train. Thus he will have to depend on the State Government for the first necessity. When he goes out he has again to come in contact with another State activity to get the land that he will spy out after some trouble. Having got the land and applied his scanty capital to its development, to whom does he go in order to supplement his earnings or reinforce his credit facilities? On whom will he rely to furnish him with the wherewithal to till the land ? Naturally he must apply to the State authority. And if, when he has brought the land under subjection and to a point of productivity, either by raising crops or feeding animals, a pest assails his crop or his stock, to whom will he look with all confidence for aid in his unequal struggle? Again he must look to the State authority. If in the course of his operations, he is short of water that vital necessity in our semiarid interior again he looks to the aid of the State authority. If he wants pustice from his neighbour, to whom does he apply for that justice which is so necessary in every civilized community? He applies to a State authority. When he seeks to get his children educated, or when he is stricken by the wayside and needs attention in a hospital or some other similar institution, the State authority once more comes to his aid. When lastly and finally, he brings his produce to market, sometimes to sell it below cost, on whom does he depend again ? Upon the State authority. In these ten instances the average Australian citizen, who turns his back on the city and goes into the interior, has to depend upon the State Government for the wherewithal to live and try to prosper. What does he expect from the Commonwealth Government? It assists him when he posts a letter or gives him facilities to telephone to his nearest neighbour. That is all. How will that man fare in the future ? We know that the State Governments, not being possessed of the philosophers stone, which will turn wood into gold, will have to find money, but we also know that there is a very pro.nounced limit to that which can be gained by taxation in any community. We know that, in Australia, the two authorities, State and Commonwealth, have been roaming over and fossicking almost the entire area of tax production in Australia. Of course, the Commonwealth now says that it will surrender a portion of its direct taxation, but that brings us back to the point that has been stated so often : Is there any guarantee that the States will be given a charter of immunity from any invasion by the Commonwealth of that field of taxation which can be derived by taxing the surplus earnings of the people? We all know that, at any time it chooses, the central Government can claim its share of the surplus earnings of the citizens of the country and that the local authorities are thrust into the position of having to depend upon the scraps that fall from the table of the higher authority. In the natural order of things the minor authority always gets the worst of the deal, and the National Parliament the best. In the meantime, what is the effect upon the citizen ? What will his progress be ? Am I to be told that the man who uses the State Government almost as a prop for at least ten operations during the course of his activities will have his position in life enhanced or made more attractive by the Commonwealth Government stepping in as it is at liberty to do and levying direct taxation upon him? We must view this question from his standpoint, because, unless he is fairly treated, he will rise in his outraged might and hurl from office any party in power that would behave so callously towards him. It is, therefore, time to see what is fair between man and man and authority and authority. The national authority has done fairly well since it was established 26 years ago. My information on the point is somewhat cramped, because the bulk of the material available has been transferred to Canberra, and I am dependent on fragments. But, even with their help, I find that, whereas at the outset of federation the personnel of all the departments transferred and newly created did not exceed 11,000 persons, with a payroll amounting to Â£1,500,000 per annum, the number has since increased to 26,000 persons and the payroll is over Â£7,000,000. I postulate that the rate of progress by the Federal Government will not be outpaced by that of the State Governments. In the first year of our federation, the revenue of the Commonwealth was between Â£7,000,000 and Â£8,000,000. Today, after 26 years, it is Â£75,000,000. In the light of these figures, is there any need to bolster u}> the Federal authority or to say that the Federal spirit needs reinvigorating t Is there any need for a bill such as this to solidify the financial and moral position of the central Government? The central Government is now raising taxation by means of Customs duties, which Senator McLachlan describes as easy money, and also by a invasion of fields of taxation which are more irksome, thorny, and distasteful than indirect taxation, The income tax collector is regarded as a villain, but indirect taxation in the form of Customs and excise duties are paid without complaint. The form of collection is easy. The States are now to be placed in a different position, and are to shoulder the responsibility of collecting practically the whole of the direct taxation, which is always unpopular. The States are to be deprived of certain revenue to which they are constitutionally entitled, and which, but for the fallacious arguments adduced, they would still continue to receive. I could quote from niv own declaration in Western Australia when I was chided by the State Treasurer at that time for opposing ti, inclusion of an amendment in the bill guaranteeing 25s. per capita to the States for all time, because, as I said, an occasion might arise when the States would be entitled to receive a larger amount. I instanced at the time the possibility of the discovery of mineral wealth in the far interior of Western Australia, which would considerably increase the revenueproducing capacity of the State. I said that it would be manifestly unjust if the State could not rightly claim a greater share of Commonwealth revenue than that which it was then receiving. The position has now changed, and the Government says that the States are no longer entitled to a portion of the Customs and excise revenue. The Minister in charge of the bill (Senator Pearce) expressed his views at the same time, and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Senator Needham) quoted the right honorable gentleman as saying that the per capita payment should be continued until at least the year 1935. Senator Pearce is now associated with a Government which proposes to abolish them altogether. I expressed my individual opinion at that time, not as a Western Australian representative, but as one who thought that the State might be entitled to a greater share of revenue on the basis I have given. Something might have happened that would have increased that States revenue capacity up to a point which would enable it to obtain a greater share instead of the central government receiving the largest portion. The Honorary Minister (Senator McLachlan) stated this afternoon that the present system permitted the States to indulge in a lavish form of expenditure, and to adopt a policy of squander. Whilst, of course, I am somewhat in sympathy with that declaration, I think the Minister went too far, since, in effect, he suggested an indirect interference with the internal policy of the States, which have sovereign rights. The States are in the same position as the Federal authority, and are as firmly established as even the Imperial Government itself is today. They have a direct line of communication between their governments and the Imperial Government, and their rights and prerogatives are clearly established. The Imperial Government, when it gives a charter to any crown colony or to a territory under the control of a responsible officer, does not impose limitations as to any form of political development. They are not told how to spend their revenue, but this Government is saying,  We will not assist you if you persist in spending unwisely on State enterprises revenue which we collect. The British Government has never imposed upon any sovereign state conditions such as this Government proposes.","N/A","STATES GRANTS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[5]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We have been told that owing to the tremendous financial responsibility which the Commonwealth Government has to shoulder in the form of war expenditure there is a warrant for this fundamental change in the financial relationship between the Commonwealth and the States. I deny that absolutely. I shall show, by figures that I shall quote that there is no warrant for the action of the Government, even in a modified form. According to the last budget our net war debt is approximately Â£304,000,000, of which amount Â£89,000,000 was funded by the Imperial Government under an arrangement successfully carried out by the late Senator Millen. There is an amount of Â£16,000,000 which is a recoverable portion of the debt due, and the interest on the cost of settling soldiers on the land and providing them with homes so that the net war debt of the Australian people is, roundly, Â£290,000,000. We have, as honorable senators are aware, a sinking fund, and also means of raising taxation to pay interest on our war debt to the extent of 20s. in the Â£1. That I hope we shall always do so that we shall be able like the village blacksmith to  Look the whole world in the face  and owe not any man. A contribution of one half per cent, to a sinking fund, as the law provides, on Â£290,000,000 is Â£1,500,000, which would liquidate that debt at the end of 50 years. Interest at the rate of 5 per cent, or 6 per cent. the rate of course varies amounts to something like Â£15,000,000, and if we add these two sums together, one for paying interest while the debt remains, and the other for liquidating the debt in 50 years we find that only about Â£17,000,000 is required yearly to wipe out Australias war debt. That is what we are called upon to bear. The revenue received from one department alone that from which the Government wishes to still enjoy the revenue is approximately Â£44,000,000. If we deduct Â£17,000,000 from the revenue received from Customs and excise, which as I have said is Â£44,000,000 we have a balance of Â£27,000,000.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","LYNCH, Patrick","KRZ","N/A","N/A","N/A","577","Yes. I checked these figures with a responsible officer, and I intend to stand by them. So far as I can remember the total revenue of the Commonwealth last year was about Â£75,000,000, and it is a simple matter to ascertain the proportion of Â£17,000,000 to Â£75,000,000. It is a trifle over 20 per cent. It must be borne in mind, however, that the Â£17,000,000 I have already mentioned is the maximum, and by the time we reached the fiftieth year the amount would, in comparison, be hardly perceptible. Are we, therefore, to change a fundamental principle by reason of a transient cause. The Governments case must be based on something more secure than the shifting sand of some transient consideration.  The Minister referred to the deadening effect of this easy money upon State authorities; but for his information I may say that the amount received by the States from the Commonwealth is equal to only Ti per cent, of their total revenue. Surely such a small percentage cannot have such a baneful influence upon State electors as has been suggested. The amount received by the States is insignificant and should not be responsible for demoralizing the electors when selecting their representatives. It has been said by previous speakers that the authorities spending the money should be responsible for raising it, but that is only a pious aspiration. The practice objected to is followed in many other countries. In this connexion I am reminded of the sage who said,  If you tried to prove the right angle of a triangle you would never succeed. Let me tell the Government something that it already knows : that other Governments also resort to this practice. When the Canadian Federation received its Constitution in 1867, this question was considered, and it was decided that the Provinces should receive a certain sum for all time.","N/A","STATES GRANTS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[5]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","LYNCH, Patrick","KRZ","N/A","N/A","N/A","577","The Minister will be sorry that he asked that question. Canada was granted a constitution in 1867. By section 118 of that constitution, the various Provinces received grants as follows: Ontario, $80,000; Quebec, $70,000; Nova Scotia, $60,000; New Brunswick, $50,000; and, in addition, every province received 80 cents, per head of the population. That represents an average of $65,000 for each Province. That was at the commencement. As the years passed, the people of the several provinces showed unmistakable displeasure because of the smallness of the amounts they received from the central Government. As a result of the growing popular feeling, legislation was passed in 1907 to provide that where the population was under 150,000 persons, the grant should be $100,000; where the population was over 150,000, but not exceeding 200,000 persons, $150,000; where it was between 200,000 and 400,000 persons, $180,000; between 400,000 and 800,000 persons, $190,000; and where the population exceeded 800,000, but was less than 1,500,000, the grant should be $220,000 per annum. Where the population exceeded 1,500,000 persons, the grant was fixed at $240,000. By studying those figures, honorable senators will be able to calculate the amount paid by way of per capita grants in Canada. It must be remembered that the payment of 80 cents per head of population was also retained. Of the big increased expenditure which took place under the 1907 act, Senator Pearce, apparently, has no knowledge.

(b)Such further sums as the GovernorGeneral in Council may consider necessary for the due performance of the services and duties assigned to the provinces respectively. In that we see nothing of the socalled sacred principle that the authority which raises revenue should spend it. That principle has never operated in Canada or South Africa, nor is there any intention of introducing it there. In the Mother Country this principle finds no place. On page 25, volume 1, of Round Table Studies, we find that the amount raised as rates by the local authorities increased from Â£25,000,000 in 1884 to Â£33,000,000 in 1894, and to Â£59,000,000 in 1907. It is true that the Exchequer grants have increased more than proportionately, and that in 19078 they reached a total of Â£20,000,000. That amount was given by the Imperial Exchequer to the local authorities in Great Britain. Again, I ask where is the observance of the socalled sacred principle that the authority which raises revenue should spend it? None of these Governments havethought it necessary to follow that principle : and they have had experience extending, in the case of the Mother Country, over many centuries. In the face of those facts, the Government should bring forward better arguments in support its proposals than the limp, halting, onelegged reasonsso far presented. [Extension of time gr anted.] Let me refer briefly to the moral aspect of this question. The word  moral  needs to be defined. In my opinion a moral right is the greatest right that exists. If a person is given his moral right he is given all that is his due; no other right that he may possess can exceed his moral right. When we say that we give a man his legal right, suspicion is at once aroused. Thereare other rights, such as inherent rights, mutual rights, and so on, but I shall confine my remarks to the moral right. It will be conceded the Honorary Minister himself admitted it that at one time the States did have a moral right to receive a portion of the revenue derived from Customs and excise. So universal was that belief that a successful effort was made to include the principle in the Constitution. I remind honorable senators that the provision in the Constitution requiring threefourths of the revenue from Customs and excise to be paid to the States, was inserted at the instance of the State Premiers, and not at the suggestion of the selected representatives of the States. The limitation of ten years was imposed by them because the people of New South Wales thought that, without it, the presence in the Constitution of such a provision would commit the Commonwealth to a policy of protection. It was thought that if the Commonwealth were limited for all time to onefourth of the revenue derived from Customs and excise duties the tendency would be to increase those duties so that the Commonwealths revenue would be greater. New South Wales was then regarded as a freetrade State. When I first took my place in this chamber I saw before me six senators from New South Wales, all of whom were opposed to the policy of protection. I refer to Senators Sir Albert Gould, Neild, Pulsford, E. D. Millen, Walker, and Gray. It was almost dangerous to mention protection in the presence of those men. Then a change came over the spirit of the dream. Now, instead of six stalwarts from that State upholding the banner of freetrade, we have strong protectionists in the persons of my honorable friends, Senator Greene, Senator Duncan, and others.","N/A","STATES GRANTS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[5]/continue[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

But for the then fiscal policy of New South Wales, that provision which was described as the   Braddon blot   would be in the Constitution still. The ground for calling it a blot and limiting its operation to ten years was the accident of a freetrade Government in New South Wales.  This attempt to belittle the claim of the States on moral groundsto a share of the Customs and excise revenue has a most shadowy foundation. As a matter of fact, the claim rests on granite, and, as I have shown, the provision would be in the Constitution still but for the fiscal tendency of the hour in one State. Now, in some quarters, at all events, this banner of the moral right is as torn and tattered as the red flag is on the Yarra bank. Other important amendments were inserted in the Constitution Bill at the instance of the Premiers in conference. There was, for instance, the provision with regard to the deadlock between the two Houses, and that other clause to safeguard the principle of majority Tule in the case of deadlocks between the two houses. Following on the vital amendment agreed to by the Premiers to take away the constitutional and moral right which the States then had, and still have in my opinion, to a major share of the Customs and excise revenue, there was the clause to empower the Federal Government to come to the assistance of necessitous States. It was realized that the financial arrangements were such that something might have to be done to assist financially certain of the States. Let me now examine the position in Western Australia. I am in duty bound to give that aspect of the proposal weighty consideration, since the electors of that State have sent me to this Chamber as one of their representatives. If in the course of my remarks under this head I tell other honorable senators what they should do, I remind them that this Chamber is essentially and for all time a States House. It was created to safeguard the rights of the States whenever an onslaught might be made upon them from either within or without. Recent happenings suggest that in some quarters, at all events, party considerations have a stronger claim on the suffrages of certain members of this Parliament than the intertsts of the States which sent them here.","N/A","STATES GRANTS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[5]/continue[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

For my part, I can say that whenever the interests of my State clash with the interests of my party, I am in duty bound to place the interests of the State in the forefront so as to safeguard the wellbeing of the people who sent me here. Therefore, when I see before me a measure which strikes at the root of the prosperity of my State, and indeed the prosperity of all the States, I feel that there is a solemn obligation upon me to maintain the charge given to me by the people who elected me to this Parliament. What am I going to do now? Vote for the Government? If I did that, I should be deliberately assisting to cripple the financial stability and destroy the prosperity of my State.  Figures supplied by the UnderTreasurer of Western Australia and by the State Commissioner of Taxation relating to this Governments proposal tell a sorry story. The Commonwealth Treasurer estimates that the evacuation by the Commonwealth of land taxation will surrender Â£87,000 to Western Australia; but according to the State Commissioner of Taxation the amount will be only Â£65,000. Similarly, according to the Commissioner, the amounts to be surrendered by way of estate duties and income tax have been overestimated by the Commonwealth Treasurer, with the result, according to figures based upon the overestimate of those two fields, that the State will suffer to the extent of Â£100,000 in the four departments proposed to be abandoned by the Commonwealth. In these circumstances can I accept the Governments proposals? If the Ministry has treated the States in the same way that it has treated its own followers, the States will be able to complain of lack of courtesy or cordiality. I remember on one occasion, when I was upstairs in the party room the only chance I had of summing up the result of the deliberations was by looking at a blackboard ! In this important issue, affecting so vitally as it does the interests of my own State, I should be false to the trust reposed in me false to the pledges I gave if I did not reject the bill contemptuously, because it will vitally undermine the financial solvency of my State. Turning now to the special grant made to Western Australia, I am reminded that the Government appointed its own commission to inquire into the grievances and disabilities suffered by that State under federation. Honorable senators will recall that the majority report stated that in order to make good the loss sustained by Western Australia a3 the result of federation, that State should receive Â£450,000 a year until such time as it regained control of its own Customs and exoise revenue. Even the minority report, which was not so favorable, recommended the payment of Â£300,000 a year. What did this Government do ? It paid Â£450,000 for one year, with allowance for a diminishing portion of the Â£250,000 granted in 1910. What is happening now? Everything is in the air. As a representative of Western Australia I do not know where I stand. Do honorable senators think that I am going blindly to accept this proposal at the dictation of the Leader of the Senate ? I repeat that I should be false to my trust, and false to my solemn word to the people who sent me here, if I did otherwise than vote against the bill. What do the people of Western Australia think of my colleague, Senator Pearce in connexion with this matter ? During the last election campaign he spoke with me at Kalgoorlie. These are the words he used, according to the report in the Kalgoorlie Miner of the 16th October, 1925","N/A","STATES GRANTS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[5]/continue[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

That amount, as I have stated, was paid for one year, and now it is to be cancelled, with no guarantee. in the bill that it will be resurrected. That, I say, is repudiation of the promise made by Senator Pearce at Kalgoorlie. The measure suggests that the people of Western Australia are about to be fooled, because they were led to believe they would get the full amount recommended by the commission. How can I support the Government? Let Senator Pearce and his Government honour the platform pledges which he gave in Kalgoorlie, and then I will reconsider my position. Whilst the financial stability of Western Australia is trembling in the balance I should bo false to my trust, and be a first rate traitor to the interests of that State if I supported the bill.

He is, in many ways, a hard man to follow. We cannot follow him in his argument or in his figures, which, on this matter, are incorrect. I should not have spoken but that the people, who are our masters, will expect us and rightly so to state our reasons for the attitude that we adopt towards the bill. As. we all know, this measure provides for the abolition of the per capita payment that is now made to the States. The existing system is a clumsy, temporary expedient, which was introduced when federation was established. Time has shown that it has fed the rich and starved the poor. The great bulk of the money is given to highlydeveloped States like New South Wales and Victoria. Had the per capita system been strictly adhered to, it would have led to the starvation of States with large areas but small populations, such as that which Senator Lynch so ably represents. The area of Western Australia is onethird of the total area of Australia. It has a sparse population, and its developmental needs are great. No other portion of Australia lends itself so readily to development, or possesses greater potentialities. It is not the intention of the Government to in any way cripple or belittle the States. The idea is to devise a better and a sounder financial basis than that which at present obtains, and to avoid the unnecessary duplication of departments that have grown up under the present system. Unfortunately, a spirit of antagonism has been displayed towards the Commonwealth Government, and the flame has been fanned by men in public, semipublic, andwouldbe public positions who ought to know better. Many of them have not even bothered to acquaint themselves with the proposals of the Government. A number of those who are opposing these proposals are not giving the Prime Minister a fair deal. That right honorable gentleman has time and again assured us that injury will not be done to the States either financially or in any other way. In the eyes of some of his opponents the greatest crime which Mr. Bruce has committed is that he has been a brilliant success as Prime Minister of Australia. He was acknowledged to be the outstanding figure at the Imperial Conference. One wonders at this bitter hostility that is being shown towards him. I do not insinuate that any honorable senator is actuated by a desire to see a reshuffling of portfolios, or by any other selfish motive; but there are some persons to whom personal spite and ambition are of more importance than the readjustment of the financial relationships of the Commonwealth and the States. The other night, in the ultraaristocratic suburb of Toorak, a gentleman who has made himself conspicuous of late used the threat that, if those honorable senators who represent Victoria did not oppose the Government on this matter, they themselves would be opposed by the National Federation and the Australian Womens National League at the next elections. That gentleman had no mandate from the National Federation or the Womens National League to make such a statement, but he evidently thought that he could intimidate the Victorian senators and induce them to obey the dictation of an outside organization rather than their own consciences. I know that none of the Victorian senators will pay the slightest heed to any outside threat. We shall vote according to our consciences, and in the best interests of Australia. As a matter of fact, a,t the last annual conference of the National Federation, a motion that the per capita payments should not be discontinued was defeated by an overwhelming majority. In the circumstances, how can this gentleman who was speaking at Toorak, or any member of the Federal Parliament, or any public man, say that the Federal Government is acting contrary to the wishes of the National Federation? Honorable senators are determined to do what is right rather than have an eye to the next election. It is, we realize, perfectly true that at the present time the proposal to abolish the per capita grant is unpopular; but that is possibly due to the fact that the public has been illinformed as to the intentions of the Commonwealth Government. It is for the States to accept the invitation of the Government which has been extended te them from time to time and which will be extended to them again after the bill goes through to meet it in conference to state their requirements. We are assured by Mr. Bruce, by Senator Pearce, by other Ministers, and by the supporters of the Government that they will receive most generous consideration and treatment. There is another great safeguard which has not been stressed sufficiently. When the Commonwealth and State Governments meet, and formulate and agree upon a basis by which the States may be recompensed for the abolition of this blundering, uneconomic, stupid old system of per capita payments, the agreement so arrived at must be ratified or rejected by this Parliament. Therefore, in our paramount position, we shall have an opportunity to discuss m detail the suggestions put forward, and to decide what it is right and just to do. It is only then that honorable senators will need to be on the qui vine to see that justice is done to the States, and, if necessary, to fight in their interests. But until this bill is passed we know perfectly well the States will refuse to make any suggestions. Already they have slammed the door in the face of the Commonwealth Ministry. They have not offered suggestions, or put forward any compromise. One wonders why there is so much fuss; why honorable senators flare up into such oratorical displays of fireworks, such as we have just had from Senator Lynch, whose brilliance is almost sufficient to outshine the sun. The honorable senator is entertaining, and also brilliant, although perhaps, somewhat illogical. After listening to so much bitter opposition, and witnessing so much playacting in some quarters, when one knows the facts one is inclined to think that there is a good deal in the leading article of the Sydney Daily Telegraph of the 10th March, which reads ","N/A","STATES GRANTS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The per capita payment was merely a temporary arrangement. In 1910 the people at a referendum rejected a suggestion to embody that agreement in the Constitution. They refused to make the method permanent, and it was continued for another ten years, but really lapsed seven years ago. Senator Pearce has shown that no other country in the world adopts the per capita basis for payments to States. We all realize that money has to be found somewhere for the development, defence, and administration of our great Commonwealth. But whether the money be collected by the Federal authorities or by the State authorities the same people in all instances provide it. To me it seems a very unwise policy for the Commonwealth to collect a tax and then hand the money to more or less irresponsible States to spend and squander. Much , has been said of the Commonwealths affluence and extravagance; but practically every one will realize that it has been extraordinarily economical in comparison with socialstic States such as Queensland which have absolutely scattered and wasted millions of the taxpayers money on all sorts of socialistic enterprises that from the very start never had a chance of making good. The Queensland Government has butted into things about which it knows nothing, using the money provided by the people in the purchase and management of such enterprises as State cattle stations. The result has been that these concerns have been so badly manaegd that they have involved the taxpayers in a loss of nearly Â£1,000,000. The Queensland Government now sees the error of its ways, and its stations are up for sale on the 9th April next. I hope that some one will buy them, but the properties have not vet been written down to the value that is likely to be fixed upon them by purchasers. When one socialistic enterprise in Queensland can show a loss of nearly Â£1,000,000, why should the Common, wealth Government tax the people and raise money to hand it over to five of the State Governments of Australia to squander on all sorts of socialistic enterprises. To do so is unsound.  Several opponents of the bill have spoken of the affluence . of the Commonwealth Government. Let us examine the facts. Very few of them have dealt fairly with the Governments huge war and other commitments, which including repatriation, war pensions, invalid and oldage pensions, and maternity allowance, amount to Â£50,000,000 per annum. These are statutory obligations. The ratio of the financial requirements of the Commonwealth and of the States has entirely altered in consequence of the war. Senator Lynch said that the Commonwealth Government required only Â£17,000,000 a year to meet its obligations. I challenge many of the. honorable senators statements, and practically all his figures, and say without fear of contradiction that they are incorrect. The honorable senator certainly said that ho was speaking from memory, owing to the absence of records which have been transferred to Canberra; but clearly stated that the annual commitments of the Commonwealth did not exceed Â£17,000.000. According to the last budget the commitments of the Commonwealth are as follows: The latter is a commitment which no one wishes to escape; I do not think any honorable senator wishes to see the amount of pension reduced in any way. The list continues In a sparsely populated country with an undefended coastline of 12,000 miles, and a population of two persons to the square mile, the Government is justified in incurring the expenditure mentioned on defence. Does any one suggest that the amount should be reduced ? There is also The loss on our railways is due largely to the policy of constructing desert lines to places like Alice Springs. We have also the eastwest railway, which Senator Lynch is glad to use when travelling to his home.

We must see where we stand financially and consider what would be our position if the quantity of our great primary products, wool and wheat, seriously declined, or their value decreased, either or both of which are quite possible.

In opposing it, I am not only standing by my pledges to the electors; I am also acting in accordance with the platform of the organization which put me here.

I agree that action in that direction is necessary. I am not an outandout champion of the States, because in my judgment the States are not entirely blameless for the position that has arisen. If the State Premiers had been in a more reasonable frame of mind, and if they had consented to meet the representatives of the Commonwealth in a proper spirit, it is possible that some solution of the present difficulty would have been agreed upon.

The Government has expressed its desire to deal liberally with the States. I do not distrust the Ministry, but it is possible that even if the Government is animated by a most earnest desire to act generously, it will not give the States anything approaching what they think they should get. It is clear that there is a distinct difference of opinion as to how the States should be treated. Some people favour treating them with the utmost liberality, whilst others would not give the States one penny piece of Commonwealth revenue. Instead of fighting them to a finish, an effort should be made to come to an amicable arrangement. We cannot afford to antagonize the States.

If that is the underlying purpose of the bill, is it not likely that the States will deeply resent the action of the Government and fight the Commonwealth over the financial arrangement as far as possible ? I admit that if the bill passes they will not be able to do much, because the representatives of this Government will go to the conference in complete possession of the resources of the Commonwealth, and will be able to say to the States, We will give you this much; you can take it or leave it.

Senator Guthrie quoted from the policy speech of the Prime Minister, and claimed that that right honorable gentleman had stated what the Government was prepared to give to the States in lieu of the present per capita payments. The honorable senator then charged those who are opposing the bill with having ratted on the Prime Minister. I shall not join in his condemnation of those who! are opposing the bill; they are answerable for their actions to their constituents. But I resent the remarks of the honorable senator if he includes me amongst those who, he says, are  ratting  on the Prime Minister. This is the first time, during my four years in the Senate, that I have heard such a remark made by an honorable senator on this side, when a supporter of the Government has spoken in opposition to a Government measure. Whatever may be our attitude on questions such as this, it should not be said of us that we are false to the Government. This is a question on which every individual should be given credit for an honesty of purpose, and a desire to do that which he considers to be in the best interests of those who elected him. I am not aware of when Senator Guthrie arrived at a decision on these proposals, but, so far as I know, his first declaration upon it was made only a few days ago. I was opposed to the proposals long before they were embodied in the bill. In justice to the Government I must say that if opposition had been shown to the measure when the opportunity was afforded before its introduction, we should not be considering it today. In introducing this bill the Government has not shown that there is any need for it. It seems to me to be late in the day for it to advance as a reason for the measure the claim that the principle under which these payments are made to the States is unsound that it is a wrong principle for one authority to collect revenue and hand it over to another to spend. Ever since the establishment of federation that practice, whether it be sound or unsound, has been followed. It was provided in the Constitution that for the first ten years a share of the Customs revenue .should be paid to the States. The same principle was adopted by legislation for the next ten years, and has continued ever since, no effort having been made until now to repeal it or alter the system. It seems to me extraordinary that, after 26 years of federation, it is only now discovered that the principle underlining these payments is unsound.

Prior to federation the Customs and excise revenue was the main source of income for each colony. Is it not a fact that the fate of the Constitution referendum hinged on the question, of the finances, not of the Commonwealth, but of the States, which formed the Commonwealth, and which had been deprived of their main source of revenue. I do not wish to repeat the strong arguments adduced on that aspect of the question; but it is clear, from the reports of the Federal Convention, that finance was one of the most important considerations. The representatives of the States on the convention were elected in an atmosphere totally different from that of tb.e present day. There were no strong political organizations. The State representatives were elected because of their outstanding ability and extensive knowledge of finance. The everincreasing revenue from Customs and excise which the Commonwealth collects, and which this year will amount to Â£44,000,000, is paid by the whole of the people; and since the States have been deprived of that revenue, they have to depend upon revenue from direct taxation imposed on a comparatively small section of the people. As has been frequently stated during the debate, the Senate was constituted the guardian of State rights. Although Tasmania has a population of only some 200,000, and Kew South Wales a population of about 2,000,000, all the States have equal representation in this chamber. As a representative of a State, I have a duty to perform to those who elected me. ","N/A","STATES GRANTS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[9]/continue[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is regrettable that, on occasions such as this, when we act as our conscience dictates, we should be charged with inconsistency. We have to consider the financial responsibilities of the Commonwealth, and also those of the States. Tasmania has nothing to gain and everything to lose under this proposal. If it is adopted, it will be compelled to appeal to the Government, as it has had to do before, under section 96 of the Constitution, for financial assistance. Whatever our difficulties have been in the past, in making our expenditure and revenue balance, we will, if this measure becomes law, be confronted with oven greater difficulties. Wealthy States, such as Victoria and New South Wales, may not be embarrassed; but I have no hesitation in saying that Tasmania will be at a great disadvantage. The more I consider this question, the more am I convinced that it is my duty to vote against the bill ; and J am sure my action will be justified by the results which follow. Such a drastic alteration in the financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States has not been sought by any section of the community, and it is difficult to understand why the bill has been introduced. The States, undoubtedly, have a moral right to the per capita payment. ","N/A","STATES GRANTS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[9]/continue[13]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","HAYS, Herbert","KOJ","N/A","N/A","N/A","594","It is. The right of the States to a portion of the Customs revenue has been recognized since Federation. The state of the Commonwealths finances cannot be used in justification of the bill. If this legislation is passed and given effect, the Government must take the responsibility. Senator Guthrie has said that honorable senators of the Nationalist party who oppose the bill are going back on the Government, but I am prepared to accept the responsibility of my action. If the Government repudiates mo in consequence of my vote I shall have no quarrel with it. Under the Nationalist platform I believe that on this measure I am free to vote according to my convictions. This legislation is not in the best interests of Tasmania. There has been no demand for it, and its passage will only antagonize the States. We have evidence of that on every hand. The question of the separation of Federal and State finances has nothing at all to do with the bill, and certainly is no justification for this Government discontinuing line per capita payments. I intend to oppose the second reading of the bill.
