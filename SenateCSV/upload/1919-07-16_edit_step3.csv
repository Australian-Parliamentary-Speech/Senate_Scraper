In reaffirming the attitude of the Government, it is both desirable and necessary that the circumstances surrounding the present disastrous strike should be clearly set out. Moved by the experience of many disastrous strikes, the community decided, and has repeatedly indorsed its decision, to adopt arbitration as the means for the ordinary settlement of industrial disputes. That decision is embodied in the law of the country, and the necessary legal machinery had been created to give effect thereto.  That . machinery is available to the members of the Seamens Union, but they not only decline to avail themselves of these means of obtaining consideration of their claims, but they have openly declared that they will not proceed by the orderly and regular methods of arbitration, but intend to enforce their decisions by paralyzing the industries of the country. They seek to win, not through the merits of their case, but from the suffering they hope to inflict. They no longer disguise either their objects or their methods; both of which constitute an open challenge alike to the law and the community. From the inception of the strike the Government have worked with but one object. They have taken every step which offered any prospect of leading to a (peaceful settlement of the dispute, short of an ignominious surrender to the demands .that direct action should be permitted to triumph over arbitration, the law, and the established institutions of the community. In the hope that the good sense of the majority of the men would ultimately reject the sinister advice of their leaders, and that the growing manifestations of public disapproval would convince them of the folly of continuing to follow that advice, the Government have with great patience refrained from any action at all likely to complicate or extend the struggle, or to embitter the minds o£ those who have created it. After the. Court had been openly flouted, the Government took the action which again: enabled the men without any loss of dignity or prejudice to their case, to again obtain a hearing. But, again, they, made it clear that they were defiantly determined to enforce their claims by war upon the community rather than submit to the adjudication of the Court. The Government is now, as it always has been, willing to further any proposal making for the proper and orderly settlement of the dispute, but it cannot, and will not, yield to methods of direct action or the revolutionary threats of those advocating that policy. Honorable Senator <*. Hear, hear !","Ministerial Statement","SEAMENS STRIKE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","MILLEN, Edward","KUL","N/A","N/A","N/A","10698","The present position cannot be allowed to continue. Already the strike has caused great industrial dislocation, with the accompanying widespread privation to thousands of innocent people, and serious material loss to the country. These grave consequences will intensify with every days prolongation of the struggle, which, if allowed to proceed, would ultimately strangle all industrial activity, and with it the peoples means of subsistence.  The Government realizes fully its duty in the present trying conditions, and is not assisted in its discharge by the advice of illinformed critics. It is, however, in possession of information indicating that steps are being taken to secure a peaceful solution of the present distressful problem. It does not intend to jeopardize this movement, but, on the contrary, will do everything in its power to help to a successful issue. The Government is not without hope that this movement will succeed; but should it, unfortunately, fail it will take all steps necessary to secure the restoration of in dustry to. normal conditions. The Government desires at this critical juncture to make a final appeal to the men immediately concerned to even now present their claims to the proper tribunal rather than to continue to wage war upon the entire community and the forces of constituted authority. The Government presses this appeal with all sincerity and all earnestness, and it asks the cooperation of all the leaders of organized labour who are in a position peculiarly fitting them, to influence the decision of the Seamens Union. It will do what it can to overcome any difficulties which may appear to exist in the acceptance of this appeal.","Ministerial Statement","SEAMENS STRIKE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The practice of the House of Commons as laid down in May confirms the practice followed under our own. Standing Orders. The word savage used, in the honorable senators question to qualify the word  sentences  is undoubtedly comment, and his question is therefore contrary to our own Standing Orders and to the practice of the House of Commons.  Questions are continually coming under my notice which are asked, not so much for the purpose of obtaining information, as for ventilating the opinions of the questioners. Senator Gardiner preferred not to have his question placed on the noticepaper if the word  savage  were to be left out of it.

If I am ruled out of order in putting my question in that manner, then rulings of such a character will narrow the rights of honorable senators so severely that it will be impossible not with a President such as today presides over this Chamber, but with one who may want to become a schoolmaster for anything else to follow except the curtailment of honorable senators liberties. If any honorable senator feels that a statement of his has been wrongly assumed to contain an imputation, there is a wellknown course of procedure by which he may put himself right. He may deny the imputation, and his word is accepted. In asking my question I had no desire to impute anything to any one. I desired only to call the attention of the Government to the sentences which had been passed, in order to get the  Government to say whether those sentences were savage or severe. Whereupon you, Mr. President, ruled that I could not put my question in such form. It will be said, perhaps, that questions such as mine are asked so that honorable senators may parade their own views. If one desired to draw the limelight upon himself by medium of such inquiries, the opportunity is afforded by either moving the adjournment of the Senate or speaking upon the ordinary adjournment. My position has been this: I read in the newspapers particulars regarding the infliction of these sentences, and I noticed that the whole trouble had originated from certain of the seamen on the Australia having waited on the officers in deputation. Up to that stage no greater offence had been committed than that the men had waited in deputation on their officers.  I am not going to discuss how far circumstances such as have, arisen through the punishment of these men may extend, if sentences of such severity may be inflicted without question. When you ruled, in the first place, Mr. President, that my first inquiry was out of order, I took no exception, for. the reason that it comprised a statement of my own. I then drafted my question so that it would come within the Standing Orders. My surprise at your ruling it out of order was  then so great that I could not imagine how it would be possible for me to ask a question of that kind at all. If I had characterized the sentences passed on board the Australia as savage and severe there would have been no need for me to have asked whether they were or were nob savage and severe. But, in asking whether it was a fact that those sentences were savage and severe, I hold that I put myself clearly within the Standing Orders. I have before me a ruling of the Speaker of the House of Commons, from which I shall quote.

If such an inquiry was in order in the House of Commons, surely our practices are hot to he clipped, curtailed, and confined so as to provide a lesser degree of liberty than is enjoyed in the Imperial Parliament. Indeed, our Constitution gives to us all the rights and privileges obtaining . in the House of Commons. If your ruling, sir, were to hold good for the future, and an honorable senator rose to ask a question of similar character, the position would be that because an assertion had been imported into the question it was out of order and could not be asked. I rest my case upon, the one authority alone from which I have quoted. Here was a question, asked in the House of Commons, whether a certain disloyal gathering had committed certain actions. Objection was taken to the question being put in that form, whereupon the Speaker ruled as I have just indicated. It was not for him to determine as to the truthfulness or otherwise of the subjectmatter of the question; it was sufficient that such subjectmatter was considered necessary for inclusion in order that certain information might be elicited. I think you must see, sir, that if my question cannot be asked in the form in which I have put it, you will be curtailing, not only the rights and privileges of honorable senators held from the beginning of this Parliament, but rights and privileges which should be continued to the end.

According to the Presidents ruling, however, the Standing Orders are being interpreted in a manner which I deem contrary to common sense. The Standing Orders must be interpreted, not in any strained fashion, and not in such a manner as to pick upon any one word and rule that that word conveys an imputation. I repeat that I had no desire to impute motives to any one.  Indeed, I have refrained from discussing these sentences in the strong hope that the Government might see fit to mark the celebrations of Peace in a way which would make those sentenced men rejoice and bring joyful appreciation to their relatives as well. We have either to exercise here the rights which we have hitherto exercised amongst others, the right to ask questions for the purpose of eliciting in formation and without being bound down strictly to the language that we may use or we must be content to see those rights disappear. I admit that it is your province,, sir; to prevent a disorderly question appearing upon the noticepaper, .and I have _ never .questioned your authority in that matter. On the contrary, I accepted your ruling in that connexion at least on one occasion, because I believe that it is within your province to exercise that power. But when you exercise the power of determining that a question which contains no statement of fact, and which makes no imputation against anybody, but merely contains some adjectives which, in your opinion, are too strong, is disorderly, I hold that you are exceeding your functions. I do not care a dump for that aspect of the case, but I do care very seriously for the future conduct of business in this  Chamber if our rights are to be thus gradually whittled away. In passing, I may say that this whittling away of parliamentary rights is a notable feature, not only in Australia, but all over the world. We see our privileges here disappearing, probably because of an indifference on the part of honorable senators to resist encroachments upon them. Reading our Standing Orders without bias and without in any way trying to bolster up a case, I maintain that you gave your decision hurriedly and without considering whether I had asked the question for the purpose of eliciting information. I merely asked if it was a fact that a certain thing had happened I did not say that it had happened.

Questions of that kind are clearly barred, not only by our Standing Orders, but also :by the wisdom which is derived from experience. Senator Gardiner has raised the point that, under the interpretation given to our Standing Orders by the President, the power of honorable senators will be limited. I maintain that it will not be limited at all. There is ample room for the honorable senator to make imputations against these naval officers, but he must not make them by means of a question. He may move the adjournment of the Senate if he so desires, and upon that motion he will be at liberty to hurl all the condemnation that he chooses, either against .the officers who inflicted .these sentences, or against the sentences themselves. There is no Chamber in the world in which members have a greater freedom to express their views than they have here. But our Standing Orders are intended to cause honorable senators, in the first ,place, to ascertain what are the facts upon which, later, they may found their opinions. It seems to me that the matter is so simple, both by reason of the language of the standing order and also because of the quotation from Hansard which Senator Gardiner has made, that I was surprised to hear him venture to question your ruling. Once or twice in the course of his remarks it appeared to me that he was under the impression that you were in some way responsible for that decision. Now it may be that the standing order I have quoted is open to criticism I am not saying that it is but I want honorable senators to draw a wide distinction between a weak standing order and the decision of the President in interpreting it. I believe that the standing order in question is a sound and necessary one,, but, whether that be so or not, I submit that the President has given an accurate interpretation of it. For this reason, I hope that the Senate will decline to indorse the motion submitted .by .Senator Gardiner.

I say that your ruling in the case was wrong, because its tendency is to curtail the privileges of honorable senators. Where there is any doubt about the interpretation of a standing order and there is room for doubt about the interpretation of the standing order in question in this case it has been the custom of the presiding officer of the Senate to give his decision in such a way as to widen rather than restrict the privileges of honorable senators. If your ruling in . this case is to stand, an honorable senator will be debarred from asking such a question as It is a fact that leniency has been shown by the Government in certain sentences that have been inflicted ?

There can be no doubt whatever that Senator Gardiners question transgresses standing order 99.  The matter arose first of all by Senator Gardiner giving notice of his question. When my attention was directed to it. I decided that the use of the word  savage  represented the offering of an opinion, and an imputation against the officers who had passed the sentences referred to. It was a matter of common knowledge that certain sentences had been passed, and the use of the word  savage  in the honorable senators question represented an imputation against those sentences and against the officers who passed them.. It offered an opinion upon them, and asked from the Minister an expression of opinion as to whether they were savage or not. It is not permissible, in asking a question, to offer an opinion, nor is it permissible to put a question asking for an opinion from a Minister, nor to put a hypothetical question. The use of the word  savage  in the honorable senators question offered an opinion upon the sentences referred to. It was a comment on those sentences and an imputation on them. There can be no doubt whatever about that. My predecessors in office have frequently altered questions submitted by honorable senators. I have a long list of such occasions here, but I do not propose to read them all. I find that on the 26th November, 1908, Senator Stewart complained that his question had been censored in such a fashion as to make it quite useless foi his purpose. The then President, Sir Albert Gould, explained that the word misrepresentation, which appeared in the question as handed in, had been amended to read  representation. The latter word conveyed no expression of opinion as to the character of an advertisement, but the word used by the honorable senator did, and, therefore, the alteration had been made. Honorable senators will find a reference to that case in Hansard for 1908, at page 2247. That is absolutely in accordance with our Standing Orders j and in accordance with the practice of the House of Commons. When Senator Gardiner originally gave notice of his question, I directed the elimination of the word savage, and he then intimated to me that he desired the question removed from the noticepaper.","N/A","DISSENT FROM RULING","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[5]/para[4]","N/A","N/A"

From the day that I dame into this Senate I have always taken the stand that I would put. my questions in any own way, and I shall not allow the President to become my instructor as to how I shall ask questions.. If honorable senators cannot seethe difference, I can. I do not want to discuss in detail what took place between the President and myself in our conversation. I can quite understand that two persons may have a somewhat different impression as to what actually has been said, though each might give what he believed to be a correct report of the conversation. If a conversation is to be used in this way, we shall be compelled in future to . ask if use will . afterwards be made of what may be said in such circumstances. I am sorry that I have been dragged into this . phase of discussion. I point out again that I made no statement in the question I submitted to the Minister. I desired only to obtain information. Officially, we have no knowledge as to whether these sentences are inflicted1 or not, whether they were savage or brutal, or whether they were sentences that should have been inflicted by civilized men living in a civilized community. In my official position I. asked the Minister if it was a fact that savage sentences had! been imposed on men who had given four years of service to their country. If the Minister had risen in his place, and said that such sentences had . not been inflicted,, or that the sentences were not savage or severe, there would have been no debatable matter for the Senate. If honorable senators vote to curtail my liberty, they will interfere also with their own. Senator OKeefe put the question excellently. He said that, under the Presidents ruling, if an honorable senator inquired if an undue leniency had been shown in the imposition of certain sentences, that question, also, would have to be disallowed,, because it contained a statement of fact.. The President has himself shown how weak is his position, and he quotes, to justify himself, the view that Ministers need not answer questions without notice. We know that Ministers can always refuse to answer questions, and ask for notice. Invariably they do so. But the fact that a Minister need not answer a question does not take away from honorable senators the right to ask questions. As a matter of fact, questions that are quite within the Standing Orders, but which Ministers sometimes consider offensive, are treated with contempt, and are not answered. I am sorry that I did. not make myself as clear as I might have done, but in the House of Commons the question was asked if it was not a fact that a disloyal gathering was held at a certain spot in Ireland. Exception was taken to the statement  disloyal, but Mr. Speaker ruled that the question could be asked.

Any one who has sat here so long with me surely cannot put such an interpretation upon my remarks. In the case which occurred in the House of Commons, and which I have quoted, there was an imputation against a large number of people contained in the question ; that is, if we are to take the ruling of the President and apply it to the question put in the Commons. It may be, Mr. President, that, in the attitude which you have adopted, you are acting under fear of the Navy, and that you have had instructions from the naval authorities to prohibit the discussion of sentences imposed. It may be that the naval authorities object to such matters being debated in Parliament, for fear that such action may break down the discipline of the Navy. I shall not discuss the question itself at this stage, but I fully intend to do so at the first opportunity afforded me; and that, I take it, will be on the adjournment of the Senate this evening. It may be that the Navy is interfering. T know that parents and friends of our naval men in Sydney were endeavouring, a few weeks ago, to organize a club in that city. They had secured a room in the Educational Buildings for the purpose of holding a meeting. However, Commander Dumaresq saw Mr. Holman, and the meeting was prohibited, because that naval officer said it was intended to discuss the sentences on the Australia. Nothing had been further from .the minds of those people. They were not of the type who would discuss that subject. Their meeting was to organize the establishment of a clubroom, .where our naval men in Sydney could meet. When one knows of things like that, one may well think that there is an attempt here to hush up what the Navy is doing. Although I am restricted during this present debate in the matter of. airing my own opinions upon the whole subject, I can, in open discussion, use just exactly what expressions I may deem fit regarding those sentences; and I will use them upon the motion for the adjournment of the Senate, I emphasize that if my question is not in order, it will be scarcely possible for any honorable senator to ask any question which will be in order. I intend to take good care to ask you, sir, for a ruling upon every occasion which may arise. I have asked,  Is it a fact that savage and severe sentences have been imposed ?  It is for the Government to answer whether sentences of that nature have been passed. They can answer me definitely to the effect that no savage and severe sentences have been imposed. Indeed, they need not answer me at all. But for you, Mr. President, to rule that I have no right to put my question in. the form in which I have set it out is the most astonishing ruling which has ever been given. I have quoted a case which arose in the British House of Commons, where exception was taken to the importation of the word  disloyal  into a question, on the ground that it was an imputation. The Speaker definitely ruled that the question was in order, and he permitted it to be put.

It will be a pity if a decision of such a character is influenced by party considerations. I sincerely trust that the vote to be taken will not be a party decision. Standing order 99 states  In putting any such question, no, argument or opinion shall be offered, nor inference nor imputation made, nor any facts stated, except so far as may he necessary to explain such question; and the President may direct the Clerk to alter any question so as to conform with this order. What argument is applied in my use of the words is it a fact? It is merely asking the Government for information. I am not saying,  Savage and severe sentences were inflicted, and will the Government do something in the matter? I am merely inquiring, Is it a fact? If the Minister considered that my question had been asked for a double purpose, he could have refused to answer it. It is now, however, for honorable senators to come to a decision, and I have a doubt whether or not a decision has been arrived at, by the  Caucus  of the party Opposite, to the effect that I am to be outvoted. I hope there are honorable senators opposite sufficiently broadminded to take the stand that our rights shall not be curtailed. You, Mr. President, have displayed what I may call unconscious bias against me. I do not want to personally comment on that, but I remember an occasion when I endeavoured to address the Senate upon a very important matter, and the whole procedure of the Senate was set aside by you, Mr. President, in order to injure and coerce me.

It draws, attention to one of the stages of development that, we have reached in connexion with our lighthouses. Under the Navigation Act, which will probably come into operation a little later, there is power to compel the masters of vessels to report any, injuries inflicted, upon lighthouses. But the most recent development for the protection of Australian shipping around our coast as, indeed, in other parts of the world has taken the form of unattended lights. These lights are automatically operated with acetylene. They light up with the falling of darkness, and cease to burn at daylight. In the old days when caretakers were in charge of all lighthouses, there was somebody upon whom responsibility could be fixed for any damage which they might sustain. Under this Bill it. is proposed to compel any ship, or any person damaging any lighthouse or marine mark, to report the damage so done. In the case of a ship, she is required to report at her first port of call in Australia within twentyfour hours of her arrival there, whilst any person responsible for damage to any lighthouse or buoy is compelled, within fortyeight hours after its occurrence, to report to the Collector at the port nearest to the place where the damage was sustained: Most of these lights are located at distant parts of our coastline along the Queensland coast and that of the Northern Territory, for example many hundreds of miles from civilization. Unless the shipmaster, owner, or agent of any vessel which inflicts damage upon a lighthouse or marine mark is responsible for reporting that damage promptly, we may have a large portion of our coastline unlighted for some considerable time.

On the Tasmanian coast there are a number of unattended lights that are of very great importance. For instance, the light at Cape Wickham, on the northern part of King Island, is an unattended light. There was at one time a lighthouse at this place which cost the State of Tasmania a considerable amount of money.  to maintain. When the lighthouses were transferred to the Commonwealth, this was made an unattended light. I have to admit that it is not likely to be damaged by any passing ships, because it is on the mainland of King Island. . That, however, does not affect my argument. There are floating lights and buoy lights that are unattended. Some maintain their lights day and night, and others operate in such a way that the light shows from sunset to sunrise. If anything should happen to these lights the safety of human life and property might be seriously endangered. Under this Bill should any persons within our jurisdiction and that is a limitation we are apt sometimes to forget be responsible for the disappearance of any of these lights, or damage to them, they are compelled to notify the matter. I think we might go further, and if a person knows that a light has been damaged or displaced ","N/A","LIGHTHOUSES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/speech[4]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If a shipmaster has damaged a light, or knows that a light has been damaged through his own fault, or by the act of God, and it no longer operates, he will report the matter for the benefit of other navigators. I do not know that we shall be able to bring foreign ships under our jurisdiction in the matter, but certainly ships that are under our jurisdiction should be compelled to report such accidents to lights as early as possible, whether the masters are responsible for the damage or not.  Senator GARDINER. (New South Wales) [5.45 J. I was waiting for some other honorable senators to discuss this Bill. For the life of me I am unable to understand why the measure was introduced. To propose a penalty upon a master of a ship for not reporting damage to a light is about on a par with saying to a member of the Senate,  If you destroy one of the lights of this building which are established for our comfort and convenience, and do not report the matter to the President, you will be liable to a penalty of £100. There is no one more interested in the maintenance of the lights dealt with in this Bill than are the masters of ships. It is. proposed to impose drastic penalties upon them if they do not report any damage done to a light.

It would appear that some official carrying out duties under the Lighthouses Act has met with some little difficult, and he proposes in this Bill that it shall be remedied by the imposition of extreme penalties for something that is very unlikely to be done. It is very unlikely that any master qf a ship will damage a lighthouse or marine mark without reporting it. Under the Bill the owner, or agents, or charterers may be responsible for damage caused by the master of the ship, or what may have been the result of pure accident. A storm may have driven a ship upon a marine mark, and if it is damaged persons who are not responsible for the damage in any way may be held to be liable, to make it good. Honorable senators must remember that a case will be decided upon the letter of the law, and the intention of Parliament in passing it will be set aside.

It appears to me to be very loose draftsmanship to place upon the persons referred to in this Bill, the responsibility of repairing damage, even though it may have been caused accidentally.

With regard to the other part of the measure. I think it is very desirable indeed that if anybody does interfere with, or affect the value of any light or navigation mark, he should, at the earliest possible moment, be called upon to report; and, if he fails to do so, he should be penalized. Notwithstanding what Senator Gardiner has said concerning liability for damage done to lights in this building, I contend that the case is not in the, least degree parallel. Ocean marks, lighthouses, lightships, or buoys intended to insure the safety of navigation, must be treated very tenderly indeed by the whole community, because the slightest disarrangement of position or alteration in appearance may lead to grave disaster. Naturally, those who do go down to the sea in ships are very careful about them, and in 999 cases out of 1,000 a master or officer of a vessel noticing any damage to or alteration of any of these marks, enters the fact in the log, and notifies the first authority.","N/A","LIGHTHOUSES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/speech[7]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

There seems to be no difference of opinion as to the principle of the Bill, which is not regarded from a party standpoint. The intention of the measure is to perfect the machinery for. giving effect to the intention .of Parliament. As the result of an evolution in appliances, automatic lightships and buoys are coming more largely into use, and it is the intention of the Government to make a rapid extension of their use, particularly in the northern and western parts of Australia. These buoys require no attendance, and experience has shown that where damage has been done in the past the only action which the Government could take was to issue a caution that it should not be done again. The principle of liability for damage is a sound one; but in view of what has been said during the course of the debate I should like to consult further with the legal authorities. An attempt is being made to throw the onus of proof on the shipowner or the agent, and it is possible that in the draftsmanship the position has not been clearly stated, so  that in the event of damage being done the Court will be called upon merely to assess the extent of damage. That hardly expresses the intention of the Government. I am prepared to listen to any suggestion for the improvement of the Bill. . Senator Guthrie has made one, which appeals to me, concerning the liability of the agent or charterer. It is possible that a vessel leaving Australia might damage a lifebuoy at the last port of call and go away without notifying the fact. Senator Guthries suggestion that the master of such a vessel should be required to send a definite message, by wireless presumably, at the first opportunity, is well worthy of consideration, but I am not quite sure as to the power of the Commonwealth to enforce penalties against the agents or charterers of a vessel outside Australia, ","N/A","LIGHTHOUSES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

That is the object of this short Bill, which will widen the definition of  wireless telegraphy  so as to include . wireless telephony. The effect of the measure, will be that the Minister administering the Wireless Telegraphy Act will have the exclusive privilege of establishing stations for the transmission or receipt of messages by wireless telephony; but he may grant licences to other persons to establish such stations, on such terms and conditions as he thinks fit. No person in the Commonwealth will be permitted to establish any such station unless he has been granted a licence. Wireless telephony has not yet reached such a state of perfection that it is likely to supersede the ordinary telephone as a means of communication for use by the general public, but it has made rapid strides during the war, and as early as 1915 wireless telephone conversations took place between Washington and Paris. The difficulty which confronts inventors at present appears to be that of eliminating outside influences, and of insuring secrecy of conversation. These facts constitute additional reasons for placing this means of communication under the exclusive control of the Government.","Second Reading","WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/para[4]","N/A","N/A"

I move  That this Bill be now read a second time. It is a very short measure ; it deals with a subject upon which, I think, all honorable senators will agree. It proposes to give discretionary power to the Government to prevent the use of certain trade marks, and to protect such words of national significance as, for example,  Anzac  and Aussie. These words have been used, in some cases, by people who have had no right to employ them as they have done. There have also been certain letters used such, for example, as A.N. A. These letters have been attached to various manufactured articles with the implied purpose of impressing the public that the goods have been made in Australia. Briefly, the letters have been used to perpetrate a deception. This Bill is intended to protect the public. Further, there has been a practice among certain individuals, who have claimed to be the possessors of patent rights in specific productions, of threatening retail merchants that if they continue to handle those goods they will render themselves liable to prosecution. It is a case of pure bluff, and the parties putting up the bluff have no thought of carrying the matter to Court. Frequently, however, storekeepers have been scared, and have desisted from offering the goods for sale. This measure is not intended in any way to interfere with the rights of bond fide patentees.","Second Reading","TRADE MARKS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It has robbed Australasia .of credit it is entitled to. It has taken from our people the credit which Australians won. It is quite a catchy little word, and aptly indicates the original Australian and New Zealand Army Corps. But it has gathered round it today a meaning altogether beyond that. The word has distinctly taken from the people of Australia that to which they are justly entitled, and has given credit where it does not belong. I have read magazine articles dealing with the origin of  Anzac. It has been asserted that it has an Arabic source, and that it was the name of a bay or a peninsula in the neighbourhood of the scenes where the Australians and New Zealanders made it famous.

Clause 2 of the Bill meets the objection which. I had in my mind when I rose to address myself to the action of the Government in endeavouring to limit the use of the word Anzac, either by proclamation or regulation.  It is absurd for Ministers to lay themselves out to specialize any one particular word, and to prevent people from using it either as a trade mark, or as a name, or anything else. If there be something magical in the word Anzac, will the Government prevent men who fought at Gallipoli registering themselves as the Anzac Trading Company? They may be men whose limbs are buried at Gallipoli. They may be the men who made the name of  Anzac, and yet, under this Bill, the Government would prevent them registering it as a trade mark. Of course, I may be asked,  Would the Government be stupid enough to do that? My reply is Yes. They are stupid enough to do anything. SenatorFoll. How would it be to make an exception in favour of those men? A most excellent suggestion. I hope that the privilege will be accorded to those who gave a value to the name of Anzac to the men who accomplished the impossible. No less an authority than the late Lord Kitchener said that only the sight of these men in the position which they had won would have convinced him that a landing could be successfully made under such circumstances. Consequently, I am not exaggerating when I say that these men accomplished the impossible. Sitting suspended from 6.80 to 8 p.m. I have been wondering whether the Acting Minister for Defence would consent to an adjournment of this debate, seeing that the Bill seeks to give effect to a principle which should not be allowed to pass without the closest scrutiny. Had I moved the adjournment of the debate before addressing myself to the measure, I understand firomthe Government Whip that the motion would have been agreed to. Does the Acting Minister for Defence desire the second reading of . the Bill to be passed tonight? The progress which is being made in another place certainly does not warrant the assumption that we are likely to be overburdened with work during the next day or two. Under the Bill, I do not know whether persons seeking to trade with the initials A.I.F. may not find themselves prevented from so doing by Ministerial proclamation. I do not think that the Acting Minister, when making his secondreading speech, had in mind what was . likely to be the effect of the measure. Personally, I have a rooted objection to endowing the Government with any . power without first knowing how they intend to use it. I should like an assurance from the honorable gentleman that it is not intended to use the powers which, will be conferred by this Bill in the same way as Ministers used the powers that were conferred under the War Precautions Act. Here I Should like to point out the vast difference between the granting of powers under a proclamation and the granting of powers under regulations. In the former case neither branch of the Legislature can exercise any control over the Government.

I wish to make a reference to clause 3, and will leave the arguments I intend to use on clause 2 to a later hour of the day. Clause 3 provides that  3.After section 100 of the principal Act the following section is inserted:  100a. Where any person claiming to be the proprietor of a trade mark, by circulars, advertisements, or otherwise, threatens any other person with any legal proceedings or liability in respect of any alleged in infringement of the trade mark, any person aggrieved thereby may bring an action against him, and may obtain an injunction against the continuance of such threats, and may recover such damages (if any) as he has sustained thereby if the alleged infringement to which the threats related was not in fact an infringement of any legal rights of the person making the threats. Provided that this section shall not apply, if the person making the threats with due diligence commences and prosecutes an action for infringement of his trade mark. That is perfectly clear. I have in mind a particular case which affected the Commonwealth Government, where a company corporation or combination of companies not only by threats, but by actions, obtained from the . Government a concession of immense value, and cash down to the amount of £5,000. I am referring to the Government of which Mr. Glynn was AttorneyGeneral, and was directly responsible for the agreement under which this was done. I refer to the case of the Telefunken Australian Wireless and Marconi Company in their attack upon the Commonwealth Government for an alleged infringement of wireless patents. I believe that the proposed new section 100a is intended to prevent people from making money merely by bluff, as Senator Russell has said. In the case to which I refer, the most magnificent piece of bluff, that was ever put up on any country was carried to a successful conclusion by the ineptitude, or worse, of the Government that handled the case on behalf of the Commonwealth.","Second Reading","TRADE MARKS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue[13]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","GARDINER, Albert","KKZ","N/A","N/A","N/A","10733","I think I can make it clear to Senator Keating that my statement is correct. One may wonder whether this principle is being carried far enough. I take it that Ministers have in mind the need for preventing this kind of bluff being used for the profit of trading companies, and that it is proposed that costs may be given if the case goes against them, against persons who threaten action, or something worse, for an infringement of their rights.  The case I have in mind is this. The Commonwealth had secured an important system of wireless telegraphy that did not in the slightest degree infringe any patents previously published. The Telefunken first took the matter up, but as they had no registered patents in this country they knew they could not carry it out, and they transferred the matter to. the Marconi Company. It might be as well to say here that the Telefunken Company, the Australian Wireless, and the Marconi Company are all one and the same, though they have shareholders of different names holding various interests. They threatened action against the Commonwealth for infringement of their patents. The Commonwealth prepared to defend the action. As I have said, the Telefunken Company handed the matter over to the Marconi Company, and the case came. before the Courts eventually. The High Court decided that in such a case they were not in a position to give a decision as to whether an infringement had taken place unless they could be i shown that it had by expert evidence. The Fisher Government secured the best expert obtainable by bringing from Great Britain, at great expense, Mr. Swinburne, who is a very high authority on wireless telegraphy. He made a sworn declaration that he was thoroughly acquainted with the existing published patents of all the wireless companies, and that the Australian Commonwealth system, which was the invention of Father Shaw, was 33 per cent, a better system than any other then in existence, and was in no way an infringement of any existing patents. One can see at a glance the bluff that was put up by the Marconi and Telefunken people. They knew that their case would go by the board if that expert evidence came before the Court. They had not, however, lost their punch in bluffing, wheedling, and swindling Australia out of its money. An agreement was entered into by the Government thai displaced the Fisher Government in 1913. This Government was in office for less than twelve months, and after it wa» beaten, at the poll, in 1914, it signed an agreement giving the Marconi Company £5,000, ostensibly for some patents they had in possession, and the case was not allowed to go beyond the stage it had reached. The Commonwealth, was bluffed into that agreement. They got patents that expired in the following November. Possibly the Minister may have had facts like this in his. mind when he sought to protect people from being bluffed. I hope he did, because what I refer to is one of the landmarks of swindling by . big companies ; possibly it has never been excelled in Australia. If that was in the mind of the Government, I welcome the Bill, but it is in the nature of a deathbed repentance for all the ill deeds that they have been, responsible for. It is evidently an attempt on the part of the Government to* enable private companies, firms, or persons to obtain legal redress for any threatened action. I draw attention,, however, to the proviso which states","Second Reading","TRADE MARKS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue[15]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","GARDINER, Albert","KKZ","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I think that proviso should be struck out,, because it gives one the impression that,, although the Government determined to do something to protect the people, they relented, and have half slammed the door against the remedy in cases of groundless threats by enabling the persons who make such threats to escape if  with due diligence  they commence and prosecute arn action. I hope the Minister will agree to strike out the proviso.  The next clause deals with the penalty for unauthorized assumption of the Royal Arms or the arms of the Commonwealth. We have to be very careful when dealing with this matter, for we must remember that under regulations, such as are permissible under this Bill, a person who favours red as a colour, and flies it in the form of a flag over his house, is in danger of prosecution, although, from his viewpoint, the red flag is emblematical of the common blood that runs through the veins of the people of all nations. Clause 4 seeks to repeal section 113 of the principal Act, and to insert in its stead the following: (1)No person shall, without the authority of the King, or of some member of the Royal Family, or of the GovernorGeneral, or of the Governor of a State, or of some Department of the Government of the Commonwealth or of a State (proof whereof shall lie upon the person accused), assume or use in connexion with any trade, business, calling, or profession the Royal Arms or Arms so nearly resembling the Royal Arms as to be likely to deceive. (2)No person shall,, without the authority of the King or of some member of the Royal Family That is a very vague term.What constitutes, the Royal Family? or of the GovernorGeneral, or of some Department of the Government of the Commonwealth (proof whereof shall lie upon the person accused), assume or use in connexion with any trade, business, calling, or profession, the arms of the Commonwealth, or arms so nearly resembling the arms of the Commonwealth as to The likely to deceive. It may be necessary for the Government to amend some of our existing legislation which has been so Satisfactory for so long, and wake up to the fact that the Royal Arms of England are not to be used for trading purposes. I do not know whether my memory serves me aright, but I think I can remember seeing the Royal Arms of England on a whisky advertisement, and I am quite sure that the Royal Arms of Scotland the lion rampant has been seen on such advertisements for many a long day. It appears, however, that the Government have decided that it is to be an offence to use these emblems of Royal authority for trade purposes, and by proclamation people doing so are to be brought within the law. I should like some definition of the words  some member of the Royal Family. Will it be His Majesty the King, Her Majesty the Queen, one of the Princes, one of the Princesses, or some other relation ? Will it . be the uncle of His Majesty King George the Imperial Kaiser grandson of . our late very respected Queen Victoria? If the Kaiser has become skilful at. the occupation he is supposed now to be employed at wood cutting I can imagine how pleased Senator Lynch would probably be if he were transported to Western Australia to continue his occupation there, and company promoters might thus have authority to emblazon the Royal Arms on the companys notepaper. I ask the Minister to give a definition of what constitutes  some member of the Royal Family. This is a serious question. It is really time that, in this free Commonwealth, we got away from worn and threadbare statements that mean nothing. We should come down to the plain business reading of our laws, and I contend that  some member of the Royal Family, in its application to this Bill, is not plain business reading. The proper authority to . give or withhold the right to use the coatsofarms is the Government of the country, and we would be wise in our day nd generation if we made that simple fact plain in all our legislation. I give second place to no one in my respect for those in authority. I never, by innuendo or insinuation, reflect upon authority, because I recognise that in every form of society the Government that is, is right. Every sensible man will . recognise that authority must rest somewhere, and in this Commonwealth, by virtue of our Constitution, authority rests in the sovereign people. If the sovereign people are satisfied to conduct their business under laws and a Constitution, assented to by the Royal House of Britain, well and good. But authority to use certain emblems and trade marks should be exercised by the Government of the country. The only authority vested with the power to permit the use, or compel the disuse, of the Royal CoatofArms within the Commonwealth is the Commonwealth Government. What if the Government were to say,  We shall refuse the use of the Royal Arms to such and such a firm, and what if that firm produced an authority from some member of the Royal Family to make use of the Royal Arms? A very complicated situation would arise. There might be a big brewing interest which had among its shareholders some member of the Royal Family. That company might be trading under the Royal CoatofArms. The position would be a nice one ; but there is only one . authority having the supreme control, and that is the Government of the Commonwealth. No one today questions the right of the people to govern themselves.","Second Reading","TRADE MARKS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/para[4]","N/A","N/A"

But while the States exist we must recognise that, .within their sphere, they have the power of government. If the Commonwealth authorities have the power to deal with trade marks we can well afford to delete from this measure all reference to the authority of the State. On several grave occasions recently we have witnessed conflicts between State and Commonwealth authority. The New South Wales Government violently repudiated the authority of the Commonwealth Government in connexion with a menace which has proved one of the most terrible in the history of Australia. Ministers of that State went out of their way to flout the Commonwealth Government, for what reason I do not know. Honorable senators will recall the famous, or infamous, case of a New South Wales Premier now Sir Joseph Carruthers seizing the property of the Commonwealth Government by force; I refer to the wirenetting incident. We have to pay tribute to the tactfulness of those who were charged with the protection of that commodity, and who knew that it was not worth while to resist force with force, but were content to leave it as a matter of law between the State and Commonwealth authorities, ls the language of this Bill so clear that a Court could give a definite decision asserting the supreme authority as between State and Commonwealth? It may be argued that in all our legislation wherein conflict between State and Commonwealth could arise, the power of the latter is supreme. Nevertheless, this Bill contains a clause wherein the Commonwealth Government propose to confer equal powers on a State authority. When a State can come into conflict with the Commonwealth over such a deadly subject as the influenza epidemic, it does not require much effort of imagination to anticipate trouble in connexion with a comparatively, trivial matter, such as trade marks.  Study of the Bill reveals that, not only are the proposed powers to be given to a State Government, but actually to a State Department. I can imagine a wheat company being formed under the authority of a State Department, which grants the use of the Royal or Australian CoatofArms. In justification of such action that Department would be able to point to the constitutional rights conferred upon it under this Commonwealth measure. On my reading of the Bill, the Department of Agriculture would be able to permit a company which was trading in wheat to use the Australian Coat of Arms.","Second Reading","TRADE MARKS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue[17]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If there is to be a penalty imposed for using the Royal Arms of England, why should there not be a penalty prescribed for using the Royal Arms of Scotland? Will the Acting Minister for Defence accept an amendment in the direction of prescribing a penalty for using the recognised arms of Scotland and Wales? I am told that Australia had no seal which could be attached to the Peace Treaty which was recently signed by the Prime Minister on her behalf, and that, as a result, the seal of Wales was used. Personally, I think that even if it had to be torn from a sheet of notepaper, the coatofarms of Australia should have been affixed to that Treaty. But probably the unauthorized use of it would have been dangerous, and the Prime Minister might conceivably have been called upon to pay a fine of £20. Anyhow, he attached to the historic document the seal of the country to which he belongs. Clause 5 of the Bill contains a long and difficult definition of what the GovernorGeneral may do, and in this connexion I would again appeal to honorable senators to realize the difference that exists between doing things by proclamation and doing them by regulation. I venture to say that the people of Australia are  not in favour of giving powers to the GovernorGeneral in Council. They are not prepared to vest in the Executive, powers which they are unable to control except through the medium of a censure motion in Parliament. Take the word  Anzac  by way of illustration. Let us suppose that some person who desires to make that word bigger than it is attempts to add to it the letter  C, so as to embrace the Canadian Forces, which fought so admirably, thus converting the word into  Canzac. The Government propose to prevent words like these from being used by trading companies. The word  Anzac  is. too sacred. Taking the broader view, I, as the head of a company, propose to include Canada, and make the word  Cart.zac. If I do so, a charge may be laid against me for, using the word without authority, and with the intention to deceive, and I may be liable to a penalty of £20. What is a penalty of £20 to a big trading company?  Before honorable members settle down at .the beginning of a session, we find these fool, measures presented. I use the term advisedly. What is the use of trying by legislation >to say that certain words are of such importance that the* Government should issue a proclamations preventing their use? If we desire to» keep the words in use, we should permit the people to use them everywhere. That will not degrade them, but will elevate them. Their general use will make them part of our everyday life.

This measure was introduced late in the afternoon, after two other Bills had been passed, and the Minister is not warranted in persisting with it. The fact that a Bill has been introduced in this Senate warrants honorable senators in demanding its full consideration. It should not be rushed through in a single day. I do not mind the progress of the measures that have gone through, but apparently the Government resent my speaking on the third Bill, and what has happened this afternoon will make me all the more careful for the future. I have shown that each of the three amendments in the Bill are most important. The Government are preparing for legislation by proclamation, and under this measure we have not had the faintest idea, from the Ministers speech, as to what form the proclamation will take. It may embody the most fantastic idea of an absurd and fantastic Government, but if it does, it will only bring greater discredit on an already discredited Government. It is the duty of the Minister, in the course of his reply to inform the Senate and the country in what direction the Government propose to use these enormous powers which are to be given to the Governor General. Probably if I speak much longer the length of my remarks and the lateness of the hour will be the excuse for a noncompliance with my request, and as I am anxious to get full information I shall not delay the Senate longer. If this power is conferred upon the GovernorGeneral there may be no limit to its use. Some fad, some sudden impulse, some expression of public opinion, or strong feeling running through the community will one day impel some brilliant genius of this or some other Government to use the powers sought for in this measure, and perhaps prevent the use of certain trade marks. All the forces at the command of the Commonwealth will be brought to bear to enforce the proclamation.

You cannot use it. He is going to make things cheap by making them dear through a high protective duty. Therefore, we shall prevent you from using the words. High protective duties and carrying on the war after peace has been signed will become the trade mark of this Government at a not very distant date, and if any one not in the counsels of the Government attempts to use those words a proclamaion will no doubt be issued, signed by the Acting Minister for Defence, or the GovernorGeneral, or some equally exalted personage perhaps a member of the Royal Family.

I mentioned earlier during this sitting that at the first opportunity which is this moment I would discuss the sentences inflicted upon a number of the seamen on board H.M.A.S. Australia. It is some weeks since those sentences were imposed, and I have waited in the hope that the Government would realize how savage and brutal they were, and what a shock to the conscience of the community it has been that our seamen, after four years in the North Sea, should come home to  Australia and be sentenced to two years imprisonment for daring to wait on their Commanding Officer in the form of a deputation. For that is all they were guilty of. After the deputation, other things may have occurred. Events in these present days are so grave that the Government would do well to mark the celebration of Peace by. the restoration of those sailors to the status they enjoyed before that unhappy day at Fremantle. It may be said, of course, that discipline has to be maintained. Discipline never will be maintained among our Australian sailors and soldiers if it is to be upheld by the stupidity of British officers. The one offence of these sailors was that they dared to wait on their officers. If they are kept in gaol while the people of Australia are celebrating Peace, an injustice will have been inflicted which will never be forgotten or forgiven. I recall the case of the soldiers on board the transport Argyllshire. It will be remembered that about 1,100 of them were landed under authority at a quarantine station in New .South Wales. There they were marched into an unsuitable camp. Snakes and vermin, crawled all over the place. Exercising their sound common sense, these Australian fighting, men, in defiance of their officers, marched en masse out of that camp. It may be said that for that slight infringement of discipline those troops should have been punished. That would have been the British method of enforcing discipline. But such, conduct would have spelt disaster if it had been tried upon those Australian boys. The Government were fortunate in having in New South Wales a Commanding Officer of such sound sense and judgment as General Lee. When he heard that the men had disobeyed orders had mutinied, if honorable senators like to put it that way and had taken the boat on to Sydney, did he arrest and court martial them ? . He did nothing so stupid or dangerous.* He met them, and had a talk with them, and then, he marched them to the Sydney Cricket Ground. There was no disorder. They were kept under control and away from contact with the people of the city. Thus a disaster was averted. Of course, the ringleaders could have been brought up and punished, but General Lee might have said that they were all ringleaders; and, for such an offence against discipline, the Sydney gaols might have been packed with a thousand prisoners from the Argyllshire. The good judgment of an Australian officer prevented such a situation. It should be remembered that the men on board the Australia had been under keen active service conditions for four years in the North Sea. Then there came one day of glorious liberty at Fremantle, where the people, in welcoming them home, possibly overdid their hospitality. It was inevitable that the men who had enjoyed such a kindly reunion with Australia should desire an opportunity to return the hospitality.","H.M.A.S.

I emphasize that no breach of discipline occurred which was so serious as to warrant the imprisonment for two years of a man who had won signal honours in the heroic exploit at Zeebrugge. There is no word strong enough to express my condemnation of such sentences. The Australia came into Sydney Harbor, and the mothers of those lads went down to meet them. The prisoners were marched off in irons under the womens eyes. One woman dropped to the ground, and so great was the shock that her life was . despaired of for days. That was an outcome of the brutality of those officers an act worthy of the fiercest term that could be employed.  There is scarcely, a camp in Britain or Prance where discipline has not been broken and orders disobeyed by Australian soldiers who were dissatisfied with existing conditions. Large  numbers of our men were carried away by the impulse of the moment. But it should not be forgotten that impulses such as those which sent many of our lads to gaol were identical with the imputes which won Australia fame. I hope that the good sense of the Government will lead them to regard the sentences upon the seamen in the same light as does the whole of Australia. There is discontent, and, indeed,, a feeling of degradation over those sentences. The Minister, no doubt, will claim that the whole matter is beyond the control and authority of the Government. We handed our warships over to the Imperial authorities to assist in the protection of the whole Empire. We placed our own sailor boys under the control of Imperial officers; and if the latter can provide no better reward for those lads after their services have been completed and the war is over, then our blood will continue to boil with indignation until redress is granted. I hope the Peace celebrations will not occur if those men. are to remain in .gaol. What would have been rejoicing on my part will be sorrow, so long as I know that the parents of those lads are sitting sadly in their homes instead of participating in the general joy. If the Government continue to carry out a barbarous sentence, they will be parties to an exhibition of vindictiveness and savagery such as one would expect only from an uncivilised nation. The situation would have been different had those mcn been going into action instead of returning home at the conclusion of the war. No doubt, the sentences arc right and just from the viewpoint of the British naval authorities. It may be an affront to an officer to be compelled to even speak to an ordinary fighting seaman.","H.M.A.S.
