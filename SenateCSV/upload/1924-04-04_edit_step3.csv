The Treaty was signed on 24th July,. 1923. Australia has been at war with Turkey, not merely because we are part of the British Empire. Our soldiers haveactually fought the Turks at Gallipoli and Palestine, and until this Treaty is ratified a state of war with Turkey still exists. The matter has been delayed owing to the British elections, but the present British Prime Minister, Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, is now urgently pressing the Commonwealth Government to ratify the Treaty. The Prime Minister of the Commonwealth (Mr. Bruce), on his return from the United Kingdom, paid a visit, to Turkey, where,, I am glad to say, he wastreated with the greatest courtesy, and he testifies to the great respect that the people of Turkey have for Australia.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","PEARCE, George","K0F","N/A","NAT","N/A","353","It is, and that fact constitutes a reason why we should ratify the Treaty promptly in order to show the people of Turkey that, whiteour soldiers, like their own, are good fighters, now that the fight is over we are quite willing to shake hands. The original Treaty with Turkey, known as the Treaty of Sevres, for reasons which the Senate will not wish me to recapitulate, was not ratified; but it will be remembered that after it was signed war broke out afresh between Greece and Turkey, with varying: results. At one time Greece appeared to be victorious, but ultimately Turkey prevailed. Out of that conflict a state of war between Turkey, on the one hand, and Britain and France, on the other, was narrowly averted. It was only the firm attitude taken up by Britain that prevented it. Had the British Govern . ment displayed weakness, that part of Europe would undoubtedly have been once more plunged into war. It is only another instance of how a firm attitude on. the part of Great Britain has maintained peace in Eastern Europe. As a result of the conflict between Greece and Turkey, an armistice was arranged and signed at Mudania in October, 1922. This was followed by prolonged negotiations and various conferences. It was not until July, 1923, that an agreement was finally reached at Lausanne. The provisions of the Treaty then signed have been well discussed in the public press, and copies of the Treaty are available for honorable senators if they desire to peruse them. I shall sketchits main provisions. Turkey relinquishes any rights she may have to Syria, Palestine, Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Soudan. The freedom of the Straits of Gallipoli and of access through the Dardanelles to the Black Sea for all forms of shipping of all nations is secured. The control of the Straits is placed under an International Commission, under the auspices of the League of Nations. On that Commission the British Empire is represented. This brings us, of course, to the responsibility of the League and the nations comprising it to maintain the freer dom of the Straits, because certain obligations rest upon Australia, as a signatory to the Treaty and as a nation represented on the League of Nations;, but the sovereign right of this Parliament to determine in what way we shall give effect to those obligations under the Treaty are not invaded. The obligation may be there, but the ultimate decision as to how effect shall be given to it will always remain the sovereign right of this Parliament. It is satisfactory to note, in view of her strong historical claim to a voice in these matters, that Russia has signed the Treaty. The safety of Australian soldiers graves and memorials on Gallipoli and in other parts of Turkish territory is provided for, and the land upon which they are situated is granted to us in perpetuity. That is the feature of the Treaty that should be deemed very satisfactory by the relatives of the soldiers buried there. The rights of Australian citizens who happen to be resident in Turkey or to be travelling in that country are fully safeguarded in common with those of all nationals. Attached to the Treaty is a Convention on Trade, but it is optional for any part of the Empire not to be a party to it, and as the most favoured nation treatment is involved, although we have a small trade with Turkey, the Commonwealth Government do not consider it advisable in the interests of Australia  that we should be a party to that Convention. Accordingly, we have notified our desire not to be a party to it. A Reparations Commission has been set up on which Britain is represented, and Australians who have any claims for damage caused during the war have the right to place them before that body. Those are the main provisions of the Treaty, and I am sure the Senate will see the wisdom of passing the motion in order to give the Government an intimation that this Chamber desires the Treaty with Turkey to be ratified.  Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","TREATY WITH TURKEY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The insolvents discharge is surely a matter which mostly concerns himself. Why should the trustee be asked to interfere? Section 167 of the Queensland Act deals with the matter more effectively than this clause does. It provides that the insolvent may, of his own volition, apply for his discharge, and it confers on creditors certain powers if they wish to be indulgent to an insolvent, while at the same time it grants a discretion in the matter to the Court. The elimination by . the present Bill of the powers of the creditors removes them from a sphere in which they are specially interested. I hold no brief for Queensland in this matter. My one desire is to improve the measure, and I ask that the clause be amended by the insertion of section 167 of the Queensland Act.

It too often happens that among the creditors of a bankrupts estate little cliques are formed, and the control of the affairs of a general meeting of creditors may be in the hands of a very small number of men. If they were required to give only three days notice, such a clique could remove a trustee for no other reason than that he would not give way to them. The removal of a trustee is an important act. He is chosen for his integrity and capacity, and the time to consider whether he is the right man is when he is appointed. If his removal is to be in the hands of a small section of creditors in the particular spot where a meetingcan be called, to the exclusion of creditors in other parts of the country, who could come in seven, but not in three clays, an injustice may be done. Seven days notice is sufficiently short. The notification of the meeting could not reach some of the creditors in three days bj post, and even if telegraphed, there would not be time for them to arrange for voting by proxy.

It provides that thecreditors may, by resolution at a meeting called for the purpose, of which certain notice has been given, remove a trustee for certain reasons. A meeting of creditors is not always a body suitably constituted to determine whether accusations against a trustee are justifiable or are borne out by evidence. It might happen that a majority ofcreditors wished to remove the trustee for motives of personal pique, and they might Carry a resolution depriving him of his office. Under the clause the trustee would have the safeguard that the matter would have to go before the Court, which would review the decision of the creditors and determine whether, on the evidence, he had been guiltyof the misconduct alleged against him. It might be a safeguard to the insolvent to retain the trustee in office. He might be acting in accordance with the interests of the insolvent, but not in accordance with the wishes of a majority of the creditors.  It is wise and proper to give the Court the discretion df saying whether the decision of the meeting of creditors should bc acted upon. Clause agreed to.

This clause provides that the official trustee shall administer all estates where neither the assets nor liabilities exceed ?300. It must be apparent that at first it will be very . difficult, if not impossible, to determine whether the value of the assets of an estate are or are not within the limit. Very frequently an insolvents statement of affairs discloses little or no property, but, through the acumen and energy of the trustee, property of considerable value may be recovered for the creditors. The best interests of the community demand that no estate, however small, should be withdrawn from the ambit of the creditors trustee. I should like the Honorary Minister (Senator Crawford) to postpone the clause to enable me to submit an amendment.

It applies only to very small estates of ?300and under, and in such cases it should not be difficult for a trustee to discover whether all a bankrupts assets have been revealed. The provision applies particularly to the insolvencies of, say, working men, and ?300 is, I think, a fair limit. A great majority of the estates dealt with will be valued under that amount. We have already provided in the Bill that a trustee appointed by the creditors shall receive certain remuneration for his services. The object of the clause is to obviate the necessity of paying for a trustee in connexion with small estates in order to avoid expense, and so to enable a larger dividend to be available to the creditors. It simplifies procedure in small estates, and leaves a larger amount to be divided amongst the creditors than would be the case if a certain portion had to be paid to a trustee. The official receiver would be a Government officer, and would not receive any portion of the estate.

For the information of those honorable senators who received telegrams concerning the action being taken in connexion with the Kalamunda Convalescent Farm, I may say that this and similar institutions were established by the Repatriation Commission in the various States to form a link in the chain of medical treatment of exsoldiers. The chain was a carefully considered scheme, and was adopted after consultation with eminent medical advisors. The necessity for convalescent farms has now practically disappeared, and their use is tending towards encouraging the inmates to abstain from trying to take their part in the life of the community, which is not in the best interests of the inmates themselves. The medical advisers support the Repatriation Commission in closing the farm. The Victorian farm has just been closed and the Queensland one will also be shut down in a few months. As the men have all been classified, and are, being handled  in various suitable ways, it is proposed to close . Kalamunda before the end of the calendar year. Dr. McWhae, of Perth, and the Principal Departmental Medical Officer for Australia, after personally examining every inmate and his medical history, are very strongly. of the opinion that it is not only unnecessary, but undesirable, to continue Kalamunda after the next few months. No final decision will, however, be made for a few weeks, so that the representations of honorable senators may be fully considered.  Question resolved in the affirmative.","Kalamunda Convalescent Farm","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
