This is a favorable opportunity to let the Leader of the Government know that this method of conducting business must cease. I am not threatening. I merely point out that we expect to have large reinforcements on this side next week. If our Standing Orders do not permit of our conducting business in the manner we desire, let us amend them. The continual suspension of the Standing Orders, to my mind, is an indication that they do not fit in with our method of conducting business. One of two things must happen either we must make the Standing Orders such that they will suit the business we have to conduct, or meet at such a time that there will be no occasion for this continual suspension of the Standing Orders. The Standing Orders should operate sometimes when important business is going through the Senate. Some of the most important business of this Senate for years has been transacted with the aid of the suspension of the Standing Orders. At the beginning of a new session this Senate might well take into grave consideration the nature of the Standing Orders, and insure that such methods as this are not necessary to enable us to conduct our business. It will be a little more troublesome to suspend the Standing Orders hereafter than it has been. I hope that the Minister will realize that this Senate should have financial measures at least a clear week before honorable senators are required to discuss them. No fear of interference with any one will prevent me from debating to the fullest extent necessary any financial measure that comes before this Senate. If the Minister will see that we get our financial measures at least a clear week before the appropriation is required to be made and that is not asking very much we on this side will work in the most complete harmony with the Government. If the Minister does not see to that I shall consider that the Government are determined not to work in harmony with honorable senators on this side. I do not make that statement in the boastful spirit of a man who expects large reinforcements. Too long have we suffered! by reason of the fact that business has been unduly hurried through by means of the suspension of the Standing Orders.

He would make it appear that he is the only just man in this Senate. My recollection is that when there has been occasion the strongest protest against rushing business through has come from the Ministerial side; we have had great difficulty in persuading our supporters to agree to the suspension of the Standing Orders. Under the leadership of Senator E. D. Millen, and as the result of protests made by honorable senators on this side, a very considerable improvement was effected in regard to the time available for the discussion of Supply Bills, and the Senate has been given greater time for the consideration of those measures than was formerly the practice. I intend to continue that practice as far as I possibly can. I should like to say, however, that there are occasions when this motion should be passed to meet the convenience of the Senate itself. The passage of such a motion does not necessarily imply that the measure to which it relates is not given full consideration. Very often I have seen more time taken up in discussing the question whether the Standing Orders should be suspended than subsequently was devoted to the measure itself. 1 shall at all times endeavour to see that honorable members are allowed ample time.

It is not the intention or desire of the Commonwealth Government that the States should be relieved of their ordinary obligations in regard to roadmaking, but this represents an additional sum of £1,000,000 to be spent on the construction of main roads throughout the Commonwealth. On a previous occasion £250,000 was provided by the Commonwealth Government for a similar purpose, and the money was distributed on a per capita basis. The Government, however, on reviewing the position, thought that that was not the best or most equitable way of distributing the money, as some Stateswhich have a comparatively small population scattered over a wide area have heavier obligations in respect to main roads than smaller States with a large population. Having that in view, the Government have decided to distribute threefifths of this amount on a per capita basis, and two fifths on an area basis.","Second Reading","MAIN ROADS DEVELOPMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","PEARCE, George","K0F","N/A","N/A","N/A","422","I do not know if that would help a great deal, as the limited use of motor cars, in my judgment, is due, not to the capital cost, but rather to the running costs.. Recently there have been substantial reductions in. the coat of motor cars, and if. we were to ask any one using motor. vehicles, especially those in. the country, what was retarding motor trans port,. they would say bad roads, the high cost of fuel, and the cost of spare parts. I have recently completed a very long motor trip of 1,400 miles over country which has; not a single yard of macadamized road. As a result of. that experience,. I think that, given cheap fuel and a comparatively small expenditure on roadmaking in the north o£ Australia, there would be a tremendous increase in the development aid the closer settlement of that, part of the country. This applies to Western Queensland, the whole of the Northern Territory, the north of South Australia, and the northwest of Western Australia. For eight months of the year that country is ideal for motor transport. When we come to the southern, eastern, and western portions of the Commonwealth we know that that country is not adapted for motor transport unless good roads are provided. But given that provision, I believe, the motor will play a very big part in the development of Australia. We know from actual experience that the one big factor militating against the success of railway transport is the high cost of railway construction and maintenance. It seems to me that in the process of the future development of this country we should aim at the construction of main lines of railways to carry the heaviest traffic, and that those main lines should be fed by a series of motor roads. That would necessitate providing fey private enterprise, or, if necessary, by some system of Government organization, cheap motor fuel. That problem devolves first of all on those who have control of motor fuel in Australia. It is so important to the development of the interior of Australia that if those who have that obligation thrust upon them do not , do their duty and provide cheaper fuel, the people of this country will demand that Government, action betaken. The need for cheap motor fuel is becoming more and more pressing and urgent. The present means for the supply of motor fuel for use on our roads is so primitive and costly that it is a reflection on the business interests. Today motor fuel is taken to one or two ports in tank steamers and1 transferred to other tanks ashore. It is then placed in tins or drums and distributed around the coast. The steamer freights are high, and after the vessels reach the ports of destination the fuel, is sent inland, very often by waggon team, and sometimes by camel team, so that when the motor spirit does reach the purchaser in the interior it is at such a cost as to make motor transport impossible. I have pleasure in moving the second reading of this Bill because, by increasing the number of good roads throughout the Commonwealth, we shall create public interest in motor transport. The business in terests, both Federal and State, will need to take action to encourage that form of transport, so essential in a country of such vast area as is Australia, for the good of . the people.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","GARDINER, Albert","KKZ","N/A","N/A","N/A","423","Absolutely. All that Senator Pearce has said in regard to the necessity for good roads we can indorse; hut is the principle of this Bill sound? According to the schedule, New South Wales will receive £138,000, and Tasmania, at the other end of the list, will receive £25,000. The financial situation today is graver than it was yesterday, and was worse yesterday than it was twelve months ago. Time will not make the .position of the country any better unless Governments will realize the importance of finance. Before us is a proposal which Senator Pearce admits is the initiation of a new system of grants by the Federal authority to the States. If the Government had brought down a well thoughtout scheme for the construction of trunk roads, showing how much money was to be expended, how the roads were to be used as feeders for railways, and how the community would benefit by the expenditure, there would be less opposition than there is to the hurried announcement that the Government will grant £500,000 to the States, but will, of course, supervise the expenditure of the money. 1 suppose the supervision will take the form of insuring that particularly good roads are made where there are dozens of people with motor cars. The number of motorists will be the excuse for the construction of better roads in certain localities. A bullock waggon can drag through any sort of road, but motor cars must have good roads; therefore; this £500,000 will be spent where the roads can be  made better for motorists. I am not an opponent of motor cars; on the contrary, I would admit them into the Commonwealth free of duty, and I would have such a system of wellconstructed roads that the petrol consumption and cost of running would be reduced. Senator Pearce spoke of the growing importance of  motor traction and cheap fuel. I venture to say that good roads will make for cheaper fuel, because a motor car will travel further to the gallon of petrol on a good road than on a bad one.  The question the Senate has to consider is whether this money is to be expended wisely. Suppose that £500,000 were utilized for the establishment in each. State of mills for the manufacture of cement to be supplied to the State Governments at cost price for the construction of concrete roads. In Australia, concrete roads will be a greater success than they are in the United States of America, because they will not be subject to the hard freezing that detrimentally affects concrete in Northern America. If we could start with a practical scheme in five or six States for establishing factories to manufacture cement, and supply it to the State Governments at low cost, we would be taking a practical step to wards the creation of good roads; we would be creating the machinery by which good roads could be made more cheaply than at the present time. I have not travelled in a motor car as far as Senator Pearce has done, and I have not travelled much in a bullock waggon, but when I see along main roads maintenance men repairing the roads with sand that has been washed into the gutters by the rain, knowing that the next rain will undo their work, I ask whether that is effective road maintenance? In any considered scheme for road development there must be provision for the construction of roads that will stand the wear and tear of traffic and weather. This Bill, which involves the expenditure of £500,000, offers no guarantee in that regard. All of the States will rush to get their respective shares of the grant. They will certainly spend the money as well as they can, and under the old system of Government control of roads in New South Wales good roads were built, but it is one of the peculiar features of local government in that State, that no sooner was the control of roads placed in the hands of those people who benefit most by them, than their fear of taxing themselves exceeded their appreciation of good roads, and; indirectly they taxed themselves thousands of pounds through the increased cost of haulage over almost impassable roads. There seems to be a grave possibility of the present Government following the example set by their predecessors, who spent millions of pounds in connexion with repatriation, war service homes, and other activities, and who, when asked what they had done, could merely reply,  Look at the millions of pounds we have spent. On this occasion the amount is only £500,000, and it is to be spread over the whole continent.","Second Reading","MAIN ROADS DEVELOPMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Government propose to distribute £500,000 amongst the States on the vague supposition that they are inaugurating a new policy, and a system of good main roads.

Its financial and other problems are so big and urgent, and are so wrapped up with the interests and wellbeing of the community, that we can well afford to devote ourselves to the solution of them rather than waste our energies on a scheme of subsidizing the States.

Certainly the Ministry is merely a reshuffle of the people who were responsible for the mistakes of the last Administration; some of the Ministers of the Hughes Cabinet are being given a rest for a while, whilst others are being put into their places to. make more mistakes.

Senator Pearce has pointed out that the proposal will do something to relieve unemployment, and I am sure that every honorable senator deplores the fact that there should he in Australia even one ablebodied man unable to find a market for his labour. In Queensland there is a Main Roads Board, which taxes all motor vehicles according to their horsepower rating, and the tax on each vehicle varies from about £3 6s. to about £10 per annum. Queensland also has an Unemployed Act under which every employer and employee ia compelled to pay 3d. weekly to a fund, for the relief of unemployment. The Main Roads Board receives the money which is collected from the taxation of motor vehicles and expends it in the improvement of existing roads and the making of new roads. In addition, the State Government makes a grant to the Board. The Commonwealth Government now propose advancing to that State the sum of £90,000 for the purpose of roadmaking. In ordinary circumstances, when the State Parliament met in Queensland, provision would be made in the financial statement for a grant to the Main Roads Board to . supplement the amount which it collects. I dare say that, as the result of this proposal, the State Government will reduce considerably that grant. We in Queensland are being taxed very heavily to cope with unemployment. Users of motor vehicles, and owners of . other vehicles which ply for hire, have to pay a road tax.

I do not think that the States would attempt to get behind an understanding arrived at at the Conference, but we ought not to take any undue risks in dealing with the States. The Commonwealth, under this Bill, are to provide a sum of £500,000 for the various State Governments. State Premiers, Treasurers, and Parliaments are never done complaining of excessive taxation imposed by the Commonwealth, and the reckless expenditure of Commonwealth money. Here we propose adding another £500,000 to the burdens of the Commonwealth in order to assist the States. I think that the Commonwealth Government will be given very little credit for the expenditure of this money. They might, with greater satisfaction to the people, have given the people the benefit by way of reduced taxation. Both this Government and the previous Government decided that taxation should be reduced. We can easily ascertain the amount that will be necessary to meet Commonwealth requirements, and so can gauge the taxation that should be imposed; but if we continue finding money for the State Governments the Commonwealth will not be in a position to reduce their taxation, while the States will be in a position to reduce theirs. The States will, therefore, still be able to point to the alleged extravagance of the Commonwealth Government, and claim credit for imposing lighter taxation upon the .people. The Leader of the Opposition (Senator Gardiner) suggested that the money could be more advantageously expended on the erection of cement works, and although that would  be an excellent idea, the whole of the money proposed to be paid under this measure would not be sufficient to equip a single plant, because the most modern cement works in Australia have cost over a million pounds to erect and equip. Concrete roads are becoming very popular, and as such roads last for many years, money spent in that direction is fully justified. The South Australian Government recently sent their Engineer for Roads and Bridges to Great Britain, America, and other countries to become acquainted with modern methods of road . construction, and, acting on his advice, they are adopting a new method in road construction, which will be more costly than the ordinary macadamized road. In these circumstances, the sum of £57,000, which is to be South Australias share, will not go as far as it would if reads were constructed1 under the old system, but the life of the roads will, of course, be longer. I trust the Government will see that the bulk of this expenditure will be incurred in country districts, and not in the metropolitan area.

There is a good deal of unemployment in Australia today, and it is the duty of the Government to do something to relieve it. The Government have not admitted it, but the measure has been introduced primarily for relieving unemployment, and for that reason I should like to give it my wholehearted support.  On the other hand, however, we are establishing a highly dangerous precedent, and one which might be used in the future to the disadvantage of Australia and to those people who, in some instances, may benefit by the Bill. We are setting out on a path which may lead us anywhere, and are giving future Governments an incentive to do something which may not he in the best interests of Australia. What we are now proposing to do is to depart altogether from the provisions of the Constitution. I am not saying that this measure is unconstitutional, but we axe proposing to depart from the spirit of the Constitution as contemplated by its framers in so far as the objects for which this Parliament was created are concerned. The proposal is to go beyond those objects and to interfere with matters that are peculiarly the prerogatives of the States, such as the maintenance of roads and the opening of new roads. It may be that certain States will resent the interference of the Commonwealth, but that is not so likely as some of us might imagine. Today, the States are only too willing to accept money so long as they have an opportunity to expend it in any direction. This Bill relates to main roads development. The title provides that it is a Bill for an Act relating to Main Road Development. What are main roads? Most of the States . already have main roads Acts, which relate to main roads within the States. They are not the type of roads that would be likely to lead to new settlement, or assist new settlers in parts of the States that are difficult of access. The main roads are roads that are . already in existence between highly settled centres, and roads that, from at least the primary producers point of view, are fairly well maintained. New roads that might be established for the purpose of opening up new country and leading to increased settlement could not, by any stretch of imagination, be called main roads.","Second Reading","MAIN ROADS DEVELOPMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am more than afraid that the money will be expended upon these main roads, and that the unfortunate outback settler who requires assistance will not obtain it. If the Bill related to new roads development, it would be an entirely different matter. If the Government said to the State that this amount would be granted if expended on the construction of roads on the Comboyne, Bulga, and other areas of New South Wales, it i would immediately make available for settlement perhaps 300 ,000 or 400,000 acres of the finest land in Australia, which could be cut up into 80 or 100 acre blocks to provide homes for thousands of settlers. That would be a good work. But it is not proposed to do anything of the kind under this Bill. The proposal is to offer to the States large sums of money to carry on works which, after all, are the concern of the people living along these roads, or of the local authorities. The road from Sydney to Parramatta is considered a main road; and large sums of money have been expended on it as such. The roads from Sydney, over the western plains to Bathurst, and other places, are main, roads, but they are not in a very good condition. No doubt a large portion of this money will be spent on them. The Minister pointed out that it would be to the advantage of the States to undertake this work, because it would make for motor traffic facilities. What is the position? There is, today, running from . Bathurst to Sydney an efficient arid large motor traction service which is robbing the railways of a great deal of traffic, and the railway lines are losing heavily because of that competition. The question in New South Wales is how to overcome this difficulty. Does any honorable senator believe that the New South Wales Government, who own the railways, and from which they derive a large revenue, will grant increased road facilities so that the motor traffic may better compete with the railways? I do not believe it. I would like to know from the Minister if the States have asked this Government to provide a large sum of money for the development of main roads, or for the making of new roads? We are pursuing a very dangerous course. From the speech the Minister delivered, it is very evident that he is confusing the position between main roads and new roads, and that whilst his ideals for the encouragement of settlement in new areas may be very fine, the real position is that the provisions of the Bill will not be given effect to in the direction desired. On the contrary, the result will be to still further grease the already fatted pig whilst unfortunate individuals in outback areas are seeking some little relief.

Unfortunately, this practice of making grants to the States has been going on all the time. I gathered from the Budget speech delivered by the present Prime Minister last year, that considerable sums had been voted to the different States to assist them in various ways. It was not stated for what specific purpose the grants were made. This Bill has crystallized a certain idea in the minds of the Government, and under it they can grant to the different States certain suras of money to he spent in a specific way. The Bill does not clearly set out that the amount to be expended by the States in order to secure this grant shall be in excess of the money they have already raised annually for this specific purpose. The States can fulfil the whole of the terms of the clause by simply spending out of their revenue an amount equal to that which is granted by the Commonwealth, and thus depart entirely from the intention of the Bill as indicated in the Ministers speech. It certainly is stablishing the precedent that the Commonwealth Government shall take a very strong hand in dealing with matters that hitherto have been regarded as purely State affairs. Several times we have been accused of impinging on State rights, aud under this proposal we shall be doing it in a specific way. If a sum of money be granted for main roads and we have the power to make this grant there is no reason why a sum of money should not also be granted for building jetties, bridges, or wharfs. For that matter, we must recognise that an educated people is the richest asset that a nation can possibly possess, and a sum of money could also be granted towards the educational facilities of the . States. ","Second Reading","MAIN ROADS DEVELOPMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The function of the Federal authority is to deal with national matters; the parish pump is not within its sphere of action. I concur in the contention of the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Gardiner), that if the Commonwealth enters into main road construction at all it should clearly define main roads and the purposes for which the money which this Parliament votes shall he used. Perhaps Senator Gardiner has, like myself, assisted in State politics in framing a schedule of main roads, and has heard all sorts of arguments advanced for the inclusion of particular roads. Subsequent inquiry as to the traffic upon and services rendered by such roads has shown that each caters for not more than about, halfadozen people. I am afraid that upon roads of that character which serve the requirements of only a few people, portion of the money to be provided by the Commonwealth will be spent. Such. work is not national ; it is clearly within the province of the State Governments. If they have not sufficient money with which to carry out necessary works, let them first see that their assessments are in accordance with recognised standards as indicated by ordinary sales and transfers of property, and, having done that, see also that the rate imposed upon such assessments is equivalent to that imposed in other States. If full inquiry is made it will probably be found that the socalled main roads for which the money is required are such only in name, and do not perform a national, service. There are, in some States, main roads that run alongside the railways. There may be such a road connecting two fairly large towns thirty miles apart, and for fifteen miles from one end the road is said to be feeding one town, whilst the other fifteen miles is supposed to be feeding the other town. Thi3 Bill should define, beyond possibility of doubt, what part in main road construction is to be taken by the Commonwealth, and what is to be left for the State. If that were done I should have pleasure in supporting the Bill, but, if it be carried in its present form, I am afraid it will establish a vicious precedent, rendering it possible for money voted by this Parliament to be applied to uses that were not intended by us.

It was fondly hoped that when the shire councils were brought into existence in Queensland they would settle all difficulties in regard to road construction and maintenance. But in time it was found that the local authorities could not raise sufficient funds to do justice to this work. The consequence was that the roads got into a bad condition. Recently a Main Roads Board was established, and its duty is to attend to roads which are considered main roads, and cannot be dealt with by the local authorities with the funds at their command. I confess that at first I thought that the Government were not proceeding on sound lines when entering a domain of activities occupied by the State Governments and local authorities. But if the local authorities will attend to the smaller local roads, and the States are responsible for the bigger arteries, the Commonwealth might very properly and constitutionally assist iu the construction of roads of an InterState character. If they adopt that policy they will be acting wisely, and the Senate will be justified in supporting this Bill. I hope that the Leader of the Senate (Senator Pearce) will give us an assurance that that is the intention of the measure.

When moving the second reading, I intended to draw attention to a small alteration that has been made in the allocation of the grant. It was represented to the Premiers Conference that Tasmania, owing to its physical features and climatic conditions, requires to have a larger proportion of metalled roads than any other State of the Commonwealth. Tasmania has spent £5,000,000 on main roads, equal to £25 per head of its population, and, as honorable senators are aware, the State exchequer is by no means affluent. Recognising these conditions, the Commonwealth made a readjustment of the grant so that New South Wales will get £3,150 less, Victoria £1,800 less, Queensland £2,500 less, South Australia £1,450 less, Western Australia £1,900 less, and Tasmania £10,800 more than it would have received under the first allocation. The deduction made from the other States is practically 2 per cent, in favour of Tasmania.  The Leader of the Opposition (Senator Gardiner) said that the Government are incompetent,, and know only how to spend money.

The criticism of this clause, I think, has been adequately answered by interjection, by Senators Benny and DrakeBrockman. Any one can see that clause 7 has to be read in conjunction with clause 6. By some strange reasoning, apparently Senators Gardiner and Senior have arrived at the conclusion that we are going to work this measure, so to speak, in particles, and that the Government of a State will be able to put forward a road, and say,  We have spent so much on this road, you subsidize us £1 for £1. That is not the system. I am not speaking theoretically; the £250,000 last year was expended in exactly the same way as we propose that this £500,000 shall he expended. The Commonwealth will say, for instance, to New South Wales,  If you will spend on roads of which we approve £138,000 more than you spent last year from your ordinary road vote, we will subsidize that expenditure £1 for £1, and so give you another £138,000. We ask you to submit to us a schedule of the roads upon which you propose to spend this £276,000. They will submit the schedule. The Commonwealth Government may say they do not agree to the expenditure being incurred on certain of the roads submitted, and ask that another schedule be sent. That will continue until a schedule is submitted on which both Governments agree. Clause 7 gives to the Commonwealth Minister the power to determine that .question, and his decision must be final. That is the basis upon which the Commonwealth grant is to be made. If a State does not like it, there will be no Commonwealth grant. Senator Seniors objection was as to the power conferred on the Minister; but he apparently forgets that under any Commonwealth law which appropriates money a Commonwealth Minister is given similar authority, and under the powers given to Commonwealth Ministers approximately £50,000,000 is spent annually. Does Senator Senior suggest that the schedule should be submitted to Parliament, and that we should debate the merits or otherwise of, say, the Bathurst road. The Leader of the Opposition (Senator Gardiner) drew an appalling picture of an inflated Department; but he should remember that similar work was performed last year by Mr. Hill, Commonwealth Director of Works, and the State Directors of Works as part of their ordinary duties. State officers have a knowledge of the roads to be constructed, and we are justified in assuming that the State representatives will act honestly in this matter. Officers will advise the Minister as to whether the spirit of the agreement is being observed.

The Government of that State may spend twice as much this year on the main roads as they did last year. The Bill, when passed, will be administered by the Minister, who will, at his discretion, advance a certain amount of money to the States.

He said that money would be voted to the various States according to the schedule, if they had expended a corresponding amount in excess of their previous years expenditure. That is quite an outrageous proposal for the States. Last year the States may have spent large sums on road making, to give relief to unemployment.

I have not suggested any amendment, but if the Minister would appreciate the need for tightening up the provisions of the Bill and rectifying the loose drafting, it would be better for all concerned. There should be one body in control of the expenditure pf money, and it is unwise that the State Governments should have to confer with their responsible officers and report on every detail to the Federal Minister. He might have a prejudice against a particular State. Take Queensland, for example, where there is a Labour Government. The Ministry there might find it much more difficult to obtain a grant from the Federal Minister than would the Liberal Government in Tasmania or Victoria.

That part of the evidence of the controller of the refreshment rooms to which he takes exception was given in a colloquial way, rather than as a statement of actual fact.. He was. asked how it wasthat there was a certain shortage every year, and why a price sufficient to cover it was not charged. In a half humorous way he said that a meal cost nearly twice as much as was charged to members. There are two factors which operate against the successful running of the parliamentary refreshment rooms. In the first place they are most inconveniently situated, and the cost of waiting is out of all proportion to what it ought to be, and what it would be if they were conveniently situated. In the next place, the custom is intermittent. Every one who is acquainted with the services of this House must know that the number of meals supplied varies. Sometimes both Houses will unexpectedly adjourn early in the afternoon . In the meantime all preparations have had to be made for dinner that evening; food has been supplied, waiters engaged, and other expenses incurred. The takings, in such circumstances, probably would  be infinitesimal, and a dead loss would be incurred. I do not agree with Senator McDougall that he can obtain, outside, as good a meal at the same price.

I am quite sure that the majority of honorable senators will indorse that statement. I do not say that members should be provided with a better service than the price charged will allow; we should have as good a service as we possibly can for the money that is paid. These refreshmentrooms exist for the convenience of members, who should not be expected, after a strenuous sitting, to run all over the town looking for a meal. 1 take very little notice of press criticism regarding the refreshment rooms, because  the newspapers usually are egregiously wrong. I remember at the close of one financial year the Melbourne Agc criticised severely our refreshment rooms, and misled the public in a most disgraceful fashion. It pointed out that the AuditorGenerals report disclosed that, at the 30th June, the sum of £800 was owing. It wound up its criticism by saying that that was proof positive that some members at least were regarding the refreshmentrooms as a sort of benevolent institution; in other words, that members were loafing and sponging on the refreshmentrooms. I was able to point out at that time that threequarters of that amount was owing, by the Government for two functions, and that we had never lost a single farthing through bad debts. I was able, further,, to point out that we run monthly accounts, and that the remaining £200 which was owing was not very great. I stated also that if it were correct to say that members were loafing and sponging on the refreshment rooms, the Age was twice as big a loafer and sponger as any member, because at that date, it owed twice as much as any member, and for twice as long a period. Did the papers publish that refutation ? It was published in an Adelaide newspaper, but those newspapers, which had grossly misled the people, had not the decency to publish the facts that were placed1 before them. Quite recently they have drawn attention to an occasional shortage in connexion with the conduct of these rooms, but they have never said a word about the State parliamentary refreshment rooms being fully twice as much behind as we are. All their arrows and shafts are directed at this Parliament. I deprecate the practice of honorable members taking notice of. unwarrantable criticism of that sort. I think that, under the controller, our parliamentary refreshmentrooms have been capably managed, and run as economically as possible.

Any one who has been acquainted with the Senate, or with any Parliament, must recognise that it is impossible to run a parliamentary refreshment room in the same economical way as can be done by an hotel or restaurant. I agree with what Senator McDougall has said concerning the quality of the meals supplied in our refreshment Toom, because I can obtain quite as good a meal elsewhere for what I pay here.

A black boy, sixteen years of age, was dragged through the fire, thrown into the river, and when he did not sink and his murderers had exhausted their brutal savagery, they shot him. Thank God, they killed him, and so put an end to his sufferings! They did not know how to treat our blacks.

I can understand the feelings that prompted Senator de Largie to complain about the statements contained in .the book to which he has just referred. No doubt he has not had a very wide experience of the natives in this country. Recently I read in, one of our historical works of a whole party of blacks being wiped out on the Namoi River because of some murders that had been committed near their camp. This happened in my time. The aggressive white, ever moving on in the development of this country, has wiped out the blacks, and in many cases has been most unscrupulous in his methods. I say it to our shame that the Commonwealth Parliament, with powers extending from one end of the country to the other, has been neglectful of its duty towards the remnants of the Australian aborigines. We have allowed things to drift, and have permitted this race to decay. Rusdens History of Australia contains a statement by an expert authority on the human race to the effect that, having surveyed mankind from China to Peru, he, found that, physically, the Australian native was the finest stamp of primitive manhood. His knowledge does not square with mine. I have always thought of the average Australian native as a halfdrunken fellow loafing round our towns and endeavouring to  cadge  a shilling or two. Physically, so far as my knowledge goes, he is of an inferior race, but surely it is not too much to expect of the Australian people that they should set aside some portion of this huge territory to enable the aborigines to continue .their existence for fifty or a hundred years longer. On train journeys I have heard some extraordinary stories of cruelty and brutality towards the blacks in Northern Queensland, and, before this Parliament rises, I intend to produce reports of the debates that have taken place in the Queensland Parliament on this subject. With regard to the book complained of by Senator de Largie, if what is contained in it i9 true, then the truth stands. It is not for us to complain. If we investigate the instances cited, it is quite possible that we may. discover that cases of brutality did occur in the development of this country, and this knowledge should bring even now the blush of shame to our cheeks. Senator de Largie is prompted by the highest motives. Bte is indignant that Australia should be libelled in this book. Personally, as an Australian, I feel it a reproach that we have not yet evinced a desire to do complete justice to the race that we have supplanted in this country.

I suggest that there is a sinister side to this matter which it would be well for honorable senators to remember. Since we have been given a mandate by the League of Nations to administer territory peopled by native races, there has been an attempt to misrepresent the sentiment of the people of Australia towards these indigenous faces. Not so long ago there appeared in an Australian journal a series of articles alleging illtreatment of the native races and maladministration of certain mandated territories.

Nobody would be foolish enough to deny that there have been cases of brutality on the part of the whites towards the natives of Australia. There have also been cases of brutality by the blacks towards the whites in Australia, as our police records will show. I deny absolutely that there has been consistent illtreatment of our natives by white Australians, as is insinuated in the book mentioned by Senator de Largie. I happen to be able to speak, of the early conditions in Coolgardie with, perhaps, greater authority than Senator de Largie, because I was on the Coolgardie goldfields as a prospector, and came in close touch with the natives who, up to that time, had never seen white people. I can truthfully say that I know of no such case as is mentioned in the book quoted by the honorable senator, but I do know of brutal and cowardly murders of prospectors by the natives. Never did I hear of a native woman being interfered with by white prospectors, because the prospector of that day would have considered himself disgraced . if he had had any dealing with one. In the early days of the Western Australian goldfields the prospectors were of the finest type physically, mentally, and morally. Their treatment of the natives was never brought into question, but, unfortunately, kindness and humanity were often mistaken for weakness, and resulted frequently in death under the most tragic circumstances. Prospectors have been murdered in their bunks after having given food and water to blacks in their vicinity. Senator Gardiner has just said that hitherto nothing much has been done to help the aborigines of Australia. The honorable senator is not quite correct. A very great deal has been done; but probably it is more difficult to do anything for the Australian aborigine than for the native of any other country. It is impossible for the Australian native to accommodate himself to the conditions of twentieth century civilization.. Unfortunately, he is a relic of the stone age, and no amount of kindness, can bring him from his primeval condition. The native race that existed on the Coolgardie goldfields practically disappeared in two or three years,, not through cruelty on the part of the white race, but through kindness. They were given almost everything they asked for in the way of food and clothing. When clothed they would get wet in the first shower of rain and go to sleep in their clothes,, with the result that many of them died in a few hours from pneumonia. Others again, through eating food to which they had been unaccustomed, developed gastric troubles and died in large numbers. I think I can safely say that more of the aborigines of Australia have, died from the misguided attempts of our people to induce them to adjust themselves to European standards of living than from any other cause. At one time I happened to live close to the Point Pearce Station, in  South Australia, a mission conducted under the best possible conditions by the Anglican Church. The natives .received an education and training to fit them in after life to become useful citizens, but, without apparent reason, failed miserably. Subsequently a majority of them became cadgers about the township, living on what they could beg from the people. It is idle to say that these institutions are not properly conducted. They are controlled by some of the noblest men and women in the world, and yet they fail because it is impossible for the Australian aborigine, fine specimen though he appears to be in his native state, to adjust himself to the conditions of modern society. I suggest that, in the rebuttal of charges such as are contained in the book referred to by Senator de Largie, we should be careful lest it be suggested that these things are happening today. All the cases mentioned by Senator Gardiner occurred at a much earlier period in our history. They were tragic incidents in the record of early settlement in Australia, and cannot in any way be associated with present day administration. I have recently travelled through .the Northern Territory, where there are more natives than in any other part of the Commonwealth. I saw them in their compounds on the cattle stations, and I know that they are being treated kindly and well. From the point of view of selfinterest, this is advisable, because owners of stations depend very largely upon the native black for domestic labour. The case is quite different, however, with the myall. The wild native is an extremely difficult problem. In the Northern Territory and Queensland large areas are set apart as reserves for the aborigines, who are thus permitted to live their lives in much their own way, and without undue interference. The reserves are in the hands of men whose duty it is to protect the aborigines, and yet it is with the utmost difficulty that the natives are kept on those reserves, despite the fact that rations are supplied there. For the last quarter of a century the utmost effort has been made, consistent with the difficulties of the problem, to treat the natives with kindness. The mention of the natives of British New Guinea recalls the services of Judge Murray, who ha9 an honorable record in connexion with the protection of those natives. The name of his predecessor, Sir William MacGregor, is a household word the world over for his humane and intelligent dealings with the same race.","Second Reading","SUPPLY BILL (No. 1) 192324","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

My earliest recollections are of the aborigines in the neighbourhood of Geelong. Later on, I went to Central Queensland, where in 1876 .the blacks were fairly numerous. Over 500 of them camped for some time near the locality where I was living, and I know that there were some cases of cruelty. But there are brutal people in every race. I have personal knowledge of two instances of assaults on natives, but these offences were not committed by Australians. The guilty party were Englishmen who had migrated to these shores. I have never known a case where an Australianborn white has perpetrated brutality upon an aboriginal. As Senator Pearce has pointed out, the growth of townships is responsible for the downfall of the native race. Bad cases of cruelty towards the natives seldom occurred on the cattle stations. In the earliest days there may have been instances of brutality, but the attacks came from both sides. I had a number of natives working for me, and I tried to keep them on the station. I have the happiest recollections of their jovial company, and I have often enjoyed their jokes. When strong drink was brought within the reach of the aborigines the first nail was driven into their coffin. Then the evil of opium had to be contended with, and this, together with venereal diseases, has been responsible for their decadence. The aborigine in his native state is a splendid type of man. Some of the finest athletes ever seen in this country have been Australian blacks. We know their qualities as riders and trackers, but they are still in the stone age, and we cannot civilize them. I know one native who was taken to England and educated there, but on returning to Australia he rejoined his tribe. Senator Gardiner is not quite correct in saying that the natives who survive are not being cared for. Those from the part of Queensland with which I was acquainted have been placed on Fraser Island, where, I believe, they enjoy ideal conditions.

I agree with Senator Pearce that the problem of caring for the few surviving Australian natives is a difficult, one. Those who have had opportunities to study the subject have found that, in some parts of Australia, the natives show considerable promise of eventually becoming useful members of the community. There are mission stations in North Queensland where the young natives have been so well cared for and educated that the specimens of their work, such as painting, drawing, and sewing, would do credit even to white boys and girls. The Lutheran mission station at Hermannsburg, however, did not favorably impress Senator Newland and myself. All we noticed was that the natives sang hymns three times a day in order to get their  tucker, and there was, practically no evidence of work done.

Is Senator Pearce satisfied with the aboriginal compound at Port Darwin, seeing that it is situated close to the town, and the members of various tribes are herded together in it? When the excitement of corroborees is at its height, there is great danger of natives being seriously wounded, if not killed. The residents of Darwin are not satisfied that the compound is conducted on the best lines. If given a fair chance the natives would prove a great asset in the settlement of Central Australia. On some selections the land is of poor quality, and it is impossible to pay the wages that are demanded for white labour. On one station, having an area of 4,000 square miles, the work is carried out by two white  men, an ] by about five aborigines. When I was recently in that country, we travelled overland for 200 miles with horse teams, and the only guides we had were two aborigines from a neighbouring station. On awakening in the mornings there would be no horses in sight, but within a couple of hours our guides would have the animals in hand. In some parts of the Northern Territory the natives are doing good work in clearing tracks and assisting to handle stock. In other localities where the administration is not being properly carried out by the police, who are supposed to be the protectors of the aborigines, the condition of the natives is disgraceful. There is a bungalow at Alice Springs containing about fifty halfcaste boys and girls, and I hope that something will be done to have the establishment removed. It was adversely reported upon by Senator Newland and myself. The administration of that bungalow is not creditable.

The impression left by the remarks of Senator Gardiner was that Queensland had not done the right thing by its aborigines. He referred to a debate which had taken place in the Queensland Parliament as, proof of the wickedness shown by Queensland towards the aboriginal. I think that Queenslands treatment of aboriginals from the pioneer days has not been a bit different from that in any other part of Australia. I have been over the greater portion of Queensland. I have heard all sorts of tales, and have seen places where there have been occurrences that were not creditable to the white races. Not a country in which the white race has been brought into contact with natives has less to its discredit than has Australia. The man who is prepared to face the dangers of nature in order to civilize the country has to fight against the aboriginal. The Australian native is as a mere child and, except in isolated cases, one cannot teach him a trade. Any one who sets out to do so injures rather than benefits him. The most disgraceful part of Australian history has been its convict system. Queensland has proclaimed large reserves in which the natives are gathered together and allowed to live in their natural state. They are well fed and are provided with huts. White people who employ them have to enter in a hook the wages to he paid, and they are collected by the Government, who hand the money to the Aboriginal Mission. No one is allowed to sweat the native in return for a cake of tobacco and a glass of grog now and again. I have come across some natives possessing really wonderful intelligence and common sense, but without any education. . I have been with them in the cattle and the sheep country, but I am not particularly anxious to preserve the race. Humanity has reached the stage beyond that of the aboriginal; we ha.ve reached the level to which you cannot lift him. There is a lot of sentimental twaddle talked about saving the race. I take a great interest in what is called the evolution of the race, and my opinion is that we have reached a stage at which we do not want a race such as the Australian aboriginal race. At the same time we should do our best to make comfortable the remainder of their days. Those who have studied the race know that it is one of the oldest in existence; and we cannot expect that it will last much longer. Ninetenths of the trouble with the aboriginals has been due to interference with the gins by vicious whites, who carry opium and rum to the blacks camps. The aboriginal does not possess our point of view; the only way in which he believes he can protect his own is by killing the other fellow. It does not appear to him to be wrong to do that. In Queensland, both the protectors have been exceedingly humane in their treatment of the aboriginals, and have gone out of their way to see that they are looked after properly.

Pressmen can write very interesting and somewhat startling articles, and, if one reads them without endeavouring  to dissect them, they may convey an entirely wrong impression. I read the startling headlines in this instance, but when I studied the article more closely I found that it contained only two charges. The first was that the whole of the administrative officers were returned soldiers, and that, as they carried on the Administration with the disciplinary methods and habits they had been accustomed to in the army, they were unfit for the work. What a frightful injustice ! Is it not extraordinary that, on the one hand, a newspaper will criticise a Government which does not adhere to the principle of preference to returned soldiers, and, when it discovers a case where every employee from the Administrator down is a returned soldier, it suddenly determines that it  is the worst thing a Government could do, because militarism is introduced into civil administration. Whilst I am not advocating militarism, there is much in military discipline that is of advantage in the civilian sphere. I am not referring to the nonsensical military discipline which Senator Gardiner probably has in mind, but what follows the respectful recognition of the duty a subordinate owes to his superior officer. The other charge, if it can be so designated, is that too many of these particular appointees come from Melbourne. The articles appeared in the Sydney newspapers, and probably there is a little InterState rivalry. I have been unable to find in the articles mentioned any definite charge of maladministration by any particular officer into which inquiry should be made. It is the policy of the Government to appoint returned soldiers to positions wherever possible. Having appointed returned soldiers to these positions, how can we now be blamed if these men have carried into their civil administration the discipline they learned in the Army ? Most of them were selected directly from the Australian Imperial Force, and some of them were appointed by myself when I was Minister for Defence.

All I can say is that if Senator Duncan will inquire further into this matter, and endeavour to formulate a definite charge, I will undertake to bring the matter under the notice of the Prime Minister, who will, undoubtedly, furnish a reply.  I come now to the charges against the Expropriation Board. For some considerable time while German New Guinea was under military administration, nobody, except perhaps Mr. Ellis, knew what was going to happen: whether the plantations would go back to the German ownership or continue under our control. During the war German New Guinea was under Commonwealth military administration in the terms of the capitulations. Thus all those plantations had to be administered as though they formed part of a trust liable to be handed over to Germany after the war. In the circumstances it is obvious that as Australia had no population to draw upon with any knowledge of plantation work, the best course was to maintain the original control until the destination, of German. New Guinea was decided.","Second Reading","SUPPLY BILL (No. 1) 192324","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1/speech[13]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In the majority of cases during military occupation the plantations were managed by the men who had carried them on prior to the war. Then came the Armistice, and the. decision to expropriate the properties. It then became the duty of the Government to transfer the management to other people, and being bound by the policy of preference to returned soldiers, we made the appointments I have indicated. There has been some neglect, partly due to want of knowledge, and partly owing to the disturbed condition of affairs following the transfer of management before we could get suitable men to take charge. It should be remembered also that the Germans had a much more effective method of dealing with native labour. The German did not regard the natives as possessing any rights at all, and so he recruited them ruthlessly, and planters were permitted to flog them if they did not do their work satisfactorily. That kind of thing would not bo tolerated under Australian administration, and, of course, it was not permitted during the term of military administration, with the result that planters under our management had not the same control or the Same driving power over the natives. Consequently, there has been a slackening in the native labour output. When the last Government . decided te dispose of the plantations, we took the necessary action to induce private owners to purchase, but at that time there was a slump in the price of copra and rubber, with the result that the prices offered were unsatisfactory. Ever since the Government decided not to accept the prices submitted, there, has been a campaign against the administration of the plantations by the Expropriation Board.  Whether there is any connexion I cannot say, but it would not be the first time that an attempt has been made, by means of a press agitation, to force the Government to accept unfair prices. I have no personal knowledge that this is so in the present instance. We have heard what Senator Cox has had to say. Definite charges appear in tonights paper. I have just read them, and, of course, they will be brought under the notice of the Prime Minister who, at the proper time, will furnish a reply in regard to the matter. In justice to the Government, I ask honorable senators to analyze the charges, and make sure that there is something substantial in them, before they call upon the Government to take any notice of them.","Second Reading","SUPPLY BILL (No. 1) 192324","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1/speech[13]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have .not had the advantage of reading the articles to which reference has been made by Senator Duncan and other speakers this evening, and so I do not propose to deal with that particular matter, assuming that as the Minister (Senator Pearce) has spoken he, no doubt, considered that all honorable senators who wished to address themselves to the subject had done so. But I cannot agree with one portion of his reply. He seemed to assume that because the articles were by a Sydney writer, and published in a Sydney newspaper, and amongst other things took exception to the predominance of Melbourne men amongst the appointees, they were principally due to Sydney influence. If it is any information to the Minister and the Government, I can say that this is a very prevalent complaint, so far as I can see, throughout the Commonwealth. All who are directly or indirectly associated with the Federal Administration are constantly having brought home to them the belief that the man in Melbourne, under the observation of the Minister, gets the preference every time.  I rose more particularly, however, to speak upon another item under the Prime Ministers Department, namely, that of £130 for the Commercial Agency, Paris. This has appeared in Estimates on previous occasions, and I have questioned the Minister frequently about it. Not so long ago I drew his attention to the fact that I had received complaints front a number of persons who had visited the Paris commercial agency for the Commonwealth, and were astounded to find it contained no uptodate information regarding Australia, the most recent works of reference obtainable being then from five to seven and eight years old. We were then assured that consideration would be given to the representations I made, more especially when they were supported by other honorable senators. I should like to know if any amends have been  made with regard to this commercial agency. I understand it is an offshoot of the High Commissioners Office, and I am under the impression that the High Commissioners Office is supposed to keep it uptodate. The fact that we have a commercial agency in Paris postulates the idea that we look upon our commercial relations with Prance as of some importance. Only a few years ago a commercial mission from Prance, headed by General Pau, visited Australia, and submitted a report to the French Government. A copy of that report has been sent to Australia, and circulated amongst honorable senators. We have to assume, therefore, that there is some desire on the part of the Commonwealth Government to maintain and promote commercial relations between Australia and Prance. I will go further and say that the Government should establish, maintain, and promote commercial intercourse with all of our exallied countries in Europe. In February last, when this Senate was sitting for a few days, I directed the attention of the Government to the then recently announced procedure adopted, mutually, by Canada and France with regard to commercial intercourse. France had sent through Canada a train exhibiting products which she could supply to Canada, and the Dominion had reciprocated by sending a trainload of its products to be exhibited throughout France. The train was due to arrive at various centres on different dates, and it was finally to be placed on view for an extended period in Paris. I asked whether the Government would follow that example, and whether any information had been received, on the subject from the High Commissioner. The reply I obtained was that no information had been furnished, but I received an assurance that early attention would be given to the matter. I pointed out the value of advertising the resources of the Commonwealth among the countries allied with us in the late wai. It is obvious that Australia must extend its markets. We cannot depend entirely upon interEmpire trade. We should have com mercial dealings with some of the European mainland countries, and preferably with those that were recently associated with us as Allies. Canada is a big competitor with Australia in the markets abroad.","Second Reading","SUPPLY BILL (No. 1) 192324","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1/speech[14]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I was invited by the Administrator of one of the soldier settlements to see how successfully that particular settlement was being run. The Administrator met us at the railway station, drove us round, took us to the prize farm on the top of a hill, and said,  Look at the prosperity that exists. This is what we are doing.

I know that some of them stayed a couple of years, while others returned on the next boat, in many « cases because they were not suitable for the job. Nevertheless, here are definite statements made by an eyewitness, a man who is not given to scaremongering, who has had an opportunity of investigating at first hand, and who can obtain confirmation of what he says. I desire that the administration by Australia of  these Mandated Territories shall be above reproach, that we shall set an example to other countries. I believe that Senator Duncan had the same idea when he . brought forward this statement.

MILLEN (Tasmania) ?10.8]. The question of the administration in New Guinea is a very important matter. We intend to take part in the Assembly of the League of Nations, which is to be held in Geneva in September next. Probably one of the most important things that will be dealt with there, apart from defence, as far as Australia is concerned, is the question of the Mandated Territories. We have to remember that that Assembly is composed of fifty two nations of the world, of whom a vote can be taken. Amongst those fiftytwo nations a considerable amount of insidious propaganda has been circulated by the German people. I shall quote some extracts which have been taken from the Die Deutsche Wacht (The German Watch), which is being published in German interests in Batavia. They set out, in a very definite way, some of the evils which, it is contended, the German settlers have suffered. The Minister has asked definitely and rightly for specific cases, and I propose to give him some obtained from German sources, and published in an attempt to influence the meeting of the League of Nations in September next. First of all I call attention to the fact that a proclamation was issued by Colonel William Holmes, in command at Rabaul, on 12th September, 1914. Clauses 3 and 4 of the Proclamation were as follow: 3.The lives and private property of peaceful inhabitants will be protected, and the laws and customs of the Colony will remain in force so far as is consistent with the military situation. 4.If the needs of the troops demand it, private property may be requisitioned. Such property will be paid for at its fair value. Following on that the Germans say they were served with the following notice:","Second Reading","SUPPLY BILL (No. 1) 192324","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1/speech[16]/continue[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

A glance at it today beggars description. The roads laid to it, which were made at great cost, are now swampy. The irrigation channels have fallen in, the palms are overgrown and infested with weevils.  It was absolutely impossible to go through the. young plantations without knife and axe, as an undergrowth of 3 to 4 metres had already grown up, and the young plants were no longer to be found. I also saw on the farm about halfamillion fully developed coconuts lying about which were not. prepared on account of the scarcity of labour to dry the copra. In German times, scarcity of labour was unknown at Kalilli, and there were more natives from the district Offering than we could use. My second visit was to the plantation, Tokua, of the H.S.A.G., in New Pomerania. The Australian planter (like 95 per cent, of his colleagues, he had known the coconut only in the form of a pudding) had discovered a new method of planting threeyear palms between the Passiflora and Faseolis lunatus which the German planter had put in to sweeten the ground.. Instead of removing by hand the tendrils of the Passiflora, which had climbed up the low hanging branches, the extreme palm branches were simply hacked away by his order, and only the middles remained standing, so that the young palms now looked like young pineapples, which are surrounded by upstanding leaves. On the New Guinea Companys Put Put plantation the Australian planter (Tatham) had shortly .before my visit cut down 3,000 young and old palm trees, ostensibly because they were infected by the leaf beetle. These are only a few instances of the conditions in which most of the farms are today. The scarcity of labour is in part the result of bad sanitary conditions. Kalilli, where formerly at the outside three to four deaths were recorded in a year from a total of 250 men, now hardly a week passes without the death of a worker from a total of 150 to 170 men. During my three weeks stay there, four* deaths occurred. It is no wonder that the native worker will not work for the Australian. Again, much is now stolen from the workers advance of pay, and the allowance of tobacco, tinned meats, and loin cloths charged against the worker. To counteract the scarcity of labour, the Australians use an original method. The labourers are taken to Rabaul for the settling of accounts, and are kept there in quarantine for months at a time, when they ultimately receive their pay, not in cash, but partly in commodities. Meanwhile, they have contracted so many debts and squandered so much money that in most cases they are compelled to enter into a contract. In January of this year I met an old worker of my firm in Rabaul, who already had had to wait some months for his money. He told me that he and about eighty other labourers received as sustenance a daily allowance of only one matta of rice (56 lbs.), and most of the workers, by reason of their hunger, were inclined to enter into a new contract. There are, however, many labourers who, not with standing any hardships, adhere to their determination not to continue to work for the Australians.","Second Reading","SUPPLY BILL (No. 1) 192324","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1/speech[16]/quote[4]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

I am anxious that, the good name of Australia shall be maintained, and that this insidious propaganda, shall cease. What I have quoted was published early this year. It has since been repeated and is still being circulated today by active, skilled, wellpaid German agents throughout the whole of Europe and America. It has been carried on in the East by men of the same type, and yet Australia declines to move. We moist be on the defensive, prove our case, and either admit or deny the truth of the German one. If the German charges are true, let us face the position and say that such conditions shall not continue. If they are false, let us prove that they are. Immediate action must be taken.
