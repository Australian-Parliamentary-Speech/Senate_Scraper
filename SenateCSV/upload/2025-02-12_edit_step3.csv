"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," It gives me great—well, I would say pleasure but Im concerned that we actually even have to have this debate in relation to this piece of legislation, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Reconsideration of Decisions) Bill 2024, because its a problem of this governments own making that this piece of legislation addresses.  We shouldnt need to have this debate, but we do because the Minister for Environment and Water took the word of organisations such as the now discredited Environmental Defenders Office over that of the Tasmanian government in relation to a decision on salmon farming in Macquarie Harbour. Instead of taking the word of the Tasmanian government, who in their submission to the Commonwealth in relation to this matter indicated that there had been no substantial change in circumstances that werent foreseen in relation to salmon farming in Macquarie Harbour, the government went with the environmental groups. Its a pattern that we have seen in Tasmania for a considerable period of time, unfortunately. Of course, the Environmental Defenders Office are an organisation that have recently had a significant finding against them in the courts in relation to other matters, where they have been found to have fabricated evidence, so its even more disturbing that the government would take the word of an organisation like this over that of the Tasmanian government. That decision set a precedent, which is that more than 11 years after a decision was made to support salmon farming in Tasmania—a decision that it would not be a controlled action—the government can come back, after all of the businesses involved have made all of the investments they have made, and reconsider the decision. What sort of circumstance is that? What if a council gave you approval to build a house and then 10 or 11 years later they came back and said: Hang on a minute. Were not sure about that. We might have another look. In fact, we might make you take your house down. We might make you demolish your house, because we dont think we should have approved it in the first place? What an absurd circumstance! What level of sovereign risk does that generate? In respect of this bill to amend the EPBC Act weve seen exactly the same attitude. Those who invest their resources to create jobs in our economy, for whom everything is at risk—every single one of them, from a range of different circumstances—supported this amendment to the act. Obviously, the salmon industry supported it, as did the Forest Products Association; the renewable energy industry—Tilt Renewables; the Business Council of Australia; Senex; Santos, who obviously were the victim of the Environmental Defenders Office, with its corrupt evidence to a court; the Australian Airports Association; the Minerals Council of Australia. These are the organisations that invest tens of thousands of dollars—millions of dollars—in gaining environmental approvals, and every single one of them supported this very simple amendment to the EPBC Act to provide them with some certainty and remove the sovereign risk that this government had created. What does the government do in its majority report on the bill? It sides with the EDO, the Environmental Defenders Office. It sends a message. The government will get up and say: Yes, well, were going to amend the EPBC Act on a broader scale. Theres the naturepositive legislation. Well, theres not. The government themselves voted against debating that this week. So there is no change on the horizon from this government. Thats unless they do a deal with the Greens, which weve seen a fair bit of lately. They stand here today against every user of the EPBC Act—those who invest to create jobs in our economy. Thats all that these people are asking for: some certainty that, when a government makes a decision, the decision stands. Thats what this very simple piece of legislation does. This legislation doesnt even remove the capacity for reconsideration down the line in the case of a genuine change in circumstances. It leaves the act exactly as it is for three years, and then, after three years, any reconsideration request must come from an appropriate minister in the state government where the project is being developed. Its a simple piece of legislation. It should be easy for the government to support. They currently dont have anything on the table with respect to changes to the current act but they are prepared to oppose this change simply because the environment group said so. Lets hear what some of these organisations that submitted to the Senate inquiry had to say. It was an inquiry that wasnt allowed to have public hearings, that was punted back to a time after sittings in the last part of last year. Really, there was zero respect for this piece of legislation shown by the government all the way through, which is a bit of a trademark, I suppose. Senex Energy said: The Bill under consideration … would provide greater certainty in approval conditions for project proponents. Such certainty is essential for investor confidence, particularly in capital intensive industries involving multidecade investments such as the natural gas industry. We know the Greens wont support it, because theyre the antieverything brigade, but the government talk about having a future gas strategy as being important for our future energy needs. We know we need more gas in the system. This is what a major investor is saying in respect of this legislation. Its a simple piece of legislation; it should not be difficult to support. Santos wrote: Challenges in the form of reconsideration requests will continue to cause delays and uncertainties for proponents, investors and the community if deficiencies in the Act are not addressed. Santos supports the Bill. Santos also wrote: Santos supports any reform which will bring clarity and greater investment confidence to the approvals regime. Its pretty clear. But, of course, the government reject that. Theyve gone with the corrupt Environmental Defenders Office. The Australian Forest Products Association wrote: The proposed changes in the Bill will substantially improve regulatory certainty for investors in projects that require environmental approvals, increase investment overall and directly assist the governments efforts to promote expansion of, and investment in, the plantation forestry sector. The government have a policy to increase plantations, and heres the forest industry saying this piece of legislation will enhance that, but Labors gone with the corrupt Environmental Defenders Office. The Business Council of Australia wrote: One of the key criticisms of the existing EPBC Act is the lack of certainty provided to proponents in pursuing a decision via the process. When multimillion and multibilliondollar investments, supporting thousands of direct and indirect jobs, are being developed and delivered there must be certainty in process and approvals. It cant get much clearer. Yet the government, again, poignant in the Santos circumstance, are going with the discredited, corrupt Environmental Defenders Office evidence. BCA continued: The recently highlighted ability under the existing Act for third parties to challenge an approval, years after it has been given, has the potential to undermine investor confidence in any project that may have an interaction with the EPBC Act. Decisions under the Act range from renewable energy projects to mining, to housing supply— hello, national housing crisis— and tourism, and to agriculture and aquaculture. All users of the act that submitted to this inquiry supported this change. The government has chosen in its report to go with the antieverything brigade. The Clean Energy Investor Group wrote: The EPBC Amendments clear timeframes for reconsidering decisions will increase investor confidence in clean energy projects. CEIG believes the EPBC Amendment will improve the predictability and efficiency of environmental approvals. CEIG also wrote: CEIG supports the EPBC Amendment as it addresses the current uncertainty surrounding approvals under the EPBC Act. Here we are with a government with a renewables policy for transition of the Australian economy. This is what the investors into clean energy are saying to the government, and they snub their nose at it. How absurd! Tilt Renewables, one of the largest owners and operators of wind and solar generation in Australia, with 1,700 megawatts of renewable energy capacity across a number of projects, wrote: The rationale for this is clear as investors need certainty that a planning approval … is final and will not be overturned as they continue to invest in developing, and then constructing, the project. … … … … the Bill would be a worthwhile reform and improvement to the current openended EPBC appeal process. I went about developing this piece of legislation after a conversation with a state environment minister who had told me about the alarm amongst other environment ministers around the country as to the actions of Minister Plibersek in reopening this overadecadeold approval in Tasmania. It wasnt just about the salmon industry; it was about all of the other sectors that Ive talked about during my contribution. Well be accused of running a wedge or something of that nature in relation to salmon farming, but this was a genuine concern that was brought to me by a colleague in another parliament who happened to be the environment minister. They were all concerned about the precedent that had been set that would allow any similar approval to be reconsidered by the minister. And this was not through some sort of substantial submission. Three environmental groups—antieverything brigade groups—wrote a letter to Minister Plibersek. They didnt write a substantial submission; they wrote a letter. On the basis of that letter, an approval process that has been in place for over a decade has been thrown into upheaval, and everybody is asking questions, including environment ministers at a state level. This is a simple piece of legislation that can provide certainty for investors. Yes, theres a process that may come to fruition, perhaps in the next parliament, with respect to the EPBC Act more broadly. But, quite frankly, people who are putting up million, tens of millions or billions of dollars to invest in projects that support this sector, support industry and support jobs around the country should have the certainty of the decisions that are made by government. It is only reasonable that they do. As I said earlier, consider if a council approved your house and came back 10 years later and said, Sorry, were going to look at this again; you might have to take the extension down or we might make you take the house apart. Its an absurdity, and the government should be supporting this legislation. They should be supporting jobs in Tasmania and across the country.  There were so many things that one could respond to in that contribution. I am amazed by the scaremongering thats going on here. The EPBC legislation, as it stands, has stood for a very long time. Senator Colbeck trying to frighten people, saying that someones going to take down their house, is beyond absurd. Its offensive and unnecessary, and he probably should be quite ashamed of himself.","Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Reconsideration of Decisions) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator COLBECK (Tasmania) ","(09:02):"

"0","0","0","1","1","MemberContinuation","296331","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Senator GROGAN: I stand here ignoring Senator Colbecks interjections because I listened to him in silence, out of respect, and it would be nice if there were a bit more of it.  The committee that I chair, the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee, conducted an inquiry into this bill, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Reconsideration of Decisions) Bill 2024, and the report was informed by a range of expert submissions. There were a variety of views, of course. This issue and anything around the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act brings us a great deal of debate and two very strong opposing sides: those opposite, the coalition, who back business and business only and have no interest in the environment; and our colleagues over in the Greens, who fight valiantly to protect the environment and have a lesser concern about business. What were trying to do here, what we always try and do here, is find the balance thats right for Australia, the balance that respects and encourages investment in business but keeps the integrity of our environment at the heart of the decisionmaking. The committee found through its inquiry that this bill is unnecessary, misguided and counterproductive, basically, to Australias environmental governance. The committee recommended that the bill not be passed. As weve heard from Senator Colbeck, it really is a desperate attempt to scare workers in regional Tasmania, and that absurd rant at the end about housing has no place in this chamber. Labor will always back workers. There is an industry in Tasmania that is, that should be and that will be—we will support it to be—a sustainable Tasmanian salmon industry. It is at the centre of a lot of jobs, and therefore theres a balance in how you proceed. We know how much Tasmanians love their natural environment and we also know how important their local economy is. We stand here on the Labor benches not to pick one side or the other but to support workers, to support business and to support the environment. That is a more complex way to go, but it is the right way to go. The bill that was introduced by Senator Colbeck is looking to impose arbitrary limitations on the reconsideration of environmental decisions. It basically restricts timeframes within which consideration can occur and limits who can actually request it. Senator Colbeck has argued that this will provide greater certainty for industry and investment, but, as the committee inquiry heard through its submissions, these proposed changes are unnecessary. There are already very strict conditions on reconsiderations that already exist, and those reconsiderations have been in the act for a long time. What we dont want to do, and what Senator Colbecks bill would do, is undermine the fundamental integrity of our environmental protections. The most glaring issue in this bill is that it removes an important safeguard in our environmental decisionmaking. Under the current act, the minister has the ability to reconsider a decision when a new substantial piece of information arises or when circumstances have changed significantly since the original approval. I think what you need to be clear on here is what the words substantial and significant mean. Its not that, as Senator Colbeck would have you believe, were going to go and tell people they have to take their house down. These are fundamental issues that need to be held within our environmental protection laws. The environment is not a static thing. As scientific information evolves, as we learn more and as things change, our environmental monitoring needs to identify those things. Then we need to deal with them—not in the manner that Senator Colbeck has dealt with them this morning, through scaremongering. These are often new threats and things that reveal new issues that need to be considered, not just ignored or mowed over for a particular ideological position. There are great dangers in limiting reconsideration to a threeyear window, as has been proposed, because sometimes issues occur decades into the future. Things change. We do not live in a static world. Restricting who can request such a reconsideration is also one of the big challenges with what the coalition is proposing here. Limiting reconsideration requests beyond three years and limiting who can make them is highly problematic. Youre turning it into an entirely political situation, as opposed as a scientific, factual one that respects the community, respects business and respects the perspectives put forward when something changes. This bill deliberately excludes community groups, because, as we know—and we hear it all the time—those opposite arent big fans of community groups who have views on things, particularly when it comes to the environment. It excludes independent experts. It excludes environmental organisations. We know environmental organisations are public enemy No. 1 for the coalition. They cant bear somebody having an opinion and they cant go through a process of respecting peoples ideas. The kinds of restrictions here about who can make a request are going to significantly reduce any public oversight and any community concerns being recognised. We look at community participation in environmental decisionmaking as a crucial transparency and accountability measure. Removing this pathway for public engagement is going to erode trust even further than it already has. The system is widely regarded as inadequate. We know that; we talked about this endlessly in this chamber. Endlessly we have spoken about the problems with the EPBC Act. This has been going on for decades. But do you think we can get agreement to bring forward a revised bill? No. Those opposite are business only. Greens colleagues are environment only. Neither of these ways is the way to go. We need to come to a position where everyone gets that business is important and the environment is important. We need to find the pathway through that. Thats what weve been trying to do with revisions to the EPBC Act that weve been talking about ever since we got into government, but do you think we can get an agreement? No, because its an either/or. Thats not what were about. Were about protecting the environment and supporting business. That takes a much more complex thought process and a much more engaged process than either of our major party colleagues in this chamber or the other are prepared to invest. Now, the EPBC Act, as Ive said, already contains strict safeguards to ensure that any reconsideration requests are entertained only with substantial new information that warrants a review, not just for political purposes as proposed by Senator Colbeck. Sustainable investment anywhere in this country, in any industry—be it salmon farming, be it mining, be it housing; it doesnt matter—all relies on robust, reliable environmental governance. Allowing projects to proceed based on outdated or incomplete information creates longterm financial and longterm environmental liability. Ultimately, that will harm business, communities and ecosystems alike. The comprehensive reform of the EPBC Act was informed by Professor Graeme Samuels review. He identified—and I dont think anyone disagrees—that our environmental laws as they stand are broken. Yet in almost three long years we have not been able to get our colleagues in the chamber to have a proper conversation and agree to compromise. I know thats maybe not quite where people are at, but compromise is a good thing to get a better outcome. Until we get some more engaged, more thoughtful and more intellectual embrace by my colleagues of the reform that were trying to get through to the EPBC, we will still be in this situation where we have the same conversation over and over again in this chamber, because the coalition and the Greens are so ideologically entrenched. If what you are looking for, Senator Colbeck, is a better deal for business, I would suggest you engage with the EPBC reform, because, with the way the laws are now, theyre not working for anyone. We know that, in the current situation—were seeing it—our environment is facing unprecedented challenges: climate change, habitat destruction and biodiversity loss. We have to ensure that our laws on the environment are robust, responsive and informed by the best available science. This bill moves us completely in the wrong direction. Really, it is just a political stunt that Senator Colbeck has been put up to by his Tasmanian Liberal colleagues. We need an answer. We need a pathway. We need a measure that protects business, protects workers and protects the environment. With enough thought and a bit less ideology, we can get there.","Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Reconsideration of Decisions) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[3]","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","1","Colbeck, Sen Richard","00AOL","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I rise to contribute to the debate on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Reconsideration of Decisions) Bill 2024. Let me say straight up that this bill is a bad bill. Its a political stunt from the coalition. It says everything about what the coalition think about the environment, and that is that they hate it. They hate the environment. They hate any moves to protect the environment. They resist any regulation that protects the environment, and theyll do anything they can to weaken environmental protections.  This is one of these issues where the coalition, refusing to listen to the scientists, refusing to listen to independent advice and refusing to listen to the cries and concerns in their local community for the survival of our native species and our ecosystems, are all too obsessed with digging, drilling and polluting. In this case, when we look at the salmon industrys devastation of waterways in Tasmania, the coalition dont give two hoots about the pollution and the damage that the corporate—foreign, I might add—salmon industry is doing to beautiful Tasmania. We are on the cusp of a biodiversity crisis. We have ecosystems in collapse. We have our beautiful native species—species after species—being acknowledged as in serious danger of extinction, and in this case its the maugean skate, an animal that has been around for hundreds of thousands of years, facing extinction. The Liberal Party and the National Party dont care about protecting Australias environment. They dont care about the impact that industry, at all costs, has on ecosystems. I do wonder just how much money and support is flowing from the big salmon corporations to the Liberal Party. Why otherwise would you, day after day after day, ignore the very real threats to Tasmanias environment and waterways so these foreign salmon corporations can make profits? Weve been told over and over again that the expansion of the salmon industry in Tasmania will push our native species and our biodiversity to extinction. But the Liberal Party in Tasmania do not care. Thats what this bill is all about. But of course its not just in relation to the toxic salmon industry in Tasmania. This is emblematic of the coalition under Peter Duttons rule. It is emblematic of Mr Duttons attitude to the environment and to nature full stop. Do you know who is, more than anyone else, helping Mr Dutton at this coming election? That of course is Gina Rinehart. Gina Rinehart openly denounces the protection of Australias environment and seems to have total disdain for Australias unique and beautiful wildlife. If anyone hasnt seen it, you should look up the crazy, unhinged speech that Gina Rinehart gave last year as part of the Bush Summit. In the list of random points that Gina Rinehart was making, chief among them was that we couldnt possibly have laws that protect Australias endangered wildlife, because—you know what?—27 of them might kill you. That is the kind of logic that this unhinged, powerhungry individual has. Of course, we know where Gina Rinehart is putting her money this election. She is funding the Liberal Party. Hundreds of thousands of dollars are being handed over to Mr Dutton to do Gina Rineharts bidding. Chief among her demands is the trashing of Australias environmental regulation, the winding back of laws that protect our native species, all in the name of profit for the big mining corporations and Gina Rinehart herself—unhinged, unAustralian and damaging to our precious biodiversity. The Liberal Party are going to run around this election saying listen to them because they will wind back environmental protection. They will stand in the way of and stare down the advice of scientists and experts about what is best for the sustainability of our natural world, and they will do the bidding of those who want to just keep logging, digging, bulldozing and polluting—and it doesnt matter whether its the coal companies, the gas corporations, the logging lobby or, indeed, the big, foreign salmon corporations. This position is not in the interests of local communities here, in Australia. This is in the interests of the profits of these big corporations and at the expense of our environment and the sustainability of jobs in our communities. If you pollute our waterways to a point where nothing can survive, therell be no jobs in that area anyway. If you continue to log our native forests into extinction, therell be no jobs there anyway. There are no jobs on a dead planet. That is a very clear, simple fact that is lost day after day on the likes of Mr Dutton, the Liberal Party and the National Party. But it seems that, if you are rich enough, like Gina Rinehart—if youve got billions of dollars yourself—then you dont care about what is being left behind for any future generation, and you dont care about the impacts on jobs in local communities or the health and protection of our environment. Lets not forget Gina Rinehart was praising the ridiculously low, almost slavelabour wages of overseas workers because thats what she thinks workers should be paid here. She doesnt care about peoples jobs. She only cares about her own money, and she only cares about whether Mr Dutton will be elected so that he can implement what she wants. This bill is a political stunt from the Liberal Party, but it is a dangerous warning sign of what is to come under a Dutton government: the trashing of common sense, the overriding of independent expert advice because they dont like its inconvenient truth and the doing the bidding of the industries that only make their money and profit because they continue to pollute, destroy and bulldoze. It doesnt matter whether were talking about the interests of the foreign owned salmon corporations, foreign owned logging companies, foreign owned mining corporations or foreign owned big ag. This is a warning of what is to come from Peter Duttons government if he were to be elected. They would do the bidding of big corporations at the expense of Australians, Australian jobs and our environment. When we stand up and say, Well, these corporations should have to pay their fair share of tax, who does the squealing and the bidding and the defending of these big corporations? Of course, its the Liberal Party and the National Party, the coalition who think their job and our job here in the parliament is to pave the way for these big corporations to run riot over our environment, over workers rights and over Australia. But as soon as you say, Maybe you should pay something for that, the Liberal Party say, Oh, no, no, no, you dont have to pay anything. You dont have to pay anything—unless, of course, it comes in the form of a political donation, and then theyll have their hand out. Theyre happy to take money for themselves as donations but they dont want money being paid back in tax to the Australian taxpayer. The beautiful waterways and rivers of Tasmania deserve to be protected for everybody—not just for the survival of the maugean skate and not just for fishermen in the area and the sustainable fishing industry. They deserve to be protected in the public interest because nature needs our help and we are part of the environment. When we come into this place and see pathetic pieces of legislation designed to ignore expert advice and overrule the protection of our endangered species and our environment, youve got to be very wary. Why would the Liberal Party want these rules and this advice ignored and overturned? Its not because theyre doing it in the best interests of the Australian people. They are doing it because the corporations who are polluting, logging, digging and burning want to keep making massive profits. Mr Dutton is doing the bidding of the big corporations because he wants them to be able to keep making profits. He wants to be mates with them, like he is with Gina Rinehart, at the expense of what is good for our communities and our environment and at the expense of the survival of some of our most unique and oldest living creatures. Australia is a beautiful, beautiful country. We have some of the most unique species in the world. But, rather than taking pride in that and having a sense of national pride about how beautiful our country is, the Liberal Party want to sell it for cheap. The Liberal Party want to sell it off to the big corporations at a cheap price with very little regulation and no respect for or understanding of expert advice. Who would you believe—the scientists or Peter Duttons Liberal Party? Do you take your advice from the Tasmanian Liberals? Or do you take your advice from the environmental scientists and climate experts? I know who I would choose, and I know who most Australians would choose. This bill is a bad bill for Australia and for our environment, and it should be rejected.","Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Reconsideration of Decisions) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator HANSONYOUNG (South Australia) ","(09:29):"
"0","0","0","1","1","Colbeck, Sen Richard","00AOL","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," Theres a rumour going around at the moment—would you believe it?—that this could well be the last sitting week before the election, and Id tend to think it is because, from listening to what both the government and their coalition partners, the Australian Greens, have had to say, youd say its all about sandbagging and holding together this little sham difference of opinion long enough for Australians to be distracted and not fooled into some allusion that this crowd over here, the Australian government, are pro jobs and that the Greens arent the green tail wagging the Labor dog.  The Greens talk about what is to come, and, I have to tell you, this last sitting fortnight is a great representation of what is to come. Ive lived through LaborGreen governments before and I can tell you one thing: they are bad. We hear someone talk about a bad bill thats bad for the environment or bad for the country. Ill tell you whats bad for the country, bad for the environment, bad for jobs and bad for the cost of living. It is a LaborGreen government and, if the polls are to be believed, that is what were going to end up with after this election. That is why it was so interesting to see the Senate inquiry report into this bill, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Reconsideration of Decisions) Bill 2024. Both Labor and the Greens lined up together to say: Do you know what? We arent going to touch this bill—for a range of spurious reasons. They provided their responses and their arguments around why they wouldnt. None of them stack up, because, at the end of the day, there are very few people in this chamber—an exception being a group called the Australian Greens—who believe the laws are broken, in the sense that they dont protect the economy, they dont protect jobs, they do not do anything to advance the cause when it comes to addressing the costofliving crisis and keeping jobs in our regional communities. Thats why it is just so ridiculous that, instead of working with the coalition on making sure this bill does something productive for a community that has been left on tenterhooks now for more than a year, almost 18 months, for two Christmases—families in the community of Strahan, in the electorate of Braddon, have been left wondering whether they will have jobs in the months to come, will be able to pay their mortgages or should reenrol their kids in the local school. These concerns are real, and what this bill was about was attempting to address the issues that that community has faced. To suggest that we have a good process in place now, where anyone anywhere in the country, masquerading as a concerned citizen or, indeed, as some might categorise them, a scientist, can throw up into the air the certainty of an industry which has operated, in Macquarie Harbour in this case, for more than a decade—for almost 13 years now this salmon farming operation has been in existence. But the Bob Brown Foundation, of course, is not a group of scientists. I dont know how many scientists they have on staff or in their membership, but they are not invested in good outcomes for that community; they are a political outfit. They are green activists who seek to do harm to industries that generate economic outcomes for our community, and it is on that basis that we think we do need to restrain who can make claims of this nature. The fact is that more than a decade after these permits came into operation you can have this happen. We hear these claims that its all about foreign owned companies deriving massive, dirty big profits. Theyre a terrible thing, these profits, which, of course, are invested in our communities by companies like Huon Aqua, Tassal, Petuna and employ people. The fact that they employ 5,000 people in our state is something that gets glossed over by those who oppose the industry and those who wont stand up for it. If you want to talk about foreign money, lets talk about the Neighbours of Fish Farming, who receive overseas donations and grants from foreign, opaque, dark, shady entities like the Global Salmon Farming Resistance. Who are they? Where are they from? Do they have our communitys interests at heart. No, I dont think they do, not if theyre based out of Argentina and we dont know who they are. Do you think that they want to have Tasmanians employed in the salmon industry? No, I dont think they do, but theyre handing over lots of money to the Neighbours of Fish Farming. Indeed, the members of the Global Salmon Farming Resistance, this foreign organisation, have very strong ties with the Bob Brown Foundation and others who are anti industry, anti jobs and anti good outcomes for our community. So I say that if youre serious about protecting this industry, if youre serious about getting a good outcome and if youre serious about saying you support the salmon workers, then, this being the last sitting fortnight that we will have before this election—and I think that is the case—do something before the election to provide certainty for salmon workers. Do something to ensure that this industry can operate with certainty into the future. You cannot say you support this industry, which, frankly, science has proven is sustainable, is manageable and will create jobs while protecting the environment and protecting the future of the maugean skate—do something! If you dont want to support this bill in its current form, amend it or, I dont know, move a motion to protect this industry. Call on this environment minister, who has sat on her hands and now sat on departmental advice for nearly 18 months, and do something to protect these jobs and this community. It is what any good Tasmanian would do. Thats what I am doing, along with Senator Colbeck, Senator Chandler and Senator Askew. I look forward to seeing how this bill is voted on, because I would characterise a vote against this legislation in one way, and that is, frankly, that you think what is happening here is okay, you think this green activist opposition to this industry is okay and youre going to let it continue.

"0","0","0","1","1","Colbeck, Sen Richard","00AOL","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," Losing the salmon industry from Macquarie Harbour will devastate the West Coast. Strahan and its surrounding towns will never be the same. If you think Im being dramatic, dont take it from me. Anyone whos spoken to people on the West Coast knows how important the salmon industry is to their survival. The industry has revitalised the West Coast. Its brought back that sense of pride for the community, and our communities need jobs to thrive. If the salmon industry jobs go, with nothing else to replace them, the community will implode. Families will have to move away to find new work, and the West Coast of Tassie will lose its next generation. It will die another death. The West Coast has taken hit after hit, and it wont survive another.  The Prime Minister has made a few visits to the West Coast recently. He said hes open to passing legislation so reviews cant be made against past decisions—the same kind of bill were voting on this morning from the coalition. I asked in question time last week if that was the Prime Ministers personal opinion or the official Labor Party policy. The Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Water wasnt aware of the Prime Ministers comments, and I think that says everything. With an election looming and Braddon a key seat, Labor and the Liberals are doing everything they can to win over voters on the northwest coast. Comments like this from the Prime Minister give the community hope. They give them a light at the end of the tunnel, a resolution finally in sight. But, if he doesnt have any intention of following through, its misleading and cruel to a community on the brink. Macquarie Harbour has been under review almost the entire time Labor has been in government—three years. Imagine waking up every day for three years not knowing if thats the day your job is going to be ripped out from under you, if its the day youre going to lose the ability to buy food for your family and pay for the roof over their head. Ive visited the workers in Strahan a few times. Each time, I was met by the worried faces of workers not concerned with politics or whats going on here in Canberra but who just want to do their job, provide for their families and be part of the West Coast community. It shouldnt be a big ask. The chaos around Macquarie Harbour has led to a wider debate about salmon farms, and weve taken an allornothing approach to the salmon industry in Tasmania. Either you support salmon and support jobs or you want to save a fish and damn an industry. This is a major oversimplification of the issue. I think theres a way forward where the industry can thrive and we can look after the environment at the same time. The salmon industry is a major employer. It directly employees thousands of people in Tasmania. Many of these jobs are in regional and remote areas where other employment opportunities arent available. But we cant ignore the very real environmental concerns either. Evidence shows salmon farms are contributing to longterm damage in sensitive aquatic habitats. Its not about compromise; its about finding solutions and genuinely improving outcomes for both sides. Here are some thoughts on how we could do that. The government can invest in offshore technologies. Itll help take the pressure off vulnerable ecosystems. They should also support research for sustainable food sources. Itll reduce the industrys environmental footprint and wastage. Lets also have more transparent reporting around the industry and bring the community into it. People in Hobart and Lonnie dont have direct contact with salmon farms in Macquarie Harbour or down in the Huon. Lets bring them into the conversation and acknowledge the industry has had its problems and will always be evolving to put them right. People trust that over the usual, Nothing to see here. To genuinely move forward with salmon farming in Tasmania, we need to start looking at how we work together rather than fighting against each other. The coalition bill aims to do just that. Its trying to make salmon farming no longer a political football. This bill says that reviews wont be able to be launched willynilly into past environmental decisions, but its not a blanket ban on all reviews. The bill allows anyone to call for a review within three years of a decision being made. After three years, the call can be made, but it has to come from the relevant state or territory minister, by whom the review of the action will happen. Its a reasonable buffer where a decision can be examined, but the case has to be made to an elected minister, and not by someone with a beef against the original decision. Businesses investing in our regions dont do it on a whim or easily change direction when somebody thinks they should. They invest with a view to the longterm future, not a threeyear election cycle. They have to be viable. They have to pay their workers. They have to make a profit and plan for the future. They take the risk and have to manage that risk. Their opponents know this, too. The bill still allows objections to be made, and, yes, hindsight can often help us look into the future. But it has to be balanced with whats fair and right. Opponents can still make their case to a state or territory minister, but it has to be fought and won on its merits, not on who can make the most noise and cause the most trouble. Ministers are accountable and can be challenged. They know this, especially at state or territory level. This bill, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Reconsideration of Decisions) Bill 2024, puts the power back in the hands of the local communities where decisions have been made—not in the hands of someone who lives in another state. Any rational person also knows that leaving thousands of workers in limbo for years is a dark place to be. Its not right and its not fair. When it comes to Macquarie Harbour, I stand with the workers and the West Coast community. I stand for finally getting a solution for an industry that spent three years waiting for the other shoe to drop. Thats why Im supporting this bill.","Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Reconsideration of Decisions) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator TYRRELL (Tasmania—Independent TAS Whip) ","(09:50):"

Hes done an incredible amount of work drafting this bill, which will provide the certainty that Tasmanias salmon workers need. Like I said, Senator Richard Colbeck has done an incredible amount of work on this bill. It is important to provide the salmon workers of Tasmania the certainty they need. I have spent many hours over the last few years meeting with Tasmanias salmon workers and talking to them about their concerns of a lack of certainty over their industry. I think it is incredibly important we listen to those concerns in this place.  As my colleagues who have already spoken on this bill, Senator Duniam and Senator Colbeck, have shared, Tasmanian salmon workers are hurting right now. They are hurting because this government has a decision sitting over their heads, meaning that they dont know if they are going to see another Christmas or another year working in their local industry. My colleagues Senator Colbeck and our fellow Senate candidate at the upcoming election, Jacki Martin, and I have spent time on the West Coast of Tasmania in Strahan, speaking to salmon workers and listening to their concerns. I know this bill that Senator Colbeck has introduced here today is incredibly important in doing that. If we are able to bring this bill on for vote today—and I certainly do hope that is something we can do—then I think that will go some way to providing the certainty that this industry needs. The government has not provided them with that certainty. The government has not listened to Tasmanian salmon workers. It has not listened to the concerns of the industry and what they are seeking to achieve.

Lets be very clear about the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act—it does not do what it says on the tin. It claims to be about protecting our environment, but what it actually does is facilitate the destruction of nature. It facilitates the undermining of biodiversity. It does that because it was designed to be a fast track for environmentally destructive approvals. It was never designed to be a piece of legislation that protected our environment. Thats why it was so disappointing when Labor kowtowed to the fossil fuel industry and refused to progress its socalled naturepositive laws, which were not anywhere near sufficient to fix our broken environment laws.  But Labor wouldnt even progress their weak attempt to fix our weak environment laws, because they got their riding orders from the giant fossil fuel corporations who, remember, are making obscene profits and whose CEOs are making multimillion dollar salary packages by cooking our planet. What that means is they are making obscene profits and their CEOs are making multimillion dollar salary packages by engaging an action that will actually result in large numbers of people dying, even greater numbers of people being displaced from their homes, famine, war and a massive civilisational upheaval that humanity will face as we move through the decades of this century. Instead of actually taking action in the public interest, we have Labor kowtowing to the fossil fuel sector and refusing to progress reforms to fix our broken environment laws and the Liberals coming in here today moving to undermine our already pathetically weak environment laws. This is a race to the bottom. It is dangerous for humanity. It is absolutely catastrophic for our ecosystems, for that beautiful, complex web of life that actually underpins human survival on this planet. History will view the Labor and Liberal parties very harshly—and rightly so. History will also laud those of us—for example, in the Greens—who are standing up and fighting against what is happening in here. This collaboration, this collusion between Labor and Liberal, to refuse to fix our environment laws and to actually actively undermine them and prevent them from even having an opportunity to do what it claims that they do in the name of the legislation, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, is active collusion and it is against the interests of humanity.

As if the car tax that was exposed yesterday wasnt enough, we now have the fresh food tax. What the coalition is seeking to do today is to have the farmers tax removed from the Notice Paper of Senate debate to give confidence to the 85,000 farmers across this country that this government will not seek to make them pay for the biosecurity arrangements of importers—their competitors. It is absolutely outrageous and really goes to the heart of the Labor Partys attack on rural and regional Australia. Our farmers are producing the cleanest, greenest product in the world. Our biosecurity arrangements need to be tough and they need to be secure, but you shouldnt be expecting our farmers to be the ones to pay for that, because—guess what—you tax the farmers but they are price takers. You have to pass that tax through. That means that, in the middle of a costofliving crisis, fresh groceries are going to go through the roof for everyday Australians. Youre seeing in the UK over this week that farmers right across the UK have taken to the streets of London against their own Labor government installing taxes and increased impost on the agriculture sector there. The agriculture sector here in Australia has made it very clear that they do not want this biosecurity tax, this fresh food tax from Labor. Thanks to the tough stance that they have taken, its sat on the Notice Paper for 320 days. We havent dealt with it. Thanks to the National Farmers Federation and their president, David Jochinke, for being so tough, for actually standing up for our primary producers, because what we have seen under Labor is that Australians are now seeing food at the grocery store go up by 12 per cent during the costofliving crisis. So what do they do? They think its just not high enough for everyday Australians to pay for their fresh food; lets put a tax on farmers. But thats not all theyve done to our agricultural sector. Theyve torn up the agriculture visa, making it harder for our farmers to find a workforce. Theyve banned the live sheep export trade, putting men and women—shearers—out of work in WA, and theyve also cut and delayed regional infrastructure and water projects. The 82 per cent renewable target by 2030 is seeing farmland carpeted with solar panels, wind towers, and transmission lines—tearing up private property rights. The deceitful changes to superannuation, which Im sure will be slammed through this chamber before we break, that will see farmers taxed on unrealised gains—as if theyre going to sell the family farm to pay their tax bill—are absolutely appalling. There is radical industrial relations law. Theyre signing up to the Global Methane Pledge. Thank you very much, if youre a beef producer! There are potential cultural heritage laws which put private property rights at risk across this country and the onerous scope 3 compulsory emissions, and I could go on. They talk a big game about supporting rural and regional Australians, the nine million of us who dont live in capital cities. They say that as theyre in front of the cameras, as theyre standing up in Merimbula even this morning. But look at peoples actions. This governments actions are an assault on rural and regional Australians, on what we do. You cant find a doctor in the regions, for love nor money. Theyve torn up projects that were supposed to assist us with road safety and productivity gains with freight. They are attacking our farmers. Theyve instigated a car and ute tax, which will mean rural and regional Australians pay more for the cars we dont just buy because we love them—which we do—but because we need them to do our work and to travel the hundreds of kilometres just to get to footy training on a Thursday night, let alone earn a living.

I can understand why the Nationals want to have a bit of debate at one minute to midnight, near the end of the 47th Parliament, to show theyre doing something for farmers, when most of their focus in this parliament has been on approving new coal projects and gas projects, fighting culture wars and undermining the path to recognition for our First Nations people. But here you are, having a little bit of a debate and raising points in the Senate to show that youre supporting farmers.  Ive got a couple of things to say very briefly about this bill. The Greens made it clear to Labor that we didnt support this bill in its current form. We did listen to the concerns raised with us by numerous stakeholders. But I want to be really clear. The funding in this country for biosecurity, which arguably is one of the biggest threats facing our agriculture sector, is through levies that are paid for agriculture producers and goes to a stance or a framework around reacting to biosecurity outbreaks. That funding is there, and, if we get a biosecurity outbreak, its there to be spent to try and get on top of a biosecurity outbreak. There isnt any funding to try to prevent biosecurity outbreaks. That comes out of general revenue. This bill was designed to add an extra funding stream to help us better futureproof our agricultural sector against enormous biosecurity risks, and I do believe it is something we still need to work on. I wanted to get this on record today. I spoke to the National Farmers Federation and other stakeholders, and they made it very clear with me that they were prepared to sit down with the government and find a way forward on this and find a new funding stream and a structure that works for them. In good faith, the Greens said to the government that we wouldnt support this, but we do have an expectation the agricultural sector will work with the government of the day to find a way forward so we can get more funding to prevent biosecurity risks. Weve recently seen it with the avian flu. There are so many risks facing our country. Weve got to do better. I wanted to get that on record today. Were supporting the discharge of this bill, but we have an expectation that, in good faith, the agricultural sector will work with the government to find a solution to this problem.","Withdrawal","BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator WHISHWILSON (Tasmania) ","(10:20):"
"0","0","0","1","1","ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The","10000","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," So bad is this government that even the Australian Greens have decided to distance themselves from the governments legislation. Senator WhishWilson has just confirmed that the Greens will support the discharge of the Agriculture (Biosecurity Protection) Levies Bill 2024 from the Notice Paper. Congratulation to Senator WhishWilson and the Australian Greens for the wisdom that you have shown in this particular instance.  Theres no group in the Australian community that the Labor government has not sought to target and undermine. Theyve undermined the experience of Australian families with their costofliving crisis. Theyve undermined Australias mining and resources sector with regulatory uncertainty as a result of duplicative environmental laws. There are workplace relations laws that stifle workplaces rather than enliven them, and, of course, Australias agricultural sector has been at the forefront of Labors attempts to undermine and attack the very heart and essence of Australias prosperity. Lets be very clear about this. The biosecurity protection levy bill was pushed through the House of Representatives in March 2024, almost a year ago, and has sat on the Senate Notice Paper for no fewer than 320 days. The opposition, in the form of the coalition, opposes it. The Australian Greens have now confirmed that they oppose it, so lets wait to see what the crossbench does. Every crossbench senator is now on notice. Do they support Australias agricultural sector, or do they want to tax it into oblivion? This fresh food tax or farming tax—whatever you want to call it—is just another attempt by the Labor government to undermine Australians agricultural sector. What more evidence do Australias regional communities need to confirm in their own hearts and minds that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Dr Jim Chalmers are not on their side? No matter what the government might do in the last 24 to 36 hours while rushing out all these new announcements—terminal to the teller and all these fancy slogans—the record of this Labor government in terms of supporting agricultural communities at a time of their greatest need is obvious and bad. Labor has chosen to tear up the agriculture visa. Labor is attempting illadvised changes to the PALM scheme. Labor is banning live sheep exports, which is sending shivers through the spines of regional communities in my home state of Western Australia; pushing ahead with water buybacks; signing up to a reckless race to 82 per cent renewables; implementing onerous scope 3 compulsory emissions reporting arrangements; making deceitful changes to superannuation; passing radical industrial relations laws that stifle farming communities; signing up to the Global Methane Pledge; potentially passing cultural heritage laws that put farming communities at risk; delaying red imported fire ant eradication funding; and implementing a new tax on trucks and utes.

"0","0","0","1","1","ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The","10000","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I rise to also support the removal of the Agriculture (Biosecurity Protection) Levies Bill 2024 from the Notice Paper. I cant understand why we dont put a tax on the importers. Weve now got the US President wanting to start a trade war, so lets call their bluff. Lets make the importers, the people who are bringing these containers on board, pay.  According to agriculture.gov.au, taxpayers have to pay 44 per cent of this levy. Believe it or not, Australia Post have to pay two per cent as well. Meanwhile, the importers only pay 48 per cent. Our wheat farmers and grain producers already pay through GST and through beer excise, and one of the policies that People First are advocating for is to reduce the beer excise tax from 60c per litre of alcohol down to 20c. This country was built by the beer drinkers and it belongs to them, not the wine drinkers. If wine can get a subsidy, so should beer. The other thing we need to do to help our agricultural producers in this country is allow the farmers to engage in collective bargaining when it comes to dealing with big wholesale buyers. In the supermarket inquiry, I saw that Coles and Woolworths are leaning very heavily on our horticultural growers—a big shoutout to the guys in the Lockyer Valley and around Bundaberg and to the many producers up in North Queensland. We need to protect our horticulturalists, we need to allow them to engage in collective bargaining and we need much more transparency in the prices that Coles and Woolworths are offering to our farmers. These are two policies that People First will be proposing. But Ill get back to this bill. We strongly believe that the people who import goods into this country should be the ones who pay for the biosecurity levy. Its not right that the consumers here in Australia have to pay for this. By putting a tax on the taxpayers, its another impost on the cost of living, through food. I, for the life of me, cant understand why wed want to be encouraging foreign farmers and foreign producers to sell their goods into Australia when we have a very viable and competitive agricultural sector here in Australia. I might add that Australia is one of the very few countries in the world that doesnt protect its agricultural and manufacturing industry—it makes my blood boil—and thats if you dont add on the amount of pork that gets dumped in this country from the EU and from Canada. This is the thing. Its all very well to say you believe in free trade, but that doesnt mean you destroy your own producers while other producers in other countries get enormous subsidies—the EUs notorious for this—and then dump. They get enormous subsidies in their own country, and they overproduce and then dump in this country. So I support the disallowance of this bill. I think its an absolute disgrace that we are trying to impose a tax on the Australian consumer. Let the foreign importers pay for this. Id also just say that we need to also reduce the excise on beer—its way out of control—and we need to allow our farmers to engage in collective bargaining with the big retailers like Coles and Woolworths.","Withdrawal","BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator RENNICK (Queensland) ","(10:27):"

Schedule 6 The day after this Act receives the Royal assent. (2) Page 49 (after line 17), at the end of the bill, add: Schedule 6 — Reconsideration of IAA decisions 1 Definitions In this Schedule: ART means the Administrative Review Tribunal. IAA means the Immigration Assessment Authority, as in existence before the transition time. Minister means the Minister administering the Migration Act 1958. new Act means the Administrative Review Tribunal Act 2024. transition time means the time the new Act commences. 2 Reconsideration of decisions on protection visa applications (1) Subitem (2) applies if, at any time before the transition time: (a) a person applied for a protection visa (within the meaning of the Migration Act 1958); and (b) a decision (the original decision) under section 65 of that Act on the persons application had been made to refuse to grant the visa to the person; and (c) the IAA reviewed and affirmed the original decision; and (d) the person has not been granted a protection visa since the original decision was made. (2) The Minister must: (a) refer the original decision to the ART as soon as practicable after the commencement of this item; and (b) notify the person in writing that the Minister has referred the original decision. (3) If the person requests the Minister to withdraw the referral, the Minister must withdraw the referral. (4) If the Minister refers an original decision to the ART under subitem (2), and the referral is not withdrawn on request of the person: (a) the person is taken to have made an application to the ART under section 347 of the Migration Act 1958 (as amended by Schedule 2 to the Administrative Review Tribunal (Consequential and Transitional Provisions No. 1) Act 2024) for a review of a reviewable protection decision; and (b) the application is taken to have been properly made under sections 347 and 347A of the Migration Act 1958 (as amended by Schedule 2 to the Administrative Review Tribunal (Consequential and Transitional Provisions No. 1) Act 2024). (5) The ART must, as soon as practicable after receiving the referral, review the original decision and: (a) affirm the original decision; or (b) remit the original decision for reconsideration in accordance with such directions or recommendations of the ART as the ART considers appropriate. (6) In reviewing the original decision, the ART must: (a) give the person a reasonable opportunity to provide additional information in relation to the original decision; and (b) disregard the decision made by the IAA to affirm the original decision. 3 Effect of this Schedule This Schedule has effect despite any other law of the Commonwealth. 4 Rules (1) The Minister administering the Administrative Review Tribunal Act 2024 may, by legislative instrument, make rules prescribing matters relating to the review by the ART of decisions covered by subitem 2(1). (2) Without limiting subitem (1) of this item, rules made for the purposes of that subitem may modify the operation of this Schedule or the new Act, to the extent that the modification is necessary to facilitate the review by the ART of the decisions covered by subitem 2(1). We had a discussion yesterday about the institutional unfairness that was inherent in the coalitions Immigration Assessment Authority process, and we saw some valiant efforts from Senator Scarr to try to hide the fact that some 460plus determinations of the Immigration Assessment Authority were reviewed by the Federal Court, found to be unlawful and then referred back to the IAA to be determined in accordance with law. We requested of the government some insight into the countless millions of dollars of Commonwealth money that was spent defending the indefensible in the Federal Court and the extent of the delays that were caused by the grossly and, in fact, intentionally unfair process that was established by the IAA, but we havent yet had that information provided. I understand the ministers argument that its not the core issue. The failure of the IAA isnt the actual core issue that he came briefed to deal with today and yesterday, but it remains the fact that the fasttrack process was an abuse of process that was intentionally designed to refuse valid asylum claims. I particularly want to note the unfairness that it visited on the Tamil community. Tamil claims for asylum were rejected at an obscene rate. They were almost guaranteed to be rejected. The country assessment from DFAT, relied upon by the IAA, deliberately minimised the ongoing persecution the Tamil community face and deliberately sought to downplay the ongoing violence towards, disappearances of and exclusions against the Tamil community, and, for that reason, hundreds of claims from the Tamil community for asylum were unfairly and unreasonably rejected. I want to note that its not just the Tamil community. The unfair approach was adopted for claims from those seeking asylum from persecution in Myanmar, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Iran, Sudan—the list goes on. I was particularly moved by the reports of one young woman, who is now an incredible contributor to our society—a leading international researcher on trying to understand skin cancers. Ive got to admit I have skin in the game on that one. She is an extraordinary woman, who only found her way through university through grants and scholarships because she was trapped in the fasttrack system. Having come here as a child and graduated from high school with all that promise, she was refused HECS and refused support into university, but, thankfully, universities and the broader community worked together with scholarships and grants, and she completed her studies, completed her postgraduate studies and is now a worldleading researcher and scholar on skin cancers. She is repeatedly invited to international forums to speak about it, but she cant leave the country, because shes trapped in the fasttrack process. Her asylum claim was rejected by the unfair IAA process. She cant travel and is caught, like thousands and thousands of others, having been rejected by the IAA and had this government, frustratingly, refuse to provide a safe and viable pathway for permanency. Weve heard stories—and, if the government and the opposition were willing to listen, youd hear stories—about claimants who put their application in to the IAA. They have researched sometimes for weeks or months, with a maximum fivepage covering letter and then sometimes countless pages of documentation identifying their persecution and identifying their wellfounded fear of persecution in the country from which they fled to Australia for safety. One case sticks in my mind—this young woman who put together her application, supported by hundreds of pages of documents, and finally submitted it at 10 oclock one night to the IAA. Having submitted it at 10 oclock that night, she woke up the next morning, and, at 10 am, she got an email saying it had been rejected. She puts it in at 10 oclock at night, with hundreds of pages of supporting documentation—its a hugely considered application—and its rejected by the coalitions unfair IAA at 10 oclock the following morning. That was only enough time for the assessing officer to literally open it up. They couldnt have pretended to have considered it. They couldnt have pretended to have looked at it. As a result, shes been caught in 10 years of insecurity and threats of deportation. Surely no government of conscience could let that stand. Instead, we have this government saying that theyre not going to put in a process to reconsider those unfair rejections in the IAA. The only process they have on foot is individual ministerial intervention—literally the feudal lord approach to this. You have to go and beg the minister for an intervention, and he or she may deign to give a tiny handful of people ministerial intervention. Lets be clear: with 7,000 applications for ministerial intervention, if that were actually the approach, considering those matters would be all the minister did for the next decade. It is a pretend solution. Its a nonsolution, so thats why we advanced this amendment, which is a real solution. This amendment would provide for the reconsideration of those unfair IAA decisions. Instead of placing it in the hands of a feudal lord politician, it would actually take the matter to the Administrative Review Tribunal. It would require the minister to refer to the ART, as soon as practicable, those matters where the circumstances are that there has been a review by the IAA that rejected an asylum claim and the person who was the subject of that review has not been granted a protection visa since that original decision was made. The minister, having referred them to the ART, obviously gives those individuals the right to seek to have the matter withdrawn. But if they dont, then the ART is required to consider the application, to treat it as a valid application, to then either affirm or reject the decision to review, and, in that process, to allow the person and the department to present whatever additional information is needed, to do the process fairly, to assess the claims in accordance with law and to live up to our commitment to provide a credible, honest and genuine pathway to actually have claims fairly assessed for those thousands of people who were caught in the fasttrack process. I urge the government to adopt this. We know the coalition wont, because they specialise in cruelty and theyre trying to defend their unfair system. We repealed the IAA because it was unfair. There are now thousands of people just demanding some fair chance to have their claims assessed—they and others are often protesting out the front of the ministers office. This gives them that fair chance. We urge the government to step up and do the right thing.","Administrative Review Tribunal (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator SHOEBRIDGE (New South Wales) ","(10:53):"
"0","0","0","1","1","TEMPORARY CHAIR, The","10000","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I first want to thank Senator Shoebridge for his work in this area over many, many years now, and that includes his time in the Senate. Also, Ive seen the way Senator Scarr engages methodically and in good faith on a range of issues, including this. I may very much disagree with his partys position on elements of amendments in this bill, the Administrative Review Tribunal (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2024, but I do think hes a genuinely goodfaith actor when it comes to getting across legislation and ensuring that it is sound.  I also want to commend the AttorneyGeneral and the government for making the Administrative Review Tribunal more independent and transparent. This is clearly a crucial and longoverdue step towards a fairer system. But fairness and accessibility, two of the tribunals stated goals, remain out of reach for many, particularly when it comes to migration matters. Fair and accessible should mean just that, and it should mean that for everyone, but under the Migration Act, the tribunal has no discretion to extend appeal deadlines for migration applicants, regardless of their circumstances. If you are currently homeless and dont receive a decision in time, too bad. If youre in hospital with a serious illness and you miss the deadline, too bad. If youre fleeing family violence and your decision is sent to your abusers address, too bad. In these cases, the only option is to go to the Federal Court, where cases drag on for years, clogging our legal system and dragging out the uncertainty. Migration matters make up 87 per cent of the tribunals case load, yet the tribunal is stripped of discretion in these cases. I find there is a disconnect in this place, in that we say to these bodies, We trust you. Youre experts. The appointment process is sound. Were going to have people on there who make great decisions, but then we take away discretion. Weve seen it done time and time again. We saw it done with the NACC, where we dont leave it up to the experts. We say: Youre experts. Do your thing, except in these circumstances where politics comes into play. On this issue, it is very cruel politics, and so many Australians want the major parties to do better on this. This bill was an opportunity to fix this, and I think its an opportunity that has been missed. Beyond procedural barriers, the government has failed to address another major injustice: the people who have been left behind by the fasttrack process. Its a process that, while in opposition, Labor pointed out many times was neither fast nor fair and has left so many people in our communities in limbo. It was a deeply flawed refugee determination system that was, rightly, abolished by this government, yet we have 7,000 people stuck in limbo, denied a fair review of their asylum claims. Many of these people arrived in Australia as children. It wasnt their decision to come here. They came here with their parents or with a parent. They went to school here and made friends here. They learned our history. They play sport in local teams in their community. They have dreamed about their future, like any other Australian kid. But, for them, that future remains uncertain. These young people, many of whom are now in their late teens or early 20s, dont even remember their country of origin. For all intents and purposes, they are Australian. They believe theyre Australian. They sound like theyre Australian. They are committed to Australian values and want to contribute but, because of the political race to the bottom on asylum seeker issues, our government still refuses to give them a fair go. For how long have we heard leaders say, If you have a go, youll get a go? What about these young people? Theyve grown up in a country that treats them as temporary, in the only home theyve ever known. Theyve been forced onto temporary bridging visas that keep them in a cycle of precarity, preventing them from planning their lives, accessing higher education or pursuing longterm employment. Many arent even allowed to work or study at all because of the conditions of their bridging visas. Imagine finishing high school alongside your classmates. Youve got hopes and dreams for the future. You apply to university, and you get in. Some young people Ive spoken to have won scholarships to universities. Theyve been the top of their class. Theyve worked harder than their peers, driven by a desire to make something of the opportunities this country should be giving them. They go to university and, when they turn 18, they get a letter from this government saying, Sorry, you can no longer study at this institution. In many cases, they cant work. They have no study or work rights. This is so cruel. When you zoom out, its cruel, and, when you talk to someone in that situation, its cruel. I do not understand why we do this as a country. Weve got young people who have dreamt of working in health care or education. We hear so much about the desperate need for more workers in those areas, and we see a government trying to get more people to migrate to Australia. Yet we have people here in our communities who want to do that, and were not allowing them to chase their dreams. Theyre being shut out of university or even TAFE. This is a moral failure of our country. Its a moral failure to not recognise the contributions of thousands of people who have already given so much to this country despite being given so little in return. I would urge colleagues in this place to think about this moral failure. If we truly love this place, we should expect more of this country. We should be constantly challenging ourselves when it comes to these issues that happen for political reasons but have such a brutal impact on fellow human beings. I support this bill, given the governments amendments that remove the provisions that would have caused even greater harm to migration applicants. But lets be clear. The tribunal is still not fair and accessible for the majority of its applicants, and the government must act to fix the impacts of the broken fasttrack system that has left 7,000 people in our communities in limbo. We must do better. Fairness should not depend on who you are, who you know or where you were born. Minister, can you advise whether it is the governments intention to continue to work to make the ART more fair and accessible for migration applications, considering they make up 87 per cent of the tribunals case load?","Administrative Review Tribunal (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator DAVID POCOCK (Australian Capital Territory) ","(11:02):"

All matters that had been finally determined by the IAA prior to the abolition of the IAA remain final and determined. This is appropriate as it provides finality and certainty as the outcome of protection visa decisions.  Individuals whose applications have been considered by the IAA have already had an opportunity to access merits reviews. It is not appropriate to provide an additional right of review.

The fasttrack process that we established through the IAA was able to resolve those cases very quickly, usually in a matter of weeks rather than months. And the overturn rates were in line with other decisions of the tribunal.  Essentially what the Greens want to do with this amendment is reopen every single refugee case that was finally decided by the IAA. This would almost inevitably lead to a massive increase in the burden that is already placed on the tribunal. It will increase costs and increase delays for everyone involved, including the people the Greens say theyre trying to help. There is no public benefit in this amendment. Its not an appropriate measure and it should be opposed.","Administrative Review Tribunal (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator DAVEY (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate) ","(11:12):"

I want to thank Senator Pocock for his contribution, for talking about these 7,000 people as though they actually matter and talking about the teenagers who are right now going into their HSC year wondering if politics will ever give them a pathway to go to uni in the only home theyve every know. I think we should reflect upon the difference in politics of talking about people as though theyre people, as opposed to the way the coalition and Labor are doing it here, talking about them as political problems or political pawns or inconveniences to the case management of an administrative tribunal. We heard the coalition come up and say they werent going to provide a just pathway for these 7,000 people—the mums, the dads, the kids, the brothers and the sisters—because its administratively inconvenient to them. Thats the nature of their politics, and I understand thats the nature of their politics, but its politics the Greens fundamentally reject. The government stood up and said, Well, these people have already had a merits review, and therefore theyre not going to open the door to a review of the fasttrack process. I remind the government that we abolished the fasttrack process, and we supported the governments bill to abolish it because the government acknowledged, as did every informed observer, that it was an unmeritorious review. It was, as many have said, neither fair nor fast; it was grossly unfair. To remind the chamber, the IAA fasttrack process did not even pretend to observe minimum procedural fairness standards. Nobody had the right to a hearing. Almost 100 per cent of the claims were decided on the papers, because they didnt want to hear from the people who brought the claims. People were only allowed to provide a fivepage written submission. They had no legal support, legal advice or support from the government in any case, and they often had only three weeks to provide their submission about their entire life. They were almost always prohibited from providing fresh information and were stuck with whatever the department had decided should be before the IAA. Thats not a merit based process. Then the government said, Oh, by the way, there was a judicial review. We know that thats not a merits review. We know that that never went to the substance of the matter. Again, I urge the Labor Party—I think its a lost cause with the coalition—to think about the core principles that are meant to underpin their movement, to think about what their members would want, even if its politically inconvenient to them in the moment, and to think about these 7,000 people as people.","Administrative Review Tribunal (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator SHOEBRIDGE (New South Wales) ","(11:14):"

"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," The Veterans Entitlements, Treatment and Support (Simplification and Harmonisation) Bill 2024 has been far too long in the making given the urgency it should have received. This legislation is in response to the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicides first recommendation in its interim report, which was handed down in August 2022. The recommendation found that the veteran compensation and rehabilitation legislative system is so complicated that it actually adversely affects the mental health of some veterans and serving ADF members and can contribute to suicidality. The words can contribute to suicidality should have raised a sense of urgency, particularly on an issue that essentially has bipartisan support.  Work on simplifying and harmonising the system should have been a priority even as the royal commission completed its vital and sensitive investigations. Yet it took almost two years for the bill to first be introduced, passing the House of Representatives on 6 November last year after debate originally opened in August. Since then, it has languished on the Senates Notice Paper. It was first put on the paper on 18 November, and it has been on a veritable rollercoaster, being pulled up and then pushed back on the Notice Paper, going up and down, which shows you the level of priority this government has put on securing the health and wellbeing of our veteran personnel. We must ask: how many more will be let down and feel abandoned before the changes of this bill finally come about, given they will not come into effect until July 2026, nearly four years after the original recommendation was made? We currently have about 300,000 veterans in Australia. We currently have about 57,000 serving personnel. So we have a great many reasons why we need to get this legislation correct, to get it passed and to get it working. The royal commission reported that 1,677 veteran suicides had occurred between 1997 and 2021, but it is widely recognised that this figure is probably very shy of the more accurate assessment of upwards of about 3,000. The very, very sad reality is that there is more chance of a veteran dying from suicide than dying while serving our country, and that is tragic. This legislation combines into one the three separate acts that currently exist for entitlements, compensation and rehabilitation support for veterans. The three acts are the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, commonly known as the MRCA; the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (DefenceRelated Claims) Act, or the DRCA; and the Veterans Entitlements Act. They will be combined into an amended military rehabilitation and compensation or the MRCA 2.0, as my colleague in the other place shadow minister for veterans affairs Barnaby Joyce calls it. Currently, the three acts are over 2,000 pages long. They contain 850 legislative instruments and provide different types of compensation, including pensions, lump sums, periodic compensation payments, healthcare cards and rehabilitation. In some cases, veterans have claims under all three acts. It is no wonder that our veterans community finds it overly complicated as they try and wade through the system. But I want to make the point that it is very important for our veterans community to understand that, in streamlining these three acts into one, noone who is currently receiving a payment under any of those three acts will be worse off. This is an assurance given to us by the government, and it is an assurance we will hold the government to. In some instances, allowances will increase: funeral allowances, reimbursement of funeral costs and other service related deaths. There might be higher reimbursements for travel and treatment, and for consolidation of household and attendant care, among other enhancements. This is all welcome. While this bill simplifies veterans compensation arrangements, the systems remain complex, with veterans and their families still eligible for support under multiple acts. This needs very careful management by Veterans Affairs. This bill also requires ongoing consideration and review. That is why we will be moving a second reading amendment, calling for the government to review the statement of principles and the role of the Repatriation Medical Authority offices—not to try and slow things down but to make sure that the statement of principles is fit for purpose and that noone is slipping through the cracks because the statement of principles is being applied too rigidly—and to look at ways to ensure that the RMAs can do their job without hindrance. Despite this complexity and despite the time and consideration that has gone into drafting this bill to streamline and harmonise compensation for veterans, we have an eleventhhour amendment put forward by the government to establish a new veterans commissioner. This is also a recommendation of the royal commission, so the intent and the principle of establishing a commissioner will not be objected to. However, this amendment is being rushed through with a lack of consultation with the very people who have been part of this process all the way along and who participated in the recent Senate inquiry into this bill. This amendment was not part of that inquiry. Those people read about it only last week and have raised quite significant concerns with the way it has been drafted. The question needs to be asked: why does this amendment have to be rushed through today, when a commissioner was already in the pipeline? On 17 January, Mr Michael Manthorpe was appointed interim commissioner to deliver the establishment of a legislated body by September. This amendment is being rushed through to establish a body by September without allowing consultation and scrutiny, and that is the concern that has been raised with us. The Families of Veterans Guild have written to us specifically requesting the amendment be withdrawn because they say the amendment is a surprise to many stakeholders within the veteran community who, despite receiving multiple communications about the vets bill and a media release about the appointment of the interim commissioner, were not advised about this significant amendment. They fundamentally disagree with rushing this unconsulted amendment through parliament, and they point out that it could have significant consequences for the system and communities within it. The key issues they raise are the lack of transparency and consultation and that there are only two public reports on the status of the implementation of the royal commission required by this amendment; they would like to see further reports. While were not opposing this amendment, we are proposing to put through an amendment of our own requiring that the commission be reviewed. Effectively, what should have happened was for us to have had this amendment at the time of the Senate inquiry or to have had it as a standalone bill that we could have sent to a Senate inquiry and had a review on to ensure that it was for purpose, that people could be consulted and that the design of the commission was fit for purpose. Were now having to do that back to front, because the last thing we want to see is the streamlining and harmonisation of the compensation program be held up in disputes. We will pass the substantive bill and accept the amendment, but we hope that our subsequent amendment calling for a review will also gain support. This is a very sensitive and complex area, and most Defence Force personnel enlist and serve their time and then transition back to civilian life okay. Most of them go on to make an enormous contribution to civilian life. A hell of a lot of them work in voluntary services, and I thank them for their continued service to our nation. I want to take this opportunity to mention and thank Disaster Relief Australia, who are an organisation established by veterans for veterans and veteran volunteers. They step up post disaster and provide management and logistics support to communities that have been impacted by natural disasters. I am sure they are in Far North Queensland as we speak, assisting in the recovery and cleanup efforts. That is an organisation that plays an important role in supporting our veteran community, connecting our veteran members with business holders and with other veterans and giving them that support network. We know through the work of the royal commission that those connections, initiatives and organisations like DRA to assist veterans—similarly to things like veterans wellbeing centres—provide a hub for connection and support and can really help veterans post their fulltime service. We will be supporting this bill, as I said at the outset. It has been a long time coming, but it is the right thing to do to streamline it. I really hope that we continue to watch, monitor and hold the DVA to account. Im sure theyre preparing for the next estimates diligently. Lets hope that we can make our veterans lives a little bit easier by passing this bill. I, and also on behalf of Senator Fawcett, move: At the end of the motion, add , but the Senate: (a) notes that there remains concern about aspects of the operation of this bill and, in particular, the rigid nature of the statement of principles used in determining claims for liability for injuries, diseases and deaths made by veterans; and (b) calls on the Government to cause a review to be undertaken by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, and in consultation with relevant stakeholders, into: (i) whether the statement of principles is fit for purpose in ensuring that every veteran receives just and timely support, (ii) the functions of the Repatriation Medical Authority, and (iii) whether further changes are needed to relevant legislation, policy, procedures or guidelines to improve outcomes for veterans with unique or unusual circumstances.  The Australian Greens support the policy of harmonising the current veterans entitlements and rehabilitation and compensation arrangements from three acts into one. To that extent, we will be supporting the Veterans Entitlements, Treatment and Support (Simplification and Harmonisation) Bill 2024, and we will be navigating our way through a variety of amendments that have been proposed from all around the chamber on the bill. However, there needs to be continuing support and dialogue with veterans and their families to ensure that the intent of the bill is met—that is, that noone is left worse off. Weve had that statement repeatedly from the minister, and I take him at his word. But I can tell you now that the veteran community, with their advocates and friends in this chamber, will be holding the government to that and ensuring that that fundamental underpinning of this harmonisation legislation is met and that noone is actually worse off. The bill represents what I would call a modest bureaucratic change into how veterans entitlements are managed in this country. It doesnt pretend to be a response to the final report from the royal commission, for the most obvious reason that it was tabled before the final report was released. That matter has been confirmed by the Department of Veterans Affairs in the inquiry we had into the bill and in exchanges in estimates as well. This bill wont in itself make any of the essential changes that veterans and their supporters know are needed to address the core recommendations of the spirit of that royal commission. That is unfinished work. This bill largely benefits the bureaucracy, with benefits for veterans—there will be some as a result of this, though largely incidental to the bureaucratic benefits that are delivered from simplifying three schemes into one. What we did see in the inquiry was very clear evidence that the legislation governing veterans entitlements and their rehabilitation and compensation rights is extraordinarily complex. Its incredibly difficult for even engaged advocates and lawyers to navigate, and we saw that it harms veterans and harms their families. The current approach of veterans being covered by the Veterans Entitlements Act 1986; the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defencerelated Claims) Act 1988, the DRCA; and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004, the MRCA, is just not fit for purpose. That was absolutely clear. The scope of this bill is intentionally limited to not address the fundamental ways in which veterans are dealt with. But as the TPI Federation said in their evidence to the inquiry: … the proposed changes to the legislation actually is not intended to alleviate suicidal ideation but rather tries to address issues that the Government and the Bureaucracy has with the legislation. This Simplification is for the purpose of administration and not for the benefit of the Veterans and their families. From my perspective, having heard that evidence, having sat through the inquiry and having spoken with veterans and their advocates in the organisation, I think what we can say is that simplified administration could, to some very modest degree, empower veterans to better navigate the bureaucracy. That is a modest win for veterans. But the point is still clear that this bill is not actually intended to address those myriad issues with veteran compensation. It just doesnt; its urgent unfinished business. What we do know is that the recommendations of the royal commission remain overwhelmingly unaddressed, and we need to work across the chamber to ensure that the rights and needs based entitlements, rehabilitation and compensation rights that veterans should expect after service are actually in place. We look forward to working with the government. In fact, we look forward to working across the chamber, and I particularly want to commend the work of Senator Lambie. Shes been an unfailing advocate, and I acknowledge the bravery she has shown in that space to work across the chamber to implement the recommendations of the royal commission. There are some matters that remain unaddressed. One of the strong lines of evidence in the inquiry was about how much of the language is incredibly dated, even in the updated bill. The Families of Veterans Guild pointed out in their submission to the committee: The first thing that needs to be done is to include veteran families and to remove archaic language which perpetuates power dynamics and isnt consistent with contemporary standards. Language like wholly dependent partner, dependents and attendants no longer meets community expectations and devalues the role of veteran families. If the Bill were to include amendments to the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 (MRCA) to replace this language with the words veteran families or families of veterans then the Act too would need to define them … I do note that, when thats tested across the broader veteran community, the difficulty has been landing those definitions and determining where veteran families begin and end or what families of veterans would mean. But it shouldnt be a task beyond a competent government and bureaucracy to engage and take the language from the 1950s and turn it into something that genuinely represents that sweep of supports—family and close support—that veterans have and need, often because the formal system itself doesnt support them. We note that theres the introduction of reforms to the presumptive liability provisions. They do look like, and we tested that in the inquiry, a modest positive step because there are certain conditions where, if veterans develop them after a period of service, the presumption should be that they actually arose from service without veterans having to go through incredibly complex steps. Tragically, that includes a series of cancers for veterans who were exposed to chemicals that we now know, and indeed a goodfaith employer would have known at the time for much of their work, are likely to be cancer causing. Some of that is already covered in existing bureaucratic determinations, but, as the evidence becomes clearer, more of those conditions should be included. Veterans who served in conflict zones or had extended peacekeeping obligations, when they present with often quite complex PTSD, shouldnt have to go through a process of proving that their PTSD arose from their service. Presumptive liability allows for that compensation to flow at the time they need it, which is when they first present, not a year and a half after their lawyers manage to persuade the department to move. I do ask and Id seek the minister to address how the new scheme will work in practice. There doesnt seem to be a clear, transparent process. We had a commitment from the government that all the existing conditions covered by presumptive liability would be grandfathered through an administrative process, and wed like the government to confirm that. But then there is no clarity about what the process will be to add future presumptive liability claims. I think the government owes the veterans, their families and their communities that transparency. We ask for that to be clear. How will the statements of principles regime be applied? We know that there have been concerns over issues of eligibility, and weve heard these from stakeholders and veterans. They were raised in the inquiry and theyve been raised historically. One clear example that has been repeatedly raised with us is the surviving 196572 national servicemen who served overseas or personnel who were not in a warlike condition as determined by Defence but certainly were exposed to danger. Those nashos in that period from 1965 to 1972 were conscripted. They didnt have a choice. If they went overseas and served in Vietnam and were directly exposed in Vietnam, they had a certain set of entitlements, but, if, for example, they went to Butterworth in Malaysia and did perimeter patrols, they were found to not be in warlike conditions even though they were under threat of attack throughout much of that work that they did. As for those nashos who spent six years here as conscripts instead of on service overseas, theyve been largely rubbed from history. It doesnt seem right to us, and we have amendments to try and remedy that historical injustice to the nashos. I particularly want to note that many veterans who served in peacekeeping actions with the ADF served in conditions that put them at incredible personal risk. Indeed, one of the most recent serious injuries suffered by ADF personnel was during an attack on a peacekeeping operation on the border between Lebanon and Israel. They were hit by a missile strike. The department has a table of peacekeeping missions that are found to qualify for warlike service, but the question is: why have some peacekeeping missions that were incredibly dangerous not been included? Theres a list of them. We have an amendment that wed urge this chamber to support that seeks a review of those peacekeeping operations and the extent to which peacekeeping operations where people were exposed to incredible risk have been deemed to not be warlike service. That would include such things as the United Nations Commission for Indonesia in January of 1949—some of those veterans are still with us, and that was an incredibly dangerous deployment—as well as the United Nations Yemen Observation Mission, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and the Sinai Multinational Force and Observers. Those, of course, were established by protocol between Egypt and Israel. The list could go on. These veterans were exposed to incredible hardship and real and genuine danger, but, because the definition of warlike deployment requires some kind of military intent, despite the risks and despite the dangers, they feel like theyre treated like secondclass veterans. We hope that will end, and we hope that there will be majority support for a review of peacekeeping operations. I particularly want to note the advocacy of the Australian Peacekeeper and Peacemaker Veterans Association, the APPVA, who said in their submission: … the APPVA is concerned that a legislative limitation on the definition of a veteran, risks recreating the historical problems created by differentiating between different classes of veterans, even when these veterans served sidebyside on the same operation. If this issue remains unaddressed, the government will simply recreate the policy complexity, interveteran tensions, administrative intransigence, and poor outcomes that have adversely impacted veterans support arrangements for decades. Stopping there, this may seem like some kind of legal argument about what are or arent warlike conditions, and theres a definition there, and, if you fall on one side, youre recognised and, if you fall on the other, youre not. When you talk to veterans, this is incredibly important to them not just for the compensation benefits they get but for the status and recognition of their service. I do want to thank the government for working with us on having amendments to ensure that there will be a statutory review within a year. I think thats important, and thats a good faith amendment. The ministers office, I think, have been dealing with complex legislation, navigating their internal stakeholders and external stakeholders as best they can. We do have very real concerns, though, for how the lastminute amendment to implement recommendation 122 of the royal commission has found its way as a small novel attached to the end of this bill. We will support the creation of the commission, but weve heard from the veterans community how surprised they were that it came in this way and how little consultation there was, and we think its fundamental that there be a parliamentary review of that. I finish by giving special thanks to the TPI Federation of Australia, the Families of Veterans Guild, the Australian Peacekeeper and Peacemaker Veterans Association, the Defence Force Welfare Association and the nashos—the national servicemen—for their engagement with my office. I would be remiss if I didnt also acknowledge the work of my staff and, particularly, Sam Brennan in doing that work and getting us to the position we are in. This bill makes modest changes. Well back in the modest changes. We hope for improvements by way of amendment, but I can tell you now theres a bloody lot more work to be done.  I rise to make a few remarks on the substantive bill, the Veterans Entitlements, Treatment and Support (Simplification and Harmonisation) Bill 2024, and then a couple of remarks regarding the two amendments that I have cosponsored with my colleague Senator Davey. This is probably the sixth or seventh inquiry that I have been involved with during my time as a senator, having come from a defence background. The welfare of our veterans is important, and it has come before the parliament on multiple occasions. This bill seeks to do something that a number of stakeholders over many years have called for, in terms of simplifying the system so that we can put into effect what the current Chief of Army said in his opening remarks at the Land Forces conference last year—that this is a onceinageneration opportunity to reduce suicide and suicidality and that we can and must do more to ensure that we do not leave our mates behind, fallen on their own personal battlefield. There is a challenge we have with this bill, with the eight schedules that were originally part of it and were subject to the inquiry by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee—I see the secretary of that committee sitting here in the chamber, so thank you for your work and that of your team in helping to facilitate that inquiry—as well as, as colleagues have highlighted, the surprise ninth schedule that has come in regarding the commission. Those do a lot to bring about some of the structural changes that are required and some reform that will, hopefully, make the process easier, but its important to remember that this process is dealing with people, with individuals. I noticed that the royal commission highlighted in their report: Risk and protective factors interact in complex and unpredictable ways in peoples lives. Similarly, exposure to known risk factors for suicide and suicidality does not affect everyone in the same way. That means that, whilst I applaud and welcome a number of measures to make three complex bills somewhat more aligned and simple, in one measure, we have to remember that no structure in and of itself, particularly if there are rigid definitions, will achieve what the Chief of Army has talked about, which is making sure we dont leave any of our mates behind. While things like the statement of principles, which are going to be embedded into the new system, have proven to be effective in simplifying some decisionmaking—and I would accept the evidence that, in many cases, it has accelerated the decisionmaking—they have also had the perverse effect of arbitrarily excluding some veterans who perhaps have unique or unusual circumstances or things that werent envisaged by the people who put the statement of principles together. If we are to achieve the Chief of Armys vision of not leaving any one of our mates behind, we need to make sure not only that we refine the process and put in place good measures—I welcome, for example, the fact that we have gone from looking for causality under MRCA to now looking at a temporal connection. The government and Defence have essentially accepted the fact that you dont need to prove that your deployment—for example, to Afghanistan—is the direct cause and have medical records to show it. If you were there at the appropriate time of the kinds of actions that may have caused that, then that temporal causality will establish the fact that the Commonwealth has an obligation to look after you. Thats been a long time coming, and it builds on things like nonliability health care, where we have basically said that if youre in the ADF we will look after you. That took a long time to come in, but its those kinds of changes that meet the real human need and that we have to have. I will leave my comments on the substantive bill there and address a couple of brief remarks regarding the two amendments. As two other colleagues have indicated, there was significant surprise amongst the veterans community and exservice organisations about the verylastminute inclusion of an amendment from the government to establish the commission. Whilst we accept that its a recommendation of the royal commission, if you read through the amendment, you will see that this is a body which is given quite remarkable powers. People will go to jail if they dont cooperate and work with the commissioner. And yet there is very little transparency in terms of the appointment, oversight, costings and all of the subordinate rules and regulations for how it will run. Most importantly, it was not codesigned with the people who it is intended to benefit or those who have lived experience in the whole veterans and DVA system. If there is one thing that governments of both persuasions have often talked about, its the importance of stakeholder engagement and the principle of working with people who are going to be affected and to put something in at the last minute with no ability for the Senate to scrutinise that, I think, is very poor. As Senator Davey said, we are not going to stay in the way of the passage of this bill, because, as groups like the RSL and others have highlighted, weve waited too long for this and we should get this through. But we know that the commission is due to come in in September of this year, and the second reading amendment that the coalition is putting forward is intended to provide the impetus to commence a review that provides the opportunity for the consultation that should have occurred before this amendment was actually brought before the parliament. I encourage people on the crossbench and in the government to support this coalition position, because what its providing is an opportunity, even once the parliament is prorogued, for stakeholders to say, Yes, there is an inquiry coming. What comment would we like to make on this commission? What do we think it needs to be able to do? so that, when a new government is formed after the election and even during the caretaker period, while the department is designing and working around what the commission would look like, we start building the evidence base for a codesigned process. In those months leading up to the commencement in September this year, at least there would be an opportunity, which currently there has not been, for stakeholders to have a voice. I recognise that Senator Lambie has put her own amendment forward, which is welcome. She has given thought to, perhaps, some changes that should occur, who appoints et cetera, but I still believe there needs to be that broader consultation. This amendment is intended to say, Lets have a codesigned process for the affected stakeholders so, before it becomes operational in September, we give veterans, their families and their support groups the opportunity to have some input into this commission. That is the substantive amendment going in. The second reading amendment goes to the issue of how we pick up the individual. It picked up on the words of the royal commission that highlight that every person responds differently. I come to the statement of principles. They provide a framework by which some groups—Im going to refer here to an article that was actually written in the Examiner newspaper by Mel Dee back in December last year. Its a very useful, succinct summary of some case studies and some of the issues at play. Thats where these quotes are coming from. Ive chosen these because they are quite a succinct summary of some of the concerns various stakeholders have raised. Ive talked about the statement of principles and the fact that theres broad support by many within the community, because they have expedited decisions for many people. But its the interaction between the Repatriation Medical Authority, the RMA, and the statement of principles that is of some concern. DVA have come out and very specifically said that they do not want to make individual decisions unless the RMA approves a change to the SOP overall. But if we take what the royal commission said as fact, and if we hear what psychologists and others tell us, individuals do respond differently. So my view is that, like we have nonliability health care, presumptive liability and temporal connections as opposed to causal relationships, if a veteran has a couple of wellcredentialled medical experts saying, We think this person is suffering this effect because of their defence service, and here is our evidence, we should have a system that is flexible enough to say, The presumption, on the strength of these two medical experts, is that this veteran should be supported by the Commonwealth. If a subsequent review finds out that this is not actually something that is worth putting into the broader SOP then thats fine, but the timeframe, which the royal commission found in some cases exceeded 12 months, affects the broader framework and system. It doesnt increase the suicidality of the individual. I recognise that departments and governments hate the concept of unbounded liability, but I think we can put enough checks and balances in to make sure that we avoid a situation where people go doctor shopping to find someone whos known to be supportive. I think theres a way we can do that, but we can provide the flexibility to pick up those individual differences. We can have a presumption of support. By providing the support that the Chief of Army talked about—Leave none of our mates behind—we can keep that person out of the dark spiral that they can so easily fall into. And then we take the review over a longer period to see if we should change the system. So thats our second reading amendment. We recognise its not going to get done by September this year. Its a complex issue, so the recommendation is that within six months there should be feedback on that particular issue. I would encourage senators on the government benches and the crossbench to support those two amendments looking into the RMA and the SOP to make sure they are fit for purpose and that every individual receives just and timely support from the Commonwealth they have served. I also encourage support for the oppositions substantive amendments, which would put in place the opportunity for stakeholders to have their voices heard around the design and function of this commission. I understand that that will still overlap with the work others will be doing to stand up the commission. But the best possible outcome would be if the next government—and I trust it will be a coalition government, but, even if it is a LaborGreens alliance, whoever is in power should do this—sought to commit to use this as an opportunity for codesign, to make sure that what is actually implemented in September is fit for purpose and meets the desires, expectations and needs of the veteran community, including their families.  I support the Veterans Entitlements, Treatment and Support (Simplification and Harmonisation) Bill 2024 and I support veterans. Today I want to speak about a World War I veteran who is very close to my heart: my pop, Corporal Harry Thorpe, a Brabralung man of the Gunnai nation. Blackfellas were originally not allowed to serve, under the Defence Act 1903, but as enlistment numbers dwindled and the cost of horrific war grew, the government quietly shifted its stance, allowing First Nations people to serve—only when it suited the government, only when their sacrifice became necessary, but never with the full rights or recognition of those they fought beside. Harry Thorpe was one of those men. He left his home on Lake Tyers Mission, where my family was displaced, to fight alongside thousands of men and women who hoped to do their part to fight for justice. When Pop left, Pop left his humpy behind. Out of respect, the locals left his old humpy untouched, waiting for his return. But. like so many others, he never returned. My pop, Lance Corporal Thorpe, was awarded the Military Medal and promoted to corporal for his courage and the leadership he showed during operations in Belgium on the night of 4 and 5 October 1917. On 9 August 1918, in France, a stretcherbearer found him shot in the stomach. He died shortly afterwards and is now buried in the Heath Cemetery at Harbonnieres, France, with his mate William Rawlings, another First Nations Military Medal winner, who was killed on the same day. Because Harry had been such a big part of the community, when he did not return, the lane where his humpy was left behind was named in his honour. Its now called Thorpes Lane. Thorpes Lane is now the site of the Lakes Entrance tip, right opposite a big mansion overlooking the ocean. This is the difference between how black and white soldiers are commemorated. So today I want to honour my pop and all the other First Nations men and women who fought in World War I and World War II. Their names, their sacrifices and their final resting places are too often forgotten and too often ignored. Uncle Joe Flick, the grandson of Michael Flick, another black soldier, is changing that. His project, Bringing Their Spirits Home, is about truth, recognition and justice. He has spent years searching for the graves of First Nations soldiers buried overseas in France, Belgium, Egypt and Gallipoli, marking their names, tracing their stories and bringing them back to their families and their country. Its work that shouldve been done long, long ago. We also have to reckon with what happened when our soldiers did return. White veterans were honoured, respected, celebrated and granted the land of First Peoples through the Soldier Settlement Scheme. They say leave no mate behind; however, many First Nations veterans were given nothing—no land, no recognition and no mention. The very land they fought for was handed to others, while they were pushed aside, their service erased. So Im here today, refusing to let that history be buried. Through Uncle Joe Flicks work and through our voices, we are bringing the spirits home, not just in name but in the respect and honour they have always deserved, so their families will know where the final resting places of their ancestors are. We have all lost so many to violence. Wars have never brought justice, only more stolen land, more bloodshed and more broken promises. True honour lies not in conquest but in peace—and in returning what was taken and in refusing to fight wars that were never ours to begin with.","Veterans Entitlements, Treatment and Support (Simplification and Harmonisation) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator DAVEY (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate) ","(11:26):"

Veterans, their families, their kids and their mates fought for decades to get a royal commission into Defence and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Since the commissioners handed down their recommendations, my office has been continually working and getting feedback from the veteran community and, most importantly, looking at amendments that will make the governments response to the royal commissions recommendations work for our veterans.  Recommendation 122 of the royal commission seeks to establish a new statutory entity headed up by a commissioner to oversee reform across the whole of the defence system. I had an amendment that would give the head of the Defence and Veterans Services Commission the powers of a royal commissioner, the power to provide independent oversight, the power to hold public hearings and the power to drive reform to improve suicide prevention and wellbeing outcomes for serving and exserving Australian Defence Force members. Unless that national commissioner has these powers, then things wont change and our veterans will continue to take their lives in record numbers. I understand that we, and I, do not have a magic wand to stop all suicides, but if we get this right, by hell, we can reduce those numbers. The government loved this amendment so much that they copied it themselves. They wanted the win, and thats okay; I dont care who gets the credit, as long as our veterans and their families get the benefits. We must extend the coverage of our liability to situations where members of the Australian Defence Force sustain injuries or fatalities during physical exercise or whilst on shore leave. With the way it is now, the liability falls way short, especially in cases of injury or death occurring outside the narrowly defined scope of onduty service. Delays in accepting liability and delays in claims being ticked off massively impact on our veterans and their families. There has to be a time limit. My amendment means that claims for permanent impairment will be resolved within 120 days, and for incapacity itll be within 90 days. This amendment includes safeguards to stop the clock, to account for reasonable delays like medical advice.","Veterans Entitlements, Treatment and Support (Simplification and Harmonisation) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator LAMBIE (Tasmania) ","(12:12):"

"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," For too long in this building, womens health hasnt received the attention, solutions or funding that it has deserved. I doubt—actually, I know—theres not a single woman in Australia who is without a story about how our health system has let her down or let someone she loves down. A womans health journey is simply and categorically different to a mans, not just because our bodies tick differently but because theres a stigma that surrounds everything from our first period to our last. That stigma has not just a personal impact on women and their health journey but a policy impact in the way we fund and deliver services. This stigma has stopped the right conversations happening about womens health, and therefore it has impeded policy solutions which would make a difference in womens lives.  I am deeply proud of the work of two recent Senate inquiries into womens health that have taken place through the Community Affairs References Committee this term—one into the impacts of menopause and perimenopause, and the other on womens sexual, reproductive and maternal health. I want to thank and acknowledge the work of the members of that committee: Senators Pratt, AllmanPayne, Kovacic, Hughes, Askew and, most of all, Waters, who herself is an incredible advocate on these issues. Our inquiries deliberately harnessed the great big spotlight we have available to us in this chamber through our committee system. We shone that light brightly on an area of public policy that has been shrouded in stigma and ignored for too long. Our work confirmed what Ive long been raising the alarm on. We know that, when it comes to womens health, you dont need to look very hard at all to see where womens pain or symptoms are too often ignored or minimised but also where theyre just outright dismissed—where women walk into their doctors surgery and arent believed for the pain they feel. Women are sick to death of it. Theyre sick to death of going unheard. Theyre sick of having their pain minimised by someone who has never felt it. They are sick of feeling like the only part of their health journey that matters is the one that takes place between puberty and childbirth, like nothing of consequence will happen in a womans life—like she is nothing of consequence—beyond the moment she becomes a mother and as if, when she enters midlife, she stops mattering. Over 600 women and organisations shared their stories with our Senate inquiries. These women shared intimate, personal stories of trauma and pain. They fought through the stigma they felt and their fear to share what had happened to them and what needed to change. They told us their stories of being let down by their GPs, of walking into a doctors clinic—a doctor who they had had a relationship with for years and who dismissed their symptoms and their pain and wasnt equipped with the information needed to help them. They told us of the crappy and misinformed advice that wasnt at all up to date with modern research, that wasnt informed by the availability of modern medicine and that stopped them getting the care they needed; of having to go online, scrolling through Instagram, desperate for answers, desperate for solutions, because they couldnt get that from their GP; and of shopping around for one GP or two GPS—up to six GPs. Women in regional areas are travelling hundreds of kilometres to find a GP who will listen to them, who has time for them and who will be able to help them with their symptoms in a way that is empathetic, well informed and effective. They told us of their difficulties getting support at work, of being too scared to ask for climate control, of being too scared to ask for a breathable uniform and of not being able to manage the morning train because their symptoms were so overwhelming that travelling to work in peak hour was enough to stop them going to work that day. They told us of their difficulties accessing HRT—of not being able to afford the HRT which helped them. They told us of the stigma. They told us of the information deficit which was stopping them getting help. They told us how theyd been dismissed and denied, not believed. We heard from women in every city around Australia—hundreds of women who shared their pain and fear in the hope that they would see change. As a committee we heard them, and now, as a government, we have heard them, and change is here. On Sunday I stood with the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care, Ged Kearney, and our Minister for Women, Katy Gallagher, as we announced a halfbilliondollar investment in womens health. I could barely express my relief as women around the country went: Thank God! About time! Youre hearing us. When you get public policy right, you can change lives for the better, and this announcement will change womens lives. It is a massive step forward in ensuring they get the care, support and treatment they need. It shows them that they have been heard, that they are believed and that we take their pain and their experience seriously. It shows them that women in midlife matter as much as every other person in our community, and that their health matters too. Our committee had over 285 submissions and seven hearings. The message was resoundingly clear: when it comes to their experience of menopause, women felt fundamentally let down in two ways. Firstly, when they walked into their doctors clinic to get care from a clinician they were unheard and dismissed. They didnt get quality information. Its not all on the doctors. The doctors themselves told us that they wanted to help but in their medical education journey, in their years and years of university and placements, theyd received one hour of training in menopause and perimenopause—things that are not an optional part of any womans life, not an optional part of ageing. Any woman lucky enough to reach midlife will go through menopause, yet our doctors are getting as little as one hour of training to help them. I dont think its an unreasonable ask that 51 per cent of the population should feel that their GP knows what they are talking about, that their GP understands the modern medicines that can support women. Thats what GPs want too. Secondly, women told us that the stigma that surrounds these issues, which Ive spoken about, is stopping conversations in their workplaces about flexibility and the support that some women need if their symptoms are troubling. I emphasise that its some women, because many women will go through this period of life with no impact on their work. These are women at their peak, in the prime of their lives, but if theres a single woman in Australia—and we know there are some—whose symptoms mean theyre turning down a promotion, missing an opportunity, giving up something they love, whether its in study, in sport or at their workplace, then thats a problem. There are simple and small changes which could make an impact and keep those women at work and thriving. We dont want a single woman in the prime of her life to miss out on achieving everything she is capable of achieving. Our package will make a transformational difference. Were funding an extended Medicare health consult so that when a woman walks into a GP clinic she can spend a decent amount of time talking through her symptoms and talking through the solutions, what options might be appropriate for her. Were increasing the number of endometriosis and pelvic pain clinics and expanding their remit to include menopause and perimenopause, so women can access specialist centres of excellence to get support. Were furthering the training and upskilling of GPs so theyre better equipped to support women. Were funding a public education campaign, because the work to overcome the stigma that surrounds these issues needs to continue, and women should be empowered with good information that means better quality health care when they walk into their GP clinic. For the first time in two decades, were putting new medicines, new hormonal therapies, on the PBS. A lot has changed in medicine in 20 years, and its time that women were able to access more choice and therefore ease the pressures on supply when it comes to these therapies. These are massive measures that are part of a womens health package which will make a difference in a womans life, from young adulthood to later in her life. Women have been heard. For too long womens health has been shrouded in stigma. That has left women in pain, feeling dismissed and unheard, and its not acceptable for it to continue any longer. A halfabilliondollar investment isnt just about good policy; its about showing these women that they are heard and that they matter. Its not an optional part of aging. Now good quality health care for these women wont be optional either.","Womens Health","STATEMENTS BY SENATORS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[1]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator MARIELLE SMITH (South Australia) ","(12:15):"
"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," Today I rise to speak about the domestic violence and related deaths in the Northern Territory as well as the governments inaction and failure to address these issues at their core. Reports in the Australian yesterday highlighted this pressing issue which demands attention from the Australian government.  Yesterday the Australian reported on the alleged murder of a mother of four from Alice Springs at the hands of her partner. This alleged perpetrator had appeared in court 54 times over the last decade. He had an extensive history of criminal activity, including breaches of intervention orders, aggravated assault, fighting in a public place and breaching court orders. I dont know how many more times any of these incidents are needed before the Albanese Labor government takes this issue seriously. But, in case they need reminding, Id like to highlight some of the incidents that have occurred in the Northern Territory over the last few months. In September 2024, a man who cut his partners achilles tendon had a history of three decades of assaulting and perpetrating violence against women. In October 2024, a man who fatally stabbed his wife had a violent history, including kicking his wife in the face and using a traditional hunting stick to fracture her legs. In January this year, a man killed his wife after a session of drinking hand sanitiser. He had previously breached the good behaviour bond for aggravated assault. There has been ample time and opportunity for the Albanese government to show they are willing to do whatever it takes to combat the rates of family and domestic violence in Indigenous communities, but time is running out. Im standing here today because this government has failed. They have failed to take definitive action and they have failed to partner in a meaningful way with the Northern Territory government to fight this scourge. The Territory government have called on the Labor government to back them in and to support them in measures that only the Commonwealth can bring about. The Prime Minister was in Alice Springs, of course. He pops in and pops out quite regularly, but only to pop in and never to speak to those people on the ground, those grassroots people and individuals—not heads of organisations but people. He still refused to commit to implementing the requests of the Territory government. All he wants to do is announce millions of dollars to blind people to the lack of action he and his government are taking. Hes not interested in practical solutions or in calling out what is really causing problems in communities, like alcohol and drug abuse, and cultural acceptance of violence. Let me say that again for those who find it hard to listen to those words: cultural acceptance of violence and low expectations of Indigenous leaders. That last point is critical. Too many Indigenous community leaders, who are Labor aligned of course, are failing our women by refusing to acknowledge that there is a problem or refusing to exhibit behaviour that is any better. In fact we have a striking example of this in the newly appointed chair of the Central Land Council, Mr Warren Williams, who has publicly said that he doesnt agree with me. That is all very well—hes entitled to his own opinion of course—but he has also said that he is sick of my continued attacks on land councils and other organisations. Well, maybe if they didnt have chairmen who had a history of domestic violence and maybe if they had removed these people or knew of their backgrounds before putting them in these places of leadership, I would stop calling them out. To be clear, I dont attack these organisations just for the sake of it. I call out this behaviour because it falls well below what we should accept in this country, but, for some reason, we have lower expectations of Indigenous Australians. I call it out because these organisations need to do better. We just had the Closing the Gap statement. Weve seen the results of the Closing the Gap program yet again, and we sit back and wonder why we cant close the gap and why we cant reduce violence or sexual abuse of Indigenous children. Lets not forget that the Central Land Council is an organisation that has a key role in implementing policy to combat Indigenous disadvantage in Central Australia. Organisations like the CLC have so much opportunity, and yet, Mr Williams, the chair of that institution, has a criminal history. He has been convicted of violent behaviour and breaches of intervention orders. I will continue to call out the racism inherent in the low expectations that we apply to Indigenous people, especially those in leadership positions. Everyone in a position of leadership in this country must be held to the same standards of behaviour no matter their race, heritage or background. I call this out because we need to end the patterns of violence and violent offending in communities, and I refuse to hold Indigenous Australians to a lower standard than anyone else in this country. I call upon the Albanese government to do the same: to have the courage of their convictions, to stand up for our marginalised and not to be afraid to take meaningful action. Mr Williams, I know, has lamented the fact that he was called out by me over his previous history. His response, in effect, was that everyone else, such as the previous chairman, has a similar history. Isnt that an indication of a systemic problem, if other chairmen have a history of violence? That is why Ive been calling for an inquiry into land councils and statutory authorities, yet the government, in bed with the Greens, has refused every time. I have stood at land council meetings and seen my own grandmother punched in the face. I saw nothing being done about it at that meeting, while men swell around and determine the decisions on behalf of everyone, taking those decisions out of the hands of women. We talk about the rights of women in this country, but were not serious about the rights of Indigenous women in this country. Leaders of organisations are saying that I conflate this issue. Its nonsense! Perhaps look in your own backyards. Maybe theres a perpetrator amongst your own that you havent dealt with. Maybe thats the problem. Indigenous women have not had our feminist movement, and where is our feminist sisterhood to back us up? Crickets! Theyre nowhere to be seen. Mr Williams is not the only one, of course. Ive called out the chair of NAAJA, Hugh Woodbury, who had a very recent history of domestic violence. The organisation tried to back him up and say: No, no, no. Hes alright. Hes changed his ways. No, no, no. Its no good in a leadership position, especially in an organisation thats supposed to serve victims of violence. Ive called out Mr Benedict Stevens as the chair of the Lhere Artepe board of directors, and then theres the Tangentyere board, which also had a perpetrator on the board, Mr Philip Miller. I will continue to call out these perpetrators because its my responsibility to do so and because Ive fought all my life as a survivor of domestic violence. This is what I will do, and I dont care if it makes people uncomfortable. I wont accept, from Mr Williams, a statement trying to suggest that he is the right person for the role of Chair of the Central Land Council and his trying to liken his circumstances to my own. Ive revealed those publicly lately, in terms of my challenges in overcoming drugs affecting my life. My circumstances came about because I was a victim of domestic and family violence. I was hospitalised by a perpetrator. Unfortunately for Mr Williams, he was a perpetrator, so he cannot compare his circumstances to my own. I will continue to call for him to stand down, if he thinks he is the honourable man that he suggests he is now—one who claims to now support those trying to reduce violence in Indigenous communities. If thats what youre doing, continue down that path. Step down from that position and let someone who doesnt have a history such as your own—let a woman, perhaps—be the chair of the Central Land Council instead. Step down. Show youre honourable by doing that, and call out sexual abuse of our children in our communities, which is also rife in this country. Im not going anywhere. Im here to stay, and you can all be confronted with this.","Northern Territory: Domestic and Family Violence, First Nations Australians","STATEMENTS BY SENATORS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator NAMPIJINPA PRICE (Northern Territory) ","(12:25):"
"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," Theres obviously an election looming, and I want to take this opportunity to share a few thoughts with Australians who are thinking about how they might vote in this election. I have to say, its getting harder and harder to tell the Labor Party and the Liberal and National parties apart. They are in absolute lockstep on approving new coal and gas projects. They are in absolute lockstep on destroying nature and, in particular, destroying our native forests. They are in absolute lockstep in refusing to make billionaires and big corporations pay their fair share of tax so we can actually offer meaningful support to Australians—for example, by wiping student debt, allowing every Australian to visit their GP with no outofpocket costs and putting dental health into Medicare, which is critical. The last time I looked, your mouth was part of your body, and you should be able to get your teeth fixed under the same public health framework that you can use for the rest of your body. On that basis, we should also put mental health properly into Medicare. Labor and the Liberals are in absolute lockstep.  I say to people, if you think the system that were living under today and that has actually been created by decades of Labor and Liberal governments is going just fine, then, by all means, keep voting for the Labor and Liberal parties. But, if you want change, if you think we need stronger climate action, to do more to protect nature, to make big corporations pay their fair share of tax and to make billionaires pay their fair share of tax so we can do things like allow every Australian to visit a GP with no outofpocket costs and put dental and mental health into Medicare, then you have to vote for it. Change is possible. It is possible, but people are going to have to vote for change. I want to talk a little bit about the billionaires. Australias billionaires are making off like bandits. Collectively, the 150 Australians who each own over $1 billion have doubled their wealth in the last six years, and collectively now, those 150 billionaires in Australia have hoarded an eyewatering $585 billion in wealth. If we said they had to pay just 10 per cent of that in tax every year that would raise enough revenue to allow every Australian to visit a GP whenever they wanted, with no outofpocket costs. Those are the costings that weve had doublechecked by the Parliamentary Budget Office. Those revenue measures, those expenditure measures, are rock solid. We know how we would raise the money, and we know how it could be spent. Taxing billionaires 10 per cent of their wealth every year would allow every Australian to visit a GP with no outofpocket costs. Since Labor came to office, Gina Rinehart has pocketed another $10 billion, which brings her fortune to $40 billion, yet millions of Australians cannot afford to see a GP. That tells you everything you need to know about the priorities of the Labor and Liberal parties and the Prime Minister, Mr Albanese, who I remind folks said we should judge a society by how it looks after the vulnerable, not how it looks after billionaires. Under his government, the billionaires are getting richer while millions of Australians cannot afford to see their GP. This is the system built by the Labor and Liberal parties that is now being protected by the Labor and Liberal parties. Lets be very clear about one thing: billionaires dont create wealth; they accumulate and hoard it. Theyve either inherited fortunes or profited from industries wrecking the planet. They dodge tax at an industrial scale while public services are crumbling in this country and millions of Australians cannot afford to see a doctor, cannot afford to see a dentist and cannot afford to pay the rent or put food on the table. We should tax billionaire wealth so we can do more to help everyday Australians who are struggling. Foreign policy is another area where Labor and the Liberals are in lockstep. The slide into fascism in the US continues. President Trump has recently unveiled his dystopian, nightmarish vision for Gaza. He supports a genocide. He wants to ethnically cleanse Gaza and other parts of illegally occupied territories and he wants to turn Gaza into some kind of resort, some kind of Riviera. Well, they really are saying the quiet things out loud now in the United States, arent they? This has to be resisted. It has to be fought. We have to stand up, resist and fight with everything weve got because, if we dont fight it now, tomorrow may be too late. Here, the Labor Party should be fighting Mr Dutton and Mr Trump with everything theyve got, but Labor have refused to stand up to Israel. They have engaged in handwringing, theyve engaged in complicity and theyve engaged in excuses. While countries like Spain and Ireland are taking a stand, Australia is falling in line behind the US and refusing to call it what it is. This is not the policy of a sovereign nation; it is the policy of a lackey nation enthralled to the United States. We should have in Australia a strong, independent foreign policy that prioritises our national interests over the national interests of the United States and anywhere else. That means an arms embargo on the genocidal government of Israel, sanctions on the genocidal war criminals leading the Israeli government and full selfdetermination for the people of Palestine, and it includes recognising Palestine. I want to end by talking about forests in Tasmania. Logging native forests is turbocharging the breakdown of the planets climate. It is an absolute calamity, a catastrophe, for biodiversity. It is sending species like that beautiful little bird the swift parrot into extinction. Its a mendicant industry that costs the Australian taxpayers many tens and potentially hundreds of millions of dollars a year that should be spent on things like building more homes for people and fixing up our health system. There is every good reason to end native forest logging. Heres another one: logging our native forests makes it more likely that we will suffer catastrophic bushfires. Logging our native forests makes them more flammable than old forests. Logging our native forests exposes our communities to greater fire risk. Logging native forests means more bushfires with a greater impact. If we want to keep our community safe, we need to stop logging our native forests. If we want to protect nature, we need to stop logging our native forests. If we want to end the breakdown of the planets climate, we need to stop logging. If we want to save tens of millions of dollars a year, we need to stop logging native forests. The time to end native forest logging is right now, and the Greens have a plan to do that. For the sake of nature, for the sake of humanity, we have to stop destroying our precious native forests.","Australian Greens, Tasmania: Forestry Industry","STATEMENTS BY SENATORS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[3]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator McKIM (Tasmania—Australian Greens Whip) ","(12:35):"
"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," Western Australias prosperity is every bit as critical to the nation as it is to those in the west, but it is under attack on multiple fronts from Anthony Albanese and his Labor government. The government isnt merely overlooking matters of concern in my home state; it is pursuing policies that are actively damaging key industries and the jobs and communities they support. As Ive said, this impacts all of us. Under this Labor government, the resources sector and the agricultural sector, among others, are being strangled by red and green tape and burdened by uncertainty. Vital projects are stalled, investment confidence is down and WAs global competitiveness is in jeopardy.  Ill start with the naturepositive laws, by any measure a policy that is bad for Western Australia and all the things that we need to be doing there. This policy has been on and off the Albanese governments legislative agenda. While it has again dropped off the program for the time being, do not think for a moment that we have seen the end of it. Nature positive threatens the viability of not just mining but also housing, agriculture and infrastructure projects across Western Australia. Labor claims these reform will deliver net positive environmental outcomes, but lets be clear about what they really involve: bureaucratic interference that forces businesses to offset any environmental disturbance, even if its unavoidable. A report commissioned by WA business and mining industry groups has revealed how damaging these laws would be to Western Australia. WAs wholesale electricity prices could surge by 38 per cent, energy capacity could fall by 2.6 per cent and coalfired power generation could increase by 244 per cent, completely contradicting Labors stated and supported environmental goals. Indeed, residential land prices in Perths northern suburbs could rise by up to 10.6 per cent due to additional red tape further exacerbating the housing crisis amongst Western Australians and their families. WA Premier Roger Cook knows it better than most. He has warned that these changes would disproportionately impact Western Australians and has said that naturepositive laws, the laws of the Albanese government, should not be progressed. His message to those federal Labor parliamentarians who support it has been clear: do not for a moment think that we will stand idly by and allow you to damage our economy. That is the Labor Premier talking about the damning effect of the Labor Prime Ministers naturepositive laws. Industry leaders have joined the chorus. From the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Western Australia to the Chamber of Minerals and Energy, theyve made their positions equally clear: these are bad laws for Western Australia. The legislation is bad for business and bad for Western Australia. Major mining projects are now at risk. The property sector is facing delays. Even cleanenergy projects could get caught up in Labors environmental mess. The Albanese government has refused to release the full report detailing these impacts, raising serious questions about transparency and what else it might be hiding from Western Australian businesses and families. If these laws are as beneficial as Labor claims, why is Labor hiding the truth? Recent analysis has pointed to yet another disturbing reality: as Labors regulatory burdens increase, the toll is evident in lost opportunities. Reports have confirmed that, despite WAs strong economic potential, investment is stagnating under this governments leadership. Rather than capitalising on WAs natural strengths, Labor is focused on ideology driven policies that deter investors and stifle economic growth. The cost is not just measured in dollars and percentages. It is measured in lost jobs, closed businesses and wasted opportunities. Labors own Resources and energy major projects: 2024 report reveals that 81 major resource projects worth $119 billion are now stalled or at risk. Thats 47,000 jobs in doubt and 47,000 workers left in limbo because of this governments incompetence. Its a simple equation: when investment dries up, so do jobs; when projects stall, so do wages; and, when businesses are buried in regulation, they start to look elsewhere. WA competes on a global stage, and investors dont have to put their money here. Under Anthony Albanese and Labor, they are increasingly turning away from Australia and from Western Australia in particular. These misguided policies have a compounding effect, so the timing of Labors Future Made in Australia (Production Tax Credits and Other Measures) Bill, which passed the Senate on Monday night, is particularly unwelcome. The bill lacks essential details on how credits will be measured, distributed or enforced. The lack of clarity surrounding the community benefit principles component poses the greatest risk—something clearly identified in the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into the bill. The Treasurer will make the rules based on these principles—rules we are yet to see but which will determine whether a company is eligible for the tax credits or is to be penalised in the form of reduced credits for alleged noncompliance. They may include forcing mining companies into compulsory union agreements and duplicative consultation on Indigenous and environmental matters. On behalf of the coalition, I introduced an amendment aimed at giving industry some certainty around these community benefit principles. Labor and the Greens voted against it. The Minerals Council of Australia has warned that Labors tax credit conditions could duplicate existing regulatory burdens, increasing costs and slowing down projects. The Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia has raised concern that these socalled benefits provide no actual value while adding additional hurdles. As with the Nature Positive Plan, ongoing regulatory uncertainty, rising project costs and a less competitive WA economy under Anthony Albanese and Labor make Labor a big risk for Western Australia. The Albanese government has taken an equally damaging and equally illinformed approach to WAs agricultural sector, something close to my heart and those of my colleagues in this place. The disastrous decision to shut down the live sheep export trade by 2028 is not just an attack on farmers but an attack on entire rural communities across all of Western Australia. The impact is already being felt. WAs sheep flock declined by 25 per cent last year alone, two major abattoirs have already closed, wool production is at its lowest level since the 1920s and shearers have reported business losses of up to 30 per cent in the past year. Labor has ignored the sectors superb advocacy, led by the Keep the Sheep campaign, and is forcing WA farmers into economic ruin while offering them a measly $139 million transition package. The WA government itself has said the real cost will be at least $1.2 billion. The Prime Minister had an opportunity to meet farmers in Canberra and to listen to their concerns. He declined. His declining sums up this governments approach to our state and our Western Australian farmers. The governments refusal to consult and refusal to consider the implications of their policy leaves Western Australia the poorer for it. Again, its the compounding effect of these policies that makes them so damaging. which brings me to Labors $150 million biosecurity protection levy, another direct hit on Australian farmers. This proposed new tax on farmers is fundamentally unfair, charging Australian farmers for the biosecurity costs of importers. Lets put this in the simplest of terms: the government taxing its own farmers to pay for foreigners to bring their products into Australia is absurd. It makes no sense. And, of course, the impact would have been felt widely if the Senate had not today successfully discharged the bill from the Notice Paper. The coalition, acting decisively this morning, has given Australian agricultural producers some relief from Labors bad policies. It is important to stress, of course, that the federal coalition absolutely recognises the importance of a strong and robust biosecurity system in protecting Australia against pests and diseases. Western Australias biosecurity is guarded with particular care, and for good reason. We support a sustainable funding model for biosecurity, but, of course, that tax would have hurt WA farmers. Western Australias a state that has given so much to our national economy; it deserves better from Labor. We need a government that supports investment rather than discouraging it—a government that reduces red and green tape rather than wrapping businesses in layers and layers of bureaucracy.  As we approach the next election and I near the end of my term in the Senate, Im incredibly proud of what the Albanese government has achieved in just three years. Looking back, I see the firm foundation of our legacy and, indeed, where we are headed. It has been rewarding to not only engage with voters and communicate these accomplishments but also—most importantly—to have voters input. Serving on the government benches, there are moments when you make your own contribution on key issues and other times when you provide support for the excellent work of others, and this reflects the strength of our political party and movement. Whether it is in the party room, the parliament, the shop floor, the boardroom, the classroom or within community groups, together we listen and together we take action. Australian voters can be sure of what Labor and an Albanese Labor government stand for. First and foremost, we stand for good jobs that pay well and a tax system that allows people to keep more of what they earn. Weve made tax cuts fair, ensuring that every Australian wage earner who pays tax gets a tax cut—not just those at the top. We passed the secure jobs, better pay bill, fixing our workplace relations system to get wages moving again. And what did the opposition promise? They promised to repeal protections for vulnerable workers—repeal them in the middle of a postCOVID costofliving crisis. While we want to lift people up, they want to tear people down. Since coming to office, the Albanese government has created more than half a million new jobs—the most for any new government on record. Weve criminalised wage theft and secured pay rises for millions of Australians on the minimum wage. This contrasts starkly with the previous LiberalNational government, which deliberately designed low wage growth into its economic framework. Just this week we saw the coalition vote against tax incentives for critical minerals processing. With over 40 such projects in Western Australia competing for international investment, Im appalled the coalition still clings to its dig and ship mentality. Far from keeping the sheep, they want to send the sheep offshore on boats, rather than having them processed onshore like the other 90 per cent of sheep in Australia, which will create new jobs. They failed to recognise the skilled, wellpaid, longterm jobs that the critical minerals industry could bring to WA by adding value to our resources. Collie is just one place that wants these projects as part of the transition of its local economy. Instead of critical minerals, however, they want to bring to Collie a nuclear power plant. On health care, Australians know that Labor is committed to strengthening Medicare. This includes tripling the bulkbilling incentive and opening more urgent care clinics—I had the privilege of opening the one in Bunbury. And this week we announced initiatives to make birth control more accessible and provide better and more affordable support for menopause. As a government, weve been taking action and listening to women. Ive been part of Senate committee inquiries on reproductive health and menopause that have made big contributions to the nature of the policy commitments that weve delivered, and its been great to participate in both of those. As a committee member, Ive also contributed to the fact that the government has raised care standards and accountability in the national agedcare system, including by providing meal standards. While there are so many things to reflect on in what we have achieved—Gonski, education funding, paid parental leave and so many more—I want to say in closing that Im confident that, with Ellie Whitaker joining Senator Ghosh on the WA Labor Senate ticket for the next election, this good work will continue.","Albanese Government","STATEMENTS BY SENATORS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[4]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator DEAN SMITH (Western Australia) ","(12:45):"
"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," Australias immigration system is broken. It no longer works in the interest of the Australian people. Immigration policy from both parties of government, Labor and the coalition, does not reflect the views of the Australian people. Its driven by big business and is used to prop up an economy brought low by poor government decisions. Poll after poll shows most Australians think immigration is too high or should be lowered. A staggering 1.4 million people have been brought to Australia since Labor won power in 2022. Thats more than the entire population of Adelaide, our fifthlargest city. There has never been such a massive increase in our population in all our history.  Last year I called for a national plebiscite on immigration to determine once and for all the views of the Australian people. Labor, the coalition and the Greens blocked it. This shows that they do not care about the Australian peoples views on immigration. It shows that they do not care about the increasing number of Australians struggling to find secure accommodation, struggling to afford increasing rents or trying to survive on the streets. It shows they dont care about the inflation caused by high immigration or its overwhelming impact on services and infrastructure. I care because Im an Australian fighting for a decent standard of living for myself, my family and the Australians relying on me to fight for them. One Nation listens to the Australian people on immigration, and we develop our policies accordingly. Late last year, the Department of Home Affairs revealed that more than 75,000 visa holders were in Australia illegally. Under our policy, all of them would be deported immediately. Under our policy, they would not be able to appeal their deportation to the Administrative Review Tribunal. During the previous two financial years, just over 1.4 million people came to Australia courtesy of the Albanese Labor government, an average of 700,000 per year. These numbers are obscene. One Nation will cap arrivals at 130,000 per year, a drop of 570,000 per year from Labors record numbers. This will allow Australia to catch its breath, catch up with housing and catch up with services and infrastructure. One Nations policies introduce a minimum eightyear waiting period before immigrants can apply for Australian citizenship and the privileges that come with it. Over this eightyear period, immigrants will be required to consistently demonstrate that they are fit to become Australians. We want to reinforce the principle that Australian citizenship is a privilege to be earned, not an entitlement to be given away. Foreign students will be included in our 130,000ayear cap. Australian universities must be broken of their addiction to foreign students and forced to prioritise the tertiary education of Australian students. With modern communications technology, there is no compelling reason why most of these students cant do Australian courses at home—unless, of course, you factor in the amount of money they send back home from Australia. In 2023, this figure was $10 billion—not million, billion. Its a scam to take jobs and wealth from Australians, and were going to put a stop to it. One Nations policy will also stop those on student visas from using the system as a back door to permanent residency and will prevent students from bringing family members here. Our policy also demands the reinstatement of temporary protection visas and Australias withdrawal from the UN refugee convention. TPVs are a proven means of deterring people smuggling, stopping the boats and stopping those arriving by plane. Labor is keeping things quiet, but its well known that people smugglers are constantly testing our borders, and more boats have made it to the mainland in recent months. Under our policy, immigration from nations known to foster extremism will be prohibited. The major parties failure to screen out extremists at the border is directly responsible for the unrest and violence weve seen on our streets and in our suburbs. One Nation is the only party with a strong immigration policy that reflects the will of the Australian people. Thats because were the only party that puts Australia and Australians first.","Migration","STATEMENTS BY SENATORS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[6]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator HANSON (Queensland—Leader of Pauline Hansons One Nation) ","(13:00):"
"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," This week the Albanese Labor government made a gamechanging announcement on womens health. Its an announcement that will impact women of all ages and will really change the game for womens health by providing more choice and lower costs and by bringing health care closer to home.  The Albanese Labor government is investing $573 million to provide better access, lower costs and more choices for women across the country. For the first time in 30 years, new oral contraceptive pills will be listed on the PBS, saving around 50,000 women hundreds of dollars a year. Longterm contraceptives like IUDs and implants will also be more affordable, with bigger Medicare payments and expanded bulkbilling cutting costs up to $400 for 300,000 Australian women. Menopause care is also getting a muchneeded boost, with new Medicare rebates, better training for doctors and the firstever clinical guidelines—I cant believe we havent had those until now, but here we are—for menopause. Plus, new hormone therapies will be listed on the PBS, making treatment cheaper for around 150,000 women. Were also expanding specialist clinics for endometriosis and pelvic pain, bringing the total number of clinics up to 33. Im really pleased to say that one of the clinics that we rolled out after the last election is in Far North Queensland, and it is making an incredible difference to the people that go there. Funded by the Albanese Labor government, the True Relationships & Reproductive Health clinic provides vital support for women dealing with endometriosis and pelvic pain, and Ive even had the privilege of visiting many times to see firsthand the incredible work that they do. In a huge win for regional areas, women will be able to get contraception and treatment for uncomplicated UTIs directly from pharmacies, with trials covering 250,000 concession cardholders. This package was shaped by extensive consultation with women, health experts and advocacy groups, ensuring real impact where its needed the most. Women in my home of Far North Queensland deserve the same quality health care as those in big cities. With this investment were making sure distance and cost arent barriers to essential care. With this investment we are making sure that essential care for things like contraception, menopause, IUDs and pelvic pain are not treated as taboo or unserious. From our first periods as young girls to the time of menopause as we get older, womens health is often shrouded in shame and stigma, but none of this is a choice. We dont choose to get older, but we need health care. Women have asked the government to take their health care seriously, and we have listened. There are changes that could save women and their families thousands of dollars across their lifetimes. On top of this, we are strengthening Medicare, tripling the bulkbilling incentive, making medicines cheaper and opening free Medicare urgent care clinics across the country. Weve had 17,000 presentations at the urgent care clinic in Cairns South alone. Thats 17,000 patients that didnt need to go to our local hospital. Urgent care clinics are taking the pressure off our hospitals and taking the pressure off the family budget. But we know that all of this is under threat from Mr Peter Dutton and the Liberal National Party, because they will make cuts. They just wont tell you where. The last time that Mr Dutton was in control of our healthcare system, he ripped $50 billion from hospitals and tried to end bulkbilling forever. We know that our healthcare system is precious. Labor built Medicare and well always protect it. But under Mr Peter Dutton, Medicare is at risk. That is why, when it comes to urgent care clinics, cheaper medicines, tripling the bulkbilling incentive, getting access to more GPs or getting access to this amazing womens health system, it is so important that we talk to people about what is at risk if Peter Dutton is elected Prime Minister at the next election. Women in particular know, after weve announced this womens health policy, that they will be worse off under Mr Peter Dutton, and thats because they will make cuts; they just wont tell you where. Theyve promised before not to make cuts to things that are important to Australians, but we know what happened last time they were in government. Youll be worse off under Peter Dutton because he will cut Medicare.","Womens Health","STATEMENTS BY SENATORS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[7]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator GREEN (Queensland) ","(13:05):"
"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," Millions of Australians standing at the checkout feel the pain of our costofliving crisis. Yesterday new research revealed that one in three Australians arent confident theyll be able to afford their housing costs over the next 12 months. Living day in, day out stressed and afraid about how youre going to pay your next bill is not the life in the lucky country that Australians have come to expect.  Canberrans are far from immune from this. Here in the ACT we have the lowest bulkbilling rate in the country. Over half of 17 to 18yearolds have to fork out the full amount to see a doctor. Its unsurprising but also a source of shame that a growing number of people here in Canberra are turning to Google when theyre sick, because they cant afford to see a GP. We also have the nations highest childcare fees and the highest rate of persistent homelessness in the country. The costofliving crisis has become one of the hallmarks of our time and will be a defining issue at the forthcoming election. I acknowledge the efforts of the Treasurer, the finance minister and this government to address this and, especially, to bring down inflation. There have been steps in the right direction, especially when we here on the crossbench have given them a gentle, and at times not so gentle, nudge in the right direction, but the magnitude of the crisis demands a parliament willing to be much bolder. The household electrification acceleration projects that the crossbench agreed with Minister Bowen are an important step forward, but we need to roll that out at scale. Rather than offering shortterm, oneoff energy bill relief, we should be ensuring that every Australian household can fully electrify and so save thousands of dollars every year into the future. Be they renters, apartment owners, or social or public housing tenants, everyone should have the opportunity to benefit from the savings that electrification can bring to Australians. Rather than the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund, we need a $20 billion, a $30 billion or even a $40 billion HAFF. We need to be getting our priorities straight. When were faced with challenges such as national security, we see both major parties commit to hundreds of billions of dollars on submarines sometime in the future, yet when we have Australians struggling to put a roof over their heads, we see nowhere near that magnitude of urgency, spending and bipartisanship. We make students pay tens of thousands of dollars for their degrees now, charging them interest for money that they have already repaid. The fact that we havent changed the date of indexation during this parliament is disgraceful. There are almost a million Australians living below the poverty line because our socalled safety net payments are so vastly inadequate. Until we start fairly taxing our gas and other natural resources, I simply do not want to hear that we cant afford to do this. Norway has a $2.8 trillion sovereign wealth fund. Imagine if we had the political courage to do that here. If our major parties werent so completely and utterly captured by the fossil fuel industry, we could have done that, and I think Australians would want us to do that. But its not too late. We can do that now. There are some deep structural problems that we as a country need to fix, especially when it comes to competition. We cant keep talking about a costofliving crisis and not talk about addressing competition in this country. When interest rates come down, we need to see the banks pass that on and supermarket prices come down. Im deeply worried that, in our system of duopolies and the big four, we wont. CommBank just announced a $5 billion halfyearly profit, which is pretty good in a costofliving crisis. We know that, in our current system, any savings will be banked, because theres no competition without a strong parliament putting people first. Why would we expect that when we have another duopoly here? Rather than dealing with more competition and trying to improve the lives of, and reconnect with, the people that they should be representing, theyre stitching up a deal to lock out competition. Its the duopoly acting in the interests of the duopoly. This is a lastgasp attempt in a country where people have had a gutful with the lack of choice in our economy and in politics and with you entrenching your power. Its shameful, and I hope people see it for what it is—the duopoly thats overseeing duopolies wants to entrench the duopoly.","Cost of Living","STATEMENTS BY SENATORS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[8]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator DAVID POCOCK (Australian Capital Territory) ","(13:10):"
"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," My kids are the men they are today because of great early childcare educators. Im so lucky to have had wonderful educators in my kids lives when they were little. As a young mum, I returned to work pretty soon after having both of my kids—youve got to keep paying the bills somehow. Its something I know so many parents out there can relate to. So I put my kids into child care in Ulvie, and Im glad I did. Those educators shaped who my boys are. I want every child to have these experiences—the playtime with other kids and the chance to laugh, play and squeal with joy. It shouldnt matter where they live, what their parents do or how much money their parents make. Every child should have the same opportunity to learn, but the current system doesnt allow that.  Theres this little thing in place called the activity test. It was designed to link subsidised child care to the number of hours parents worked, studied or volunteered. It means the more hours you work, the more hours of subsidised care you have access to, except its actually locking families out of child care. Its punishing parents who have insecure jobs, people looking for work and carers who contribute to their communities in other ways, and it hits families on low or unpredictable incomes the most. It means people get stuck in a vicious cycle where they cant get a job because they cant get care for their child, but they cant get subsidised care for their child unless they get a job. What are these parents supposed to do? Thats why I support getting rid of this test. Its not working the way its supposed to. This change will help an estimated 126,000 Australian children access more affordable care and will give them a better start to life. But removing the activity test alone isnt enough to solve the tangled web of problems with the childcare system. If we want every child to have access to child care, we have to have somewhere to put them. Tassie has been labelled a childcare desert. There are fewer childcare places available than there are options for water in the Sahara Desert. Parents can be stuck on waiting lists for months. Some of them sign up for places as soon as they find out that theyre pregnant. If there arent enough places now, there definitely arent going to be enough when universal child care is implemented. The government has got to start getting creative, and Tassie is already leading the way with a solution. Some family day care centres in Tassie are at risk of shutting down because there are two day cares running out of the same building and the Tassie bureaucrats say this isnt allowed. The Tasmanian Minister for Education, Jo Palmer, has the power to keep them open, but she refuses to do it. Shutting down amazing childcare centres doing their job doesnt make any sense. It will put a hundred families at risk, with no other childcare options available in the area. Last year, the Productivity Commission said that dualeducator models in childcare centres could help with childcare prices. The federal government should have them in rural and regional areas, where there arent a lot of options available. The two centres currently under threat in Latrobe are the perfect example of this; theyre filling the gap and doing it well. The federal government should use these centres as an example of how dualeducator family day cares could be rolled out across the country, but to roll out new centres you need staff to fill them. Early childcare educators are underpaid and overworked. Centres are struggling to retain staff, and educators are heading off to work at Woolies because the pay is better. Labor tried to fix that with their recent pay rise for childcare workers, but it hasnt been executed well. The government wont say how many centres have successfully applied for the wage boost so far, because it isnt rolling out as well as theyd hoped. Educators arent getting pay rises fast enough, because the wageboost rollout is a bureaucratic, confusing application process. Some providers are on their fourth attempt to get paperwork approved so their staff can receive their wage increase. I absolutely support a pay rise for early childhood educators, but, if the process is so hard that noone can get the pay rise, then the system is stuffed. The federal government needs to work with the sector to make this process as easy as possible. Without addressing these issues, we risk creating a system where families are eligible for care but no places exist for them. Universal child care and removing the activity test are steps in the right direction, but make sure there are spaces available for our kids where theyre needed and dont close down what we already have.","Child Care","STATEMENTS BY SENATORS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[9]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator TYRRELL (Tasmania—Independent TAS Whip) ","(13:15):"

The purpose of my bill is to enshrine freedom of speech in the Australian Constitution. This bill is urgently needed and will provide protection of a right that many Australians assume they already have. This assumption, though, is increasingly dangerous. While freedom of speech in this country is generally assumed, it is not guaranteed. Indeed, it is always under threat.  Over the past decade, the right of Australians to say what they think has been increasingly infringed upon, and, while Australian parliaments have made no efforts at all to protect speech, they have, however, passed laws at state and federal level to restrict freedom of speech. We are now at a point where it is dangerous to openly say things that most people privately believe. Its a brave person, for example, who opines that men cannot become women. Is that really the kind of country that we want to live in—a country in which stating a simple truth puts a person in danger of being dragged before a tribunal to be interrogated for their words? It is time to provide a constitutional right for all Australians to say what they truly think. The Western world became prosperous by allowing, rather than censoring, debate. Free speech is not a thing to be feared. It is a thing which should be embraced. Free speech is something that protects people. Its something that needs to be encouraged. The Enlightenment was built on the ability of people to say what they honestly thought even if it went against established norms. Indeed, it was the ability to challenge norms that made progress possible in the first place. But now we risk going backwards into a new dark age of restricted speech where certain ideas, held sacrosanct by those in power, are beyond challenging. This bodes well for nobody. Without speech, there is no expression of thought. It is not exaggeration to say that, if people are not able to speak freely, then they are not able to think clearly. That is the key issue here. Freedom of thought supposes freedom of speech; the two are linked. What good are all the other freedoms if people are not free to think independently of the state and to express those thoughts? Australia, at a national level, lacks entrenched protections for freedom of speech. Our role as elected members should be to provide and sustain that right. This bill will give the Australian people the power to vote in a referendum and determine just how important freedom of speech is to them. I believe that people, if given the chance, will vote overwhelmingly in favour of free speech, because Australians, while we may disagree on many issues, believe in a fair go. We believe in the right of everyone to voice their opinion without fear or favour. My proposed alteration to the Constitution will protect freedom of expression, along similar lines to the first amendment in the United States constitution, which provides that congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press. My bill will put the brakes on efforts to suppress speech, which is shockingly becoming more and more common all around the Western world, especially here in Australia. There shouldnt be a single senator in this chamber who would say that they are against freedom of speech. There shouldnt be a single senator in this chamber who would say to their constituents, I want to make it more difficult for you and your family to express your opinions. Its crazy. We came to Canberra not to oppress our constituents but to defend and to ensure their freedoms forever. This bill does just that.

"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," In 2022 I set up an inquiry into concussions and repeated head trauma in contact sports due to the shocking accounts from people who approached my office concerned by the lack of action from the major sporting codes and the government, despite decades of attempts to bring this into the public light. The Senate inquiry and increased media reporting have raised awareness over the last two years on this important issue, and there has been some movement in the concussion space since the inquiry handed down its report in August last year. Firstly some sporting codes have undergone rule modification to decrease injury rates, as prevention is the most effective way to address the issue. The government also tabled its response to the Senate inquiry report, which is what I want to address here today.  I appreciate the development of an updated concussion and brain health position statement, released in February last year, which partly addressed recommendation 8 of the inquiry report. The position statement provides updated information on concussion, including the Australian concussion guidelines for community and youth sport. It advances a more precautionary approach than previously seen, including guidance for flexible returntoplay protocols with a more cautious approach, particularly for children and those with previous concussions. The position statement is an improvement on the previous versions and brings concussion advice in line with the UK and New Zealand. However, its development failed to fully take into account some of the existing research in this country and could have gone further in its guidance. The response to some of the other recommendations has unfortunately been less satisfying. Recommendations 3 to 6 of the report spoke to the need for greater investment in research around concussion and repeated head trauma, including CTE. The government responded by reiterating already existing research funding, which scientists called out as insufficient, particularly for CTE. The existing Medical Research Future Fund funding of $50 million for a 10year period is very little for a complex research area and does not include CTE. CTE is a neurodegenerative disorder which has been linked to repeated head trauma and gets worse over time. It can sadly lead to mood and behaviour changes and progressive disorders of thinking and memory. It can lead to death. During the inquiry, we heard from affected players and families, some of whom have tragically lost loved ones, and their accounts were heartwrenching. Failing to acknowledge the significance of CTE and to invest in better research and support for those affected is the government failing in its duty of care. The governments response also fails to address the need for more independent research on the issue. The Australian Research Council is conflicted with its close associations with sports like the AFL and NRL, who have vested interests to not support research into CTE. This was a matter raised in the inquiry but which the committee report failed to properly call out. It is time funding is provided to independent research rather than the same cohort of suspects deeply connected with the sports, such as internationally discredited Paul McCrory. Recommendation 7 around improving public awareness and education on concussion and repeated head trauma was fully endorsed by the government. It came as a surprise, though, that in response it committed $12.5 million to Dementia Australia in this years budget to support populations at risk of dementia, including those with suspected CTE. While I value Dementia Australias work, it has until recently never worked in the CTE space, and others with decades of experience and high credentials in the field, such as the Australian Sports Brain Bank, have repeatedly missed out on funding.

Women have asked and asked governments to take their health seriously, and we on this side of the chamber have listened. Were making big changes to make oral contraceptives and IUDs more accessible and affordable, including the first PBS listing of new oral contraceptive pills in 30 years. Yaz and Yasmin will be listed, saving 50,000 women hundreds of dollars a year, and there is work underway to list more contraceptive pills. Were also opening even more endo and pelvic pain clinics across the country. Well open 11 new clinics and ensure that all 33 clinics are staffed to provide specialist support for menopause. And theres a whole bunch of improvements for women experiencing menopause, including a new Medicare rebate of around $110 for menopause health assessments. This will help around 150,000 women each year, saving hundreds of dollars every year. Again, this is not a small proportion of the population. Women make up over 50 per cent of the population, and we all go through menopause. All of the changes that have been announced are going to save women hundreds of dollars every year. In a costofliving crisis, it will mean women are more easily able to prioritise their own healthcare needs. This is a government that will always take womens health seriously.

It was at an event hosted by Rare Cancers Australia. This young woman, living in regional Australia, is 33 years old and got the terrible news that she has a very rare terminal cancer. When she finally got the diagnosis, her choice of whether she lived or died depended on her access to superannuation. She is a beautiful young woman with her whole life ahead of her. She is very lucky that the treatment that shes under at the moment is working, but it is $8,000 every time. Thats not what its about. We provide Medicare and support for all Australians.  That leads me to the meeting I had with rural GPs today in my office. I come from Tasmania, a rural and regional state. We know what its like not to have access to specialists when we need them, and the demand on GPs is so great. So I give a shoutout to Rare Cancers Australia for all the work that they do about raising awareness. But we want equality in this country. Theres the threat of a Liberal government under Mr Dutton if he were to become Prime Minister. We know his record of cutting and using the health budget and the agedcare budget as ATMs, and thats in stark contrast to the work that Minister Mark Butler has done in the almost three years that we have been in government. There is a stark contrast. You cannot afford to risk the Liberals introducing another GP tax. For a decade, they did nothing about giving any incentives for GPs to allow longer consultations or training more GPs so that we have them in rural and regional Australia. Every Australian living in a regional or rural area is equal to any Australian living— (Time expired)  One Nations plan to put more money in Australians pockets has a focus on strengthening Medicare. Well begin by targeting fraud. As we learnt from the Independent Review of Medicare Integrity and Compliance, released by the Minister for Health and Aged Care in April 2023, the system has been rorted by up to $3 billion a year. There have been many examples of people using other peoples Medicare cards or of doctors claiming rebates for patients they did not see. There are other examples of Medicare funded appointments being used to obtain cheap prescriptions sold at obscene profits both here and overseas. Much of this can be prevented by simply requiring photo ID on Medicare cards. One Nations policy will increase bulkbilling rates, which have fallen under Labor. According to the 2025 report on government services released this month, in 202324 bulkbilling rates declined from 51.7 per cent to 47.7 per cent despite significant funding injections by Labor. In the same year, the average outofpocket cost for a patient to see a GP was $45, and nine per cent of patients either delayed appointments or simply didnt go because of the cost. One Nations policy will also look at increasing the Medicare rebate to better support bulkbilling. GPs facing huge costs increases in rent, rates, insurance and energy need to be better remunerated if bulkbilling rates are to improve and if we want to prevent the exit of GPs from the system. Medicare must be made sustainable if we want Australians to continue to have access to affordable Medicare. Lets put photo ID on the Medicare card so that we stop this fraud and stop people coming in from overseas, taking up the Medicare cards of friends and family, using our services, getting their scripts and taking back medicines. We know that fraud is up to $3 billion a year.

They have rolled over to the big banks yet again, like they did in 1985 when they lifted capital controls and in 1992 when they privatised the Commonwealth Bank. Theyve effectively got an agreement from the four major banks that theyre going keep their branches open until 2027. What a copout. That is an absolute insult to the hardworking people out in regional and metropolitan Australia who need to access banking services. Ben Chifley would be rolling in his grave, if he saw the modern Labor Party today. I know you agree with me, Acting Deputy President Sterle; youre an old Chifley man yourself, coming from the working class.  What has happened to the Labor Party? Stop selling out to the big banks. We need more branches in the regions. We need a proper public ban not this postal bank rubbish, whereby little post office franchises are being screwed by the major banks. Yes, its all very well that theyve signed an agreement now. But under the last agreement, the banks went and closed a whole heap more branches, which of course meant that the post offices got more work and the post office itself couldnt actually engage in these transactions for a profit. The banks are merely shifting costs through Bank@Post. The only party that has a proper solution is the People First Party, which wants a public bank that uses the RBA payment systems that already exist. I know about that because Ive actually managed the payment systems in an Australianlisted bank. We need a government insurance office brought back that would also include a government superannuation fund, all under the same roof.

Rents have never been higher, every trip to the grocery store feels like daylight robbery and, while Aussie families struggle to keep up with soaring mortgage repayments, the big banks—like Senator Rennick said—are raking in billions from the very interest rate hikes that are crushing households.  Lets cut through the noise. These arent just numbers on a spreadsheet. These are parents, who are already budgeting down to the last dollar, skipping meals to keep a roof over their heads; young couples, who worked hard to buy their first home, watching their Australian dream turn into a financial nightmare as their mortgage repayments go up by hundreds or even thousands of dollars a month; and retirees dusting off resumes and forced back into work because their savings arent keeping up. For most Australians, this isnt just economic theory; its reality. Yet what we get from the two major parties is a blame game. Labor points the finger at the Liberals for a decade of economic mismanagement, and the Liberals fire back about reckless spending. But heres the truth: both sides have spent years dodging the hard work of fixing this mess. We know the RBA only has one blunt instrument to address inflation, and it wont hold up as the sole firefighter in this crisis. We need real solutions, like strengthened renters rights, so landlords cant hike rents at will. We need to invest in affordable housing, instead of leaving it to profithungry developers and tackle corporate price gouging so families arent paying through the nose for essentials.

Firstly, I want to talk about the punitive partner income test for the disability support pension, a test that traps disabled people in abusive relationships by forcing them into a situation of financial dependency where they can lose access to their own income. Its a test that also prevents members of the community from getting married, out of fear of losing their disability support pensions. I hear time and time again from participants and constituents who are exhausted from dealing with a social security system that punishes instead of uplifts. Participants should not be punished for pursuing relationships; its regressive and undermines marriage equality.  This is on top of the already dismal rate of income support that we have in this country. Today there are more than three million Australians living in poverty, including one in six children. Despite Australias being one of the wealthiest countries on earth, successive Labor and coalition governments have made deliberate policy choices that keep people in poverty. I urge the government to get their priorities in order. Tax breaks for property investors and giving hundreds of billions of dollars to billionaires and big corporations, including fossil fuel corporations, doesnt help the average Australian get through this costofliving crisis and it certainly does absolutely nothing for the millions of people struggling to survive on Centrelink poverty payments. Poverty is a policy choice, and the Greens are fighting for a strong social safety net and a liveable wage that would raise all Centrelink payments above the poverty line.","Pensions and Benefits","STATEMENTS BY SENATORS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[19]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator ALLMANPAYNE (Queensland) ","(13:44):"

The twoparty system is designed to give voters the illusion of choice while ensuring that nothing truly changes. For years, both major parties have supported globalist led policies that erode national sovereignty and undermine personal freedom. Labor and the Liberals are both committed to the Paris climate accord, which wont change the weather but will devastate our economy and our quality of life.  Digital ID, censorship laws, socalled hate speech laws and restricting social media for minors are all bipartisan initiatives. The same goes for the indemnity that big pharmaceutical companies were given during the pandemic and the gaslighting of the victims of their products afterwards. Both parties bow to unelected globalist organisations like the UN, the WHO and the WEF while running up national debt, destroying the value of our dollar, undermining Australian culture and implementing mass immigration policies that weaken sovereignty. Their policies are dictated not by the people, in my opinion, but by faceless bureaucrats who remain in power regardless of who sits in the Prime Ministers office. Unlike in the United States, where a president can bring in fresh personnel, Australias deeply entrenched bureaucracy influences policy from the shadows, ensuring continuity of the globalist agenda. If Australians believe that voting for Mr Dutton will fix the mess created by Prime Minister Albanese, they are mistaken. These men are two sides of the same coin, the only difference being the colour of their ties. The only way forward, really, is this: reject the twoparty system and vote for true disruptors—leaders who will challenge the establishment, fight globalist overreach and, most importantly, put Australia first.","Federal Election","STATEMENTS BY SENATORS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[20]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator BABET (Victoria—United Australia Party Whip) ","(13:46):"

I should recognise your efforts as well, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle. A few years ago, Senator Rennick—and I think he might have spoken about this earlier—pushed for a Senate inquiry into regional bank closures. We on the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee, along with many everyday Australians, got involved and fought hard to keep banks in our country towns.  Our first act as a committee was to write to all the banks and ask them not to close branches during our inquiry, and three of the four major banks agreed with us and did that. As a consequence, 12 bank branches that were slated for closure were not closed at that time. It was one of the more fruitful Senate committee experiences Ive been involved in. It was conducted in a tripartisan way and we delivered real results for people on the ground. I want to thank everybody who got involved. I remember our first hearing down in Sale, in Victoria—organised with just weeks notice. The town hall was packed to the rafters, and that public reaction clearly helped force the hands of the banks to do something here and to stop the ripping out of financial services from our country towns. I do welcome yesterdays announcement that banks will now extend that moratorium until mid2027. Thats fantastic. All banks have now signed up to provide their banking services through Australia Post branches. Thats great, but more needs to be done, too. Our committee did also recommend that a small levy be introduced on our major banks so that we could fund the expansion of new services and we dont just get declining services; we get growth in financial services in the bush. I hope the government can take that recommendation up as well.","Banking and Financial Services","STATEMENTS BY SENATORS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[21]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator CANAVAN (Queensland) ","(13:48):"

Im here to set the record straight. I dont support the bill. Labor say their bill targets the top end of town. Their plan is that people with $3 million or more in their superannuation need to pay more tax. In theory, it sounds okay. Most of us would say $3 million is a fair chunk of change, but that amount wont be indexed. So, as we move forward 10 years or 20 years, suddenly what seems like a lot of money now wont be a lot of money then. It means more and more Australians will be caught up in this tax, but the real secret assassin of this bill is the unrealised gains.  Think of a Tassie farmer who owns an agricultural property thats been in their family for generations. Maybe that land is worth a few million dollars now and is classed as one of their assets. This bill would ask farmers to pay tax on that land—pay tax on something they havent sold and something they dont have the cash in the bank for. It makes absolutely no sense at all. So, suddenly, this bill, which Labor says only targets millionaires, is targeting average, everyday working people. Thats not giving people a fair crack. I agree that super needs to be taxed in a way thats fairer and more sustainable. The administration of superannuation is needlessly complex, and it adds costs to everyone who uses the system. Super tax concessions are expensive and will require eventual wind back, but its got to be done in a way that reduces complexity, gives certainty and improves sustainability. Labors better targeted super concession bill isnt the right way to do it, and thats why I dont support it—so rumour dispensed.","Superannuation (Better Targeted Superannuation Concessions) Imposition Bill 2023","STATEMENTS BY SENATORS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[22]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator TYRRELL (Tasmania—Independent TAS Whip) ","(13:50):"

As the duty senator for most of New South Wales, Im delighted that the government will back regional aviation, just like we back regional telecommunications, because we know our great country towns deserve quality services and connectivity just like our cities.

Again, the Labor government is standing up for regional communities and making sure that regional transport, including aviation services, is not reduced under this government. We believe in regional and remote communities and in the fact that they deserve reliable, affordable and accessible air travel. Today, the Prime Minister announced that we will support bidders in a second sale process for Rex Airlines to maximise the prospect of a successful sale. We have been clear that the Commonwealth is not a bidder in this process and that we want to see a successful, market led outcome, but this is an important signal to the market. Weve been clear that if there is no sale well look at contingency options, including Commonwealth acquisition. This is because regional Australians deserve to know that we have their backs.  This announcement today, of course, builds on the announcement yesterday about ensuring regional services like banking are maintained in communities and on the important announcements by the minister for infrastructure today about the upgrade of regional airports—again, infrastructure that is essential not only for daytoday air travel and transport but also in times of emergencies. We know those communities, Senator ONeill, where you are the relevant senator rely so much on being able to, at short notice, ship in supplies and support at times of national emergency. We are very pleased to make these investments—certainly, the investments in airports are long overdue—and we believe, in terms of Rex, we need to make a very strong commitment to regional communities that we will maintain your air services, despite Rex Airlines going through a difficult time.","Aviation Industry","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[2]/answer[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator GALLAGHER (Australian Capital Territory—Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Finance, Minister for Women, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and VicePresident of the Executive Council) ","(14:07):"

Various people choose various people to hang out with, whether it be here in Australia or overseas. Your own question is answered by what youve asked. The report referred to a function that the Prime Minister attended that turned out to be a function with a group that we are actually taking enforcement action against, so there can be no suggestion that the Prime Minister or anyone else in our government has gone soft on anyone. No government has done more to crack down on dodgy international education providers than the Albanese government.  I think the person whos got some explaining to do is Mr Dutton. Mr Duttons got some explaining to do about why hes saying he wants to bring back the golden ticket visa that was discredited and got rid of because it was prone to fraud and it was open to bringing in spies and criminals.

Today marks one year since the second tranche of the Albanese Labor governments closing loopholes legislation passed the parliament. These reforms built on the same job, same pay legislation. They contain stronger protections for gig workers, end unpaid overtime with a right to disconnect, and provide more job security for casual workers. Minister, why is closing loopholes in our workplace relations system so important, and how are the Albanese Labor governments policies helping Australian workers earn more and keep more of what they earn?

I know Senator Polley was very happy to join a whole heap of workers, along with many other colleagues this morning, to acknowledge and celebrate the oneyear anniversary of the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes No. 2) Bill 2024 being passed through this parliament. That piece of legislation passed by the Albanese government has given workers better worklife balance, more job security and improved workplace conditions.  The second tranche of our closing loopholes legislation, which is now one year old, introduced a right to disconnect for eligible workers when they are not working or being paid, set new minimum pay and other standards for workers in the gig economy and the road transport industry, and provided a fairer definition of casual employees, enabling more casual workers to convert to permanent employment. In fact, Senator ONeill and I were talking with one of the workers this morning who not only has been able to convert to permanency but, along with other colleagues, is able to go to the bank and get a home loan for the first time. Thats the kind of difference its making to people. But, of course, these reforms are now at risk from Mr Dutton and the coalition because they voted against them, just as they voted against every single one of our workplace law changes that are delivering higher wages and better jobs for Australians, while also voting against every measure we have taken to provide costofliving relief. Now, as we approach the next election, they have already confirmed that they will repeal the right to disconnect and our protections for casual workers, and theyve flagged further attacks to workers wages and conditions by promising a targeted set of repeals of our workplace laws. We know they will follow through in doing that because every time theyve ever been in government the coalition have gone out of their way to cut workers wages and cut their conditions to serve their big business mates. Not only did they do that last time they were in government, when they boasted about keeping wages deliberately low, but they voted against every change weve made to try and turn wages around for Australian workers.

"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I move:  That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today. Today we saw, in response to a question that I asked of the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Senator McCarthy tell the chamber that, under Labor, bulkbilling rates are lower and outofpocket costs are lower. It has literally never been more expensive or more difficult to see a doctor than it is right now. But, at the same time this is happening, the Labor Party are reheating their disgraced Mediscare campaign in an attempt to distract from their health failures. Lets be clear: Labor is outright telling factually incorrect information to Australians. In fact, an ABC article published today made that very clear. The ABC article has actually called out the Australian Labor Party for misleadingly editing a video of the Leader of the Opposition which perpetuates their shameful scare campaign. The coalition has been crystal clear, and Ill say it again here: a Dutton coalition government will guarantee the growing funding of Medicare. We support Australians having access to bulkbilling services, and that includes through urgent care clinics. Were focused on ensuring all Australians have affordable and timely access to a GP. But Labor dont seem to care about the truth, and it seems that theyre quite happy to continue to focus on efforts to provide misleading information to the Australian public. On the other hand, the coalition is focused on tackling Labors primary care crisis. So lets set the record straight, shall we? As I said, Peter Dutton has committed to the coalition guaranteeing the growing funding of Medicare, and this is actually consistent with our record when we were in government. The former coalition government increased Medicare funding every single year and, in our last budget in government, included a $7.3 billion increase in Medicare funding. We increased hospital funding, and we oversaw recordhigh bulkbilling rates. It doesnt matter what the other side says; the facts of the matter are that, when we left government, bulkbilling rates were in excess of 88 per cent and, in the space of less than two years, under the government opposite, they have actually dropped by more than 11 per cent. As we stand here today, the bulkbilling rate is 11 per cent lower than when they came to government. When we took the reins of government in 2013 and during our period, we saw a rise of six per cent in bulkbilling. They have seen a fall of 11 per cent. Right now, as we are sitting here, under Labor the bulkbilling rate is 77.5 per cent. Thats significantly lower than 88.8 per cent, which is what the bulkbilling rate was under us, when it was at its highest. So at best we have seen a stagnation of the bulkbilling rate, but the government are now claiming that theyve seen some sort of increase in bulkbilling. The facts dont lie. The bulkbilling rate has dropped by 11 per cent. But what makes things even worse is that Australians are now paying 45 per cent more on average to see a doctor under Labor, in comparison to under the former coalition government. The cold, hard facts are that the outofpocket costs to see your GP are the highest they have been since records started. But the really, really concerning fact—if those facts arent concerning enough—is that last year over 1.5 million Australians avoided seeing their doctor because they said they simply couldnt afford to do so. Thats a 25 per cent increase on just the year before. That means that our hospitals are now seeing patients who are much sicker because they havent had access at the primary care level. They are becoming sicker and are presenting at our hospitals. So Labors primary care crisis is now exacerbating the crisis that we have in our hospitals. I would say this to Anthony Albanese, who said to Australians that he was not going to leave anyone behind: you have left sick Australians behind. Their outofpocket costs are higher. They cant get in to see a bulkbilling doctor. Theyre sicker before theyre able to interact with the healthcare system because they cant afford to see a GP. Hardworking Australians who cant access bulkbilling have become Anthony Albaneses forgotten patients. The healthcare crisis is just another crisis of the making of your costofliving crisis.  I think we need to correct some of that. It was beautifully spoken and designed to create a sense of belief that the Liberal and National parties have ever done anything innovative and are determined to make sure Australians actually get proper access to health care. But that is a myth. Australians, while they live their lives, dont see everything that goes on in this place, but they are entitled to the truth. And the truth is the party that established Medicare is Labor. Every chance the people opposite and their forebears had in government, every time the Liberal and National coalition got into government, they did every single thing they could to wreck the health system, to make you as an Australian pay more and to try and get rid of your Medicare card. When they came to government under Tony Abbott, in 2013, I was actually paying attention. Other people were getting on with their lives across this great nation, but I went across this country, to regional, rural, remote and city locations, to document what they did. Lets be clear. There was $52 billion for a 10year national partnership health agreement that was supposed to proceed. Mr Abbott and the team that is now Mr Duttons ripped up that agreement and, in doing so, pulled apart and completely dismantled across this country the opportunity for our state governments to deliver primary care. We heard Senator Ruston talking about primary health. I can tell you what happened. When they last got a go at government, under Mr Abbott they ripped up that agreement, and that meant every single bit of preventive care and community health care fell away. States kept their tertiary institutions, their hospitals, open. Thats what they had to do. People who had been looked after no longer got health care. In addition to that—because they think they know something about businesses—they decided to have a crack at the businesses that were being run by our GPs. They wanted to put a $7 tax on. They implemented a freeze on the Medicare rebate, which basically kicked the legs out from under the business model of Australian GPs. That is why we have a crisis. We ended up with the massive crisis of people not being able to go to their GPs, and, because they couldnt go to a GP, they ended up in our hospital emergency centres. Weve got a few doctors in the Labor Party, and they know exactly what is being faced by Australians who seek health care. Amongst them is a very good friend of mine from the beautiful Central Coast, Dr Gordon Reid, who continues to this day, for no fee, to offer his services to support emergency care on the Central Coast. Hes joined in such work by Dr Mike Freelander, who, at Campbelltown Hospital, continues to provide support for people who need it. They know a thing or two about the health system. They are the GPs and the specialists whove been at the front line. They tell the truth. And they saw the system decay before their very eyes. Dr Gordon Reid, very wisely, pushed for and had accepted by the Labor Party the urgent care clinic model. Now, across this country, every seat in the country is begging for an urgent care centre, because the need is so great. There were no Medicare cards for any Australian before Labor brought them in. There were no mental health services through headspace before Labor brought them in. There were no urgent care centres for this country till Labor brought them in. Theres a pattern there! The biggest threat to communities, the threat that will take away urgent care centres, is the election of a Peter Dutton government. Those opposite have absolutely no commitment to the policy innovation that gives Australians access to the health care they need through urgent care centres across this country. The biggest threat to your health is a Dutton led government. Give Labor your vote. Hang on to Medicare, hang on to headspace and hang on to our urgent care centres.  That was a lovely speech by Senator ONeill, and I always admire Senator ONeills rhetoric, but lets look at the facts. The facts are these. When the coalition government left office, the bulkbilling rate was 88 per cent. The bulkbilling rate has now fallen to 77 per cent—it has actually fallen. It has gone from 88 per cent to 77 per cent, so it has fallen 11 per cent—fact. Heres another fact. Over 1.5 million Australians—just reflect on that—didnt go to a GP in 202324, because of concerns about costs. In the Albanese Labor governments costofliving crisis, over 1.5 million Australians in 202324 chose not to go to a GP, because of costs. Thats the impact of the Albanese Labor government: people arent going to see their GP, because theyre concerned about the cost. Thats another fact. I want to talk to you about the results of a survey in relation to the region where my senators office is located, the greater Ipswich region. In 202223, in the greater Ipswich region, an outer suburban area in SouthEast Queensland, the bulkbilling rate—thats the number of clinics with available slots for new patients—when the coalition left office was 59.5 per cent. In 202324 it fell to 37.8 per cent. Only 17 out of 45 clinics with available spaces were providing bulkbilling. We now find, with the latest statistics released by Cleanbill, that the percentage has fallen further. It is now at 30 per cent. So in 202223, shortly after the coalition government, there was 59.5 per cent bulkbilling in the greater Ipswich region. Fast forward a few years to 202425 and it has gone from 59.5 per cent to 30 per cent. That is why in the last year 1.5 million Australians were so concerned about costs that they didnt go and see their GP. That is the direct result of the Albanese Labor governments costofliving crisis. Only 15 out of 50 clinics in the Ipswich region and the Somerset region, in the greater Ipswich region where my office is located, provide bulkbilling. What a devastating figure! I can tell you that in our region there are a lot of people who are doing it tough. The most recent analysis undertaken by the University of New South Wales for the Four Corners program that aired recently looked at household financial stress across the whole of Australia. It found that over three out of four households in the greater Ipswich region are under financial stress. Over 77 per cent are in financial distress, and that means that those households are barely covering the necessities of life: housing, clothing and food. That is why you have 1.5 million Australians not seeing their GP; theyre concerned about the cost. Youll hear a lot of rhetoric from the other side about the money thats been spent: Weve done this. Weve done that. But when you look at the raw figures, those figures dont lie. The Cleanbill survey was conducted by an independent organisation that contacted 6,925 GP clinics across Australia. It found that the bulkbilling rate in the Ipswich region and the Somerset region had fallen from 59.5 per cent a few years ago to 30 per cent. So the figures dont lie: the bulkbilling rates under Labor are falling.  Again, in the oppositions questions in question time today and in their response in the debate now, we see just a political agenda but, somewhat surprisingly, as we go into an election, no policy at all. From Medicare and housing to antisemitism, theyre quick on the attack, but that is accompanied by selective hearing and selective facts. Lets turn first to housing. The last government absolutely abandoned social housing and any kind of national housing initiative through the Commonwealth. The opposition, when in government, turned its back on remote Indigenous communities in areas of dire housing need—communities where the Commonwealth had had a long history of sharing the load of building and maintaining houses—and I believe a Dutton government would do exactly the same. Equally, under the Rudd government we saw a massive uplift in social housing. Places like St Pats, which Ive been pleased to visit, that house people at otherwise extreme risk of homelessness were funded during that period. Now, through the Housing Australia Future Fund, we have a substantial agenda to deliver hundreds of thousands more houses for our nation. On the question of Medicare, what a joke it was to hear that critique from those opposite. When the opposition say, The facts dont lie, they have pretty selective facts, let me tell you. When the opposition say bulkbilling has fallen by 11 per cent, theyre actually comparing it to all of the bulkbilled injections done by the Commonwealth government during COVID, where people walked through the door and got their jab. Thats what they have counted as 100 per cent bulkbilled. Todays bulkbilling rates are actually pretty close to what they were under the last government, but we dont think thats good enough. We want to see that lifted, which is why we are investing in the bulkbilling incentive. Its why we have opened 87 Medicare urgent care clinics that are demonstrably diverting patients away from busy hospitals and emergency departments. Finally, I come to the topic that Senator Cash started with in question time today, trying to score political points off these appalling antisemitic comments taking place in a hospital in Bankstown, New South Wales. I looked up this particular incident on the internet, and it is, indeed, appalling. The holding of such views, as Senator Wong pointed out, is a contravention of federal law under Ahpra, which is the accreditation and standards body that coordinates health bodies. I daresay those comments will also be an offence under the hate speech laws that we have just passed. But, rather than focusing on what was being done to hold these workers to account and to stop it from happening in the future, Senator Cash wanted to invent some kind of idea that the Prime Minister should have done something other than what he did. Did Senator Cash want the Prime Minister to march into the hospital and sack them himself?","Answers to Questions","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator RUSTON (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) ","(15:01):"

"0","0","0","1","1","McLachlan, Sen Andrew (The DEPUTY PRESIDENT)","287062","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," In rising to take note of the answers given today, I think the main point is that the government has been very good at building bureaucracies but very bad at building houses. The government made building more houses its central pitch for election, and we heard today—in the preprepared answer from the minister in response to a dorothy dixer—that the government had built more houses. That is factually incorrect. All you need to do is ask the Parliamentary Library, like I have, what the average number of houses built under the last government was and how many have been built under this government. The answer is, on average, about 190,000 each year under the last government, the coalition. Under this government, it has fallen to 170,000.  I believe the central reason for this is linked to the faith in this Housing Australia Future Fund agenda, which is a federal government bureaucracy. Minister Wong says its not reasonable for us to ask questions about this because we voted against it. We did vote against it, and we voted against it because its a bad idea that bureaucracies in Canberra can build houses in all parts of Australia. Nonetheless, that legislation passed a year and a half ago. I would have thought that in a year and a half the governments central housing scheme, the Housing Australia boondoggle, would have been able to sign a few contracts, dig a few holes and build a few houses. What it has done is make announcements. In September, the Prime Minister made an announcement with the new Minister for Housing, Ms ONeil, saying that they will build 13,000 houses. Minister Wong referred to this yesterday and today, saying that 13,000 houses are in the pipeline. At Senate estimates at the end of last year, when we asked Housing Australia how theyre going in building those 13,000 new houses, the answer was that they had signed one contract. Since then, theyve signed another 11 contracts, so now they have 12 signed contracts. Contracts are fantastic. Its great to have pieces of paper, and we have lots of paper here in this building. But what actually matter are shovels and the assembly of bricks and mortar. That is what counts. That is why weve made the point that it appears that the Housing Australia Future Fund is on a duck. Its on a duck. Its built no houses, and that is because the government have put all of their faith in bureaucracies when they should have been backing the market. They should have been backing builders and developers to build us out of this housing crisis Labor have created.

I have to respond to Senator Watts comment today on my question to him about the 75,400 illegals that are in the country on these visas, and nothings being done about it. He couldnt even respond to it. He didnt know the numbers. He said, I dont know where you got your numbers from. That tells me that hes not across it and he doesnt know what hes talking about. When you have 75,400 illegal visa holders in the nation, you have to question it, because this has an impact on our housing, our facilities, our doctors—everything like that. Yet we do not address the number of illegals in the country. You question me about voting for Labors policies. When you put up decent policies that will make a difference to this country and to the high immigration numbers, then you will get my support. I am the biggest advocate in this whole chamber for people pushing for Australias way of life. What is happening with the high immigration under this government, with 1.4 million people coming into this country—that is why we have a crisis in housing, infrastructure, roads and health, seeing doctors, everything. So youre to blame for this. Put up decent policies, and I will back them. What happened with the debacle of those detainees let out of detention centres? That was your problem as well, and your fault—everything that youve touched and done with people in this country. The number of students youve allowed into the country is over the top. As Ive said, the students here should be allowed to work, by all means, but theyre supposed to be here studying. Theyre doing plenty of work, to make $10 billion to send back to their respective countries. There are a lot of questions here.

I grew up around Karratha and remember very fondly the rocks around Murujuga, where my family and I used to go for picnics. Its a truly special part of our country. In fact, its globally culturally significant. The answer that Senator McAllister gave to Senator Cox was that the governments taking steps to get a World Heritage listing for the area. Absolutely, this should be listed as national and world heritage, but thats not going to stop the acid rain from emissions from heavy industry in the area destroying this irreplaceable and absolutely priceless First Nations cultural heritage. Some of the art at Murujuga includes carvings depicting thylacines, Tasmanian tigers, which existed tens of thousands of years ago in the northwest of Western Australia. This is known around the world as the worlds largest art site, and the science very clearly tells us, and nobody disagrees with this, that the emissions from the Burrup fertiliser plant and Woodsides gasprocessing plant are destroying the desert glass that makes these carvings so unique—the desert glass that has allowed these carvings to survive intact over tens of thousands of years of normal weather in the northwest of Western Australia. But now the desert glass is disappearing because the acid from heavy industry emissions is making it vanish. What a tragedy that would be, not just for First Nations communities who are linked to this area but for all of us and for all of humanity. The question Senator Cox asked was: will the government stop further development at Murujuga on the Burrup Hub? Right now, we know that the minister, Minister Plibersek, has on her desk before her a decision on whether to extend the Burrup Hub North West Shelf project, which would require the opening up of the Browse Basin and the drilling of Scott Reef, Australias largest oceanic reef system off the coast of Western Australia. Right now, were looking at opening one of the biggest carbon bombs this nation has seen in its history. That goes directly to the heart of the damage being done to a priceless cultural treasure on the Burrup Hub at Murujuga. Well continue to ask questions about this. I know there are a lot of people in the building today—not just the First Nations mob from this very special area, but also environmentalists and other people—who are campaigning to have this area protected. I would urge senators to look at the facts. I chaired the Senate inquiry into this exact issue nine years ago, and were still having the same arguments, having the same debates and having questions unanswered. When will we put a stop to heavy industrial development at this extremely sensitive, culturally significant site? We couldnt get an answer out of the government on that today. Senator Cox was right to raise the impacts that climate change is having on her communities right around this country. We are living in an age where we are witnessing the climate breaking down before our very eyes, and we know that its decisions made in places like this that are allowing this to happen. As I mentioned in my adjournment speech last night, we know its not just the big donors to the Labor and Liberal parties who are facilitating the lack of climate action—in fact, tearing up climate action in this place. Its also the global networks and their decadeslong campaign to control our institutions in this parliament. They certainly have control of the Liberal Party. I dont know about the Labor Party, but they dont have control of the Greens. Every day, we will come in here and fight for First Nations communities, fight for climate action and fight for what is right.

Thomas Eyre Forrest Hughes AO, KC, a former minister and member of the House of Representatives for the divisions of Parkes and Berowra, New South Wales, from 1963 to 1972. Before I call the Leader of the Government in the Senate, I draw to the attention of honourable senators the presence with us today of former prime minister the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull AC, Ms Lucy Hughes Turnbull AO, Ms Christine Hughes and Mr Tom Hughes. I also welcome family in the Presidents gallery today. On behalf of all senators, I pass on our condolences.   by leave—I move: That the Senate records its sadness at the death, on 28 November 2024, of the Honourable Thomas Eyre Forrest (Tom) Hughes AO KC, former AttorneyGeneral and member for Parkes and Berowra, places on record its gratitude for his service to the Parliament and the nation, and tenders its sympathy to his family in their bereavement. I rise on behalf of the government to acknowledge the death of the former member of the House of Representatives and minister, the Hon. Thomas Eyre Forrest Hughes AO, KC, at the age of 101. At the outset of my remarks, I convey the governments condolences to the family and friends of Tom Hughes and, again, join you and others in acknowledging those joining us in the chamber today—Toms wife, Christine; his son, Tom; and his daughter, Lucy Turnbull AO, and her husband, the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull AC, former Prime Minister of Australia. I also extend acknowledgement to all friends and relatives here today. I extend my personal sympathies to you all, as I do to Mr Hughess loved ones who are not here with us today. To be a centenarian puts one in rare air, and Tom Hughes was rare indeed. As the Prime Minister said earlier: It takes considerable effort to fill a century of life to capacity, yet Tom Hughes certainly managed it. In his 101 years, he gave us many remarkable chapters, each revealing another aspect of a man of wit, intellect, courage, conviction and curiosity. The narrative that coursed through those chapters was his family—a family flush with talent, a family grounded by civic duty and a family bound by deep love and affection. Tom Hughes was born in November 1923 in Sydney. His father was a successful lawyer and wartime aviator. His grandfather and great uncles were members of the New South Wales parliament. His brother was the acclaimed historian and art critic Robert Hughes, who was once described in the New York Times as the most famous art critic in the world. He was educated at Riverview, where the intellectual discipline of the Jesuits helped shape his character and work ethic. As with so many of his generation, World War II interceded and upended his trajectory into adult life. He followed his fathers footsteps, enlisting in the RAAF in Australia in 1942. He was a celebrated pilot, and when his service concluded in 1946 he held the rank of flight lieutenant. For his contribution to the war in Europe, he would be recognised in 2005 by France with its highest award, the Legion of Honour. Despite his military achievements, Lucy Turnbull recalled that her father did not dwell on his war service. He never told us stories of his flying or military adventures. I think that says something of the character of the man—his respect for the suffering of war and the sacred memory of those who didnt return. Returning to civilian life, Tom once again followed in his fathers footsteps and completed studies in law at the University of Sydney. He was admitted in 1949 and took silk just over a decade later. Im told it was on the same day as Gough Whitlam. Gough Whitlam and Tom always held each other in high esteem despite their political differences. Tom Hughes had not long been Queens Counsel before another family calling resonated. At the 1963 general election, won by Robert Menzies, he successfully contested the division of Parkes—then located in inner Western Sydney—defeating the Labor incumbent, Les Haylen. His campaign manager was future prime minister John Howard. In 1969, Tom became the first member for Berowra. After a couple of terms on the backbench, destiny prevailed when Prime Minister John Gorton appointed Tom Hughes to the ministry as his AttorneyGeneral. They shared a background as wartime airmen and an enmity for Billy McMahon. The strength of the relationship between them is evidenced by Tom Hughes delivering the eulogy at John Gortons funeral in 2002. Theirs was a government grappling with change—a restlessness percolating through the Australian public, and politics was catching up with a prime minister orientated towards action. Tom himself, as Lucy recalled, became a more liberal Liberal during his time in parliament. He certainly was way ahead of his time and was at the vanguard of pushing to abolish the crime of homosexuality. Tom didnt have much time as AttorneyGeneral, only until John Gortons demise in 1971, but he spent that short tenure at the forefront of legislative reform, applying himself with his typical focus, especially in areas not regarded as the purview of Commonwealth government—pursuing divorce law reform, law reform in the ACT and trade practices legislation. In her eulogy, Mrs Turnbull said: Dad, like all traditional Liberals, was always a big supporter of free and fair enterprise. The fair bit was very important to him. Dad was very opposed to restrictive trade practices, meaning monopolistic or anticompetitive behaviour, and in those days the legal system didnt have enough power to prohibit or sanction it. Tom balanced public expectations with justice in electing not to indiscriminately prosecute antidraft protesters, at the same time as he notoriously confronted antiwar demonstrators streaming down his driveway—with a cricket bat. Alongside reform inside the parliament, his talents as a barrister were not left idle, personally appearing for the Commonwealth on multiple occasions in the High Court during this time. It was a pretty good deal for the taxpayer, since—a young Malcolm Turnbull later recorded in a profile for the Bulletin—Toms daily rate at the bar was a thousand dollars a day in 1970s money. Perhaps most famously, he appeared for the Commonwealth in the Concrete Pipes case, which led to an expansive interpretation of the corporations power in the Constitution. Former High Court justice Michael McHugh reflected, This granted the Commonwealth government power to control and regulate most of the business and economic life, and much of the social life, in Australia. The ascent of William McMahon to the nations highest political office brought about Tom Hughess ministerial demise. The three airmen—John Gorton, Tom Hughes and their close friend, minister for the Navy Jim Killen—fell together, sacked by the new leader, whom he accurately described as a shocking little person. Tom Hughes left parliament at the ensuing election and returned full time to the New South Wales bar, serving as president of the Bar Association from 1973 to 1975, and he built his reputation and became preeminent amongst those learned in the law. Ive read various nicknames and various adjectives for this period in his life: formidable, dominant, theatrical, the nickname Frosty. But above all, unquestionably, he was exceptionally good—a leader at the bar, master of the courtroom—and he applied himself across a broad spectrum of the law. And hed work his craft as adeptly before the High Court, in which he appeared on nearly 100 occasions in constitutional cases, as he did before the Supreme Court on a defamation trial or criminal matter. His clients included Lionel Murphy, as well as the Packer family, and even—no doubt to the delight of the current Prime Minister—the South Sydney Rabbitohs. Finally, he retired on the occasion of his 90th birthday. Its very impressive. Tom Hughes was a gifted Australian. He excelled in his chosen field, and he ensured he never treated it like an occupation. Whether in law or politics, it was a calling, and our nation is richer for his pursuit of it. Tom Hughes was, as the Prime Minister said, someone with a sharp wit and a gift for language and persuasion. More importantly, he held a determination to use his talents for the service of others, for causes bigger than himself. And anyone who has had anything to do with the Hughes and Turnbull families would have observed how they treasured their loving patriarch. Lucys eulogy reveals not just his familys sadness for his passing but also their pride in his life. Tom returned to the shores of Sydney Harbour for his last days, so fitting when his brother had vividly described Sydney Harbour as the amniotic fluid of Toms memory. That iconic part of Australia so nurtured Tom Hughess emotional and spiritual life, and Tom and his family have just as devotedly sought to shape the modern soul of Australia. On behalf of the government I express again our condolences, following his passing, to his friends and family, especially to his wife, Christine; and his children, Lucy, Tom and Michael.  I rise on behalf of the opposition to pay tribute to Tom Hughes AO, KC. In doing so, I also acknowledge the presence today here with us in the chamber of Lucy Turnbull and former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, Christine Hughes, Tom Hughes and the broader Hughes family in the gallery. Quite simply, as so many have said, over so long a period, Tom Hughes was a great Australian—born in a bygone era, living to 101. It has been said by his official biographer that he actually had four careers: farmer, RAAF pilot, barrister and politician. And today in the Australian Senate we acknowledge, as appropriate, a truly remarkable life. In fact, when you talk to people about Tom Hughes and his life story, it is amazing to hear people say that his life story reads somewhat like a movie script. Thomas Eyre Forrest Hughes was born on 26 November 1923 in Rose Bay. His grandfather, Sir Thomas Hughes, was a solicitor who rose to become the Lord Mayor of Sydney. His father, whom Tom always said was the man he most admired and respected, was Geoffrey Forrest Hughes, a solicitor and decorated World War I flying ace. In fact, he was famously involved in a lengthy dogfight over France with the Red Baron. His mother, Margaret, was a vicars daughter from Devon in England. As well as Tom, the couple had one daughter, Constance, and two more sons, Geoffrey and Robert. Robert Hughes, of course, would become the renowned art critic and author of A Fatal Shore. Tom himself was educated at Saint Ignatius College Riverview and the University of Sydney, where he studied law. That study, however, was interrupted by World War II. As a young man who already had a strong sense of service and love of his country, he joined the RAAF as a pilot. He captained a Sunderland flying boat and a crew of 12, flying out of the United Kingdom over the Atlantic and parts of wartorn Europe at the young age of 21. His Sunderland and crew succeeded in unmasking enemy artillery nests in the southwest of France where it had been assumed the Germans had been expelled. The Sunderland flying boat participated in Dday operations, escorting allied convoys and sinking Uboats. Tom was later awarded the French Legion of Honour, Frances highest award. Tom modestly described it as a relatively lucky and safe war. Toms time in Britain is also said to have inspired him to become a barrister. It had often been assumed that Tom would become a solicitor, like his father and grandfather. But during World War II in London he attended the law courts and was inspired by the performance of the wigged and blackgowned barristers defending their clients. On return to Australia after the war, Tom resumed his legal studies. He was admitted to the bar in 1949, the same year Robert Menzies won office as head of a LiberalCountry Party coalition government. The young barrister, Tom, had impeccable connections through his father, but his practice also grew because of talent and an insatiable appetite for hard work. Taking silk in 1962, Tom found a mentor and a friend in Chief Justice Owen Dixon, with both men bonding over political discussions. What was to become a distinguished career in politics began in 1963, when Tom was persuaded to stand as a Liberal candidate in the marginal Labor seat of Parkes in Sydneys inner west. His campaign manager was a young John Howard, who remained a close friend throughout his life. In fact, former Prime Minister Howard reflected on that first campaign after Toms death: Quickly adapting from the formality of the courtroom to speaking from the back of a truck near Campsie Railway Station, he fought a vigorous campaign and claimed this highly marginal seat for the Menzies government Tom was reelected in Parkes in 1966 and then won in the new seat of Berowra in 1969. In November 1969, Tom was appointed as John Gortons AttorneyGeneral, a position he held until March 1971. Being responsible for administering the National Service Act and prosecuting those who resisted the draft for Vietnam, Toms time as AttorneyGeneral was not without difficulties. He was targeted by anticonscription and antiwar protesters. In fact, in 1970 some 40 protesters turned up on the doorstep of the Hughes family home in Bellevue Hill. Not a man to take a step backwards, though, Tom confronted them with a cricket bat. His son Michael, we are told, just five at the time, was said to have been delighted to see hippies in the garden. Tom retired from politics prior to the 1972 election, returning to what we all now know was his true love for law. While, as I said earlier, he had a distinguished career in politics, it was as a barrister that he truly excelled and became, quite frankly, legendary. Returning to the New South Wales bar, Tom became president from 1973 to 1975. Tom had, without a doubt—and it is well known in legal circles not just here in Australia but also on the global stage—a commanding presence in Australian courtrooms for more than half a century, taking on and winning many highprofile cases. He was still practising as a barrister well into his 80s, using his trademark mix of persuasion, intimidation and theatre. Some of Toms cases included that of Elizabeth Evatt, Chief Judge of the Family Court, who sued when a newspaper article about the court accused her of overseeing the destruction of family lives. He represented disgraced former New South Wales chief stipendiary magistrate Murray Farquhar in his criminal trial, and Jane Makim—sister, of course, to the Duchess of York—who was found to have been defamed when falsely accused of adultery. Tom appeared several times for his law school contemporary Lionel Murphy, former attorneygeneral in the Whitlam government and High Court judge. In a defamation case, he represented famous rugby league player Andrew Ettingshausen, who sued when a newspaper published a naked photo of him in the shower after a game. The next statistic, quite frankly, is utterly remarkable. Tom Hughes appeared in the High Court 91 times between 1949 and 2010. He only retired from practice in 2013—literally just over a decade ago. It was well known that Tom would travel to chambers by public transport, before dawn spending many hours meticulously preparing for his cases. The tributes from those within the legal world say a lot about Toms standing as a barrister. New South Wales Chief Justice Andrew Bell was Hughess junior counsel at his secondlast High Court appearance, in 2009. Chief Justice Bell described Tom as one of the finest trial lawyers and advocates in our nations history and said: Preparing and appearing with Tom was a privilege and wonderful education for any junior barrister … … … … Tom Hughes was a wonderful man, of large spirit, great style and a true patriot. Law Society of New South Wales president Brett McGrath described Tom as one of the most formidable, talented and courteous lawyers to grace our justice system, saying: Tom Hughes served his nation, in times of war and peace, with distinction, he served his clients with determination and his opponents with the utmost respect. High Court Judge Michael McHugh said of Tom: He is a legendary figure who embodies the publics perception of the great advocate: dashing, dominating … and handsome … By any reckoning, he ranks as one of the greatest barristers the Australian legal profession has produced. There is no doubt that Tom Hughes lived an incredible life. The service he gave to our great country of Australia, combined with the mark he left on this nations legal profession, carved out a unique place for Tom Hughes in our nations history. Again, on behalf of the coalition, I offer my heartfelt condolences to Toms wife, Chrissie; to Toms children, Lucy, Tom and Michael; and to the wider Hughes family. May Tom Hughes, without doubt a remarkable Australian, rest in peace.  I rise today, on behalf of the National Party, to honour the life and legacy of Thomas Eyre Forrest Hughes AO, KC, a man of towering intellect and unwavering integrity and an indelible contributor to Australian public life. Thomas Hughes was a legal giant, a Kings Counsel of great renown whose mastery of the law was matched only by his passion for its fair application. His career spanned decades, during which he set benchmarks for legal advocacy that continue to inspire generations of barristers and solicitors today. Its said he had four careers, and the Nats might just doff a cap—an Akubra—to the fact that he was known to be a farmer, an airman, a barrister and an MP. The mark he left on Australian jurisprudence is significant: his arguments sharp and persuasive, his presence in the courtroom formidable, and his dedication to the rule of law unwavering. This was demonstrated by the fact—and this just speaks volumes—that he only retired from practice in 2013, just shy of his 90th birthday. Beyond the legal profession, Mr Hughes was a dedicated servant of the Australian people. His military service was an extension of these principles, an affirmation of his willingness to stand in defence of our great country and contribute to the global struggle for peace and security. During World War II, he answered the call to serve his nation, enlisting in the Royal Australian Air Force, where he trained and served as a pilot. Tom enlisted and served in the No. 10 Squadron from 1942 to 1946. No. 10 Squadron was both the first RAAF squadron and the first British Commonwealth squadron to see active service in the Second World War. It was also the only RAAF squadron to see continuous active service throughout the war. In 1943, Tom began a tour of operations and was part of the Normandy invasion. In 2005, he was awarded the French—and forgive my French—Legion dhonneur for his contribution to Operation Overlord. His contributions to the war effort, alongside those of thousands of other Australians, were instrumental in safeguarding the freedoms that we all cherish today. As a parliamentarian, he represented the constituents of Parkes from 1963 to 1969, in the halcyon days, shall we say, of the MenziesMcEwen government. In 1970, he purchased 800 hectares of good country down near Goulburn and went on to establish a Poll Dorset sheep stud. He exhibited, Im sure, a fancied fleece not only in the local shows but at the Sydney Royal, which is something he enjoyed. He was also the first member for the electorate of Berowra from 1969 to 1972. Former prime minister John Howard was Hughess campaign manager for the seat of Parkes in 1963 and became a lifelong friend. Serving with distinction as Australias AttorneyGeneral from 1969 to 1971, he demonstrated an unyielding commitment to justice, bringing about reforms that strengthened the legal foundations of our nation and reinforced the fundamental rights of its citizens. His service in public office was defined by his sharp legal mind, his deep understanding of constitutional matters and his ability to balance the weighty responsibilities of his role with an innate sense of fairness. He believed in the principle that the law was not merely a collection of rules but a living institution that must serve the people it governs. Beyond his public service, many would attest that Thomas Hughes was a man of great personal warmth, wit and generosity. To those who knew him he was a devoted family man, a mentor and a steadfast friend. He was known for a rare trait in politics—his humility despite his formidable achievements and impressive CV. His contributions extended well beyond the legal and political spheres. In 2001, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia in recognition of his service to the law and the broader Australian community. He gave freely of his time and expertise, fostering the next generation of legal minds and remaining a respected voice in national discussions on governance and legal affairs. The passing of Thomas Hughes is a reminder of the legacy that great Australians can and do leave behind, not only in the institutions they shape but in the lives they touch. His influence is still felt in courtrooms across this country, in the pages of our legal textbooks and in the hearts of those who had the privilege to work alongside him. I would like to acknowledge his daughter, Lucy Turnbull, who is in the chamber today and who inherited from her father and his family a commitment and dedication to public service. On behalf of the Nationals, I extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, Christine; his children, Lucy, Tom and Michael; and their families. We honour his life and contributions and acknowledge him with gratitude. Again, I take this opportunity to thank him for his service to a grateful nation in all four of those careers. May he rest in peace.  The Jesuits have a maxim that they teach their students, their seminarians, which is foundational to the way that they see the world. They call on each other to be men and women for others. It builds upon Ignatiuss spiritual exercises, which call for love to be expressed not just in words but in deeds. It should come as no surprise to any of us here that Tom Hughes was a product of this very Jesuit education at St Ignatius College Riverview. Few others readily come to mind in exhibiting this calling throughout a life of service more than Tom—an eminent life of service to his country, to this parliament and to the law. Tom graduated in law from the University of Sydney and enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force in 1942. After some training in Australia and the US, Tom volunteered for No. 10 Squadron RAAF in Plymouth, flying Short Sunderlands and protecting Atlantic shipping and, in 1944, the English Channel and Bay of Biscay during DDay operations. For his work in the war, which he later described as a rather minimal contribution to the war, he was awarded the French Legion of Honour amongst his Australian and imperial awards. On 3 March 1964, Tom delivered his maiden speech in the other place as the member for Parkes and, later, the member for Berowra. In it, he discussed the most pressing matter of the time, particularly for those on his side of politics—the Cold War. Tom was resolute about the risks that Australia faced and the role of Australia particularly in the light of a diminished empire and the threat of communism to the free and open world, particularly in Asia. His words echo true today—the need to be vigilant in the face of threats to our way of life, this time at the hands of authoritarian regimes. Tom later recalled in regard to the development of his political ideology: Its true that I was a fairly conservative politician when I first entered parliament in 1963, but in time I think I learnt to temper that conservatism, and later I think I was regarded as a smalll liberal. It was this shift that came to a head at the latter end of his parliamentary career. In May 1970, when he was the Commonwealth AttorneyGeneral, Tom gave an address to the sixth national conference of the Australian Council of Social Service at the ANU. In it, the first law officer of the Commonwealth made what was at the time considered to be a remarkable statement. He said: It is one thing to disapprove on moral grounds of homosexual connection in a private place between consenting adults. It is another thing to permit such disapproval to drive one to the conclusion that conduct of that description should be classified as criminal. This statement was remarkable at the time because homosexual acts were illegal. He was at that point and for some time after the only Liberal politician to express the desire to decriminalise homosexuality. He was saying then that the government did not belong in peoples bedrooms. He was ahead of his time. Naturally, Toms calls did not go unnoticed by elements of his own party, and, shortly after ending up on the wrong side of a leadership spill and back on the backbench, Tom was the subject of a preselection challenge. On 8 October 1971, delegates of the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party gathered at their Ash Street headquarters in Sydney to select their candidate for Berowra. Tom was being challenged by four candidates, including leading conservative and state MP Jim Cameron. But, as selectors entered the building, a remarkable thing was happening on the street: the Campaign Against Moral Persecution was staging a demonstration in support of Tom. The Australian newspaper had reported on that morning of the meeting, Australias homosexuals will hold their first public picket. It was the first ever public demonstration by that group and it was done in support of the preselection of Tom Hughes. However, whilst Tom was victorious in the preselection, defeating his challengers in the first ballot, he would decide not to contest the next election and would return to the bar full time. He was elected to the Council of the Australian National University and was elected President of the New South Wales Bar Association. As I mentioned at the outset, Tom would carry the values he was taught at a young age whilst at the bar. He represented Robert Askin, Gough Whitlam, Vic Garland, Kerry Packer, Bill Waterhouse and Lionel Murphy during a career that would culminate in him being dubbed, as weve already heard today, a lion of the bar. He retired a month before his 90th birthday. In more recent years, I am particularly proud to have worked on the Tom Hughes Oration, led by my friend the member for Berowra, which is now an annual fixture in the Berowra federal electoral conference, which I led for a number of years. It was a privilege to witness Toms formidable intellect in person. Tom is survived by his wife, Christine; his children, Lucy, Tom Jr and Michael; and, of course, Malcolm—all of whom, I might add, have given exemplary services to this country, to the law and to the Liberal Party. I offer my condolences to Toms family and friends. May he rest in peace. Ad maiorem Dei gloriam. Question agreed to, honourable senators joining in a moment of silence.","Hughes, Hon.

Leave granted. The speech read as follows— The Migration Amendment (Restoring Medevac) Bill 2025 will bring back the Medevac legislation that saved lives when it was active in 2019. This Bill would replicate what occurred in 2019, when people held in Papua New Guinea and Nauru, and their families, were transferred to Australia for medical care when assessed by two or more doctors as requiring treatment. This bill replicates the intent of the Migration Amendment (Urgent Medical Treatment) Bill 2018 proposed MPs Kerryn Phelps, Andrew Wilkie, Adam Bandt, Julia Banks and Rebekha Sharkie as well as Senators Nick McKim and Tim Storers amendment to the Home Affairs Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2018. This legislation was known as Medevac and was supported by members of the crossbench, the Australian Labor Party and Greens. I thank all involved in creating the initial bills for this 2025 bill. The 2018 Medevac amendments were unfortunately repealed in December 2019 under the Migration Amendment (Repairing Medical Transfers) 2019. When Medevac was in place 192 people were transferred to Australia and received urgent, oftenlifesaving, medical treatment. Since the repeal in 2019 people seeking asylum held in PNG and Nauru have been unable to access adequate medical treatment. There are currently nearly 100 people seeking asylum held on Nauru and around 40 in PNG who have been denied permanent resettlement for over a decade. Many are in desperate medical condition, too often as a direct result of the cruel treatment they have suffered under the offshore detention regime. Offshore detention emerged during a period of toxic politics that saw a race to the bottom on how to treat people seeking asylum. As a consequence, people who came to Australia seeking safety and to rebuild their lives were forced, coerced and deceived into going to so called regional processing countries. While the agreement with Nauru endures, there is no current agreement with PNG, despite Australia still being responsible for the refugees held there and continuing to be actively engaged with the PNG Government regarding them. In January 2025 the UN Human Rights Committee ruled that Australia remained responsible for the arbitrary detention of people seeking asylum who are redirected or transferred to offshore detention facilities, in two cases brought forward by people held on Nauru. This confirms what the Government has been told for years, going back to Medevac was last in place in 2019 when the Australian Human Rights Commission said: Transferring asylum seekers to third countries does not release Australia from its obligations under international human rights law. This bill applies to all people transferred to a regional processing country when an agreement was active. It also applies to those still held in PNG who were forcibly relocated there from Australia. As much as the Australian Government may wish it not to be true, they have a clear legal and moral responsibility to the people who were in Australia seeking safety and the Government chose to remove. When this bill last passed, the Labor Party supported it. Now they are in government they seem to have forgotten this policy. I urge Labor to support this bill again. Do not let the fear and division of the last few years, indeed the last few weeks, win. It is well known that the medical treatment provided to refugees and people seeking asylum in regional processing countries is often grossly inadequate. When Doctors Without Borders published their 2018 report on the medical conditions in Nauru, they found widespread mental and physical illness. One particularly disturbing rare psychiatric condition they saw in people held offshore was called Resignation Syndrome, which one in every four children had. Professor Louise Newman of the University of Melbourne described the syndrome as follows: Children may stop talking and isolate themselves in bed; they may also stop eating and drinking. The most serious stage of the disorder is when children enter a state of profound withdrawal and are unconscious or in a comatose state. This comatose state appears to be a state of hibernation in response to an intolerable reality. They are unresponsive, even to pain. They appear floppy, without normal reflexes, and require total care, including feeding and intravenous fluids, as otherwise, they risk kidney failure and death from complications caused by immobility, malnutrition and dehydration. This is a lifethreatening condition needing highlevel medical care. The conditions in these facilities were so bad that children entered into a coma to endure it. People are still held in these, or similar, conditions today. More recent reporting from the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre found that every single person currently held on PNG was ill, with one in 5 being so unwell their lives are at imminent risk. On top of that not one single person they spoke to could access adequate medical support. I know this to be true, because at the end of last year I travelled to PNG to meet with those held there after a decade. What I saw should shame every person in this place. People with futures taken from them, for no other reason than seeking safety at a time that was political inconvenient for some here. I want to relay just one story that I was told, of someone who needed to be evacuated for medical treatment. He was approved under Medevac at the same time as five others. On the day his plane was meant to take off all four of his friends approved for transfer came to Australia for essential treatment. They got the medical care they needed. But no one told him when his flight was, so he missed it. When he secured another flight, he went to the airport. While he was sitting in the airport, waiting for medical treatment to address his chronic pain the Medevac Bill was repealed. He was not allowed to get on the plane. Five years later that man is still in PNG, still without treatment, still in pain. That is the image I want everyone to have when you vote on this bill. A man who fled the country where he was born because he might be killed. Came to Australia to seek safety and build a life. But instead was taken away in the middle of the night and forcibly held in a detention centre where he watched his friends die. Became ill because of the horrors the Australian Government put him through. And when there was a glimmer of hope, of fairness, a slim chance that at least some of his pain would be eased, he was left there alone watching the plane he should have been on takeoff, watching that slither of justice disappear. Because of decisions made here. That is what this bill is, a slim sunbeam of hope. Hope not just for those people who have been denied a decade of their lives and basic dignity. But hope for us too. That we can be a better than what we are now. That the cruelty we have inflicted does not need to continue. I worry that if we do not take a stand against this hatred and division, then it will spread and take deeper root in our society. I urge everyone to support this bill.","Migration Amendment (Restoring Medevac) Bill 2025","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[5]","N/A","N/A"

Leave granted. The speech read as follows— It is my privilege to introduce theLobbying (Improving Government Honesty and Trust) Bill 2025into the Senate. In doing so, I would like to acknowledge Dr Monique Ryan MP, the independent Member for Kooyong, who drafted an earlier version of this Bill and introduced it into the House of Representatives on 18 November 2024. This Bill presents an opportunity for the major parties to help restore faith in our political system; to introduce regulations that will give Australians greater confidence that laws and policies are being made to benefit the public interest, not vested interests. I have been shocked to see the influence that lobbyists can have on the trajectory of public decisionmaking, and how inadequate the checks and balances are to ensure that these interactions are properly scrutinised. Lobbying is a legitimate practice. It is a way for various interest groups, such as those advocating for investment in cancer screening, to advocate for investment and attention by Government decisionmakers. If lobbying is performed transparently and ethically, it can assist governments—and the Parliament—to identify gaps and ultimately craft policies that benefit Australians. However, without any guardrails or transparency, there is no counterbalance to ensure that policies dont favour particular groups at the expense of the public interest. Worse still, when lobbying is performed out of sight, as is so often the case now, it erodes trust in our political system, leaving Australians feeling like the very people they elect to serve them are serving the interests of those with enough money to hire people to walk the halls of Parliament. I have seen the real consequences of this; of Australians who feel little more than apathy toward our political system, who feel there is no point in engaging with politics because their voice will never be as loud as those who can afford to employ a lobbyist or attend a fundraising dinner. This is a terrible outcome for our democracy and something we need to urgently repair. Transparency can be the antidote. Australias weak lobbying laws As it stands, the rules that govern the conduct of lobbyists in this building and their interactions with Government decisionmakers are so weak that they might not as well exist. Currently, the only infrastructure we have to ensure integrity around lobbying activities is a largely voluntary Code of Conduct applying to people who register on the Lobbyist Register. The first issue is that the obligation to register doesnt apply to the vast majority of lobbyists that come to Canberra each sitting fortnight. The Lobbying Code of Conduct (the Code) applies only to thirdparty lobbyists, that is, professionals who lobby on behalf of other companies or interest groups. This means that people who work inhouse as Government relations advisers for, say, Qantas, the Minerals Council or Santos, are not captured by the Code and dont have to abide by any formal code of ethics. As Dr Ryan said in the House of Representatives: So it applies only to 20 per cent of the lobbyists roaming our corridors, knocking on our doors, seeking to influence our decisions. The other 80 per cent—who knows? The second issue is that the obligation to register isnt really an obligation. There is nothing that mandates that lobbyists register in the first place—and no penalty if they lobby while not on the register. The breaches are also woefully inadequate. For even the most serious of breaches, for example, if a lobbyist were to lie or threaten a Government representative, the main sanction the Government can apply is a threemonth break from lobbying. Finally, while there may be some transparency around who lobbyists are, there is no transparency about who they are meeting with in the Government and what they are meeting about. The current Code and Register amount to little more than window dressing; a nod to integrity without actually doing anything to promote integrity or transparency in Government decisionmaking. The reforms introduced in this Bill This Bill introduces several critical reforms to strengthen our lobbying laws and enhance transparency. Firstly, it expands the definition of lobbyists to capture inhouse lobbyists, industry associations and consultants who have direct access to decision makers, ensuring that everyone who lobbies the Government is held to a code of ethics and can be penalised for breaches. The Bill also legislates the Lobbying Code of Conduct and introduces stronger penalties for breaches, so that it is no longer a voluntary code with no teeth. It will require lobbyists to submit online quarterly returns, so the Australian public can see who they have been meeting with, for how long, where and why. At the same time, it establishes a requirement for ministers to publicly disclose their diaries, so the Australian public can compare, crosscheck and verify that each party is disclosing accurate information. The Australian public has a right to know whether key policy decisions are being shaped by the voices of ordinary Australians or by a select group of lobbyists with privileged access. Making ministerial diaries public would shine a light on these interactions and ensure that the Government remains accountable to the people it serves. It provides the National AntiCorruption Commissioner with the authority to oversee lobbying activities and investigate breaches of the Code. Finally, but I believe most importantly, the Bill will prohibit ministers and their senior staff from moving into plum lobbying gigs after they cease employment in Government for a period of three years. This revolving door between Government and industry is toxic to good governance. When ministers and staff leave public office, they should not be able to use their insider knowledge for personal gain or the commercial benefit of their new employer—and they shouldnt be making decisions prior to leaving office which may advance their employertobe. Almost every resources minister we have had in recent memory has left the Government to work in the resources sector, which may go some way to explaining why Australia receives a dud deal on the export of its gas. Its notable that at least one former communications minister, responsible for regulating online gambling, moved onto work for the online gambling industrys peak body after leaving Government. Critics of reform will argue that this Bill would place an unnecessary burden on Government officials and businesses engaging with policymakers. However, transparency is not a burden—it is a fundamental obligation of any democratic government. Ultimately, compliance with a legislated Code is a small price to pay if more Australians feel they can trust that their Government is making decisions in the public interest. Australia is lagging behind other democracies when it comes to lobbying transparency. Countries such as Canada and the United Kingdom have far stricter regulations, including realtime public reporting of lobbying activities and independent regulators that actively enforce the rules. We should not settle for a system that is weaker than those of our democratic peers. The need for reform is not new. Calls to strengthen lobbying laws have been made repeatedly, yet successive governments have failed to take meaningful action. As I outlined in my dissenting report to the Senate inquiry into lobbyist access to Parliament House: The response to this inquiry shouldnt be another inquiry, it should be real action to fix a broken system sitting at the heart of our democracy. We cannot allow inertia to continue. Australians deserve a system where policy decisions are made in the open, where the public can see who is meeting with their representatives, and where Government officials are held to the highest standards of integrity. This Bill provides an infrastructure that allows Australians to scrutinise lobbying activities and decide for themselves whether lobbying activities are having too great an influence over the formation of our national policies. This Bill would allow Australians to look and see for themselves, in near realtime, at the actions of lobbyists. I urge my fellow Senators to support this legislation and take decisive action to reform our lobbying laws.

Leave granted. The speech read as follows— I am pleased to introduce the Constitution Alteration (Right to Free Speech) 2025, the purpose of which is to enshrine freedom of speech within the Australian Constitution. The proposed alteration will insert a new Chapter IIIA and section 80A in the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900. The new section will provide that the Commonwealth or a State must not make any law that limits the freedom of speech, including freedom of the press and other media. This Bill is urgently needed and will provide protection of a right that Australians assume they already have. That assumption is increasingly dangerous. While freedom of speech in this country is generally assumed, it is not guaranteed. Indeed, it is under perilous threat right now. Over the past decade the right of Australians to say what they think has increasingly come under attack. While Australian parliaments have made no effort to protect speech, they have passed laws—at state and federal level—to restrict freedom of speech. We are now at a point in this country where it is dangerous to openly say things that most people privately believe. Its a brave person, for example, who opines in public that men cannot become women. Is that really the kind of country we want to live in? A country in which stating simple biological truths puts a person in danger of being dragged before a tribunal to be interrogated for their words. It is time to provide a constitutional right for all Australians to say what they truly think. The Western world became prosperous by allowing, rather than censuring debate. Free speech is not a thing to be feared. Its a thing which should be embraced. Free speech is not something to protect people from, its something to be encouraged. The enlightenment was built on the ability of people to say what they honestly thought, even if it went against established norms. Indeed, it was the ability to challenge norms that made progress possible. But we now risk going backwards into a new dark age of restricted speech, where certain ideas—held sacrosanct by those in power—are beyond challenging. This bodes well for nobody. Without speech there is no expression of thought, it is no exaggeration to say that if people are not able to speak freely then they are not able to think freely. And that is the key issue here. Freedom of thought supposes freedom of speech. The two are indelibly linked. What good are all the other freedoms if people are not free to think independently of the state and to express those thoughts? Australia lacks, at a national level, entrenched protections of freedom of speech. Our role as elected representatives should be to provide and sustain that right. This bill, if successful will give the Australian people the power to vote in a referendum and determine just how important freedom of speech is to them. I believe the people will vote overwhelmingly in favour of free speech, because Australians may disagree on many issues, but we believe in a fair go and the right of everyone to voice their opinion without fear or favour. Our proposed alteration to the Constitution will protect freedom of expression along similar lines to the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America which provides that the Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press. The Australian Constitution already provides some express protection against legislative action by the Commonwealth. Section 116 says that the Parliament shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion.... In a similar way, our proposed protection for freedom of speech would reflect the assumption of all Australians that people have the right to express their thoughts with confidence and without fear of censure. Moreover, it would put a brake on efforts to supress freedom of speech that are, shockingly, becoming more and more common around the Western world including here in Australia. There shouldnt be a single Senator in this chamber who would say they were against freedom of speech. There shouldnt be a single Senator in this chamber who would say to their constituents, I want to make it more difficult for you and your family to express your opinions. We came to Canberra not to oppress our constituents but to defend and ensure their freedoms. This bill does that. And it is long overdue. I commend this Bill to the Senate.","Constitution Alteration (Right to Free Speech) 2025","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[5]","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," This amendment includes safeguards to stop the clock to account for reasonable delays, like for medical advice. If the commission does not determine the claim by the end of the consideration period, the commission is taken to have accepted the claim. Veterans who have to take their matters to the Veterans Review Board cant be represented by a lawyer. This is hugely unfair for some of them, and it flips all the power to the DVA staff, which are expert lawyers—the known enemy, as we like to call them, who do have access to legal representation before the hearing. My amendment attempts to level the playing field so veterans can get legal representation themselves when they go before the Veterans Review Board to plead their case. Its a nobrainer, and I reckon it gives the veterans a fair go. It also removes section 353L, which allows the Veterans Review Board to imprison a veteran for up to six months if they insult a person, interrupt proceedings, create a disturbance or cause contempt as part of their proceedings. We need to know as much as possible about the ongoing health and wellbeing of our veterans. That means research and data gathering.  The amendment responds to recommendations 114, 115 and 117 of the royal commission. It establishes an expert committee on veteran research made up of people with real skills and real experience. The amendment also requires the department to establish work plans to outline the immediate research priorities of the department in relation to health and wellbeing, longterm research goals and detailed actions to address gaps in the legislation. My amendments are not perfect, but they will go a hell of a long way to fixing the injustice that weve put up with for far too long, that is within the system and that has resulted in so many of your mates taking their lives. I ask everyone in this place to vote for my amendments. Veterans put their lives on the line for this country. The least that we can do is make sure that they are looked after during and beyond their service. I would also like to put on record the shocking and slow response the coalition displayed over nine years. They did everything they could to resist a royal commission. They were aided and abetted by the national RSL. They kept telling me and the veterans that there is nothing to see here. The National President of the RSL even went after JulieAnn Finney, accusing her of campaigning for a royal commission to assuage guilt for her failed relationship with her son. You, Mr Melick, subsequently apologised, but I have to ask why on earth this man is still the head of the national RSL. It is certainly not the request and it is not the want of every digger who has served and is serving. I would like to acknowledge the work of Minister Keogh and his willingness to work with me over the summer and over the past two years. I want to take some time here to make sure that the veterans know this: I cannot praise Minister Keogh enough. He has worked over the Christmas period with me. Hes given up time with his family. It has been very enduring of him to go through this with me for the past two years. He has carried tears behind closed doors. I want you to know that. He has, fair dinkum, put everything he possibly can into this, knowing we needed to get as much as we possibly could through before an election. We have done everything that we possibly can over the last eight weeks to get that national commissioner up and to start ticking off those royal commission recommendations. We cannot possibly have any hours left, between the minister and I, to do anything else that is left. We have nothing left. I just wanted you to know that Minister Keogh—over the last 10 years I have been up there, the revolving door of ministers has been an absolute shocker for you people—has put his heart and his soul into this, and I will pay credit where credit is due. I know, at times, that we have sat behind closed doors and cried together, and we have tried to do everything possible in the last eight weeks. I cannot thank you enough, from the bottom of my heart, Minister Keogh. I want you to know that. I want every veteran out there to know that, because nobody during the period of time Ive been up here has ever done what you have done or stood beside me. I want to thank the Prime Minister for giving me the extra staff member over the last two years. I want to thank you, Luke Brown. I dont think this will get you sacked. I want every veteran out there to know that assistant commissioner Luke Brown has saved many lives in the last two years, because, when this government came in, they gave me full access to Luke Brown. Im not sure if he works for DVA or Jacqui Lambie, but I cannot thank you enough, Luke. I cannot thank you enough. The pressure that you have taken off the people in my office has been absolutely remarkable. It has stopped being the revolving door for you veterans out there as well, and its caused a hell of a lot less harm to my office and the people working there in the last two years. Luke, thank you. Just to let you know, I have another six people I will need to come and see in the next day. Im sorry I didnt ring you Monday. Ill be in touch with you tomorrow, mate, but thank you. Finally, I would like to thank all the organisations, the veterans, the mothers and the families who have fought for the royal commission. I know it has taken it out of you. I know it has taken it out of me. I want to thank especially JulieAnn Finney and the other mums and the dads who have worked so tirelessly for many, many years, campaigning for veterans and the recommendations of the royal commission. JulieAnn, I want you to know that your son would be so proud of you. I know the royal commissioners. You were shaken, and I know that you have been moved by the testimony from so many. I know that has been extremely harmful to you, and I want to thank you for going through that and doing everything you could for us. Nothing can compensate for the pain and the loss of losing your child, and that is the burden of military service that many parents and many families will have to carry with them for the rest of their lives. The passage of this bill wont fix everything, but the speed of the government response is now down to you. To you, Matt, once again, thank you. I know that we have tried to rush this through, and Im pretty sure weve got it right—weve got to be damn close—but there is still a lot of work to be done. There are still over 120 recommendations to be put through as quickly as possible. We have worked hard in my office over the last eight years to do as much as we possibly can to fix the DVA and Defence. Like I said, it has taken a toll on my staff, and Ive lost some of them along the way. To my staff, thank you, once again, for your commitment to the veterans over the last eight years. I thank all of you. I am up for reelection this year, and I am hoping that Tasmanians will give me another six years, but if they dont I want the veteran community to know that I will always stand beside you. I want you to stay vigilant. You will need to keep holding Defence, the Department of Veterans Affairs and, most importantly, the government to account. You must do that. I want you service organisations to listen to me—listen very carefully. There are a lot of you out there; there are thousands. I want you to stop fighting with each other, because it is not helpful. You are not standing together as one, so you have no strength. You have a national RSL that is useless; we know that, but if you service organisations continue to fight with each other and bicker with each other, you will continue to not save lives. Dealing with you makes my job up here very difficult, and you are not being fair to your mates. If you are part of an organisation and you fall out with your mates, dont go and start another one. It has not been helpful. I know that many of you in these organisations are also physically and psychologically damaged. I know your patience only goes so far. I also know that for many, many years you have been fighting a government that has destroyed you. I know that, but the biggest enemy that I have right now and that we, the veterans out there, have right now is you, because you wont come together as one. For Gods sake, even the Vietnam veterans worked it out. They only split into two groups, not thousands. That has been extremely harmful to us. I want you to go away and think about that. I want to see you guys have one group, one union. Thats where you should be—and that is what our national RSL should have been. It has failed us, but it has taken great delight over the years in watching us chew each other up for breakfast. Oh, theyve loved it! I beg you to recognise that you will only become a force again if you come together as one. You must come together as one. You have to do that today. Then we will get what we want. But, until you do that, you will make the fight harder. I want you to go away and have a good think about that. Surely one of you is big enough to say, The rest of us are not doing our job, and we need to come together as one. I dont even care what you call us, but bring us together because it gives us more power and it gives us more might. Then we can help our own. That is how it works. Sometimes I know it feels like two steps forward and one step back. But, whenever I have felt defeated, the resilience and the strength of you, even in the chaos you are in—that service organisation community has got me through. I want to make sure that you know that. I want to thank all of you for helping me along the way. There are some who have, along the way, thrown names at me and others out there, and it has been very unhelpful. But I think Ive said enough about service organisations out there. All Im asking you to do, in my last minute, is to go away and think about where you are, because what you are doing in thousands of groups out there, how youve all separated, is not helpful. It is not helpful to saving your mates.  One Nation supports measures to simplify veterans entitlements. At the moment, it seems to many veterans that they need to be a lawyer just to receive entitlements that should be easily accessible. In this government bill, the Veterans Entitlements, Treatment and Support (Simplification and Harmonisation) Bill 2024, its difficult to say whether the governments proposal will meet veterans needs for clarity and ease until we see the legislation put into action, when the guidance filters its way through to the service agents. As the saying goes, the proof will be in the pudding. Were willing to give the government the benefit of the doubt when it comes to converting three acts, 2,000 pages of legislation and more than 800 legislative instruments into one act. As other senators have mentioned, its not rare for veterans to have claims under all three separate acts. This obviously needs desperate change. Throughout this process, we do not want to see any veterans worse off. One Nation notes with concern submissions that state some changes may have the intention of easier administration not achieving the veterans full entitlements. Thats a deep concern. Well be supporting the amendments codifying the Senates intent that no veteran is left worse off after this bills passage. In relation to the governments amendment on sheet ED101, weve received concerns from the Families of Veterans Guild, as have many other senators, Im sure. Ill read them out so that theyre on the record from the impressively confident chief executive officer of the Families of Veterans Guild on this government amendment to its own bill. Why is the government having so many amendments? The letter is as follows: After being alerted to the amendment, Ive read through the detail and have a number of concerns with it which are as follows: There has been no public announcement or public communication from the Department of Defence or Veterans Affairs about it, and as a result there has been no consultation with the veteran community regarding its content. This amendment proposes a significant structural change to the Defence and Veteran system in Australia. It is arguably a Bill in its own right, and ought to be treated as such. Our view is that it ought to be introduced as an amendment to the Defence Act 1903 and debated accordingly. Instead, it is being added on to the VETS Bill in order to be rushed through the parliament— Here we go again, Labor rushing. She continues with No. 2: The intent of the VETS Bill is to harmonise the legislative frameworks that govern the provision of veteran entitlements and supports, it is not to make fundamental structural changes to the veteran system. That is a separate issue— She says. She goes on to No. 3: The object outlined in the amendment, improve suicide prevention, is extremely broad, unclear, and lacks any insight into tangible work that will be done to achieve the objective. This objective requires significant work to be more specific, focusing on issues we know are challenges in the veteran community like reducing the incidents and rate of suicide among the Defence and Veteran population, and improving the effectiveness of suicide prevention initiatives within this community. The amendment outlines that the commission only needs to provide two public reports on the status of the implementation of the Royal Commissions recommendations. This isnt good enough. The reason the concept of the independent body outlined in the amendment received initial support from the veteran community was because for too long recommendations from previous inquiries have been shelved. 700+ recommendations which could have resulted in better health and wellbeing outcomes for veterans and their families were left to collect dust. The amendment ought to compel the commission to report annually to the Parliament, the veteran community, and the Australian public on the status of the Royal Commissions recommendations until such time as they are implemented and their effectiveness evaluated. She goes on, under No. 5: The amendment provides the Minister with the power to direct the Commissioner to conduct an inquiry. However, before the Commissioner reports to the Minister (at which point the report is to be tabled) the Minister may vary or withdraw the request. Does this mean the inquiry results are never made public? This point must be clarified. In No. 6, she says: The amendment outlines that the commission can inquire into the entire Defence ecosystem but doesnt define what that is. With the amendment providing significant powers to the proposed commission, this must be defined understood and consulted. As it stands, the authority this commission would have could affect more than 5,000 nonprofit organisations in Australia who provide support to veterans. She says, under No. 7: Veteran families once again are omitted from this amendment, other than a mention that they will be listened to. The Royal Commission highlighted the important role of veteran families and the significantly implications (including related to mental health) that service and suicide have on them, yet they are excluded from the commissions remit. Will it require a Royal Commission into the ill health, wellbeing and high suicide rates amongst veteran families before they are taken seriously by their government? Its a good question shes asking. Under our expectations, she says: The Families of Veterans Guild supports the establishment of an independent body to oversee the defence and veteran system and the implementation of the Royal Commissions recommendations. However, it fundamentally disagrees with rushing an unconsulted amendment through parliament which could have significant consequences for the system, and the communities within it. She goes on: The Guilds expectations were set by the Minister in his media release on the appointment of the interim Commissioner— where the minister said: Mr Manthorpe will head the organisation and work across government to deliver the establishment of a legislated oversight body by September 2025. As part of the Albanese Governments response to the Royal Commission, we have committed $9.5 million of funding, as part of MYEFO, to support its implementation, including: $5 million over two years to fund the appointment of the Interim Head of the Defence and Veterans Service Commission, and to establish a crossagency taskforce to provide advice to Government— thats the end of the ministers quote. She goes on: We expected DVA and Defence to therefore consult with those who could and would be impacted by this amendment. That hasnt happened. She said, We are especially shocked by this, considering the unwillingness of the minister and the Department of Veterans Affairs to support and implement amendments to the vets bill aimed at removing archaic and offensive language, due to concerns it would hold up passage of the bill. Yet an amendment which does bring cost implications and hasnt been consulted on is deemed acceptable. This is the last paragraph: Wed like to see this amendment withdrawn so that it can go through the proper process, including consultation, to ensure it is fit for purpose and reduces the risk of having unintended consequences on and within the defence and veteran community. That quote is from the letter from the Families of Veterans Guild, and thats where it ends. One Nation is greatly concerned that the government is operating this way and dropping significant changes on the Senate suddenly. We wont even get time to discuss the bills tonight. We will be voting against this amendment because of those concerns and the lack of consultation.  In rising to speak on this bill today, I wish to first and foremost express my continued gratitude to Australias veterans community for their service to our country. The Albanese government accepted and took swift action on the first recommendation of the interim report of the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide to simplify and harmonise the legislation governing compensation, rehabilitation and other supports for veterans and families so that they can not only access the support that they need and deserve but receive it in a timely manner. Under the current legislative model, veterans entitlements are determined under one or more of three primary compensation acts: the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004, known as the MRCA; the Veterans Entitlements Act 1986, known as the VEA; and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (DefenceRelated Claims) Act 1988, known as the DRCA. Which act or acts apply to a veteran depends on when they served and which period or periods of services caused or contributed to the condition being claimed. The Veterans Entitlements, Treatment and Support (Simplification and Harmonisation) Bill 2024, known as the VETS bill, modifies the current triact legislative framework by providing for all claims for compensation and rehabilitation received from 1 July 2026 to be determined under an enhanced MRCA. In essence, the changes in this bill will make it easier for veterans and families to know what they are entitled to, make it simpler for advocates to assist veterans and their families with those claims, and make it quicker for DVA to process claims so veterans and families get the benefits that they need and deserve in a timely way. The government will also propose three amendments following the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee inquiry into this bill, the release of the final report of the royal commission, advocacy from the veterans community and consultation with the opposition, the Jacqui Lambie Network and the Australian Greens. The first amendment provides for a Senate foreign affairs and defence committee to initiate a review of the enhanced MRCA, to be conducted 12 months after the act commences. The second allows for apportionment of payments to veterans with severe impairment in relation to their children under section 80 of the MRCA. And the third amendment implements the governments response to recommendation 122 of the royal commissions final report by establishing an independent body, headed by a commissioner, to provide advice and oversight on reducing deaths by suicide in the Defence and veterans community. Id also like to take this opportunity to offer additional information for senators following debate. The government notes the concerns expressed by the opposition regarding the statementofprinciples system, known as SOPS, and the role of the Repatriation Medical Authority. However, it should be underscored that the royal commission examined this matter and did not recommend a change to this feature of the military compensation system. I would also note that the VETS bill will actually add flexibility to the SOP arrangements by introducing two new liability tests that do not rely on the SOPS—namely, the presumptive liability arrangements and temporal connection to being on duty, both of which were noted by senators earlier in the debate. Furthermore, the current flexibility under section 340 of the MRCA will be retained, which permits the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission to determine its own SOPS outside the RMA process where warranted. Regardless of these improvements, I would note in this context that, under the MRCA, using the SOP system, the acceptance rate for liability claims sits at 80 per cent or higher on an annual basis. This system ensures that sound medical and scientific evidence is applied consistently, fairly and equitably in the assessment of veterans claims, with no need for further review of these beneficial arrangements. With respect to comments made that the bill results in modest improvements for veterans and minor bureaucratic improvements only, I would note that the passage of the bill would result in an additional $222 million being provided to veterans and their families in the form of increased compensation and health care in the first two years of operation alone, with ongoing support beyond this period. In addition to these increased levels of compensation and treatment, it was acknowledged that this legislation will make the veterans system easier for veterans and their families to navigate, ensuring they receive the care and support they need more quickly. As mentioned, this bill implements the very first recommendation of the royal commissions interim report. Clearly, the royal commission, in prioritising this recommendation, viewed it as resulting in more than just minor bureaucratic improvements and saw harmonising and simplifying veterans legislation as intrinsically linked to the issues of suicide and veterans wellbeing. The level of support expressed for this bill by exservice organisations and the veteran community more broadly would indicate that they see these changes being of real and tangible benefit to them also. Finally, as this bill was still before the parliament when the government delivered its formal response to the final report of the royal commission on 2 December 2024, and recognising the urgency that veterans attach to recommendation 122 to establish an ongoing, independent body to provide advice and oversight on reducing deaths by suicide in the defence and veteran community, we have taken this opportunity to legislate to implement this recommendation as a priority, and I will speak further on the government amendments shortly, should time permit. The Albanese Labor government is committed to continuously improving and adapting to the needs of current and former serving Australian Defence Force personnel and families. I acknowledge Minister Keogh, who was here in the chamber earlier. I know that he has worked hard on this historic reform, but I know, too, how much he has valued those whove advocated for reform and, especially, those who participated in and bravely shared their experiences with the royal commission. The government also acknowledges the partnership we have been able to form with Senator Lambie, and we thank her for her advocacy, her constructive approach and her dedication to veterans and their families. This is an historic reform. It will benefit veterans and their families for generations to come. I commend the bill to the Senate.","Veterans Entitlements, Treatment and Support (Simplification and Harmonisation) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator LAMBIE (Tasmania) ","(17:18):"

There being no objection, it is so ordered.  I have a statement, so Ill just give my statement. This is somewhat unusual, so it could be a learning experience for some. According to the statement of reasons for the government amendments on sheet ZA257, amendment (3) is covered by section 53 of the Constitution because it changes the destination of money appropriated by section 423 of the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004. This reflects the advice to the government from the parliamentary counsel, but the Clerks view is that this does not accord with the precedents of the Senate. The third paragraph of section 53 provides: The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. This has relevantly been taken to mean that the Senate may not amend a bill to increase the proposed expenditure under a standing appropriation. However, the amendment in question does not have that effect. Quick and Garran, in their commentaries on the Constitution, say: … the Senate is only forbidden to amend [bills imposing taxation] and the annual appropriation bill; it may amend two kinds of expenditure bills … those for permanent and extraordinary appropriations … The Senate may amend such money bills so as to reduce the total amount of expenditure or to change the method, object and destination of the expenditure, but not to increase the total expenditure originated in the House of Representatives. This position is set out at page 671. The advice of the Clerk, which is set out on the amendment sheet, is that the amendment deals only with the apportionment of expenditure and does not change the total proposed expenditure under the standing appropriation in section 423 of the act. This is highlighted by the note to proposed subsection 80A(2), which makes it clear that the sum of amounts paid to persons cannot exceed the amount the Commonwealth is liable to pay in respect of an eligible person, which is itself a capped amount. I have considered the views of the parliamentary counsel and the Clerk and consider that the Clerks view is consistent with the precedents of the Senate. I therefore rule that the amendment should be framed as an amendment, not a request. Its purely of a technical nature, but we wont be making requests to the other House. We will be amending as we see fit.","Veterans Entitlements, Treatment and Support (Simplification and Harmonisation) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[2]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","The CHAIR ","(17:56):"

(4) Without limiting subsection (3), the criteria or other requirements specified may relate to the circumstances surrounding legal responsibility or other arrangements for the care of the eligible young person or child. ______ P ARLIAMENTARY COUNSEL Statement of reasons: why certain amendments should be moved as requests Section 53 of the Constitution is as follows: Powers of the Houses in respect of legislation 53. Proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys, or imposing taxation, shall not originate in the Senate. But a proposed law shall not be taken to appropriate revenue or moneys, or to impose taxation, by reason only of its containing provisions for the imposition or appropriation of fines or other pecuniary penalties, or for the demand or payment or appropriation of fees for licences, or fees for services under the proposed law. The Senate may not amend proposed laws imposing taxation, or proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government. The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. The Senate may at any stage return to the House of Representatives any proposed law which the Senate may not amend, requesting, by message, the omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein. And the House of Representatives may, if it thinks fit, make any of such omissions or amendments, with or without modifications. Except as provided in this section, the Senate shall have equal power with the House of Representatives in respect of all proposed laws. Amendment (3) The effect of this amendment is to change the persons to whom additional amounts under section 80 of the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 are payable. The amendment is covered by section 53 because it changes the destination of money appropriated by section 423 of the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004. ______ Statement by the Clerk of the Senate pursuant to the order of the Senate of 26 June 2000 Amendment (3) According to the statement of reasons for the government amendments on sheet ZA257, amendment (3) is covered by section 53 of the Constitution because it changes the destination of money appropriated by section 423 of the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004. This does not accord with the precedents of the Senate. The third paragraph of section 53 provides that: The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. This has relevantly been taken to mean that the Senate may not amend a bill to increase the proposed expenditure under a standing appropriation. The amendment in question does not have that effect. The amendment deals only with the apportionment of expenditure and does not change the total proposed expenditure under the standing appropriation in section 423 of the Act This is highlighted by the note to proposed subsection 80A(2), which makes it clear that the sum of amounts paid to persons cannot exceed the amount the Commonwealth is liable to pay in respect of an eligible person, which itself is a capped amount. It is therefore in accordance with the precedents of the Senate for the amendment to be treated as an amendment, rather than a request. This is the same approach that the Senate took in relation to the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility Bill 2016. _____ SHEET ED101—Amendment (1) Clause 2, page 2 (at the end of the table), add: 8.

Proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys, or imposing taxation, shall not originate in the Senate. But a proposed law shall not be taken to appropriate revenue or moneys, or to impose taxation, by reason only of its containing provisions for the imposition or appropriation of fines or other pecuniary penalties, or for the demand or payment or appropriation of fees for licences, or fees for services under the proposed law. The Senate may not amend proposed laws imposing taxation, or proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government. The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. The Senate may at any stage return to the House of Representatives any proposed law which the Senate may not amend, requesting, by message, the omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein. And the House of Representatives may, if it thinks fit, make any of such omissions or amendments, with or without modifications. Except as provided in this section, the Senate shall have equal power with the House of Representatives in respect of all proposed laws. Amendment (2) The effect of this amendment is to establish the office of the Defence and Veterans Service Commissioner, a new public office within the meaning of Part II of the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973. It is covered by section 53 because it will increase the amount of expenditure out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund under the standing appropriation in subsection 7(13) of that Act. ______ Statement by the Clerk of the Senate pursuant to the order of the Senate of 26 June 2000 Amendment (2) If the effect of the amendment is to increase the amount of expenditure under subsection 7(13) of the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973, then it is in accordance with the precedents of the Senate that the amendment be moved as a request. I will provide a brief explanation of each of these. The government does seek to bring forward three additional amendments, as I indicated in my second reading contribution, and the decision to do so follows the Senate inquiry into this bill, the release of the final report of the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide, the advocacy from the veterans community, and consultation with the opposition, the Jacqui Lambie Network and the Australian Greens. The government moves an amendment on sheet ZA257 where a new provision is to be inserted to provide for a Senate foreign affairs and defence committee to initiate a review on the VETS bill changes, to be conducted 12 months after the act commences. There will be broad scope to review all aspects of the reform, specifically how well the changes to the legislation framework have been implemented in the evolution of the veterans compensation and support system, and the intent is to provide an assurance mechanism that the objectives are being achieved and the processes and functions are performing in line with community expectations. We consider that having a review scheduled in advance through legislation demonstrates the governments commitment to transparency, accountability and responsiveness. The second government amendment, which is on the same sheet, ZA257, relates to one of the changes originally proposed in the bill, relating to lumpsum payments to veterans with severe impairment in relation to their children under section 80 of the MRCA. This compensation is for the additional financial strain of raising children impacted by the service of their veteran parent. The lump sum is currently paid to the veteran regardless of which parent has actual parental responsibilities for the child or children. The VETS bill initially set out changes to allow the lump sum to be paid to the primary carer of the child, which may be the veteran or another person. Feedback on the bill highlighted that the original drafting limited payment to only one parent, rather than allowing for apportionment based on actual caring and family arrangements. In response to this feedback, the government proposes that the VETS bill be amended to account for all combinations of caring arrangements in veterans families and provide for the lump sum to be apportioned where necessary. An instrumentmaking power will be inserted for the Repatriation Commission to prescribe the criteria and requirements for determining the payees as well as their share of the compensation amount, in a manner similar to other government payments, such as family tax benefit and DVA education allowance payments under the MRCA. The revised approach, to be reflected in section 80 of the MRCA, recognises that there are varying caring arrangements that may apply in the community and ensures there is appropriate flexibility to provide support to separated families. The final government amendments, on sheet ED101, are proposed in response to recommendation 122 of the final report from the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide. As this bill was still before the parliament when the government delivered our formal response to the final report, on 2 December 2024, and, recognising the urgency veterans attach to this recommendation, were taking this opportunity to legislate to implement this recommendation as a priority. I spoke a little about this in my second reading contribution, but I note also that the government has recently announced the appointment of Mr Michael Manthorpe PSM as the interim head of the Defence and Veterans Services Commission, to commence work on getting the commission up and running. The interim commissioner will also be able to advise government before the statutory role commences in September 2025, as recommended by the royal commission, on any improvements to this legislation that may be required. As the senators would be aware, the government has already established a taskforce in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet which will draw on expertise from across government as well as external experts to consider matters of detailed implementation of the governments response to the final report, including further work regarding recommendations that were noted. The independence of the commissioner is assured by the ability to always conduct an inquiry of their own volition regardless of any direction of the minister. The remit of the commissioner follows that which was set by the royal commission, including the use of the term ecosystem, which is deliberately broad and not confined by further definition but would include nongovernment organisations, such as exservice organisations and service providers, as well as defence and veteran families in the context of the overall purpose and functions of the commission, with a systems view of defence and veteran suicide prevention and wellbeing. Implementing the governments response to the royal commission will result in the most comprehensive reform ever undertaken to the culture, systems and processes across the Department of Defence, the Australian Defence Force and the Department of Veterans Affairs to prevent suicide and improve mental health and wellbeing of serving personnel and of veterans. I thank all of those who have worked productively with the government on this bill—the opposition, the Jacqui Lambie Network, the Australian Greens and their staff—and I thank you also for recognising the significance of this bill. The transformative reforms in this bill are only possible because of the support and the engagement that has been received from all sides of politics. And, again, I acknowledge the significance of supporting our service personnel, our veterans and their families. I thank those veterans, veteran families, exservice organisations and experts who have contributed to the development of this legislation. It will benefit the veteran community for generations to come, and I commend these amendments to the Senate.","Veterans Entitlements, Treatment and Support (Simplification and Harmonisation) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[2]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[3]","N/A","N/A"

While we support the governments amendments, we are moving these amendments to include a review, should it pass, of the veterans commissioner to be. The reason why we believe this review must take place is that their amendment, which would add schedule 9 to the Veterans Entitlements, Treatment and Support (Simplification and Harmonisation) Bill 2024, has come about at the last minute. There has been a lack of consultation. The veterans community was taken by surprise when they read about their amendment. The veterans community has been engaged from the outset of developing this bill. They have participated in good faith. They participated in the recent Senate inquiry into the substantive bill, at which time this commissioner was not foreshadowed. At that point in time, the veterans community understood that an interim commissioner had been appointed who would work on developing a framework for a legislated commission to be in place by September this year. Their amendment fasttracks that process and puts the cart before the horse, so to speak, and veterans have not been consulted. Veterans are gravely concerned about what it means and how it will be rolled out. So, briefly, we are moving these amendments to ensure that the Senate can undertake the due diligence and scrutiny that should have happened with an amendment of this scale. I commend our amendments to the amendment to the chamber.","Veterans Entitlements, Treatment and Support (Simplification and Harmonisation) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[2]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator DAVEY (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate) ","(18:05):"
"0","0","0","1","1","MemberContinuation","121628","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," For clarity, I simply want to indicate that, as I understand it, we are presently debating the amendments on ZA257, 3322 and also ED101, and I just want to confirm that that is a shared understanding across the chamber.   Ill speak to that bevy of amendments. To be clear, the Greens are grateful for the ministers consultation in terms of the review. We think that its important that the review be undertaken almost in real time as these amendments are being rolled out. The original proposition was to have a review which would happen significantly after the commencement of the act. The amendments on sheet ZA257, moved by the government, will see the review begin as soon as practicable and within a period of no more than 12 months after the act commences. It is almost certain, with legislation this complex, that there will be unintended consequences. We think picking them up as early as possible is critically important. We note the breadth of the review proposed to be run by one of the Senate standing committees on foreign affairs, defence and trade, and, again, were grateful for the government engaging with us and with veterans and listening. We think this review will be both timely and essential. When it comes to the oppositions amendments—we will end up supporting them, on balance—part of the difficulty weve confronted is that there will then be multiple reviews running, potentially, in parallel. Remember that separate to this we also have the process being undertaken by Mr Manthorpe, whos been engaged by the government to consider what the commission should look like, in implementing recommendation 122 of the royal commission. Since the engagement of Mr Manthorpe, weve now had the governments amendments to form schedule 9, which will institute the commission. So we have these amendments, which we will end up supporting, to institute a commission for oversight, in accordance with recommendation 122; well have Mr Manthorpe engaging in a process of determining what that commission should look like; and well have the review, by one of the Senate committees for foreign affairs, defence and trade, into what the commission should look like and how recommendation 122 should be implemented. Then well also have that Senate standing committee do the broader review some 12 months after the commencement of the act. I think cooperation between the different parties and the government will be desperately needed in the new parliament to ensure these processes arent tripping over each other and to ensure were not putting veterans through multiple different parallel processes. The committees review of the commission, I think, is essential. How that works with Mr Manthorpes review, I think, is going to have to be a work in progress. Well have to make that happen. The broader review of the amending bill itself is also essential. I want to say clearly to those veterans who are somewhat confused about the multiple hounds running off at the same time as a result of these different reviews that I accept your confusion and I understand why youre confused. I think we all have an obligation to make sure these processes are not tripping over each other and to ensure, as best as possible, that common submissions can be considered and, if possible, that the two reviews run by the standing committee dont replicate the work but are focused and dont put veterans through unnecessary process.","Veterans Entitlements, Treatment and Support (Simplification and Harmonisation) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[2]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p","Senator McALLISTER (New South Wales—Minister for Emergency Management and Minister for Cities) ","(18:08):"

"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," Pursuant to the contingent notice standing in my name, I move:  That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent further consideration of the bills without limitation of time. I know its a pain when the crossbench does this, but I think Australians probably need to know whats happening here. We have record numbers of Australians being scammed, yet were having the Scams Prevention Framework Bill 2025 just rushed through this place. The crossbenchers havent even had time to get amendments drafted. Is that what we want our democracy to be? I find this extraordinary. The coalition need to have a good hard look at themselves. Senator Dean Smith, from the great state of Western Australia, engaged in the Senate inquiry in good faith. Anyone watching would have seen the probing questions he asked. The coalition put in a very good set of comments and recommendations. Then, it seems, his party said: Great work, Dean, but do you know what? We dont care. We dont care what the evidence says, what was tendered to the committee or what youre recommending, because were just going to roll over. Were going to do a deal on electoral reform and were going to ram through scams legislation. This is scams legislation that is so undercooked! Anyone paying attention in the Senate committee process would have heard experts and consumer groups say, This is legislation that is stacked in the interests of the banks. I find it astounding that on such a big issue we have a lack of evidence based policy. Were told: Weve got to get this legislation through. It doesnt matter that if its not going to be effective. It doesnt matter if the codes wont come into effect for ages. Its urgent. To the coalition: after your additional comments in the report, it is disgraceful that youre happy to put this bill through unamended. I think it shows real disrespect to Australians. Ive met so many people who have lost hundreds of dollars, thousands of dollars, tens of thousands of dollars or hundreds of thousands of dollars. Some have lost millions of dollars. And you guys are happy to just give them the middle finger and say: Well, heres some scams legislation. Its better than nothing. The Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman has called the bill in its current form unworkable. The crossbench had briefings with the peak consumer groups, and they said, In its current form, this does not work for Australians and should not pass. They engaged in good faith. The crossbench have tried to engage in good faith, and you have put us in a position where we cant even get our amendments drafted. The crossbench has raised concerns about drafting resources in this place many times. It doesnt seem to have improved. The poor drafters in there are working their arses off, and you wont give them extra resources. I hope Australians see this for what it is: disrespecting our democracy by not allowing elected representatives to at least engage in a debate. We have had no second reading speeches, no time for committee process and no time to even get amendments drafted for this, and why? The codes that hold everything in this legislation havent even been drafted. Were told that it will take a very long time to develop them. I wasnt that surprised when Minister Jones put forward legislation that looked like it had been drafted by Anna Bligh and the Australian Banking Association. I honestly wasnt surprised. What I was surprised by was the coalition, after engaging in good faith—as I said, Senator Dean Smith does excellent work in this Senate, at estimates and in committees. But you dont care. At the end of the day, its selfinterest and vested interest. Australians deserve better. I dont understand why youre doing this.  We will not be supporting the suspension motion. We allowed time for consideration of those bills in the motion today, but obviously senators were keen to debate veterans entitlements legislation, which I acknowledge a huge amount of work has gone into, and we are in the middle of that right now. Can I just also add that the comments from Senator Pocock about the scam legislation are offensive, and there is noone in this country who has done more to protect people from scams than Minister Jones. He has spent years on this—years and years of attending forums, consulting with people and working with stakeholders—and for you to diminish that and say that hes done this in the pursuit of selfinterest is absolutely offensive. From time to time, we need to get things done in this Senate. That was how the Senate resolved on this procedural motion today. I move: That the question be now put.

Australian Greens  circulated amendment— SHEET 3285 (1) Schedule 1, page 21 (after line 6), after item 66, insert: 66A After Part 6 of Chapter 11 Insert: Part 6A — Review 438A Review of meaning of warlike service (1) The Minister must cause an independent review to be conducted into whether it is appropriate for the meaning of the expression warlike service in section 6 to include peacekeeping service, including in areas of high risk and local or regional instability. (2) The review must make provision for public consultation. (3) The review must start as soon as practicable after the commencement of this section. (4) The persons who conduct the review must give the Minister a written report of the review within 6 months of the commencement of the review.

As the effect of the amendment is to increase the number of individuals who would be eligible to be provided with Commonwealthfunded treatment, the amendment is likely to increase expenditure under the standing appropriation in section 49 of the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests and British Commonwealth Occupation Force (Treatment) Act 2006.

(2B) The Minister must, by legislative instrument, specify one or more kinds of professional services for the purposes of paragraph (2A)(c). (2C) The first instrument made under subsection (2B) must be made by the end of the period of 12 months beginning on the day this subsection commences. _____ Statement pursuant to the order of the Senate of 26 June 2000 Amendment (1) Amendment (1) is framed as a request because it amends the bill to increase the kinds of professional services in relation to which a Medicare benefit is payable. Specifically, it would require payments in relation to certain services provided to people in prison or recently released from prison. The amendment would therefore increase the amount of Medicare benefit payments made from the Medicare Guarantee Fund (Health) Special Account. As the effect of this amendment is to increase payments made from the Medicare Guarantee Fund (Health) Special Account, it will increase expenditure under the standing appropriation in section 80 of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 or in certain circumstances the standing appropriation in section 18 of the Medicare Guarantee Act 2017. Statement by the Clerk of the Senate pursuant to the order of the Senate of 26 June 2000 Amendment (1) If the effect of the amendment is to increase expenditure under a standing appropriation, then it is in accordance with the precedents of the Senate that the amendment be moved as a request. _____ SHEET 3268 (1) Schedule 2, page 44 (after line 28), after the heading specifying National Health Act 1953, insert: 16A After subsection 100(1) Insert: (1AA) Without limiting subsection (1), the Minister must, by legislative instrument, make special arrangements for, or in relation to, providing that an adequate supply of pharmaceutical benefits will be available to persons who are in prison or another place of detention.

"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I rise to speak on the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Reform) Bill 2024. This bill responds to this parliaments inquiry, conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, into the 2022 election. An inquiry into our electoral laws is conducted after every election, which is right and proper. These inquiries consider both the performance of the electoral system and its legislation following an electoral event and whether changes are required to keep our electoral regulations consistent with the current and practices. These inquiries are conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and are some of the most indepth and detailed work of the parliament. I want to thank my colleague Senator McGrath, a veteran of this committee over several parliaments, for his work in contributing to the committees deliberations.  The bill that was introduced by the government last year seeks to implement recommendations from that committees work, which the assistant minister referred to as being multipartisan—but not multipartisan in the agreement of the recommendations of that the committee and its inquiry. Coalition members of that committee reflected our positions when they provided a dissenting report to that committees work on several occasions. As coalition members stated, the coalition believes that any proposed electoral changes should support our system of fair, open and transparent elections which treat all political participants equally. Our system must encourage political participation that protects freedoms of speech, belief, association and thought. No participant should have fear of retribution for their belief or their support. The coalition believes those who join or actively support political parties, like those who support civil society movements or notforprofit organisations, do so on the basis of sincerely held beliefs and a genuine desire to participate in their democratic society. Members of established political parties are not less worthy than those who support other forms of political campaigning, movements or civil causes. Changes to regulations at federal and state levels of government have increased the regulatory burden on political parties, making it harder for grassroots participation. This is not a good outcome for democratic participation in Australia. Financially stable political parties with active membership representing the broad political spectrum are important foundations for a healthy democracy. The governing legislative and regulatory framework for political parties should ultimately encourage grassroots participation, not make it harder. This bill looks to implement recommendations 1 to 10 of the joint standing committees interim report that was tabled in June 2023. Recommendation 1 proposed to lower the disclosure threshold of donations to $1,000. As the coalition stated in the response to the committees report, we are concerned there must be a balance between privacy and transparency. Weve seen the political intimidation by some in the community recently and often on the offices of parliamentarians. Any threshold should not be a discouragement to participation in the electoral system, where there is any fear of intimidation or retribution from the publication of the support of political parties or particular candidates. The Grattan Institute argued for a higher threshold of $5,000, noting this important balance. They stated that this would protect the privacy of small donors and keep administrative costs manageable, while ensuring that all donations that are big enough to matter are on the public record. The opposition notes that the government has taken on board many concerns of the proposed changes, including that of the Grattan Institute, and will move to amend the bill to raise the threshold to $5,000. The opposition supports this change, noting that it is a sensible compromise and acknowledging that the Prime Minister himself has advocated for a threshold of $1,000 for some time. Recommendations 4, 5 and 6 of the interim report are also reflected in the bills schedules. These propose to introduce donations, known in the legislation as gifts, and expenditure caps to the electoral system. The bill originally proposed to introduce a donation cap of $20,000 each year, indexed annually, which would apply to an individual donor whether they are a person or an entity. On expenditure, the bill proposes to introduce a cap of $90 million for each political party, and a cap of $800,000 would apply to expenditure by any party or candidate in an individual electorate. A Senate cap would apply for a state or territory that will be valued at the number of electorates in that jurisdiction. The key concern for coalition members through the process of the committees inquiry on this matter was that caps be applied fairly and equitably. The ability to set caps of donations for the Commonwealth system, which has never had this limitation, is new ground and may well require review. The opposition notes that the government is intending to move amendments that will lift this cap to $50,000, and we will support this change. Another important aspect of the governments legislation is that it will capture political entities outside parties and candidates. As Professor George Williams stated on the potential loopholes with caps when he appeared before the joint standing committee: Unless we actually have a holistic regime, people will set up the equals, whether they be charities, third parties or the like. We need to make sure that they are equally covered with appropriate caps, disclosure and the like. Otherwise, well just end up with the electoral fundraising and the fight moving from parties to third parties. We welcome the review of the government that these caps should also apply to significant third parties, associated entities and third parties who will be subject to expenditure of $11.25 million annually, with other limits at electorate, state and territory levels. Recommendations 2, 3 and 7 of JSCEMs inquiry are being implemented through measures to implement faster disclosure timeframes. These also alter the definition of a gift under the electoral law and establish a system of common accounting for Commonwealth campaign accounts. These recommendations were all supported in principle by the coalition members, and we see merit in these as improvements to the current systems integrity. The opposition notes that these changes will not take effect until after the upcoming election. This may enable further issues to be considered by the next parliament. The government has worked with all parties and members, including the opposition, to improve this legislation. While this is not the electoral reform that we would have brought forward, and while some parts do remain of concern, we note and appreciate that the amendments that have been brought forward address the concerns around the potential impacts of the proposed laws. Our electoral system and our electoral legislation is complex and intricate. Changes should rightly be made with care, and the devil is always in the detail. I want to thank the minister and his staff for working constructively to remove as many of those devils as could be found. In particular, I want to thank the ministers chief of staff, Ben Rillo, and the department for working through dense and complex drafting. If youd indulge me, Id also like to thank opposition staff who have worked on this legislation, particularly those out of my own office and that of Senator McGraths, particularly Hughston Parle and John Harris. Id also particularly like to thank those staff from the leaders office, who have put in long hours to check and recheck the implications of this bill, in particular Michelle Hutchinson and Mike Horner. This legislation represents some very significant changes to the electoral system in Australia, and, like all changes, theyve been made in good faith with a bipartisan approach to ensure that our electoral system remains, to the extent that it ever can be, above politics.  Well, finally, the jig is up. We see many, many months of negotiations that both of the major parties denied having culminating in a very cosy little arrangement that suits both of them quite nicely. Its one of the ironies of this appallingly bad process that we didnt see an inquiry happen into this incredibly detailed, 400page bill. But I think the greatest irony is that we still have not seen the detail of that deal, the stitchup that was just finally landed by Mr Albanese and Mr Dutton, who are BFFs on this matter. It is 7.33 pm, we are to vote on this in 2½ hours, and we still have not seen the amendments. This is absolute insanity. Ive seen some pretty shabby process in my time here since 2011, but I reckon this one takes the cake. We are debating a bill where there has been a stitchup, and they still wont tell us what the stitchup is. They still havent even circulated the amendments that theyve been working on for these long hours, as Senator Hume describes. Meanwhile, the minister has spent more time telling journalists that hes consulting with the Greens and the crossbench than he has actually spent consulting with the Greens and the crossbench. Senator Hume has just belled the cat—its because theyve been having these long, detailed conversations between themselves for quite some time. The vote for the two big parties at the last election was the lowest it had ever been. Whats the lesson that any ordinary person would take from that? Well, maybe I need to fix my policies. Perhaps what Im offering the public isnt that attractive. But no: rather than actually having a good, long, hard look at themselves and maybe taking action on the climate crisis, taking real action on the costofliving crisis or building some actual affordable housing—rather than doing that—theyre just chatting to each other about how they can cancel their competitors. Theyre just chatting to each other to change the rules to make it harder for anyone thats not already elected and harder in particular for anyone that is not in the Labor, Liberal or National parties. This bill is going to make it harder for the parliament to represent the community. This bill is going to lock in the shape of the parliament for years to come in a cosy little stitchup that suits the twoparty system, which has been crumbling. Their only response is, Lets rig the rules to try to keep us both in power. Nothing unites that lot like selfinterest, and its on fine display tonight. You would have thought that, with the most momentous reforms to our democratic system, as they have been described by the previous speaker, which have such a momentous outcome that will dictate what sorts of decisions the country takes on the big issues that really make a difference in peoples lives, the normal process would apply and wed have a Senate inquiry. But oh, no; we dont want to tell you anything about whats in this cosy little deal. And so last week, once again, when I moved for an inquiry, the two big parties voted together as theyre going to do later tonight. They didnt want the scrutiny. They dont want the expert analysis of what this bill will really do. I think its because, if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, its a duck. This is a deal designed to shore up their own flailing power and its designed to cancel the competition. Well, there are other ways of improving your vote in the polls, and I suggest that you actually improve your policies rather than rigging the rules. Now, we have repeatedly said to the government, in what scarce discussions we have had about this topic in the last 18 months, that the Greens stand ready to pass the transparency measures that were originally in this bill: the $1,000 disclosure threshold, lowered down from $16,900. We have repeatedly said that truth in political advertising needs to pass. Theres a bill to do that, but do you think thats whats being rushed through tonight? No, they introduced that bit, but then they said, Were not going to do that bit. That bits not being guillotined and rammed through the chamber tonight; in fact, that part will probably never see the light of day, because thats the part that the opposition didnt want to see happen and, frankly, its the part that Labor was only ever half committed to and was just doing for the look of it. So we have a situation where the Greens said to the government, You have a pathway to pass reforms through this parliament. We will pass these transparency measures. We will pass truth in advertising. We will pass funding reforms. But we want a Senate inquiry into your particular type of funding reforms because they look pretty suspicious to us, and we were right. They were suspicious. An inquiry was denied, and now, at the eleventh hour, we see a guillotine motion to ram this cosy deal through and we still havent seen the damn amendments! This is absolutely remarkable. Democracy is a sham, folks. When the two big parties reach an agreement, none of this here actually matters. The deal was done in a back room, probably between Mr Albanese and Mr Dutton personally, probably last night after he tried to wine and dine the teals while kneecapping them at the same time, and here we go. The parliament is now meant to just rubberstamp this stuff. Im grateful that the Greens and the crossbench wont ever just rubberstamp stuff, particularly not very large reforms with very consequential outcomes. I cant wait to see these amendments, because we thought the bill was a bit dodgy, but what were now reading through the newspapers, not through the actual amendments, is that there are changes that make it even less effective. The disclosure threshold, which was going to be $1,000, now is going to be increased, at the behest of Mr Dutton and the opposition, to $5,000, so there will be more secrecy, not more transparency, than was originally planned by this bill. The donations cap, originally planned to be $20,000, is now going to be $50,000—again, at the behest of Mr Dutton and the Liberals. So thats more money sloshing around in the system. There is a particularly egregious change which we havent yet seen the detail of, because we still havent seen those amendments. We read from the media, not from the minister, that the draft bill would have capped the amount that peak bodies could receive from their member bodies—folk like the Business Council and the Minerals Council—in membership fees at $20,000, which could then be spent on electoral matters. I will confirm this if I get the opportunity in committee stage, but, on my reading of this, each of those big mining companies will be able to give $250,000 in membership fees to the Minerals Council, who will then be able to spend that money on electoral campaigning to the tune of $11.5 million. It doesnt seem like thats getting big money out of the system to me. Call me a purist, but that still seems like an awful lot of dough that the big vested interests will spend on campaigns to try to get policies and politicians to act to boost their own private profits. Were all meant to be here to fix the problems that people are facing and trying to fix the planet, but, no, this deal has got these additional loopholes designed and built into it to facilitate the likes of the Minerals Council, the Business Council and all sorts of other political players who are very cashed up and whose profit bottom lines very much depend on the access and influence that they peddle with politicians here. Now there are special favours for them. This is precisely why we needed an inquiry process and, frankly, precisely why we need to see these amendments. Its quarter to eight, and we still have not seen the detail of this deal. I mentioned before that we didnt have an inquiry into this bill. Indeed, that doesnt bother just me; it bothers quite a lot of learned academics and professionals in this field. The Centre for Public Integrity, which has been really active in this space in the last few years—they had a lot to do with the design of what then became the NACC, the National AntiCorruption Commission—had a lot to say about how we should better structure our democratic decisionmaking. Theyve put out a statement today saying: The Centre for Public Integrity has long advocated for reform of our political donations laws. We have fought for greater transparency via a reduced disclosure threshold and realtime disclosure, as well as a broader definition of what constitutes a donation. We have fought for solutions to the problem of undue influence in the form of donations and expenditure caps. We have also fought for fairness, because the advantages of majorparty membership and incumbency are significant and need to be compensated for in any system capping donations and spending. It is an affront to our democratic process that the Electoral Legislation Amendment—significant, complex legislation which concerns the very foundations of our democracy—is proceeding without proper parliamentary process and scrutiny. The Governments guillotining of debate, and proceeding in the absence of a parliamentary inquiry or the advice of an independent expert panel, is of profound concern. That was a statement from the Hon. Anthony Whealy KC, the Hon. Michael Barker KC, the Hon. Margaret White AO, Professor Allan Fels AO—and he would know all about anticompetitive conduct, I might add—Professor Joo Cheong Tham and Geoffrey Watson SC. This is a debasing of our democratic process, and its just such a choice example of it. Theyre scratching each others backs. Meanwhile, the community is going to be hung out to dry, because the community actually wanted a more diverse parliament and they wanted decisionmakers who were not for sale to corporate donors and to these business councils, minerals councils and other conglomerates. Theyve now had this special little pathway given to them where their big money can keep sloshing about, trying to influence democracy. You should be embarrassed by this, and I think youve got the audacity to be proud that youve pulled it off. Well, everyone else is going to be appalled. This is not the fix for your falling popularity that you might think it is. Im going to be moving a second reading amendment that was in fact circulated last November, so hopefully the excellent chamber attendants will be able to circulate that for your convenience. But in that second reading amendment we have noted that reforms have to strengthen democracy, not just the electoral fortunes of the two big parties. We are concerned that the proposed reforms entrench incumbency and stack outcomes in favour of the twoparty system, and we will continue to advocate, as we have for decades, to get big money out of politics and to ban donations from fossil fuel companies and other socialharm industries. And theres a list of folk that are used to buying influence in this joint: the gambling industry, the pokies industry, the alcohol industry, big property developers, weapons manufacturers, the big banks and big pharma. Theres a list of vested interests that should not be allowed to donate. Do you think this bill does that? No way, Jose! It rolls out the red carpet for them with these dodgy little backdoor provisions. We will keep advocating that those dirty industries and socialharm industries not be allowed to make political donations to anyone. Theyve got enough influence over our system. They should not be buying further influence. We will keep pushing to implement truth in political advertising because people deserve to make decisions based on the actual policies of a party, not on some bullshit that has been promulgated—","Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Reform) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1[6]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator HUME (Victoria) ","(19:24):"

"0","0","0","1","1","Lines, Sen Sue (The PRESIDENT)","112096","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I rise to speak on the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Reform) Bill 2024. Elections matter. None of us would be here without an election. I speak as a former chair and current deputy chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I speak as someone who volunteered on my first campaign when I was 15 years old and still at school in Toowoomba. I speak as someone who has spent most of their working life fighting the Left and campaigning for a civil, civic and considered conservativism. I was raised on the belief that politics, voting and elections are part of our civic duty. I also speak as someone whos probably forgotten more about elections and election law than some in this chamber can claim to actually know.  We are blessed to live in one of the worlds oldest and most successful democracies. I know that because Ive worked in some of the worlds newest democracies. Our country works because over the years a lot of people, paid and unpaid, have worked to make it so. Countless Australians have made the ultimate sacrifice to protect our democracy and our inherent freedoms that shield us from the dark. The coalition therefore holds that any electoral changes that will impact upon this very special country ought to be assessed on the following four core principles: fair, open and transparent elections; equal treatment of all political participants; freedom of political communication and participation without fear of retribution; and the recognition of freedom of thought, belief, association and speech as fundamental to free elections. Australias success as a liberal democracy is reliant on the effectiveness of the Australian Electoral Commission, the federal government and political participants more broadly to satisfy and uphold these four principles. Ensuring that Australians have continued faith in the electoral system is paramount to Australias faith in its institutions of government and indeed to the very notion of Australia. As such, when assessing legislative proposals, the coalition will always do so through the lens of upholding its four principles to promote a free and fair liberal democracy. We will look at the amendments moved by the government on this legislation to see if they address some of the concerns that we had with the original bill. The bill will introduce a lower disclosure threshold for Commonwealth elections, realtime disclosure of donations, caps on gifts to political parties and caps on expenditure for political parties. The electoral reforms have a planned commencement date from 2026, which means the laws would not apply for the 2025 general election. That is important. It is very important that we provide political actors with the time required for these laws. We do not support rushed attempts to force these provisions to come into effect in the heat of an election campaign. We should be vigilant in remembering that the Liberal National Party, my party, like other political parties, is run not by faceless ghouls but by volunteers—men and women who see their involvement in a political party as a civil duty akin to their service in other community groups and who have a strong desire to leave their community, their state and their country in a better place than was bequeathed to them. So, while the Queensland voters are my boss, it is the volunteer branch members of my party who give their all so I can stand up for their values. The Commonwealth Electoral Act is extremely complex, and, with significant reform, we must give all political participants, like my volunteer branch members, time to adjust before the reforms come into effect. We do not want unintended consequences of these changes that could hinder Australians joining political parties or act as a handbrake on party political participation. I have long spoken in this chamber about the inconsistent approach of the intelligentsia, who regard members of mainstream political parties as less worthy than those who support the Greens, the teals or other Climate 200 groups. I would suggest all political participants should be treated equally when it comes to their motivation for joining a party or a cause. Sadly, the teals and the Greens and their vested, conflicted donors do not share such views. In the last federal election, the teal candidates spent ridiculous amounts of money to win their seats. Monique Ryan spent $2.1 million, Allegra Spender spent $2.1 million, Zoe Daniel spent $1.5 million, Kylea Tink spent $1.3 million and Sophie Scamps spent $1.2 million. This bill would establish an $800,000 cap on spending per seat. So perhaps I can understand why the teals are so upset. It is the teals who are using big money from vested donors to buy elections. The cap for expenditure is a very reasonable upper limit, but still the teals say they cannot support it. The teals have argued that $800,000 sounds good but only for major parties. If you are a minor party or a socalled Independent—remembering that teals are not independent; theyre a part of the teal political movement—you should be able to spend more than that. That is not how Australias democracy operates. All political participants should be treated equally; otherwise you will have a teal coloured gerrymander being brought into Australia. As a former campaign director, I can say to the teals that, if they cant get their message out in a seat with $800,000, then they need to look at their message or they need to look at what they are spending that money on. This bill takes power away from vested interests and puts limitations on the likes of Simon Holmes a Court by implementing a donation cap. As such, the coalition will consider the amendments but notes that the contents of this bill are not inconsistent with our four core principles. In my foreword to the 2020 JSCEM report into the 2019 election, I noted: We sleep safely in our beds protected from the claws of the banality of evil because we— voters— decide who governs. We should never forget that we owe it to the voters to have a fitforpurpose democracy. The coalition supports this bill on that basis.","Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Reform) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1[6]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator McGRATH (Queensland—Deputy Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) ","(19:47):"

Labor went to the last election promising electoral reforms, giving voters the impression that the days of corporate influence over our political system would be over, that the battlers and everyday people would be better represented. That was dishonest! said the President. The bill before us does offer some small, positive changes to give these pretend Labor and Liberal politicians some talking points to distract and gaslight the public into thinking this is a good bill. But that is not the truth. The bill goes some way to limit influence from major donors, with donation caps and more transparency around political donations, by lowering the disclosure threshold. But it also brings in a suite of measures to make the whole system more undemocratic and less representative of the people in this country. Look at this place!

Why is it that after over 200 years of the socalled civilisation of colonisation, this g government—bleep, bleep, bleep—cant even figure out how to make sure children are fed? How is that not the No. 1 priority? That shows you exactly the values of a government that is more interested in its own survival than that of the people.  In addition to spending caps, which will disadvantage independent candidates who dont have the broader advertising and campaign infrastructure that political parties have, the expenditure cap would still allow countrywide political parties to spend up to $90 million on broad political advertisements. How can an Independent keep up with that, especially someone from a nonwealthy background who hasnt stolen any land? For many, running for office means putting their careers and livelihoods on hold, a stark reminder that the opportunity to serve is not a universal right but a privilege afforded only to those with big cash and powerful mates. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights pointed out that the measures in the bill may increase the relative monetary power of incumbents and bigger parties and disproportionately impact people with particular protected attributes who are already underrepresented by major political parties, such as women or ethnic minority groups. The committee pointed out that this might limit the right to equality and nondiscrimination in this country. The Scrutiny of Bills report also pointed out that this bill may impact representative government by negatively affecting the diversity of opinions, arguments and other political matters that can be in electoral communications. This would be a further violation of our basic rights in a country where we already only have limited right to take part in public affairs. This right is supposed to include a guarantee of the right of citizens to stand for public office, to vote in elections and to have access to positions in public service. However, section 44 of the colonial Constitution prohibits those with dual citizenship to stand for federal political office, thereby possibly excluding up to half of the population unless they renounce ties with the other country. This is in a country which, apparently, prides itself on multiculturalism. Any further hurdles put in the way of diverse representation, like those proposed by this bill, need to be avoided by all means. This bill basically means that many of us dont fit into the middleclass, whiteAustralian picture and we will be less likely to have real representation in this place. Have a look at it! It says it all. So many of us already dont feel represented by the major parties and their assimilation practices. We want our representatives to be able to speak freely and vote along their conscience. People in the community want parliamentarians to stand up for them, not just a tired old backbencher twiddling their thumbs, taking orders and asking How high? when they are told to jump. The disappointment with the political status quo is exactly why the Independent and minor party vote has grown over the last decade, and thats what the major parties are scared of. Theyre scared of the crossbench because we demand transparency and accountability, but these are basic and essential democratic measures and we owe this to the voters. This term alone has shown, so many times, that the crossbench contributes to better policy outcomes through bringing a diverse lens to negotiations, listening to communities and stakeholders—they fall on deaf ears with the major parties—and ensuring that they are being heard. That is the very heart of representative democracy. This bill is a done deal between the major parties and is being rushed through parliament, explicitly because they know it is so flawed and theyre so ashamed of it themselves and its in breach of basic democratic rights. I want to make clear to everyone here and all voters out there that this bill represents an erosion of democratic principles, participation and representation. This is why Im proposing to rename it the Sham Democracy Bill, because at least that would tell people the truth about what theyre up for. For the record, I would like to see the majority of the politicians in this place recognise how out of touch they really are and give their seats to someone who deserves it and who will actually use it for good. The younger generation know the way. Give it to them. There are too many people that have been here for way too long, crusty—and all the rest of it. I dont want to get in trouble again. After all that, I foreshadow my second reading amendment.","Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Reform) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1[6]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[88]","N/A","N/A"

Politics should be a contest of values, of ideas and of support in our communities, not who can raise the most money or wage the dirtiest campaign. Theres been a lot of talk about what I and other firsttime Independent candidates spent last election to crack the twoparty stranglehold—to have in a handful of seats, for the first time ever, someone who wasnt from the major parties or, in some cases, from a single party. But there hasnt been much talk about what the major parties spent and what they spent in seats that have never gone to anyone else. They would be totally safe seats. We had the Special Minister of State, months ago, in question time, having a go at me about how much I spent in my election campaign.

"0","0","0","1","1","MemberContinuation","256136","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Senator DAVID POCOCK: Both parties also had more than $1 million in receipts. As I said, Im all for getting big money out of politics, but this bill doesnt get big money out of politics. It will result in more than $80 million worth of additional taxpayer money being spent on the major parties, and thats every single electoral cycle. So its not actually about less money; its about Australian taxpayers picking up the bill. More than that, its about the major parties reducing competition in a desperate attempt to plug the leaking of votes of Australians who see that there are better options. There are other options in the political landscape now. Its a lastgasp attempt to hold back a rising tide of Independents and minor parties. Rather than stepping up and meeting this challenge and reconnecting with the people you should be representing, youre seeking to skew our electoral system even further to your advantage. My hope is that communities will see through this attempt to suppress community voices, and it will fail.  There are so many loopholes built into this bill. Theyre clearly designed to stifle competition. Senator McGrath made a contribution earlier. I fear that he misunderstands the issues that Independents have with this bill. He talked about a spending cap of $800,000 per electorate and $200,000 per state or territory in the Senate election, but, if you actually look at the details, that is the individual spending cap. If you stack up some of these contests around the country, where you have a firsttime Independent, noname candidate spending $800,000, an incumbent major party candidate spending $800,000, this bill allows the party to then spend basically an unlimited amount of money up to their $90 million national cap to shore up support in that electorate. There could be $800,000 backing the Liberal or Labor candidate by name and $2 million backing the Liberals or Labor—just dont mention the name. Thats not a level playing field. It would be a very different conversation if it truly created a level playing field. The second loophole is that the major parties can receive unlimited transfers from what are now being called nominated entities. In the last election cycle, the coalition accepted nearly $10 million from the Cormack Foundation and the Labor Party accepted around $6 million from Labor Services & Holdings Pty Ltd. The third loophole is something called administrative funding. Administrative funding can be used for all kinds of party expenditure, but it doesnt count a cent towards spending caps. It basically makes spending caps meaningless. In a briefing with the department when asking about this—basically anyone who isnt directly campaigning isnt counted in your spending. We know the party infrastructure. People organise events and doorknock and do all the other things. Thats not counted. So when the government says, Weve been spending $120 million on elections and were going down to $90 million, thats very disingenuous because that $120 million is actually all the inkind hours that people are putting into it. Now thats not counted. Youve essentially said: What do we currently spend on elections? Lets get a lot more of that from the taxpayer, and lets ensure that Independents who are trying to challenge us have a very hard time doing it. The increase in taxpayer funding is huge. First—and this is one I take real exception to—is for administrative expenses, which dont account for economies of scale and greatly advantage the major parties. You cant tell me that, with $30,000 per MP, at some point you havent covered your administrative expenses. That should not scale in a linear fashion. For the coalition, who keep telling us theyre the party of business and all the rest, youd surely know that that is not the case. In South Australia I think they cap it at $5,000, which is probably fair enough. With $5,000, thats enough money to do your administrative tasks. On top of that—others have talked about this—theres taxpayer funding from votes, from three to five bucks per vote. Finally, the definition of gift, which is really a donation, has three pages of exceptions. The major parties say, If the gambling industry takes us out for a birthday dinner, that will be a donation, but if the gambling industry has a subscription to the Federal Labor Business Forum or whoever it might be—no; thats a subscription. The fact that you may get a few dinners here and there is just one of the perks of having a subscription. As I said, there are three pages of exceptions: subscriptions, levies and dozens of other things. I dont see how you can say with a straight face that this is creating a level playing field, particularly given how challenging so many Australians are finding it. The major parties want to give themselves millions of extra dollars and dont want to accept the responsibility of truth in political advertising. Its very telling that Labor introduced two bills. One they basically shelved—a bill that had the support of the crossbench to pass. Then they do a deal with the coalition that is clearly in their interests. A bill like this not going through a Senate committee process is, I think, tragic and reflects really badly on this Senate. We call it the house of review—thats not for this bill. In the words of Professor Anne Twomey: Any suggestion that this bill has already been subject to proper scrutiny is completely disingenuous. Do the major parties want transparency or scrutiny? It seems like what they really want, when its in their interest, is a stitchup. This is a sad, sad day for our democracy. Youre ramming through electoral reform thats going to reduce competition at a time when Australians want more competition. They want more competition in politics and more competition across our economy. One of my observations is that there are a whole bunch of things that Australians want that the major parties team up to block, like getting more money for the gas that we export and actually transitioning away from fossil fuels. The major parties voted together to expand the fossil fuel industry. Major parties will vote together on gambling reform. You guys totally squibbed scams legislation to actually protect Australians. We had an opportunity to protect Australians being scammed. Weve got halfbaked legislation thats just passed: mandatory minimum sentencing, things with absolutely no evidence behind them and protecting lobbyists. We should have more regulation around lobbyists. The list goes on and on.","Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Reform) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1[6]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[4]","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","1","Fawcett, Sen David (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)","DYU","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," Pursuant to contingent notice of motion, I move:  That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent further consideration of the bill without limitation of time. Well, the fix is in, isnt it? Weve got the two major parties in the dead of night trying to pass a bill that is going to entrench their stale, putrid monopoly. Thats what you expect from stale, putrid major parties who have no policy ideas of their own and where all they can do is manipulate the law and manipulate the rules to constantly protect themselves. The public are awake to this. If you look at the combined primary vote of the two major parties, it is going one way and that is down—because this chamber is nothing but a Punch and Judy show by members of parties who are party bred and party fed. One of my former staffers used to call it Union bred, union fed, but what we really have here is major party bred, major party fed. Theyre the same careerists who started off in the Young LNP and Young Labor, theyve never had any real life experience and they dont know how to relate to the common man on the street. The only way that they can continue to protect their little racket is to manipulate the rules of the game. Im a victim of that because my own party manipulated the rules of the game, and I took them to court. Do you know what the judge said? Were not going to rule. Political parties arent justiciable. There you have it, people. The Supreme Court of Queensland ruled that the very political parties who make the law are above the law. What sort of a democratic system is that? Weve had three years to debate this bill, but no—these guys cannot face scrutiny. If you put any sunlight on these guys, its like throwing water on a witch: theyll just fade away like in the Wizard of Oz—Im melting, melting! Not only do they not have any policy solutions to deal with the cost of living or anything like that; they just want to keep their protection racket going. I am calling you guys out. I think its a very low act to be guillotining this bill, and its a very low act to be pushing it through in what looks to be the last sitting week of this term. There have been no solutions in this term. The first half of the term was dominated by Labor and the Voice, where they wanted to split the country on race. The second half has been all about Israel and Palestine, because thats a nice deflection from the fact that none of you guys have any solutions to deal with the cost of living, the immigration problem, the cost of housing or the energy crisis, or to help people who are struggling from government neglect through vaccine injuries, robodebt—you name it. This place has a stench. It is a dead, putrid carcass flapping in the breeze, and the people of Australia are awake to it. Well see more and more people turn away from the major parties. The only way the major parties can protect themselves is by having dodgy rules. The one that really grinds my gears—and Ill be moving an amendment on this in a minute—is that parties that get less than four per cent of the vote dont get any electoral funding whatsoever. So, if you vote for a minor party, in the eyes of the major party youre not as worth as much. They will only reward you if you vote for one of them. Thats straightout bribery. There ought to be laws against that. Everyone who votes should be worth $3.50 a vote, but, of course, the major parties dont want the minor parties and wouldnt like the minor parties getting some money, because God forbid the minor parties actually have some solutions and arent beholden to the big end of town. Pay attention to all these amendments. What are we always asking for at this end of the chamber? Greater accountability, greater scrutiny and greater protection of the people. But do we get that? No. What we have is these two major parties protecting the big end of town, big government, the big bureaucracies, big media, big corporations and their mates in the big super funds. Its all about the establishment. On that side youve got the commandandcontrol communists and on this side youve got the borntorule fascists. It doesnt matter what you do, the two major parties are only interested in controlling you, not serving you.","Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Reform) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1[6]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator RENNICK (Queensland) ","(20:24):"

Seeking gifts (2) Despite any State or Territory electoral law, a regulated entity, or a person on behalf of a regulated entity, may seek a gift if the gift is expresslysought for use for federal administrative purposes. Giving gifts (3) Despite any State or Territory electoral law, a person or entity may give a gift to, or for the benefit of, a regulated entity if the gift is expresslygiven for federal administrative purposes. Receiving or keeping gifts — money (4) Despite any State or Territory electoral law, a regulated entity, or a person on behalf of a regulated entity, may receive a gift of money if: (a) the money is deposited into a federal administrative account as soon as practicable after the money is received; and (b) the money is not transferred or withdrawn out of the account except: (i) to use the money for federal administrative purposes; or (ii) to transfer the money to another federal administrative account. (5) Despite any State or Territory electoral law, a regulated entity, or a person on behalf of a regulated entity, may keep a gift of money if: (a) the money is kept in a federal administrative account; and (b) the money is not transferred or withdrawn out of the account except: (i) to use the money for federal administrative purposes; or (ii) to transfer the money to another federal administrative account.

Receiving or keeping gifts — gifts other than money (7) Despite any State or Territory electoral law and despite subsection 302CA(5), a regulated entity, or a person on behalf of a regulated entity, may receive or keep a gift that is not money unless the regulated entity keeps the gift for use for, or uses the gift for, purposes other than federal purposes or federal administrative purposes.

Using gifts — gifts other than money (11) Despite any State or Territory electoral law, a regulated entity may use, or authorise the use of, a gift, that is not money, for federal administrative purposes if the gift has been continuouslykept for federal administrative purposes since it was received. Using gifts — relationship with State or Territory electoral laws (12) To avoid doubt, the fact that, as a result of subsection (10) or (11), a State or Territory electoral law does not prohibit the use of a gift does not prevent that law from prohibiting the offering, seeking, giving, receiving or keeping of the gift. Gifts not otherwise prohibited by this Part (13) To avoid doubt, this section applies to a gift only if this Part does not prohibit the giving, receiving or keeping of the gift. Parts of gifts (14) For the purposes of this section, if a part of a gift is offered, sought, given, received, kept or used for a particular purpose, and that same action is taken in relation to another part of the gift for a different purpose, each part of the gift is taken to be a separate gift. Extended meaning of gift (15) Disregard subsection 287AAB(3) in working out whether something is a gift for the purposes of this section. 314D Disclosure of amounts given etc. for federal administrative purposes Disclosure of amounts and benefits given etc. (1) Despite any State or Territory electoral law, a person or entity is not required to disclose under that law an amount of money, or information relating to an amount of money, (including a gift or loan) if the person or entity expressly gives the amount to, or for the benefit of, a regulated entity for federal administrative purposes.

Disclosure of amounts and other benefits received (3) Despite any State or Territory electoral law, a regulated entity is not required to disclose under that law an amount of money, or information relating to an amount of money, (including a gift or loan) that is received by or on behalf of the regulated entity if: (a) the amount is deposited into a federal administrative account as soon as practicable after the amount is received; and (b) the amount is not transferred or withdrawn out of the account except: (i) to use the amount for federal administrative purposes; or (ii) to transfer the amount to another federal administrative account. (4) To avoid doubt, subsection (3) is taken never to have applied if, at any time, the amount is transferred or withdrawn out of the account, or any other federal administrative account, except as provided by subparagraph (3)(b)(i) or (ii). (5) Despite any State or Territory electoral law and despite subsection 314B(2), a regulated entity is not required to disclose under that law the value of a nonmonetary benefit, or information relating to a nonmonetary benefit, that is received by or on behalf of the regulated entity unless the regulated entity keeps the benefit for use for, or uses the benefit for, purposes other than federal purposes or federal administrative purposes. (6) To avoid doubt, subsection (5) is taken never to have applied if, at any time, the regulated entity keeps the benefit for use for, or uses the benefit for, purposes other than federal administrative purposes. (7) Subsections (3) and (5) also have the effect they would have if a reference to an amount or benefit were confined to an amount or benefit expressly given or provided for federal administrative purposes.

Disclosure of debts (9) Despite any State or Territory electoral law, a regulated entity is not required to disclose under that law an amount, or information relating to an amount, of a debt (except a debt incurred as a result of a loan) if the debt is incurred for federal administrative purposes. Interpretation (10) Despite any State or Territory electoral law, if, as a result of this section, a person or entity is not required to disclose under that law an amount, information or value referred to in this section (the federal information), then: (a) it is immaterial whether the federal information is required to be included in a return provided under this Part; and (b) a total amount, or information relating to a total amount, that is required to be disclosed under that law is not required to include the federal information. (11) A nonmonetary benefit is a gift, or a good or service that is lent, that is not money. (12) For the purposes of this section, if an action (such as giving or using) is taken in relation to a part of an amount or nonmonetary benefit for a particular purpose, and that same action is taken in relation to another part of the amount or benefit for a different purpose, each part of the amount or benefit is taken to be a separate amount or benefit. (13) Disregard subsection 287AAB(3) in working out whether something is a gift for the purposes of this section. Compulsory production provisions excluded (14) This section does not apply in relation to any compulsory production provision in a State or Territory electoral law. (15) A compulsory production provision in a State or Territory electoral law is a provision that confers a power on a person or body (the regulator) to compel a particular person to disclose information (including an amount or value) for the purposes of the regulator investigating a potential contravention of that or any otherlaw. Note: A provision that confers a power for a person or body to give a notice to produce to a regulated entity is an example of a compulsory production provision. 4 After subsection 302AE(3) Insert: (3A) The account may be a federal administrative account. 5 After subsection 302AE(8) Insert: (8A) The account may be a federal administrative account. 6 After subsection 302AF(3) Insert: (3A) The account may be a federal administrative account. 7 Subsection 317(1A) Omit or 314B, substitute , 314B, 314C or 314D. 8 Subsection 317(1A) (example) After federal account, insert or federal administrative account. 9 Paragraph 317(2)(e) Omit or 314B, substitute , 314B, 314C or 314D.

Yes, weve sought to make sure that, by including these natural members as being members or officeholders in a nonfinancial capacity, as individuals, they cannot pay a subscription or an affiliation fee.   Can you confirm that the bill will not change the National Partys existing affiliation arrangements between the federal party and state parties as per their constitutions? In particular, can you confirm that the state National Party entities, such as the National Party of Australia Victoria and the LNP, will continue to be recognised as state branches of the federal National Party for the purposes of the Commonwealth Electoral Act?  Thank you for that question, Senator Hume. Yes, I can confirm that requirements to party registration and affiliations are not amended by the bill.  Minister, can you confirm that the provisions of the bill do not alter the status of the LNP as the recognised state branch and, specifically, the Queensland branch of both the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia for the purposes of the Commonwealth Electoral Act?  I thank Senator Hume for her question. The bill does not alter the status of the LNP for the purposes of the Commonwealth Electoral Act.  Minister, is it also correct that a state branch in a federal party is a core member of the federal branchs expenditure group?  Yes, a state branch in a federal party is a core member of the federal branchs executive group.  Minister, could you please give an example of a natural person who is a member of the type of organisation captured by the definition of peak representative body?  If you can give me a little bit of time, I will get a formal answer to that question.  I want to ask some questions about the expenditure cap by electorate. Independent candidates are provided a divisional expenditure cap of $800,000 while political parties are provided with a national expenditure cap of $90 million. Thats correct, yes?  Yes, that is correct.  If a political party runs candidates in all 150 seats, that equates to just $600,000 per seat. Given this, what do you then say to people who say that this bill disadvantages Independents who have a cap of $800,000?  Thank you, Senator Hume, for your question.

"0","0","0","1","1","TEMPORARY CHAIR, The","10000","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I have some questions about disclosure periods. First of all, Minister, can you confirm the length of time that a candidate or a political party will have to disclose a donation outside of an election?   The answer to that is monthly.  Minister, can you confirm the length of time that a candidate or a political party will have to disclose a donation after the writs for an election have been issued?  Its weekly, until the last week when it becomes daily. Thats significant because, for the first time in Australian electoral history, when you go into the ballet box to vote, you will know in advance who else is backing the particular candidate that youre contemplating voting for. This is one of the historical changes and, I think, very beneficial changes to our democratic process that will result as a result of this legislation.  I just want to reconfirm then that, after the writs are issued, disclosures for donations have to occur within a week, but, during that last week of a campaign, disclosures for donations have to occur daily—is that correct?  Thats correct, and that is one of the terrific transparency provisions in this new legislation.  I have some questions about parliamentarian resources. First, could you confirm that the resources provided to sitting parliamentarians are not considered electoral expenditure for the purposes of the expenditure cap?  Yes, that is correct.  Minister, can you also confirm that, in relation to staff provided to parliamentarians, the changes proposed in this legislation will also ensure that volunteers are not inappropriately captured by the expenditure caps?  Yes, I can confirm that. I think theres an amendment to clarify that point amongst the ones Ive just presented here this evening.  I have no further questions for the minister other than hoping that he will be able to come back on that original question of an example of a natural person who is a member of the type of organisation captured by the definition of peak representative body. If you could come back to us before we get to the end, that would be terrific.  I think were going to be here for a very long time tonight, so I have ample time to ensure I get the accurate advice for you, Senator.  Well, well, well. I have to say Im rather offended. The only way I got up here, the only way I was given an opportunity as a normal Aussie out there, was by billionaire Clive Palmer. Are you now saying to me that after 10 years in this place I do not belong here? Is that what youre saying—that that opportunity was given to me and that youre going to take it off everyone else and that I havent earnt my way up here? By God, Im offended. Why dont you answer that one?  No, Im not saying that.  I actually dont recall—maybe I was comatose during the last three years—the Labor Party taking this to the last election. When did you get the majority? When did you get a social licence from the Australian people to ram this down our throats and theirs and to charge them more? Instead of $3, $5 will pass over to us. When did you get Australias social licence to do that?  The Labor Party took transparency provisions to the last election, and, in the almost three years of this parliament, we have had inquiry after inquiry into the best way of ensuring the ongoing electoral system in this country to ensure that democracy survives in this country and to ensure that democracy prospers in this country. Those committee hearings and the resultant legislation which you now see before you tonight are a reflection of all of those discussions which we have conducted in this parliament with the Australian people, and Im very firmly of the view that the Australian people want this legislation.  Democracy? Its a stitchup. You have stained democracy. Thats what youve done by doing this. Anyway, during this time, Ive never seen the opposition throwing dorothy dixers to the government. At what time did the opposition provide copies of the questions they were going to ask you whilst you were in the committee stage of consideration of this bill?  Weve had very extensive conversations over a long period of time with the opposition, with the Greens, with Senator Pocock and even with Senator Rennick.","Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Reform) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1[6]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[16]/talk.text/body/p","Senator HUME (Victoria) ","(20:59):"

Minister, we just got a whole bevy of amendments that constituted the changes that the Liberal Party required in order to back in this piece of legislation.

That was when they came into my email inbox, so Ive had about an hour to glance through them whilst also trying to pay attention to whats happening in the chamber. My first question is: can you please run us through the changes that the Liberal Party asked you to make to this bill that are now being reflected in the amendments that youve just tabled?

That actually didnt answer my question at all. I didnt ask about the process of the cosy chats youve had with the opposition.

She chose not to take advantage of that. If she wishes to have an explanation of the proposed amendments, then Im happy to go through those. Amendment (1) proposed originally a disclosure threshold of $1,000, and we have increased that to $5,000. This is currently $16,900 and was again set to increase for the new financial year. No. 2, the amended gift cap from an individual or entity was originally $20,000 in the bill. That has been increased to $50,000. No. 3 is a provision to allow genuine peak representation bodies to manage their affiliation under the cap of four times the proposed gift. No. 4 is a technical amendment to limit the risks associated with constitutional changes to the reform package. No. 5 is a clarification that administrative expenditure is not electoral expenditure. Amendment (6) is technical amendments to ensure that state and territory electoral laws do not apply to the receipt and the use of funds for federal purposes or federal administrative purposes. No. 7 is technical amendments to ensure candidates, MPs and senators are able to contribute to their own political party or individual campaign account up to the annual gift cap. No. 8 is technical amendments to ensure political parties are able to loan funds between their branches without being subject to the gift cap. No. 9 is technical amendments to clarify that volunteers are to be treated as staff for the purposes of travel and accommodation related expenses and exemptions.  While Im on my feet, Chair, Senator Hume did ask a question earlier. The answer to that is that a peak body can only be representative of other organisations.

Im not sure why it took seven attempts to do so, but I do genuinely appreciate the guidance that youve given there. I have a followup question in relation to the affiliation fees, which was the third amendment that you mentioned. I dont know which number amendment it is, unfortunately.  You mentioned that affiliation fees up to four times the amount of the gift cap for peak bodies can be contributed. I understand that, under the bill that was tabled, there would have been a $20,000 cap on the amount that peak bodies—such as the Business Council or the Minerals Council, for example—could take from their member organisations for their own national political campaigns. Is it correct that the amendment that youve just flagged essentially changes that? Is it the case that every single big mining company that is a member of the Minerals Council can now contribute $250,000 in affiliate fees to the Minerals Council—not $20,000 anymore but $250,000? Is it the case that the Minerals Council could then spend that on electoral purposes and only be capped from doing so above $11½ million?

At the last election we saw Clive Palmer spend $117 million.  To the extent that we are capping the ability of these organisations to spend money in elections, we are putting downward pressure on these organisations and their ability to spend money in the election. At the moment, there is no restriction. Nothing at all restricts those companies from spending as much as they like. We have capped the spending of these organisations. You dont want money going to gambling organisations or fossil fuels companies, and you dont want donations from them. For the first time in the electoral history of the federal parliament, we are capping the spending of those organisations which you say you dont like. We are treating them the same as all other organisations, but weve finally put a cap on their spending. I am disappointed that the Greens havent come on board to support that legislation, because for the first time we are putting downward pressure on the ability of all of these organisations to spend money in the electoral cycle.","Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Reform) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1[6]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[47]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator FARRELL (South Australia—Minister for Trade and Tourism, Special Minister of State and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) ","(21:21):"

We had a number of discussions—for instance, with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and with the BCA. I think we might have discussed it with the National Farmers Federation, and there were a few others.  Minister, did you speak to the Minerals Council about this amendment?  Not that I can recall.  Minister, have you or the department obtained advice from the AEC about how easy it will be to understand and comply with this law, and, if so, what is that advice?  Yes, throughout the whole process. Right from the start of the discussions about this legislation, we have engaged with the Australian Electoral Commission. I would have liked this legislation to have been in force for this particular election, but, because of the very transformational nature of the changes that were making here—particularly those provisions that relate to realtime disclosure, and to the donations caps and disclosure caps—the AEC requested extra time to implement the changes because they are such significant changes. I wanted to get this legislation through the parliament in this term to give the Australian Electoral Commission as much time as I possibly could to implement these changes. They are significant and important changes, and we want to get them right. I am planning to give the AEC as much time as possible to implement them, and, because they have been engaged in the process and have seen the changes that were proposing, they have had the opportunity to provide input into what were doing here.

New parties are popping up all the time—weve got Mr Rennicks new party popping up here—and the good thing is that all parties, new or old, are treated exactly the same under this legislation. Nobody gets an advantage and nobody is disadvantaged by this legislation. I know weve had a number of discussions and I guess weve had to agree to disagree, but the significance of what were doing here by capping expenditure on individual electorates is that all of the parties in the process are limited by how much they can spend. So, if you are a new party, you know that, if you can raise $800,000, your opponent can only spend $800,000. You know youre on an equal footing with that other party if you choose to challenge them.

The playing field is level on a candidate level, where its $800,000 each, but, if you have a party, you can then tip in more money promoting that party as long as you dont mention that candidate.  One of the other things with new entrants and minor parties is that, if the candidates name is in the partys name, you cannot spend more, as Labor or the Liberals could do. I understand youre trying to sell it as a level playing field, but, if you actually look at the details, it doesnt seem to be that way.

If youre a candidate in a lower house seat then you are limited to an expenditure of $800,000. Youre right; there is a total expenditure for the major political parties. But that figure is lower than what the parties have spent in previous elections, and it will certainly be lower than what the parties spend in this election. Youll have seen the rivers of gold, particularly flowing into the teal seats, in this election cycle. Theres going to be a huge amount of money spent at the next election.  What this legislation does, and the reason I think youre wrong about your analysis of the benefit for the major parties, is that were capping the amount of money that the major parties can spend in elections. We are, Senator Pocock. Were capping the amount of money that political parties can spend in elections. If we were seeking, as has been claimed in the press today, to benefit the Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the National Party or the Greens by this legislation, we wouldnt be limiting the amount of money that we can spend; wed be increasing the amount of money that we can spend visavis the Independents. Were taking a haircut—I know you have a haircut from time to time, Senator Pocock. Were taking a haircut, voluntarily, to limit the amount of money that the major parties can spend. For that reason, your argument doesnt follow. Were limiting the expenditure in the seats. Were also limiting how much the political parties can spend on a broader scale. That, Senator Pocock, is the reason that, I hate to say, your analysis of what this legislation is doing is completely wrong.","Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Reform) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1[6]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[59]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator FARRELL (South Australia—Minister for Trade and Tourism, Special Minister of State and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) ","(21:30):"

A lot of the stuff Im saying is from the departmental briefing, so Id suggest that you check with the department thats actually drafted this legislation.  To your point about parties being able to spend less: it looks that way, but, when we actually look at the way that you calculate spending, all the people who arent directly campaigning are just in admin, and they dont count. That is a massive loophole, and again it doesnt take into account the advantage of (1) being an incumbent, where you have a team who can do that work; and (2) the party machinery. Then you add on top $30,000 per MP and $15,000 per senator. Thats a lot of cash to be organising in the background. Thats not part of that $90 million cap. I understand the narrative that youre pushing, but it doesnt stack up with what your department is saying and it doesnt sound like there was any consideration given to new parties or Independents. It doesnt sound like there was any modelling done to work out what this will mean for new entrants. I note that, at paragraph 528 of the explanatory memorandum, three Independent candidate campaigns have been cited as examples of campaigns which were successful with expenditure well below the proposed expenditure cap. Im interested in what other analysis were conducted of these campaigns informing a view that an Independent candidate may be successful with total electorate expenditure of $100,000 to $340,000. Were incumbency factors considered? Was the nature of the electorate considered? How did you actually come up with this conclusion?","Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Reform) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1[6]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[60]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator DAVID POCOCK (Australian Capital Territory) ","(21:32):"

Ive had many candidates come to me who want to run, but you know what? They dont have $2,000. If they were able to get that money refunded then they might be able to run. I would actually be able to finance them myself. But the problem is that we dont know if theyre going to get four per cent of the vote. So, when you say that all Australians can run, that is not entirely true, because they have to get four per cent of the vote to get any electoral funding.  This is ultimately my question to you: by capping all the other money that external people from outside the major political parties can donate, you can then monopolise the electoral funding by increasing the dollar per vote. Thats what youll do in the next cycle—cut off all external sources now and then, knowing that you get the bulk of the votes and you will cut the threshold off at four per cent, lift the dollar count per vote, from $3.50, up to $7 or $8. Thats how youre going to make up for the fact that other parties cant actually raise external dollars. That is my question to you. If you genuinely want ordinary Australians to be able to run, why dont you reduce the threshold in order to receive electoral funding from four per cent to one per cent so that people can at least get their registration fee and some costs of the election paid? Its all very well talking about the big end of town and capping them, but youve choked the little end of town and the minor parties, like People First, from actually getting off the ground.","Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Reform) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1[6]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[62]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator RENNICK (Queensland) ","(21:44):"

Instead of having to raise, for Senate candidates and the Australian capital cities, $1.7 million to compete with other candidates, there is now a ceiling. For smaller parties this is a boon. This is the best piece of legislation that has ever been presented to the Australian parliament. Now, your candidates at the election after the next election are going to have to raise a whole lot less money in order to get themselves elected.  Look, if they do get that four per cent, yes, they get some government funding; that is true. I dont think thats an unreasonable position to get to. If you believe people are going to be attracted to your political party, Senator Rennick, then one imagines theyre going to get a lot more than four per cent. But your candidates are going to have to raise a damn sight less money to contest the election after next than theyre going to have to do now, and thats a good thing. Thats a good thing for Australian democracy. Its a good thing for your fledgling party. You are not disadvantaged by this legislation, Senator Rennick; you are advantaged.

We should be clear that the coalition supports and continues to support strengthening the integrity of our electoral system, particularly around voter ID—something that Ive pushed for for many years, which the minister would be aware of. The coalition notes the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters reports into the conduct of the 2013, 2016 and 2019 elections that have raised this issue.  However, the amendments in relation to this issue have been received very late in the process of discussions around this bill and were not socialised with the opposition. We were not allowed enough time to ensure that this proposed amendment is consistent with the current bill. As a result, the opposition will be opposing those amendments. It remains coalition policy to move towards an election system that requires voters to provide an acceptable form of identification in order to cast an ordinary prepoll or polling day vote in federal elections and referendums. Can I just confirm that there is no plan for the Labor Party to implement further voter integrity measures?","Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Reform) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1[6]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[64]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator McGRATH (Queensland—Deputy Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) ","(21:49):"
"0","0","0","1","1","TEMPORARY CHAIR, The","10000","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I wouldnt describe them as voter integrity measures. I would describe them as voter discouragement measures. As you well know, you convinced a former minister of state to bat up a piece of legislation in this area, and I had the great satisfaction of campaigning successfully to convince the last parliament not to proceed with that legislation because it simply would have discouraged ordinary people, who want to vote, from voting. This is a comprehensive package of changes to our electoral system. Its been three years in the making. There have been two inquiries. There have been heaps, and heaps, and heaps of discussions. Were now at the point where weve got to make a decision. Are we going to increase the integrity of the Australian electoral system? Are we going to make it fairer? Are we going to make it more possible for ordinary Australians to participate, or are we not? What might happen in future parliaments to this particular act? I dont know. What Im very confident about is that weve struck the right balance here. I am disappointed that the Greens and the independents have not come on board. I am genuinely disappointed about that because I think we want to be on the right side of history here. This is a significant change—a good change—to our democratic process. But for the moment, this is our package. This is what we want the parliament to vote for, and this is what the government is supporting.   I think youve put a real spin on it tonight, because two of the major political parties are going along with this. When you have everyone in the Greens and on the crossbench opposing this, it tells you something stinks to high heaven. Senator Pocock is right. Whatever anyone spends on an election should be questioned. Youve said youre actually bringing down the cost in elections. The House and halfSenate elections in 2019 were $372,473,000 for the Australian people. The election of 2022 was $522,390,000, so it actually hasnt come down. The byelections for Dunkley were over $3 million. Your referendum that you had in 2023 was over $411 million. You havent brought anything down whatsoever. On top of that, its actually costing the taxpayers now. Youre increasing the $5 per vote on the primary vote. Youre increasing that. On top of that, youre putting a cap of $90 million on spending, nationally, for a campaign of any political party. My concern is that the Labor Party is funded by the unions through the backdoor all the time, and this is not registered at all. This is behindthescenes backdoor funding that you are getting from the Labor Party, and you are going like a snake through the grass. You are not exposing this, and you expect us to be upfront in where we get our donations from. I dont trust the Labor Party. I dont trust you, the government, in what you are doing and where youre getting donations from. Now, it has been extremely hard for the minor parties and Independents to actually win seats in parliament against the major political parties, but the Australian people are waking up to you because theyve had a gutful of it and they want true representation. When you came into my office and spoke to me about it, and you wanted to raise the threshold, getting $30,000 per person in the lower house, per member of parliament, and $15,000 for each senator in the upper house, as compliance costs, I was absolutely ropeable, and I still am. This is nothing but a cash grab—a greedy grab by the government and the coalition. You know youve got the members in this House. I think youll benefit by about $2.7 million a year to the party, at the cost of the taxpayers, for your compliance costs. But you have actually put compliance costs onto farmers, businesses and everyone else out there. Have you compensated them for the fact that they have to get tax agents and other people to do their compliance costs? No, you havent. And you use this as an excuse to fill your coffers with taxpayers moneys. What you are doing is absolutely disgraceful. You know damn well that the Independents and minor parties cant compete with this. To have the coalition support you on this tells me, and the Australian people out there, a lot about both of you. On top of that, youre getting $5 per primary vote as well. Is that fair? No, its not. It stinks to high heaven. Thats why youve got the Greens and all the crossbench here opposing this, based on principle. When you sit there, day in, day out, and push your policies, and reckon that youre fighting for the Australian people out there, trying to put them in a house and all the rest of it, youre twofaced hypocrites. And Ill tell you to your face: youre twofaced hypocrites. And we have to try and compete with you, to get democracy in this place, to give people fair representation. I dont always agree with my colleagues here and their policies—by no means. And they know it. But we should look at it, based on policy, to give fair representation for people. You are not doing that in this piece of legislation that youve put before us. Youre rushing it through the parliament as well, without real debate. This is a cash grab by the major political parties. Ill tell the public who are there: this is a cash grab by the major political parties for your money, taxpayers money, and youre suffering out there. That is why we, all the crossbench here, are standing up to fight for your rights. Yes, wed love to have more cash. I run a political party and I do it bloody tough to try and get donations. We dont get the donations from the big end of business or the banks or the corporations—or from the unions that actually dominate and run the Labor Party. You, the elected people from the Labor Party, dont run it; the unions run you. Thats who runs this country when the Labor Party is in government. The unions run you—tell you what to do and how to vote. They watch over you. So, Minister, do you honestly believe that what youre pushing here is fair on the purse, the pocket, of the taxpayer? Youve made comments about how its going to be easier for anyone to run in this election—democracy. Ive put up amendments to this to say: Lets get rid of the twoweek polling. Lets get rid of all of this campaigning material; it shouldnt be allowed at polling booths; just put it up in the booth itself so that people can look at it. Why dont you run fair? You know that the minor parties and Independents cant compete with the money that you guys get. We cant compete with that. Youve actually put a $90 million cap nationally on the major political parties. Thats who can run this sort of campaign. We cant. You can put out all the material, all the advertising on TV and everything, and youre going to get refunded through the electoral system. Youre going to get your money back. We cant do that. Wheres the fair play in this? Where is the democracy? Where is the fair play? Minister, are you going to address this honestly? Can I get a fair answer out of you? Do you think its fair that parties can spend up to $90 million in this election and get refunded by the taxpayer? Is that fair?","Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Reform) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1[6]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[65]/talk.text/body/p","Senator FARRELL (South Australia—Minister for Trade and Tourism, Special Minister of State and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) ","(21:50):"

The unions are going to be subject to the same rules as everybody else—in particular, all of the disclosure requirements. In other words, if they donate more than $5,000, theyre going to be required to declare that donation. In the course of the election, theyre going to have to reveal those donations, so that, when you go to the ballot box, you will know whether a union has donated to a particular candidate. This is the first time in our history that that sort of disclosure is going to be made available to Australian voters. Thats a really, really significant step forward in the democratic process.  You talk about the $90 million. Yes, its true; there is a total cap. Elections dont cost nothing; elections cost something. My objective with this legislation is to put downward pressure on the total cost of the election, but political parties and individuals do have to spend money in order to get their message out. If they want to get their message out to people, then theyre going to have to spend some money. Thats just the way things work. What weve done in this legislation is—voluntarily, by virtue of a piece of legislation—cut back how much the major political parties can spend on elections.

Ill give one example. Dr Scamps asked if we could lift the donation cap to $50,000, and thats what weve done. For Independents, the administration funding is paid directly, and thats in response to some of the Independents who worked constructively with us. Should parties or party structures change, the AEC will rely on the party registration, with the members themselves electing where that compliance funding is attributed. This is funding that cannot be used for campaigning.  Its been reported by the media that you had an encounter with Simon Holmes a Court: Farrell told a small group how the Climate 200 convenor had approached him to complain that his proposed changes to election donation laws would entrench the twoparty system and lock out challengers. I mean, Farrell quipped, thats the fucking point! Minister, did you or did you not say that to Simon Holmes a Court?","Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Reform) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1[6]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[70]/talk.text/body/p","Senator DAVID POCOCK (Australian Capital Territory) ","(22:06):"
"0","0","0","1","1","Senator David Pocock ","I0N","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," No. And, I might add, we told the journalist that I didnt, and he never reported it. That is not the sort of language I use either, publicly or otherwise.   Minister, can you confirm that, under your legislation, entities are able to take donations under this proposal before passing them on to other entities? For example, its common practice for branches of parties to accept donations into a bank account, check that the donor is not a prohibited donor and then pass on the donation to the party head office. For many Independent campaigns, its common practice for a Voices of group to accept donations and then transfer those to the candidate once they are endorsed by the community. If donations are legal and declared, will such practices still be valid under your proposal?  Thank you for your question. Were not supporting super PAC models here like in the United States. So, if your question is, Will they be allowable? the answer is, no, they wont. But, if a transfer is clearly reported and ends up in a federal account, yes, that is permissible.  Thanks for clarifying that. So I assume it is okay for that to happen. With the JSCEM review, all major parties made submissions saying that they needed increased administrative funding in order to deal with any realtime disclosure regime or increased regulatory burden. What consideration has been given to the ability of new entrants to comply with these laws without such funding?  Thank you, Senator Pocock. The administrative funding is only available to existing candidates.  Thank you, Minister. That perfectly leads me to my next question. The explanatory memorandum is silent on incumbency benefits. How were incumbency factors considered when modelling the expenditure caps and the donation caps?  Thank you for your question. Well get back to fundamental principles here. The whole point of this legislation is to create a level playing field, to allow ordinary Australians to participate in the electoral process and to limit big money in our electoral system. So how do new entrants benefit? Well, they benefit in all of those ways. The task of raising money is nowhere near as great as it was prior to this legislation and—  This is a point of order on relevance. Were running up on time. Im just interested in how incumbency factors were considered when modelling the caps.","Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Reform) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1[6]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[73]/talk.text/body/p","Senator FARRELL (South Australia—Minister for Trade and Tourism, Special Minister of State and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) ","(22:09):"
"0","0","0","1","1","MemberContinuation","287062","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","The CHAIR: Ill just take that as not a point of order but another question. Minister.   We may have to just agree to disagree again, Senator Pocock. This whole regime is all about putting downward pressure on the costs so that, for new entrants, it is less expensive. If this legislation were in place at the last election, Senator Pocock, you would not have had to raise $1.7 million to get yourself elected. There would have been a ceiling that both you were subject to as a new competitor and the existing incumbents—exactly the same amount of money, to limit it. If youre saying that the system should allow more money for new incumbents to spend, I dont agree with that. If were going to have a fair electoral system, then I say you have to have a level playing field, and a level playing field is applying the caps equally to all participants in the process.  Thank you, Minister. I might just explain, for the chamber, how the cap would actually work. In the territory, a new entrant could spend $600,000 on their Senate campaign. The Liberal and Labor candidates could spend $600,000 on their campaign, promoting themselves. If one of the parties thinks that this new entrant is a threat to the seat that theyve held for 50 years, they could spend as much money as they are willing to allocate under their $90 million national cap as long as that advertising does not mention that person. This is the crux of the level playing field disagreement that Minister Farrell and I have. I have a lot of respect for the way that Minister Farrell is able to get things done, and Im not going to go down into personal attacks. But that is the fact of it—if you ask the department or read the legislation. Its not the level playing field were hearing about. There is the benefit of being a party. Minister, I asked about consideration thats been given to the ability of new entrants to comply with the realtime disclosures and all the things that youve been talking about. We know that MPs get 30 grand a year and senators get 15 grand a year to do that. Can you please confirm that no consideration has been given to the ability of new entrants to comply with new laws without the additional administrative funding.","Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Reform) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1[6]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[80]/talk.text/body/p[2]","N/A","N/A"

Youve reiterated some points that youd made previously, and I really have to disagree with you about the advantage that the existing parties get by virtue of their ability to promote the party as distinct from the individual. We are reducing by 30 per cent the amount of money that the Labor Party and the Liberal Party can spend on promoting their party. The comparison cant be the fact that the existing parties can spend that money. The comparison has to be: what can those parties do now, and what are they not going to be able to do under this new legislation? Thats got to be the comparison. I say: for a new entrant into the scheme, thats a good thing. Thats an advantage you have under this legislation which you did not have under the previous legislation. Given the amounts of money that are pulled out of the Australian political system as a result of this legislation, that does give the new contestants an advantage which they dont currently have. They dont currently have that advantage. They are going to be advantaged by this legislation, and, in the process, democracy is going to be a damn sight better in this country.

I understand that there was some desire for stakeholders to have an independent statutory review, not just a JSCEM one. Is there an independent statutory review provision? If not, was there ever and did the Liberal Party ask you to drop that in order to get their support?  The government always supported a JSCEM review.

(3) A determination under subsection (1) remains in force for 12 months after it is made, unless it is revoked earlier. (4) The Electoral Commission may, by written notice to the applicant, revoke a determination under subsection (1) if the Commission is no longer satisfied of the matter in paragraph (1)(b). Subsection (2) does not apply to a decision of whether or not to revoke a determination under this subsection. Effect of presumption (5) If a person is, under a determination made under subsection (1), presumed not to be a relevant donor, then sections 314AGD, 314AGE and 314AGF do not apply in relation to a gift made by or on behalf of the person. (6) However, subsection (5) does not apply to a person who knows that information provided to the Electoral Commission in connection with the making of the determination was false or misleading in a material particular. (7) The onus of proving that a person is not presumed not to be a relevant donor under a determination made under subsection (1) is born by: (a) in proceedings under section 314AGD—the Commonwealth; or (b) in proceedings for an offence against section 314AGE or 314AGF—the prosecution. Register of determinations (8) The Electoral Commission must maintain, and publish on the Commissions website, a register of determinations made under subsection (1).
