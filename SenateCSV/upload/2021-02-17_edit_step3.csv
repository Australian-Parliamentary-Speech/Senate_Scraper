"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I rise to speak on the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019. Labor is proud to have established a standalone specialist family court under the Whitlam government. Today we stand here to defend its ongoing existence. These bills threaten the existence of a specialist family court in Australia and so should be opposed. Together these bills represent the most significant reform of the Family Court since its creation in 1975.  What these bills seek to do is combine the Federal Circuit Court and the Family Court into one court with two divisions. That court would then be called the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia. The current Family Court of Australia would become Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 1), while the Federal Circuit Court of Australia would become the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2). Like the courts that they would be replacing, the Division 1 court would deal exclusively with family law matters, including the most complex matters, while the Division 2 court would deal with family law and other federal law matters. Both divisions would operate under the leadership of a single Chief Justice and Deputy Chief Justice, with a single set of rules and a single point of entry. The appeals division of the Family Court would not be replaced with anything. Instead, all Division 1 judges would be able to hear appeals either as a single judge or as part of a full court. The proposal to merge these courts is not based on any consultation with Australian families or family law experts. Instead, it is based on an inadequate review from PwC that cites evidence from other reports put together not by experts in this area but rather by bean counters at Ernst & Young and KPMG. Rather than a merger or amalgamation of courts, the evidence actually points to the need for a specialist family court to be more pronounced and better resourced. The Australian Law Reform Commission noted, in its 2019 report on the family law system, that, when the court was established, it could not have been foreseen that it would be seeing the level or growth in incidents of family violence and child abuse that it does now. But, as we know, it is typical of this government to commission an expert review only to then completely ignore it and allow it to collect dust on the top shelf. The realisation of Whitlams vision of a specialist family law court with interrelated colocated services and resources was about creating a structure that could deal not just with the legal rights of those appearing before it but also with their unique human problems. Finally realising this vision, not backing away from it, has never been more important than now. Vulnerable children and families need a system that is not only efficient but also safe and sensitive to their particular needs and vulnerabilities. This is not to say that there are not problems with the Family Court as it exists today. There are. The Australian Law Reform Commission report that I previously mentioned notes that the system: … has been deprived of resources to such an extent that it cannot deliver the quality of justice expected of a country like Australia, and to whose family law system other countries once looked and tried to emulate. We recently heard the word neglect used in relation to the agedcare sector when the royal commission released its interim report. But this is not the only area that this government has neglected. Under this government, the Federal Court and family courts have been wilfully neglected—first by the Abbott government, then by the Turnbull government and now by the Morrison government. They have starved them of funding, sat on new appointments and ignored a stream of sensible reviews that flagged problems along the way. A cynic might think that all of this has been a deliberate effort of systematic deterioration in order to justify the courts merger. This government has ignored any opportunity to fix the family law system and instead is pursuing its illadvised structure that is sure to make an already bad situation worse. There has been next to no consultation on these bills, at least not in any meaningful sense—no consultation with legal professionals; no consultation with counsellors or psychologists, especially those working with children; and no consultation with family specialists or families with experience of the system, not to mention the already mentioned dismissal of numerous expert reports, including that from the Australian Law Reform Commission. And, apart from the Chief Justice, the government did not even consult with the judges of the Family Court. The government are not interested in implementing evidence based policy. Instead, they are pursuing ideological pet projects, even when they put the health, safety and wellbeing of Australian families at risk. These bills have a list of opponents longer than a month of Sundays. More than 100 different stakeholders, from the Law Council of Australia to various community legal centres, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services, child protection advocates, disability services and womens legal services have all written to the AttorneyGeneral and asked him to abandon his plans as outlined in these bills. He has ignored their expert advice. The government have ignored their advice that the abolition of the Family Court will harm already vulnerable children and families in need of specialist family law assistance. They have ignored the advice that the abolition of the Family Court will place further stresses on Federal Circuit Court judges, who are struggling under unsafe, unsustainable and unconscionable workloads. They have ignored their advice that the abolition of the Family Court will increase, rather than decrease, cost, time and stress for families and children in the family law system. And they have failed to address any of the fundamental problems plaguing the family law system, including the risk of family violence survivors falling through the cracks. Noone likes this legislation. Noone in the system thinks this legislation is a good idea. Just listen to what eminent experts have said of the proposed merger of the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court. An honourable senator: Point of order: I dont know that youre allowed to use your phone to take photographs in the chamber. The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Yes. Sorry. Please continue, Senator Kitching.","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator KITCHING (Victoria) ","(09:31):"
"0","0","0","1","1","MemberContinuation","247512","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Senator KITCHING: The first Chief Justice of the Family Court of Australia, the Hon, Elizabeth Evatt AC, has warned:  Merging the Family Court into a generalist court will undermine the integrity and the structural specialisation of the Family Court. The impact of losing this institutional specialisation is not properly understood, and has been downplayed. The increasing number of cases in which issues of family violence and child abuse are raised has led to an even greater need today for family law jurisdiction to be vested exclusively in specialised judges who can give their full attention to the needs of family law clients without being diverted to exercise other unrelated jurisdictions. The current bill undermines this principle, is not in the public interest and should not be enacted. The second Chief Justice of the Family Court, the Hon. Alastair Nicholson AO, RFD, QC, who served in that position for 16 years from 1988, backed up Ms Evatts arguments, noting: It is unbelievable that Government would propose the dissolution of a Federal Superior Court in this fashion without the most careful and searching Public Inquiry and without carrying out significant research and without consulting the many experts in this field. Thats the Hon. Alastair Nicholson, one of the most experienced people in this jurisdiction. He went on to say: What those proposing this merger do not seem to understand is that family law is complex and nuanced, and it is not to be judged by the output by numbers of cases as if the Courts are sausage machines. Throughput is important, but so is the quality of the decisions made. The National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services noted these bills will: … disproportionately impact the most vulnerable including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and families who need the most support. Pauline Wright, the President of the Law Council of Australia, said the Family Court is a respected, specialised and focused court dealing with family law issues, before she posited that its abolition would mean: Australian families and children will have to compete for the resourcing and hearing time with all federal matters—that is, other matters like migration, bankruptcy and those sorts of things that the Federal Circuit Court and the Federal Court deal with. There must be an increase not a decrease in specialisation in family law and violence issues. This is critical for the safety of children and victims of family violence. The Law Council of Australia, Community Legal Centres Australia and Womens Legal Services Australia have variously said that these bills are a terrible gamble with the lives of children and families, that they are a retrograde step, that they will expose survivors of family violence to unnecessary risk and that the focus of the government should be on ensuring the safety and best interests of the child and the safety of adult victimssurvivors of family violence in family law proceedings. Despite the governments protestations, there is no real rationale for these bills. Currently, there are two separate courts, a specialist Family Court of Australia and the nonspecialist Federal Circuit Court of Australia, that hear family law matters in Australia. The government is claiming that these bills will help reduce delays and backlogs in these two courts by creating a single point of entry for federal family law matters. Frankly, this is nonsense. The people I have quoted are of the opinion that the delays are a direct result of actions by this government. It is a government that is causing unacceptable delays in the family court system—delays caused by the starvation of funding, delays caused by the refusal of new appointments and delays caused by wilfully ignoring numerous sensible expert reviews. Average waiting times for the production of a family report by a family consultant have blown out. As at 12 March 2020, it was 11 months and sixtonine months respectively for the Federal Circuit Court and the Family Court in Sydney, it was 7.5 months and fivetoseven months respectively in Melbourne, and it was 4.25 months for each court in Hobart. The Morrison government and what they are doing here today is only part of the problem. This goes back seven years. It spans three Liberal governments and a series of deliberate measures to undermine the family court system. As the experts have made clear, this merger proposal will do nothing to address delays in the family court system. Theres nothing in this bill that will increase the number of judges, registrars and other court staff. Theres nothing in this bill that will force the AttorneyGeneral to do his job, even something as basic as appointing new judges as vacancies are created. Theres nothing in this bill that will help Australian families. There is nothing in this bill that will help the most vulnerable in our society.","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[14]","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","1","MemberContinuation","247512","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," Today we again see misplaced socalled reform come before this chamber. The government has been intent on merging the Federal Circuit Court and the Family Court of Australia, and we know that these bills, the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019, were previously rejected by the Senate. I cant remember if they were actually put, but we went through a complex Senate inquiry that looked in detail at the issues raised by the desire to merge the two courts and it was found that this merger was not supported by the evidence. Minister Porter has gone ahead with pushing this merger while hes yet to act on the substantial issues raised by the Australian Law Reform Commissions report into family law in Australia.  What we have here is legislation that impacts on the most vulnerable families at a time when they need support, at a time when they need dispute resolution most and at a time when we see, across our country, family violence and abuse on the rise. What we see here is, in effect, the Family Court of Australia ceasing to be a specialist, standalone superior court. It would be collapsed into Australias busiest and most overburdened court—that is, the Federal Circuit Court—which deals with a great diversity of issues. Weve known since the creation of the Family Court that the vision for the court was as a specialist family court with interrelated, colocated resources and services. As our late, great Prime Minister Gough Whitlam said, a court with regard to the human problems of couples and families, not just their legal rights. What we have here are not general issues that other generalist courts deal with; they are of the most fundamental nature to our being. The court makes lifechanging decisions about childrens lives. It is essential, in my view, that the distinguishing feature of the Family Court, which is its specialisation in families, must not be abolished; it must continue to exist. It is bizarre and ridiculous to me that the government think they can merge this court into a much busier court and retain the same emphasis on the services required. But I guess Im not surprised, because I havent seen any evidence yet of the governments desire to put more specialist services into the Family Court. I know that in particular communities around Australia they have done some trials looking at innovative ways of resolving Family Court disputes, but there isnt systemic support for what is a nationwide problem. The Australian Law Reform Commission found: … the family law system has been deprived of resources to such an extent that it cannot deliver the quality of justice expected of a country like Australia, and to whose family law system other countries once looked and tried to emulate. They are telling words indeed. The first time this legislation came forward, the Australian Law Reform Commission was newly commissioned to undertake a review. Nevertheless, Minister Porter sought to push on with this court merger as if it were a great priority. Again, it is not just the reform of family law issues but the very resourcing of the courts and services that has been underdone. What the government has done is, frankly, to blame the family law system for being inefficient, when the statistics do not back up that argument. This merger is taking place without consultation with family specialists, like counsellors and child psychologists—noone other than the Chief Justice. Its taking place without any judges of the Family Court being able to participate. I know from my previous experience in Senate inquiries on these issues that judges have to be very circumspect about making appearances before Senate committees because of the separation of powers. It wasnt seen as proper that they talk to us directly, but enough judges have put their voices up for us to hear very clearly what their views are. We very much need in our nation a specialised court that provides a system that is safe and sensitive to the particular needs and vulnerabilities of children and families. I very much recognise that this legislation undermines that need. I come from the state of Western Australia, where we have our own Family Court that hasnt been merged with the federal system. As a result of that we were able to do things like samesex de facto recognition back in the early 2000s. We have a court system that tries to focus, not only in law but also in the way it is resourced, on responding to the needs of the community. Right now almost 70 per cent of matters before the Commonwealth Family Court involve allegations of family violence. We really need a system that bolsters specialisation in this critical area. I have to say that this legislation does nothing but undermine that. Its a bad situation for families. Its a bad situation for victims of family violence. We need cultural competence and we need resources in our Family Court. As I highlighted before, WA is the only state with a state based Family Court. In WA we have effectively two divisions—magistrates and judges—operating seamlessly to determine family law issues. I would very much be the first to recognise that that state system has its challenges with resourcing et cetera, but, as Minister Christian Porter would know, as a former AttorneyGeneral of Western Australia, Western Australians value the expertise and focus of that court. The last thing that would be acceptable to the state of WA is some kind of generic court system. Minister Porter would know that. It would never have been something he would have put forward at the state level and it should not be put forward now. The 2008 Future governance options for federal family law courts in Australia report, which is called the Semple report, recommends that kind of system. It has been endorsed by stakeholders, including Womens Legal Services Australia and the Law Council of Australia. Again, the AttorneyGeneral should know this. I guess Minister Porter is just looking for some things to put his stamp on, because hes not capable of engaging properly with the kinds of cultural and legal issues that are really at the core of enhancing peoples rights and protecting their vulnerabilities. We know that family violence is on the rise and we in this place want to be promoting safety for children and safety for adults by preserving access to this specialist Family Court. Over the last seven years of the Liberal government we have had a family law system that has been one of neglect. I think these bills makes that much worse, putting people into a much bigger melting pot of the legal system. We have a government thats cut funding to legal assistance, failed to replace retiring judges in a timely way and failed to respond to the dozens of recommendations that have been made by experts to improve the family law system. So we have a family law system that has been underresourced and a family law system that has failed to have the kinds of laws within it that are necessary for a quality system, and yet this AttorneyGeneral has sought to blame the Family Court itself for some of these problems. We have seen an increase in the number of unrepresented litigations, and these typically take longer to resolve. Why? Because of a lack of resourcing. The Law Reform Commission completed the most comprehensive review into the family law system thats ever been conducted. It did not recommend this merger, and the government has failed yet to even respond. So what flimsy evidence is the government basing this on? Instead, its the discredited sixweek desktop review by PricewaterhouseCoopers, by two accountants. Thats the evidence base for these radical reforms. We quizzed PricewaterhouseCoopers about these reports in the Senate committees, and, indeed, the statistics dont take account of the complexity of matters. They simply looked at time lines in the statistics for the resolution of cases. So, once you account for those factors, if you were to take into account complexity, then there is no evidence base at all to say that one court is more efficient than the other, especially in an environment where youve got unrepresented people before the court, especially in an environment where legal services have been defunded and especially in a system where the law reform itself that should be embedded in these courts hasnt been addressed. Theres a clear consensus among experts that collapsing the courts is a bad thing. Its a bad thing in terms of harming vulnerable children and families in need of specialist family law assistance, increased cost, increased time and stress for families and children in the system, and increased stress on Federal Circuit Court judges, who are already under unsustainable workloads. I recognise that Federal Circuit Court judges do currently deal with family law matters, but this is not their area of expertise, and it is an area of expertise that we should be supporting the growth of in terms of specialist courts and a specialist system. Evidence from experts on this merger proposal is that it will increase costs and increase time and stress for families and children. It will place further stress on Federal Circuit Court judges, and I also find that alarming. We have a family law system that is already in crisis in this country, and this socalled reform and merger of the courts is the last thing the court system and families of Australia need.","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator PRATT (Western Australia) ","(09:44):"
"0","0","0","1","1","MemberContinuation","247512","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I rise to speak in extreme opposition to this proposal to merge the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court. This government bill, the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, has been brought on today in an awful hurry after, it seems, one of the crossbenchers changed their mind about their view on the bill. This bill, together with the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019, has been hanging around for years and its been a bad idea since the day dot.  I dont think theres anyone who thinks the Family Court is working terribly well at the minute. We hear harrowing stories of justice delayed, and Im sure every knows that justice delayed is justice denied. There is a lack of proper training for judicial officers and support staff in spotting and responding to domestic violence and supporting those affected, and there is desperate underfunding of community legal centres and other folk who support people seeking to access the Family Court, but merging the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court wont fix either of those problems. Im just baffled as to why the government thinks that this is a good idea. It was a friendless proposal until this morning. I think its One Nation and Senator Patrick who have decided to support this legislation. Noone else in the profession thinks this merger is a good idea. None of the constituents Ive spoken to on this matter think this will fix any of the problems they have in getting their issues properly dealt with in the Family Court. The fact is that the court is underresourced and theres a massive backlog. You dont fix that by adding it in with a different jurisdiction; you fix it by properly resourcing the court, hiring some more judges. The court themselves have a proposal to hire some more registrars to deal with some of the less legally intense aspects. It seems a meritorious suggestion, as long as more judges are hired as well. There are so many things that could, and should, be done to fix up the problem. This is the wrong solution to the right problem. Its baffling to me that the AttorneyGeneral, in the face of so many letters, so many submissions and so many experts saying, Wrong way; go back, is persisting with this nonsense proposal that wont fix anything. The safety of children needs to be paramount in the Family Court, and one of the advantages of the Family Court is that it is a specialist jurisdiction. It is a superior court, as its called in the legalese, with specialist expertise. Merging it with a generalist court can only, logic would hold, reduce specialisation. In this day and age, when we have an epidemic of violence against women and their children and when many of the cases that end up in the Family Court in fact feature it as an element, why on earth would you reduce the specialisation of the courts to deal with that matter? Yes, of course we need more training for the judges, registrars and other support services that surround the victims of violence who are seeking to access justice through the Family Court, but we will have less of that when we reduce the specialisation of the Family Court. It genuinely beggars belief that the government could think this is in any way a good idea, for anyone. So we strongly oppose this legislation. Of course, it is not the first time the government has sought to bring these bills on. Theyve been hanging around since 2018. Everyone recommended against them and theyre still recommending against them now, but thats falling on ears that just will not hear sense. As part of a separate but related inquiry into family law matters, I attended a briefing in recent times and was told of the reforms that the court is already undertaking. There is already a process to harmonise court rules. So whatever administrative efficiencies can be gained and whatever closer associations there need to be are already happening. We do not need this merger to deliver administrative efficiencies, and it certainly wont deliver justice. It will reduce specialisation. It is an overly complex and illfitting solution that does not address the real problems. We are concerned about the loss of specialisation in the Family Court. We are concerned that survivors of domestic violence will continue to be retraumatised through the justice system and will now have an even less appropriate forum in which to raise those matters. Womens organisations oppose this legislation. Even a bevy of former Family Court judges oppose this legislation. I might take this chance to highlight some of those concerns. I have a letter here that was signed by more than 150 professionals in this space. Some of them are exjudges. The Law Council is a signatory. Many of the womens support services have signed on. Its a letter to the letter to the AttorneyGeneral and Im going to quote selectively from it. One paragraph says: Any reform should strengthen a system, not lead to the diminution of specialisation. If the Governments proposed reforms proceed, we will lose a standalone specialist superior family court. It goes on to say: We … support having a single entry point to the family courts and common rules so the … system is easier for families to navigate. But— … this can be done without abandoning the benefits otherwise available to children and families from a properly resourced and specialised court system. Theyve referred to the fact that those rules are in the process of being harmonised, and they too support that process. But we do not need to be merging these two courts and diluting the specialisation of the Family Court in order to achieve those administrative efficiencies. Indeed, what should the driver be here? It should be the safety of children and people seeking justice, and it should be facilitating affordable access to justice, not simply a boxticking exercise for the AttorneyGeneral. Those signatories to the letter go on to say: We believe an increase in specialisation in family law and family violence will increase the safety of children and adult victimssurvivors of family violence … The need for increased specialisation of courts to improve decisions and outcomes for families is supported by the evidence of many inquiries. … … … The safety of children and adult victimssurvivors of family violence requires increased specialisation. The proposed merger serves only to undermine that important need. This is a ludicrous proposal. It has no friends, bar a couple of folk on the crossbench who happen to have the balance of power in the Senate. This will further delay the delivery of justice. It will further reduce the ability of the courts to acknowledge and address family violence. It will continue to disenfranchise people seeking justice from the courts. It doesnt fix the underfunding of community legal centres and other support services. It doesnt fix the understaffing of courts, when it comes to the numbers of judicial officers and the workload that they have. It doesnt fix the problem of costly applications to the court. It doesnt fix any of those real problems, which have real impacts on real peoples lives. It is the most shameless and disappointing of proposals to hold out false hope, when this isnt going to solve anything. In fact, its going to make it worse. So we oppose this legislation with the strongest possible might of our party. We have much support in that regard but, sadly, it seems that, with the change of one vote from a crossbench member, this bill may well pass the Senate today. We will be doing everything we can to stop that because we believe that justice should be accessible, that specialisation is appropriate and necessary and that more resourcing for the Family Court—not a dilution of its specialisation with this merger—is whats needed to protect women, children and others seeking access to the family law justice system.","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator WATERS (Queensland—Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate) ","(09:59):"
"0","0","0","1","1","MemberContinuation","247512","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," Today the parliament is again considering the Morrison Liberal governments attempt to dissolve the specialist Family Court of Australia as a standalone superior court. Should the parliament accept this legislation, it would be a sad end indeed to a decadesold institution which has served Australia well. The Family Court of Australia, of course, is an institutional legacy of the Whitlam Labor government. It has a proud legacy and has served our nation well. The enactment of the Family Law Act 1975 saw two significant social reforms for the nation. It brought about the key milestone for Australian women of nofault divorce and it established, finally and with much need, a standalone multidisciplinary court designed specifically to consider disputes arising within the family.  The Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 and Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019 represent the most significant change to the structure of family law in this nation since that time, 46 years ago. So it is more than appropriate that this matter be given the sort of consideration and debate worthy of the institution and the critical matters it deals with. Let us briefly consider some of the history of family law and the court in Australia. I know that other senators have spoken about the work of former Labor AttorneyGeneral Kep Enderby, but it is important that the Senate hear these words again. This is a critical piece of legislation that needs to be defeated. Shortly after the passage of the Family Law Act in 1975, Mr Enderby said: In public discussion of the Family Law Act, most of the attention has understandably, and quite properly, focused on the ground of divorce and, to a lesser extent, the maintenance provisions. While not underrating the magnitude of the reforms to the divorce and maintenance laws, I feel sure that, in time, the provision for the establishment of Family Courts will come to be seen as a reform of equal importance. Mr Enderby later said that the essential distinguishing feature of the Family Court is that it would be dealing only with family law matters. This has been critical. Yet the proposition before us today would abolish this essential distinguishing feature. It would roll the Family Court into one of Australias busiest and most poorly resourced and overburdened courts, the Federal Circuit Court. And what of the modernday role of the Family Court in Australia? Much has been said about its pivotal role and vital need as an important institution. In 2019, the Australian Law Reform Commission delivered a landmark report on the family law system. It should be noted in this place that, whilst the government commissioned the report, it has completely ignored it. In the report, the commission noted that, at the time of passage of the Family Law Act, the Whitlam government did not, quite reasonably, foresee the growth in the incidence and awareness of family violence that would come. Thus the need for a specialist court to deal with these sensitive matters has only grown. We must consider what specialisation actually means. At the time of its establishment, the specialised court was envisaged as one in which the environment would have regard to the human problems, as Whitlam described it, of couples and families, not simply a clinical and sanitised institution that solely considered legalistic matters and requirements. It was to be a court with interrelated and colocated services and resources for families. This is a critically important distinction, especially for vulnerable children and families in need of a safe and sensitive environment. It is universally understood and accepted that the family court system, at present, suffers from serious deficiencies. We need only look at the findings from the Australian Law Reform Commission, which determined that the family law system: … has been deprived of resources to such an extent that it cannot deliver the quality of justice expected of a country like Australia, and to whose family law system other countries once looked at and tried to emulate. Thats a sad indictment indeed of the current state of affairs for families in need of a swift and quality judicial experience. The last seven years, in particular, have brought about such neglect. It would be hard to consider it to be anything other than deliberate—a deliberate trashing of Australias system of family law from successive conservative governments. It started with deliberate cuts and neglect by the government led by Mr Tony Abbott. It continued with further cuts and neglect by the government led by Mr Turnbull and now Mr Scott Morrison. How has that neglect manifested itself? It started with the failure to replace judges of the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court in a timely manner. Despite increased demands for services, funding has not been delivered to meet that demand. The recommendation of repeated reviews has been continuously ignored—parked on the bench to gather dust. After all of that, the governments solution is this legislation before us. Instead of working to fix the family law system, these bills will only make this situation much worse, and that is bad news for Australian families and vulnerable people, including vulnerable children. The governments bills seek to combine two distinct courts into one. They trash the concept set forth by the Whitlam government of a single, standalone and specialised family court designed to deal with the sensitive human problems of family law. In combining the Federal Circuit Court and the Family Court, both these divisions would share the same single Chief Justice and Deputy Chief Justice. They would share a single set of rules and a single point of entry. Worryingly, the Appeal Division of the Family Court would not be replaced with anything. The same bench of judges would hear matters both in the original jurisdiction and on appeal. When this merger was originally proposed by the government, the AttorneyGeneral said that he would stop appointing new judges to Division 1 as they retire. That would obviously amount to a gradual abolition of Division 1—that is, the Family Court of Australia—over time. Whilst he backed away from this proposition after sustained public criticism, there is nothing in this legislation that would prevent him from reverting back to his original position. He can, once again, have a change of mind and simply stop appointing judges. We are supposed to simply take him at his word. Unsurprisingly, there are few who do when it comes to this AttorneyGeneral. Even if changes were made to this legislation to guarantee the continuation of the proposed Division 1, the Family Court, it would not address the fundamental problem at the heart of this legislation—that is, the abolition of specialisation within our Australian system of family law. So, why such a radical departure? Perhaps the government are relying on a quantum of supporting evidence. Perhaps theyve consulted widely to reach and form this view. No, and no—no such evidence, no such consultation. The Morrison government claims that the proposed merger has been informed by independent reviews and inquiries over a decade. On his departmental website, the minister, the AttorneyGeneral, has named five reports under a heading that reads The evidence base for the reforms. However, unfortunately, like most of the work produced by this AttorneyGeneral, it doesnt even make sense. Not one of the reports he lists has recommended these radical reforms. In fact, none of those reports have even considered these reforms. Just one of the reports recommended restructuring the Family Court. However, the model recommended would have maintained—would have maintained!—a standalone specialised court. Not once in almost 70 reviews of the family law system undertaken since 1974 has it ever been recommended that the family court system of Australia should be restructured in the way proposed by this government. These reviews and reports are all listed in appendix 3 to the interim report of the Joint Select Committee on Australias Family Law System, but the AttorneyGeneral continues to ignore all this, continues to ignore the evidence cited by his own department and this parliament. But senators in this place should not ignore the evidence. What evidence does the government rely on? Amazingly, the most radical change to the structure of family law in Australia has been done off the back of a sixweek desktop review of data by two accountants. Thats it. It should be noted that this review has been widely panned and thoroughly discredited. And what about consultation on this legislation? There has not been any meaningful consultation with the legal profession or with any other family specialists, like counsellors or child psychologists. There was no consultation with users of the family law system—Australian families—other than with the Chief Justice. The government did not even consult with the judges of the Family Court. Such a radical reform should not be undertaken with such scant regard for consultation. Yet, it is no wonder the government did not wish to consult, because they would have come across naught but an avalanche of opposition. Lets look at some of the commentary, opinion and analysis on this legislation. A letter that was sent to all members of parliament indicates its opposed by over 155 stakeholders, including 13 retired judges. Signatories also include community legal centres, the Law Council of Australia, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services, child protection advocates, womens legal services, disability services and many more. Theyve written to the AttorneyGeneral, asking him to abandon this proposal. They have been silenced; their views have been ignored. To the last, these opponents have made it clear that it is their combined view that this proposal will increase, rather than decrease, cost, time and stress for families and children in the family law system; harm vulnerable children and families in need of specialist family law assistance; place further stressors on the Federal Circuit Court judges, who are struggling under unsafe, unsustainable and unconscionable workloads; and fail to address any of the fundamental problems plaguing the family law system, including the risk of family violence survivors falling through the cracks. The very first Chief Justice of the Family Court of Australia, Elizabeth Evatt AC, has said: The proposed merger of the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court (FCC) will lead to undesirable outcomes for children and families. The Hon. Alastair Nicholson, the second Chief Justice of the Family Court, who served in that position between 1988 and 2004, has fully supported Ms Evatts remarks. Mr Nicholson has also said, in biting criticism: It is unbelievable that government would propose the dissolution of a Federal Superior Court in this fashion without the most careful and searching Public Inquiry and without carrying out significant research and without consulting the many experts in this field. He went on to say, in pointed remarks: The Family Court is a Court that has been envied throughout the common law world and its judgments have often been cited with approval by the courts of many countries including New Zealand, UK, Canada, the USA and others. Its significance as the only specialist Family Court set up as a superior Court of Record and particularly that of its Appeal Division cannot be over emphasised. There are so many groups, organisations and experts in this field that have asked the government to stop with this reform and stop with this legislation. But the government has been unprepared to listen and unprepared to back down, and its not good enough. We know that this legislation, if enacted, will lead to worse outcomes for very vulnerable families. I believe that, amongst the people that have written to all the senators and members here, there are a number of highly specialised expert organisations from South Australia. Weve got the Coalition of Womens Domestic Violence Services of South Australia. Weve got the Family Violence Legal Service Aboriginal Corporation (SA). There is JusticeNet SA, the South Australian community legal centres—and it goes on. So I ask those senators to look to their own, to look to their state experts as to what they are saying— (Time expired)","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator CAROL BROWN (Tasmania) ","(10:08):"
"0","0","0","1","1","MemberContinuation","247512","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I too rise to speak on the governments Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 and a related bill. Lets be very clear about the governments intention with this bill. This bill would destroy the Family Court of Australia, leaving families and children at risk. This government has been hard at work for some time running down the Family Court. There have been unacceptable delays in replacing retiring Family Court and Federal Circuit Court judges. Funding has not increased in response to increasing demand for Family Court services. Review after review with critical recommendations has been ignored by this government. And, instead of fixing the family law system, the government wants to restructure the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court in a way that would make a bad situation even worse for so many Australian families and leave Australian children vulnerable. The Law Council of Australia has described the governments proposal as a terrible gamble with the lives of children and families.  This governments bill is just another chapter in this governments long, long story of builders and wreckers. Its Labor that builds and protects our most significant national institutions. It was Labor that laid the foundation for Australias worldleading Family Court system. We created Medicare, delivering free universal health care to every Australian. We invest in education and training so that our young people can fulfil their potential. We established a universal superannuation system so that working people have dignity in their retirement. We introduced the NDIS, making sure people with a disability are properly supported, and we built the social safety net that is so important for vulnerable Australians. But the Liberals, on the other side, the wreckers, are always trying to tear these institutions down, and this bill is no exception. Why do they do that? Because they just dont understand ordinary Australians, the working families and young people who are trying to build a good life and get ahead, the retirees and the pensioners. They just dont understand the people of Australia. Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam first introduced the bill to establish the Family Law Act back in 1975 in response to what he described as an overwhelming demand for reform. The Family Law Act instituted nofault divorce and it established the critical Family Court of Australia, a specialist, multidisciplinary court for the resolution of family disputes. In 1975, Mr Whitlam said the Family Law Bill was an achievement reflecting the Labor governments: … fundamental social and human priorities. The Family Law Bill … has completely refurbished the marriage and divorce laws of Australia and done away with the medieval concepts of guilt and fault. The Bill has established a Family Court of Australia which will … protect the rights of all parties in divorce proceedings in an atmosphere of dignity and humanity. Ill repeat this for the wreckers on the other side of the chamber: Labors family law reforms were, and remain, a reflection of Labors fundamental social and human priorities—priorities which, with this bill, are in such clear deficit on the other side of the chamber. Labors reforms transformed outcomes for generations of families and, critically, for women and for children. In 1974 the Senate Standing Committees on Legal and Constitutional Affairs described the Family Court as essential to give substance to key aspects of the Family Law Act. The bill before us would collapse the Family Court into one of Australias busiest, most poorly resourced and overburdened courts, the Federal Circuit Court. The bill would erode and ultimately abolish the Family Court of Australia as a specialist court. That specialisation is intended to prioritise the safety of children. Its intended to prioritise the safety of adult victimssurvivors of family violence. Eminent Australian and the first Chief Justice of the Family Court, the Hon. Elizabeth Evatt AC, has said that merging the Family Court will undermine the integrity and structural specialisation of the court: The Family Court was designed purposely as a worldleading, specialist, standalone Court to deal only with family law matters, with the support of a dedicated multidisciplinary team of counsellors and mediators. Its standalone nature is one its greatest attributes, providing protections for vulnerable people in need of family law assistance … Her comments are fully endorsed by the Hon. Alastair Nicholson, the second Chief Justice of the Family Court. He has said that it is unbelievable that the government would propose the dissolution of the Family Court. Let me repeat that word of his: unbelievable. It is unbelievable that the government would propose the dissolution of this court. He also says that the courts specialisation is absolutely necessary to deal with cases that can be extremely complex, involving the determination of issues relating to children, including their rights and need for protection not only from individuals but also from government in its myriad forms. Who here in this chamber today doesnt understand the need to protect Australias vulnerable children? Who here doesnt understand the advice that is coming from these eminent jurists? Its clear that the wreckers on the government benches just really dont care about taking advice or considering the overwhelming evidence on this bill. This bill does not have the support of people who work within our family law system, the very people who work to protect Australias vulnerable children, who work to protect Australias separated families, who work to protect victimssurvivors of family violence. Community Legal Centres Australia have said that moving away from a specialist family court model would be a retrograde step from this government. They say it would expose survivors of violence to unnecessary risk. Womens Legal Services Australias opposition to the governments legislation is, in their words, centred on ensuring the safety and best interests of the child and the safety of adult victimssurvivors of family violence in family law proceedings. And there is this damning observation offered by an eminent family law practitioner, who says: It cant be anything other than ideology, because there are so many groups opposed to it. Consultation with stakeholders on this bill, on the substance of the governments plans to abolish the Family Court in this bill, has been absolutely terrible. It has been missing in action. There has been no meaningful consultation with the legal profession or with other family specialists like counsellors or child psychologists. There has been no consultation with users of the family law system—Australian families. And, other than with the Chief Justice, the government did not even consult with the judges of the Family Court. Over 100 stakeholders, ranging from the Law Council of Australia to womens legal services, community legal centres, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services, child protection advocates and disability services from across the country have written to the AttorneyGeneral to ask him to please abandon this proposal. Their pleas have fallen on deaf ears. This is what they have told the AttorneyGeneral. They say that this proposal will harm vulnerable children and families in need of specialist family law assistance. They say the proposal will increase rather than decrease cost, time and stress for families in the family law system, families who are already under extreme stress. They say this proposal will place further stresses on Federal Circuit Court judges, who are already struggling under unsafe, unsustainable and unconscionable workloads. And they say this proposal will fail to address any of the fundamental problems plaguing the family law system. Again, this bill will fail to address any of the fundamental problems plaguing the family law system, including the risk of family violence survivors falling through the cracks. Womens Legal Services Australia has said: Government commissioned inquiry after inquiry has recommended increasing specialisation of the family law system in family law and family violence. The safety of children and adult victimssurvivors of family violence and ongoing consideration of risk must be foundational in the family law system. If the courts are to merge, we recommend retaining the specialist stand alone superior family court. Likewise, Victorian Women Lawyers does not support the governments bill, observing that there has been overwhelming opposition to the bill by family law experts and stakeholders, including a vast number of submissions from law societies and legal professionals, calling for the bill to be rejected. In particular, VWL is concerned that: ● the Bill prioritises the efficiency of hearing and resolving family law matters over and above the safety and wellbeing of families and children: ● the Bill seeks to reduce the operating costs of hearing family law matters at the expense of ensuring the appropriateness of judicial outcomes; ● the proposed merger of the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court lacks sufficient justification weighed against the interests of parties to family law proceedings, and goes against the recommendations of family law specialists. I want to make particular mention of the governments proposal in the COVID context. While parts of Australia remain in lockdown and remain at risk, for some people home is not always the safe place that it should be. A survey by the Australian Institute of Criminology has revealed more than half of women who had experienced violence before the COVID19 crisis said the violence had become more frequent, more severe, since the start of the pandemic. COVID lockdowns and selfisolation, increased job insecurity and financial pressures are increasing the risk of family violence and family breakdown in our country today. That is why its so astounding the government would decide to pursue this legislation now. More than ever, its time for us to actually strengthen and properly resource a standalone specialist Family Court, not tear it down. But the wreckers on the other side, the wreckers on the government benches, are not listening. This bill, all the evidence says, will do nothing to help Australian families. Instead, the experts tell us that this bill will put Australias vulnerable children at even greater risk. This bill will put Australian families already struggling, already under immense stress, at harm. That is what the experts are telling us about this bill. Australian families deserve better from their government. They deserve protection from their government. They deserve a government that backs them up and supports them, not a government that tears down vital institutions that exist purely for the protection of Australian families. Australian families deserve better.","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator WALSH (Victoria) ","(10:23):"

I tell you who is gaining something out of this and it isnt always the experts out there who said, Do not do this, do not do this, because they would know its gone from a lawyers picnic to a lawyers banquet. Theyre going, You beauty, bring in the money; bring her in, baby. Thats exactly what is going on here. My goodness, like there isnt enough heartache going on in our family court system. Right now its underresourced and understaffed. If you think the heartache and the suicides that are going on out there right now are bad enough, if you have half a conscience over on that side, wait until you see what is coming, because it is a train wreck in action. What is wrong with you people? Youre playing with peoples lives. By the time people get to the Family Court they are vulnerable. The mums and dads are vulnerable, and the poor kids—my goodness!  Where is your conscience? Goodness me. Just take a moment and picture a judge hearing a case in an Australian court. Do me a favour and call up an image of it in your own mind for just one moment—and, if you can get a slight feeling from it, that would be great. If youre one of the lucky people whos never had anything to do with our legal system, you probably expect that the process is fast and fair. I tell you what, it is not. And its not because of the judges, not because of the people who work in our courts, but because of decisions that have been made up here—the underresourcing, the understaffing. It is absolutely atrocious. The harm youre going to bring and what youre already doing to these families is disgusting. No conscience whatsoever—Ive never seen a government like this one, not in my lifetime. You should be ashamed of yourselves. You might picture something like what you see at the end of a cop show on TV. Maybe youre thinking of a system where the bad guys get locked up and the good guys are quickly let go. In the back of your mind, you possibly have an idea that everybody has a highpowered lawyer in an expensive suit—and, my goodness, are they expensive. At the very least, you probably figure that normal people will get decent professional help to navigate through it all. When it comes to someones day before the judge, maybe you imagine that they have a lawyer who uses clever language and careful questions to get to the bottom of their case. If thats what youre thinking, you arent alone; thats how I used to think our court system worked as well. Oh dear. Its funny when you have life experience of something—not just in one year, two years, three years and four years. Its an amazingly different picture that you actually get, because Ive come to realise that this isnt true and thats how things are. Its a fantasy, an absolute fantasy. Our courts dont look like the courts on TV or in movies. The truth is that the process is messy and it is slow and it is incredibly expensive and it is becoming out of reach for many normal Australians out there. Thats where our justice system is going, and that is so unfair. Heres the great divide between the rich and the poor. Even if the system finds the right answers eventually, it can take a lot of pain to get there. The AttorneyGeneral knows this is a problem. He knows that the courts are running too slowly; theyre too ineffective. People like to say the first step towards fixing a problem is admitting you have one, and youve got to give it to the Attorney: he has made the first step. Where hes gone wrong is in how he wants to fix it. He says that we need to merge the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court to clear out the backlog. I dont know where youve been, mate, but youve seen the backlog in the Federal Circuit Court and you want to merge them? I dont know what planet youre sitting on, AttorneyGeneral, but come back to earth—because its causing great harm to many Australians out there. Our court system, the whole lot of it, is in dire straits, and now youre going to throw this Family Court system in with the rest of it. Seriously? Seriously, mate? These bills dont do anything to fix whats going wrong for so many Australian families who find themselves before the courts. Merging the two courts that deal with family law matters wont take the pressure off the judges to get through the hundreds of cases at a time and it wont get people the legal assistance they need to have the best chance that their day in court will go well for them. If the AttorneyGeneral was really committed to making our courts faster and fairer, hed put his money where his mouth is, once and for all, and resource them, because thats whats missing here, mate. Family law cases should be dealt with more quickly and more efficiently so there is less harm done to the family unit, and thats not being done. Now youre just stretching it out, and like I said, I hope you can wear it, mate, and you can sleep at night, because youre going to see a lot more hurt going on in these families, and more suicides. Quite frankly, you disgust me. Some judges in the Circuit Court have over 600 cases on their books. It isnt humanly possible for them to get through that kind of workload in a reasonable amount of time, let alone try and get through every case and understand it. The delays leave people stuck in limbo, waiting for hearing dates that are months away, years away. When they finally get their hearing, theyll again have to wait months for the judges to deliver their findings, because theyre so overstacked. These sorts of delays across all levels of courts are causing the real harm to people and their families. The time it takes to get things resolved is time in which people arent getting justice, either to have their defence upheld or to have their complaint acted upon. For families in the court system, it can mean months or years of waiting to be able to move on from a nasty marriage breakup which has already caused havoc in the family unit itself—let alone the destruction its doing to our Australian kids, our future. It means that a fiveyearold could end up waiting a third of their life before the courts finally figure out whether theyre going to stay with mum or dad. And you wonder why our kids are having bloody psychological issues out there! This isnt a problem that merging the courts will solve. Its happening because the government isnt giving the courts the funding they need to be able to get through the work that they have to do. Its happening because our judges are overworked. Family Court judges are working well into the night every night to get through cases that often involve children who are at risk of abuse and violence. As hard as they work, they have to churn through them as though theyre on a production line, and that is not the way our courts were set up to deal with things. Were asking judges to work as if theyre someone in a burger joint—just chuck on a bit more lettuce, double the cheese; great, no worries!—rushing about to get your orders filled and out the door as fast as possible. How is that justice? How is that bringing justice to any Australian, let alone Australian families? Sometimes judges in the Federal Circuit Court have to deal with 70 legal matters before 10 in the morning. Thats 70 decisions they have to make before most people have even had brunch or their second cup of coffee. Thats what were dealing with. How can any judge give those cases the consideration and care that they deserve? I dont care how good they are at their job; theyre human. They could be the best in the world and they wouldnt be able to get through all that properly. Nobody could, unless they have some sort of superpower. These judges have inherited that somehow, and I dont recall you giving them that, AttorneyGeneral. Every person whos behind a legal case like that has a story to tell, but the judges dont have time to hear them. Instead, theyre in and out as quickly as possible. Thats not how you give broken families justice. All youre doing is bringing them more hurt and more misery. I didnt sign up to be a politician to do that. Obviously the Attorney did though, because the churn of the cases going through the courts means that the chambers end up feeling like a shopping centre. Its a ride up and down the escalators—no worries!—in and out, get your purchases and back out the door. One lawyer spoke out and said that being in the Federal Circuit Court was like being in a zoo. Were sending Australian families into a zoo and expecting them to get a fair hearing. Thats why were asking the legal system to figure out how to look after vulnerable kids. Were asking them to look after our vulnerable kids, and they cant even keep up with the cases. How much do we need to ask of them? I dont think theres much left. I dont think theres anything in reserve. Theyre overstacked and theyre underresourced, and this is not the way to fix it. Parents are supposed to get a fair hearing on whether they can get custody of their children. Instead, theyre running around in a zoo or waiting for the burger. Thats what is going on here. The people who are copping it the most are the families who can least afford it. Its getting further and further away from them, and thats got to bring destruction. Its got to bring destruction to the nation. So the people losing out here are the good old Aussie family, those who are already doing it tough more than likely, the ones who dont have the money to fight these cases in the courts, the families who dont have the money to pay for lawyers banquets. The Attorney knows that. My word he does! Hes got to know that, because apparently hes the Attorney. Hes educated—apparently well educated—so why doesnt he know that? He says people shouldnt have to fork out buckets of money to get before a judge. Hes right. That theres a problem in itself. At least youve picked that up. But talking the talk aint walking the walk, is it? Youre not doing anything to fix it; youre actually making it worse, which is really soul destroying, to be honest with you. Hundreds of people are going through the Family Court on their own. One study on the Family Court and Federal Circuit Court counted nearly 250 hearings where at least one of the parties was selfrepresented, and that is an absolute disaster in itself. Those people might not be getting the legal advice they need, and many of them wont get the best chance to make their case properly to a judge. It makes it harder for judges to get through their huge workload, because those cases usually take longer to get through. Yes, the topup of funding of legal assistance programs last year was welcome, but weve had successive cuts to legal aid funding for decades. A oneoff injection isnt going to cut it. Its not even close. You havent even got to sharpening the knife; I can assure you. If the Attorney were really committed to keeping costs down, he wouldnt be hiking up court fees for people in the Federal Circuit Court like he is doing. Im very worried about the recent fee increases for migration cases in that court. Theyre going to be paying five times what they were paying before. It is the thin edge of the wedge. Its coming. If you think its only going to happen to those immigrants, I can assure you: its coming. Will families be forced to pay five times more than what they are already having to pay now? How many people will lose their chance to get before a court because of those fee hikes? Its terribly worrying. How much more damage will be done to families? Justice shouldnt come more easily to people who can pay for it. This merger wont fix our broken court system. The problems that we have dont come from the Family Court being inefficient and they dont come from confusion about where to lodge a case; the issues are much bigger than that and they go much deeper than that. To push complex family law matters through the Federal Circuit Court is going to end up in absolute disaster, it is going to end up in misery, it is going to take peoples lives, and it is going to cost the economy a lot more. Spend, and it wont cost you more. Fix it in the first place and fix it properly, because youll save in the long run. Werent you taught that growing up, Attorney? Was it all just out of a textbook for you? Get some life experience, because you need it. The Federal Circuit Court is one of the busiest in the country. Along with family matters, it deals with things like migration cases, bankruptcy, intellectual property rights, workplace law, consumer issues and so on. We cant get families the support and services they need if were sending them into a zoo to get their cases heard. They are having to represent themselves to judges who are overworked, tired and dont have the time to hear their stories and their background. Were talking about some of the worst moments of these peoples lives and their kids lives, and they deserve a lot better than that. What is going on here today is so unAustralian. Everybody should have a right to legal representation and fairness. That is what this country is about. You just stuck that knife in today, Attorney, and you twisted it, didnt you? My goodness. Here you go, you most vulnerable families in Australia: take that; thanks for coming! The bills do not get to the heart of where the problem is, because, to fix the problem, the government will need to put a lot more money into it. Theyre not doing it and theyre not going to bother to.","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator LAMBIE (Tasmania) ","(10:38):"

I think what weve seen over the course of the development of these bills, the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019, and their passage through the parliament and over the course of the last 12 months with this Attorney just establishes that you can go to the best schools in the country, you can have the best education and you can be given the best opportunities in life that any young person could expect, but it doesnt guarantee that youll come to public life with any measure of empathy, any measure of a capacity for concern and any measure to discharge your responsibilities as the Attorney in the interests of families and, in particular, the interests of children.  The abolition of the Family Court really says two things. Firstly, it is a catastrophe for Australian families and in particular Australian children. Secondly, it will be an enduring symbol of everything that is wrong with this parliament and everything that is wrong with this government. Firstly, it shows us that weve got a government with no plan for the Australian people and no mobilising vision for itself—and nowhere is this more clear than in this area of family law. This party used to claim the dual mantle of progress and conservatism but now stands for nothing. The Prime Minister stands for nothing, but hes prepared to do anything in his narrow political interests or the governments narrow political interests. Were seeing that unfold with this legislation and were seeing that unfold over many issues, including some of the issues that the parliament has had to confront this week. The government stands for nothing but is prepared to do anything. It is dedicated to only one thing—continuing to occupy the treasury bench. It is dedicated to only one interest—its own narrow, venal political interest. The second thing thats wrong with this legislation, this place, this government and in particular this chamber is the role that the One Nation party is playing, with government support, to dismantle good protections for Australian families. The One Nation party are hanging out with the blackshirted mens movement grievance brigade. Thats what they support. It is barely disguised misogyny and hostility to the interests of Australian children. It is no mystery that this backward nativist outfit supports the abolition of the Family Court. The real mystery is why on earth the government is supporting them. Why on earth would anybody with a shred of common sense or decency support this legislation? I noticed that former Senator Boswell was in the chamber the other day. I cant imagine the sense of disappointment that he must feel after being a leader of the National Party in this place when it took the courage to stand up to One Nation—he tried to provide a different political voice for his constituents and the constituents of the National Party—and defeated the creeping backward nativist political voice, only to have this government bring them back. The responsibility for this resurgent rightwing nasty brigade is all on you. Its your preference strategies, your activity in this chamber and your legislative haggling that has brought it back, and the consequences for Australian families and in particular Australian children are very serious indeed. We have a weak, supine government that stands for nothing and is prepared to incorporate extremists in its electoral strategy. I have to register my deep disappointment with the decision of Senator Patrick to support this legislation. He was elected by people who had lost faith in the major parties and wanted to vote in a way that registered a protest. But this is all about horsetrading. Its entirely about transactional politics. Its entirely about secret deals, with mealymouthed justifications. It is so transactional that some on the crossbench have lost their way entirely and lost perspective entirely. All taken together, theres a dysfunctional chamber and a government that has lost the capacity to govern in the interests of all Australians because its so obsessed with itself. In this case, its bad law—the abolition of the Family Court of Australia—and, in general, it has no plan for Australia. Its time for a new government thats actually prepared to be on the side of Australians, to be on the side of Australian families and Australian children. The Family Law Act in 1975 instituted two major changes: (1) nofault divorce and (2) the establishment of the Family Court of Australia, a specialist, multidisciplinary court for the resolution of family disputes that it was envisaged would support families through the process. The establishment of the Family Court and the Family Law Act did away with the brutal inquisitions, the dehumanising inquisitions, that characterised proceedings under the Matrimonial Causes Act. These two reforms were and are inseparable. They come together, and it is not possible to separate them. It is clear that the agenda, supported by the One Nation Party, is also to do away with the other. I assume, from the governments connivance with them over this legislation and the committee that led to this bill, that there are people in the government who support it. In November 1974 my predecessor in this place Senator Lionel Murphy, the then AttorneyGeneral, made the case for change which has endured until now. He said: The existing law and administration of divorce, custody and other family matters is too humiliating, too complex and too costly. The laws should be changed so that they may be characterised by dignity, simplicity and inexpensiveness. …A broken down marriage should no longer be a prison which can be escaped from only by adultery, cruelty or the like. Prior to the Family Law Act, the Matrimonial Causes Act 1959 set out 14 grounds for divorce, including adultery, desertion, habitual drunkenness, imprisonment and insanity. To get a divorce, one party had to prove that the other party was at fault. The provisions for divorce were costly, protracted and involved indignity and humiliation to the parties because an inquiry into fault was the foundation for the dissolution of a marriage. It doesnt appear that the Morrison government is proposing to reinstitute fault based divorce yet. That, Im sure, will be the subject of another dirty deal with One Nation some time in the future. But what its proposing to do is to undo the second of the major changes introduced by the Family Law Act—the establishment of the court. Its a change being proposed in the absence of a shred of evidence to support it. I heard Senator Lambies account of the experience of Australian families in the Family Court, and I agree with her that the answer to improving the experience of families in the Family Court is to provide them with more support to ensure that there are sufficient justices and sufficient staff to do their work. I imagine that there are very few people who leave their experience in the Family Court of Australia happy. Im sure that most people leave it with some sense of unhappiness and a sense of grievance. Im sure that is true. That is no basis to abolish the court. That is not a reason for the kind of perverted reform that the government proposes here. The government claims that the proposed abolition has been informed by independent reviews and inquiries over a decade. No such thing has occurred. The AttorneyGenerals Departments website lists five reports under the heading The evidence base for the reforms. The only problem with that claim is that none of those inquiries or reports recommended these reforms. None of those reports even thought that this kind of reform was worthy of consideration. None of them. Appendix 3 to the interim report of the Joint Select Committee on Australias Family Law System—whats called the Hanson family law inquiry—lists almost 70 reviews of the family law system that have been undertaken since 1974. Not one of those 70 reports or inquiries listed the abolition of the Family Court as a sensible reform. The AttorneyGeneral and the Morrison government, of course, arent interested in sensible reform. Theyre not interested in improving the lives of families and, in particular, supporting children and getting the best answers for children. The only possible explanation is a continued engagement and dalliance with the One Nation party. That is a grave political mistake. That is a longterm error of judgement from a group that have lost the capacity for good political judgement in the interests of Australian people. Its the One Nation party that resents the existence of the Family Court. Its this government that selected Senator Hanson to cochair the joint select committee along with the soontobeformer member for Menzies. That was a disgrace and it has led us into this place. True to form, Senator Hanson hasnt provided a shred of evidence to support her statements. In a Facebook discussion with selfappointed mens rights activist Leith Erikson, along with Las Vegas stripper aficionado Mr Dickson, Senator Roberts accused the Family Court of being responsible for mens violence towards women. He said: I know you agree with me Leith on that and youve counselled people against that. But when youre a father, and you cant get access to your kids, and you cant get access to the legal system properly, what else is there to do other than check out or hurt the other person? Its that kind of misogyny, the kind of thinking that would have been outofdate at any point in the 20th century, that mobilises the governments thinking and its position of abolishing the Family Court. Its that kind of approach from this government that has mobilised one of the worst pieces of legislation that Ive seen come before this Senate. Its one of the most retrograde, regressive pieces of legislation that is taking this country backwards and is damaging the interests of Australian families and, most of all, Australian children. This should be sent back to where it belongs.","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator AYRES (New South Wales) ","(10:53):"
"0","0","0","1","1","MemberContinuation","247512","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," Three days ago the President of the Law Society of Tasmania went to the media warning that the federal governments failure to appoint another judge to hear Family Court cases in Tasmania is leading to delays and angst for families. He said that one judge in Launceston was doing the work of two judges after a judge retired last November. This means that Tasmania is left with one specialist judge tackling difficult issues including family violence, child abuse and mental health. When the President of the Law Society made this comment, the AttorneyGeneral Christian Porter refused to say if or when the appointment was likely. This scenario is playing out all around Australia and its been playing out that way for many years now. The family law system in this country is in crisis. It is buckling under so much work that some judges are dealing with more than 600 cases and there is a glacial parade of desperate and troubled people.  The court is being starved of resources, and, in some Federal Circuit Court and Family Court registries, it is taking, on average, 12 months for court appointed family consultants to produce family reports. A family report is a critical document that provides an independent assessment of issues in a case. Those reports help judges to make lifechanging decisions about arrangements for children. If anything, the need for a specialist Family Court has become more pronounced over time. As the Australian Law Reform Commission noted in a report the government commissioned but then completely ignored, the Whitlam government, which established the court, could not have foreseen the growth in the incidence and awareness of family violence and child abuse since 1975. Yet the Morrison government persist in refusing to own up to what they are seeking to do with this legislation. They are seeking to abolish the Family Court as a specialist and standalone superior court. This would be a profoundly retrograde step. It would harm Australian families and, in particular, children at their time of greatest need. On this side of the chamber, we view the Family Law Act 1975, which established the principle of nofault divorce and established the Family Court of Australia, as part of the proud Whitlam legacy. Like most of the great social reforms that have occurred in Australia, from Medicare to our worldleading superannuation system, to free legal assistance services for Australians in need, the Family Court of Australia is an institution that has served our nation admirably. That distinguishing feature of specialisation is so important, because family law matters are not like any other matters that generalist courts tend to deal with. The parties to family law matters are not like the parties that generalist courts tend to deal with. They are often very, very vulnerable. Vulnerable children and families need a family court system that is not only efficient but also safe and sensitive to their particular needs and vulnerabilities. The Whitlam governments vision of a specialist law court was of a court with interrelated colocated services and resources. It was about creating an environment that would have regard for what Gough Whitlam described as the human problems of couples and families, not just their legal rights. This legislation would rob the Family Court of that essential distinguishing feature by merging it into one of Australias busiest, most poorly resourced and most overloaded courts, the Federal Circuit Court. To be frank, thats just crazy. Its senseless and its also a friendless idea. But dont get me wrong—there are serious problems in the Family Court at present, but the main cause of those problems is no mystery. The Australian Law Reform Commission found: … the family law system has been deprived of resources to such an extent that it cannot deliver the quality of justice expected of a country like Australia, and to whose family law system other countries once looked and tried to emulate. And its getting worse. Over seven years of Liberal governments under Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull and now Mr Scott Morrison, right around the country Family Court judges have not been replaced in a timely manner. In response to increasing demand, the court has been starved of funds, and review after review, making considered and measured recommendations, has been ignored. Who is suffering in all this? Apart from dangerously overburdened court and support staff and judges, its the families and its children in crisis situations: children experiencing trauma, children who deserve the best service and support that we can provide for them in times of huge anxiety. This governments disgraceful level of neglect in letting these children down so badly should be a cause of national shame. Yet our AttorneyGeneral, Mr Porter, persists in defying logic, ignoring those in crisis and need, relentlessly refusing to appoint judges and provide adequate resources and, with no evidence that it will improve the situation, pushing on with his agenda to collapse the court into the Federal Circuit Court in a way that will make a bad situation worse for Australian families, including vulnerable children. I will summarise the intent of this legislation. It will combine the Federal Circuit Court and Family Court into one court with two divisions. That court would be called the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia. Both divisions would operate under the leadership of a single Chief Justice and a Deputy Chief Justice, with a single set of rules and a single point of entry. The Appeal Division of the Family Court would not be replaced with anything. Instead, all Division 1 judges would be able to hear appeals either as a single judge or as part of a full court. A number of other consequential amendments will be made. When the government originally proposed this merger, in the 45th Parliament, the current AttorneyGeneral said that he would stop appointing new judges to Division 1 as they retire. That would obviously amount to a gradual abolition of Division 1—that is, the Family Court of Australia—over time. The AttorneyGeneral has now backed away from that position and promised to keep appointing judges to Division 1. But theres nothing in this bill that would guarantee the continued existence of Division 1. The AttorneyGeneral made his intentions for this merger very clear in the last parliament, yet now the AttorneyGeneral says, Trust me. All the while, judges are retiring and new appointments are not being made to the Family Court, as we have so recently seen in Tasmania. Even if the bill were amended to guarantee the continued existence of Division 1, that would not address the fundamental problem with this bill, which is that, instead of increasing specialisation in the family law system, the Morrison government is going to water it down by effectively abolishing the Family Court. Some would argue that Mr Porter is trying to kill off our specialist family court by stealth, but he has made his intention clear over two parliaments. As Ive said, his intention is friendless. In fact, it has an overwhelming number of highly credentialled and respected opponents. This is a list of just some of them. There are no less than 110 stakeholders, ranging from the Law Council of Australia to womens legal services, community legal services, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services, child protection advocates and disability services from across Australia, who have written to the AttorneyGeneral to ask to abandon this proposal, and they have all been ignored. These opponents to the proposal have stated that it would harm vulnerable children and families in need of specialist law assistance; that it would increase rather than decrease the cost, time and stress for families and children in the family law system; that it would place further stresses on Federal Circuit Court judges, who are struggling under unsafe, unsustainable and unconscionable workloads; and that it would fail to address any of the fundamental problems plaguing the family law system, including the risk of family violence survivors simply falling through the cracks. The very first Chief Justice of the Family Court of Australia, Elizabeth Evatt AC, has said: The proposed merger of the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court will lead to undesirable outcomes for children and families. Ms Evatt has also warned: The increasing number of cases in which issues of family violence and child abuse are raised has led to an even greater need today for family law jurisdiction to be vested exclusively in specialised judges who can give their full attention to the needs of family law clients without being diverted to exercise other unrelated jurisdictions. The current bill undermines this principle, is not in the public interest and should not be enacted. The Hon. Alastair Nicholson AO, RFD, QC, the second Chief Justice of the Family Court, who served in that position between 1988 and 2004, has fully supported Ms Evatts remarks. Mr Nicholson has also said: It is unbelievable that government would propose the dissolution of a Federal Superior Court in this fashion without the most careful and searching Public Inquiry and without carrying out significant research and without consulting the many experts in this field. … … … What those proposing this merger do not seem to understand is that family law is complex and nuanced, and it is not to be judged by the output by numbers of cases as if the Courts are sausage machines. Throughput is important, but so is the quality of the decisions made. He went on to say: Cases can be extremely complex and require specialist knowledge of the type that has always been available in the Family Court, which has provided leadership in the proper interpretation and principles to be applied by other courts with family law jurisdiction. Many involve the determination of important issues relating to children, including their rights and need for protection, not only from individuals, but also from government in its myriad forms. Many also involve problems of family violence and the effects of it upon the parties and their children. Others involve extremely complicated property disputes either alone or combined with the above issues and requiring other important specialist levels of legal knowledge, whilst understanding the important family issues that may be affected by the decision. The President of the Law Council of Australia, Pauline Wright, has said of the proposed merger: It would result in the effective abolition of the Family Court of Australia, a respected, specialised and focused court dealing with family law issues. The 2019 merger bills, if passed, would also mean that Australian families and children will have to compete for the resourcing and hearing time with all federal matters—that is, other matters like migration bankruptcy and those sorts of things that the Federal Circuit Courts and the Federal Courts deal with. There must be an increase not a decrease in specialisation in family law and violence issues. This is critical for the safety of children and victims of family violence. The Law Council of Australia has also said that the proposed merger: … is a terrible gamble with the lives of children and families. Communities Legal Centres Australia has said: … moving away from a specialist Family Court model would be a retrograde step and expose survivors of family violence to an unnecessary risk. Womens Legal Services Australia has said its opposition to the proposed merger is: … centred on the safety and best interests of the child and the safety of adult victimsurvivors of family violence in family law proceedings. The National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services has said that the proposed merger: … will disproportionately impact the most vulnerable including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and families who need the most support. The list of statements in opposition to this legislation from those who know this system well, those who have daily experience with it, those who deserve our respect and those who should be listened to, goes on and on and on. The absolute arrogance of this AttorneyGeneral, Mr Christian Porter, in dismissing these concerns is breathtaking. Hes beyond listened and beyond reasoned, and he is blindly followed by those opposite, who should be seeking to question his reasoning and his blind determination to make this move. Australian families deserve better; Australian children deserve better. Those opposite intend to smugly stand by while the vision of this human centred court, so profoundly important to our country and to Australian families, is desecrated and abandoned. As the experts have made clear, this merger proposal will do nothing to address delays in the family court system. Theres nothing in this legislation that will increase the number of judges, registrars and other court staff. Theres nothing in this legislation that will force the AttorneyGeneral to do his job—even something as basic as appointing a new judge as vacancies are created. And these bills will do absolutely nothing to help Australian families.","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator URQUHART (Tasmania—Opposition Whip in the Senate) ","(11:08):"
"0","0","0","1","1","MemberContinuation","247512","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I rise today to speak on the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019. These bills will seek to abolish the independent Family Court of Australia. Its a proud legacy of the Whitlam government. Instead of honouring that legacy and properly investing in it, this government seeks to replace it with a Frankenstein amalgam of the Federal Circuit Court and a rump of a court dealing with family law matters. Reform is needed. A new approach to family law is needed. But this legislation will only increase the problems currently experienced in the family law system. We need to improve efficiency in the family law system. We need to increase auxiliary services for families in need, caught up in the need for the services of the family law system. We need to ensure that specialist services are there for children and women fleeing violence.  These bills follow a clear pattern for this Liberal government and its two predecessors in undermining a public institution, running that public institution into the ground and then clamouring for reform to fix the very mess that they themselves have made. The Whitlam government set up the Family Court as part of a suite of reforms, including nofault divorce, that revolutionised the family law system in Australia. When introducing the family law bill to establish the courts, Mr Whitlam remarked: The essence of the Family Courts is that they will be helping courts. Judges will be specially and carefully selected for their suitability for the work of the court. There will be attached to the court a specialist staff, notably marriage counsellors and welfare officers, to assist the parties at any stage and even independently of any proceedings. Mr Whitlam went on to say: The Family Court will, of course, determine legal rights, which it is bound to do as a court, but it will do much more than that Here will be a court, the expressly stated purpose of which is to provide help, encouragement and counselling to parties with marital problems, and to have regard to their human problems, not just their legal rights. What a visionary statement, and what a practical, authentic response to the challenges that face us as human beings in our relationships with one another. There is none of that vision in what this government is advancing. The Whitlam reform was passed to give better access to justice to women and children across Australia, and to support a system that would work in a conciliatory manner to sensitively decide the personal matters of Australians. The auxiliary services that it provided will be further cut and diluted by these bills and the proposed amalgamation. In 2019 the Australian Law Reform Commission completed a report on the family law system in Australia. They made their inquiry, and it was an extensive, highly consultative one. They made over 60 recommendations for reform. They noted that the family law system in Australia: … has been deprived of resources to such an extent that it cannot deliver the quality of justice expected of a country like Australia, and to whose family law system other countries once looked and tried to emulate. They roundly condemn what this government and its withdrawal of resource capacity has done to the Family Court. The Australian Law Reform Commission did not make the recommendation to amalgamate the Federal Circuit Court and the government did not even bother responding to that very important report—60 recommendations ignored by the government, and they come up with a recommendation that was not in that very august report. The government, instead, bases the major reform that theyre proposing on nothing more than a sixweek desktop review by two PricewaterhouseCoopers accountants. Even that doesnt endorse this drastic proposal. In a response to the Senate committee inquiry into the bills, PwC said they were told not to even consider detailed reform as part of their report. The AttorneyGenerals website cites five reports as the basis for this reform, yet not even one—not a single one—of the five reports that it claims it bases this legislation on considered, let alone recommended, the drastic change that the government is seeking to push forward with these bills today. Only one report recommended restructuring the Family Court, but in a way that would still leave a standalone, specialist family law court. The interim report of the Joint Select Committee on Australias Family Law System, initiated by Senator Hanson, also noted that among the 70 reviews into the family law system in Australia since 1974, not one—not one!—has recommended that family law courts be structured in the way that the government is now seeking to make happen. The bill even prejudges the work of Senator Hansons committee inquiry, which is not due to report until next week. You would think, if the government actually valued the work of that committee, which has been travelling around Australia hearing evidence, advanced by Senator Hanson herself, it could have paused the biggest reform in the family law system in 40 years to hear the recommendations of her committee, to give some semblance of respect to the work of the senators who have been travelling around the country and to give some sense of hearing the testimony, which was, in many cases, traumatic for witnesses to deliver. But, instead, the government is advancing with this particular massive reform not recommended anywhere and is ignoring the finalising of that very important report. Its profoundly disrespectful to Senator Hanson and the committee not to wait that one week to hear the report the committee has spent years preparing. Anyone who has been involved with the Family Court will have an opinion on this, and Im sure they wont land where the government has landed. The question is: is there really any point, is there really any effectiveness, in jamming two different court systems together? Its not going to decrease the lengthy process times. Do we think that removing specialist services like child issue report writers will lead to more truthful and more lasting resolutions to matters? Do we think that further disruption to the Family Court will decrease the escalating distrust and anguish that many in the system are currently feeling? Can we trust this Prime Minister on this issue? We all know hes much vaunted as a family man; he cares about his family. Well, that may be the case but he doesnt seem to care about yours. This abysmal state of affairs is solely the result of the successive Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments gutting the funding of all aspects of the family law system. Matters have ground to a halt. Ive heard anecdotally that matters in Sydney will now take 2½ years to be fully heard. I come from a great state but its burdened with the trauma of these delays that are impacting family life, impacting children and impacting childrens learning at school. If youre in Newcastle, it will take 18 months. Where a full report into an abuse would take one month, so denuded of resources is this entire system that it now takes four to five months to get a report, and this is despite divorce rates dropping nationwide to their lowest level since nofault divorce was introduced. This is not an issue of the institution being broken; this is an issue of the resourcing being completely underdone. Family courts deal with matters of child welfare, they deal with sensitive matters of family breakdown, and they need the appropriate resources to serve the needs of Australians. Weve seen a degradation of public services across our country in the last 7½ years by this government at scale thats absolutely breathtaking. People pay their taxes to ensure that, when they need them, public services are there and operating in an efficient way. How will reducing services help anguished mothers, fathers and children? How will cutting funding to the bone for child report writers help inform the courts on sensitive matters of child abuse and violence? The primary goal of the family law courts in Australia is to work in the interests of the child. Can anyone really kid themselves into believing this bill, as constructed by the government, will be in the best interests of the children of Australia? This bill will only compound the governments neglect of the family law system; it will make a bad situation worse. The bill, if passed, will do the following things. It will combine the Federal Circuit Court and Family Court into one court with two divisions, and that court will be called the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia. The current Family Court of Australia would become Division 1, while the current Federal Circuit Court of Australia would become Division 2. Both divisions would operate under the leadership of a single chief justice and a deputy chief justice with a single set of rules and a single point of entry. The Appeal Division of the Family Court would not be replaced with anything. Let me just say that again. The Appeal Division of the Family Court would not be replaced with anything. Instead, all Division 1 judges would be able to hear appeals either as a single judge or as part of a full court. And, of course, there are a number of other consequential amendments that will be made. In the last parliament, the AttorneyGeneral refused to commit to replacing Division 1 judges as they retire, amounting to a gradual abolition of the specialised Family Court. Due to public pressure, hes now committed to appointing judges to Division 1, though there is nothing in this governments bill that would actually guarantee this. There are 110 stakeholders, among them Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services, community legal centres, womens legal services, child protection advocates and disability service providers across Australia, who have formed a chorus of opposition to this bill. And I trust their voices. I trust their lived experience. I trust advocates for people who find themselves in a family crisis that engages them with the courts. Those families have the support of those community service agents who are walking the walk with them—because this government, as much it bleats about its care, is always missing when the work has to be done. When the hard work has to be done, theyre missing in action. Those great advocates believe this reform proposed by the government will increase bills, time and stress for families in the system. The advocates I trust say that this bill will remove specialist family law support services for vulnerable children and families; it will increase the unsustainable workloads of Circuit Court judges, who, on average, have 337 matters on their dockets; and it will ignore the major systemic issues of chronic underfunding and victims falling through the cracks. The family law system is a proud monument of the Australian legal system, and Christian Porter and Scott Morrison want to run a bulldozer over it. Once they have crushed this institution, it will be very difficult to put it back together in any way. The government bill is friendless, recommended by no independent report. It will devastate the most vulnerable in our community, it prejudges a yearlong report into the family law system by a week and it is rushed in at a point when the government clearly thinks it has the numbers in this place to push this incredible level of reform through. Like all Morrison government initiatives, this bill is a facade. It cloaks the hollowingout of a proud and vital public institution in the gilded glamour of reform. It speaks to the sheer arrogance of the Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, who ignores the interests of vulnerable Australian families in order to chalk up at least one policy win this week in an otherwise barren agenda. This bill is a wrecking ball through our legal system, and I urge all senators to reject it.","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[9]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator ONEILL (New South Wales) ","(11:23):"
"0","0","0","1","1","MemberContinuation","247512","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," As has been made abundantly clear by previous speakers from the Australian Greens, we will not be supporting this legislation. The Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019 cover an area where large numbers of Australian people are directly impacted by the decisions that we in this place make, and we have to get this right. In this case, the government has not only not got it right; its got it badly and tragically wrong.  The sad thing is that its Australian families, Australian people, who are interacting with Australias family law system who are going to pay the price for the terrible mistake that this Senate is about to make, thanks to Senator Patrick deciding to support this legislation and therefore give the government the numbers for it to be passed by this chamber. Those Australians who are going to pay the price for this terrible mistake are Australians who are already dealing with significant challenges in their lives—challenges like the breakdowns of their relationships and challenges like decisions over custody of children subsequent to the breakdown of a relationship. Those things are difficult enough to deal with of themselves and they can be highly traumatising to people, but for those matters to be dealt with by people in a system that will be reformed in the way that this legislation seeks to reform our family law system will make it even harder for people who are interacting with that family law system. I might add: these socalled reforms follow a classic LiberalNational party strategy where they starve an institution of resources—and undoubtedly our family law system has been starved of resources through successive LiberalNational governments in this country. When those massively reduced resources start to bite on the effectiveness of an institution, whether it be our Family Court system or whether it be an institution like the ABC, the government comes out and says: See! Weve got to do something because the organisations not running properly. Well, Earth to the LNP: its not running properly because you deliberately starved it of resources. Thats why its not running properly. Thats the major reason its not running properly. Noone is going to get up and argue that our current family law system and the courts that are involved in our family law system are running perfectly. Of course theyre not. Anything that humans set up is going to run imperfectly, and the challenge for people in our place and people who work in those institutions is to try to continually improve them. Ill talk a bit later in my contribution about how the Australian Greens believe that we could actually improve the way our family law system works. But, let me be abundantly clear about this, the proposals that are currently before the Senate are not the way to make improvements, and ultimately they will make our family law system more difficult to interact with, they will make it more complicated and they will mean that Australians who are interacting with our family law system will be significantly disadvantaged. The Australian Greens approach this legislation with the principle that the strongest protection for children, for families and for survivors of family and domestic violence is to maintain and strengthen a standalone specialist family law court involving a holistic specialist system of collaborative, culturally safe, timely, colocated services and resources. And, in general terms, that was the intention when the Family Court was created. The Greens believe that significant changes to the family law system, like the ones proposed in these bills, should meet a basic test—that is, they must strengthen the system, move it to being a person focused system, ensure that it is a trauma informed system, ensure that it is a collaborative system, ensure that it delivers outcomes in a timely way, ensure that it is a holistic system and, very importantly, ensure it is a culturally safe system because there are people in this country from a massive range of cultural backgrounds who interact with our family law system. We have to make sure that it is culturally safe and appropriate for people from a range of cultures, whether they are our First Nations people—and remember that they were here for many tens of thousands of years before white people even arrived—or more recent arrivals from around the planet who come from places where families and family law systems are differently conceived than they are in this place. It has to be a culturally safe system that reflects the diversity of the cultural backgrounds of those who interact with it. The tests that the Australian Greens propose are not met by these bills. Its not just the Australian Greens saying that these bills are undesirable; more than 110 stakeholders and interested parties of the family law system agree that the merger proposed in these bills is not the solution and they oppose this legislation because it will put families at risk. Its important to say that a significant number of those stakeholders prefer the Family Court 2.0 model proposed by the New South Wales Bar Association. Unlike the merger proposal thats currently before this chamber, the Family Court 2.0 model proposes a straightforward lift and shift of the Federal Circuit Courts family law jurisdiction and judges into a new lower division within the standalone specialist Family Court. Family Court judges would be in Division 1 of the Family Court of Australia and Federal Circuit Court judges who are hearing family law matters would move across to Division 2 of the Family Court of Australia. Interestingly, this model has been in place for many years in the AttorneyGenerals own state of Western Australia. This system was also recommended by the 2008 Semple report and has been endorsed by stakeholders, including the Law Council of Australia, Womens Legal Services Australia and former chief justice Elizabeth Evatt AC. Unlike the governments dangerous and fatally flawed merger proposal, the Family Court 2.0 model would have the significant advantage of promoting safety for children and adults by preserving access to services of a specialist family court. An increase in specialisation in family law and family violence will increase the safety of children and adult victims and survivors of family violence. This is particularly the case for groups that are disproportionately impacted in the family law and family violence systems, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The need for increased and culturally safe specialisation of courts to improve decisions and outcomes for families is supported by the evidence of the multiple inquiries there have been over a number of years into the family law system. The Family Court 2.0 model proposed by the New South Wales Bar Association would actually produce what Australians have consistently said they want from their family law system—a single specialist family court to address the needs of the countrys families within an integrated system of collaborative, culturally safe, responsive and timely support services. We absolutely do not support this legislation being passed. Were extremely disappointed that Senator Patrick has caved on this issue. The government moved with indecent haste to bring these bills on once it believed it had the numbers in this place, even to the extent that the inquiry it stitched up with One Nation into Australias law system hasnt reported yet. Lets make no mistake, that inquiry was stitched up between the LNP and One Nation as an exercise by the LNP in stakeholder relationships with One Nation and now theyre burning One Nation and all the work that has been done in that inquiry by moving preemptively before that inquiry has had the capacity and time to report. So were not going to support this legislation. We believe the government should withdraw it, and we believe the government should move forward in a consultative and collaborative way around the development of an alternative like the Family Court 2.0 system, which is actually supported and preferred by almost all stakeholders in this area. I mentioned the starving of funding that this government has engaged in over many years in regard to our family law system. Something else that the Australian Greens are calling on the government to do is properly fund the system. The delays that we all know about in the family law system—because weve had submission after submission after submission about those delays—are unconscionable. To say to Australians that, in some circumstances, you have to wait for two or three years before your matter can be addressed through the family law system—well, we are dealing with real people, who are living real lives. They have real families, they have real children and they have real challenges in their lives. It is incredibly traumatic to go through a relationship breakdown or family breakup—losing access to your child. These things are traumatising in themselves. People dont need another layer of trauma put onto their shoulders in the form of having to wait for years before the family law system can actually address their issue. The government needs to commit at least another $310 million a year in funding for legal assistance providers, as identified by the Law Council, to make up for the shortfall of successive cuts that have been faced by a range of organisations inside our family law system and also by organisations—like Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Service, community legal centres, womens legal services and legal aid commissions—who actually support people who are engaged with our family law system. We also need to make sure that substantial funding increases are made available to the social and support services that families and survivors of family and domestic violence require. The government needs to far better resource the community legal sector. Ill make the point again that, over a number of years in this place, the government has slashed funding to the community legal sector, and the government needs to properly resource our family law system. The Australian Greens hold dear the principle of access to justice. Your capacity to access our justice system—whether it be the criminal justice system, the civil justice system or our family law system—should not be determined by the thickness of your wallet or the size of your bank balance. It shouldnt be determined by those things. But, tragically, too often it is determined by those things. So these bills are a terrible, terrible mistake, and it is the Australians who are interacting with the family law system—who, in almost all cases, are already traumatised by events that theyve been through—who are going to pay the price for this governments terrible mistake. I urge the government to reconsider. I urge the government to listen to the stakeholders who work in this system every day. I urge the government to think rationally about the impact that these bills will have on ordinary Australians going about their daytoday lives with the significant challenges that they are facing. Withdraw this legislation, and lets work collaboratively to come up with a better approach.","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[10]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator McKIM (Tasmania—Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate) ","(11:38):"
"0","0","0","1","1","MemberContinuation","247512","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," Id like to start with a tale of two family law reforms. The first reform was promised by the government in their first Womens Economic Security Statement. I remind you that that was back in 2018. Its a relatively simple proposal, and it would make dividing super assets easier and fairer. Its supported by lawyers, by academics and by womens groups. The government promised, back in 2018, that they would have this reform up and running by July 2020—last year. Where do you think that reforms up to? Nowhere. It hasnt been debated in this parliament. Its been eight months after that system was due to have commenced, and the government hasnt even drafted legislation for consultation. Why? When we asked about it in Senate estimates, we were told by officials that this was not a priority for the government.  Lets go to the second reform. Thats a proposal, the one before us, to abolish the specialist Family Court, and its contained in this legislation. Its a reform that is opposed by lawyers, by judges, by experts and by the users of the family law system. It has been recommended by precisely no inquiries and no policy process, and the government seems willing to commit endless resources to make this happen. We should remember this the next time the government tells us that something is too hard, because in this case the government seems willing to punch through community opposition, through policy advice and through the objections of experts to say nothing to the cost and disruption caused by the change like the one theyre proposing. Nothing is quite as powerful as this government just deciding that it wants to do something. Why is the government so committed to abolishing a specialist family law court? I suspect, at least in part, it is because the family law system is one of Prime Minister Whitlams great legacies. The family law reforms undertaken by the Whitlam government improved the lives of millions of Australians. The introduction of nofault divorce freed men and women who had otherwise been trapped in marriages that were unhappy or worse. The creation of a specialist family law court was an essential part of this vision. It promised the delivery of a type of justice in a different type of court to that which had been previously available. In speaking about the bill back in November of 74, Prime Minister Whitlam told the other place: The essence of the Family Courts is that they will be helping courts. Judges will be specially and carefully selected for their suitability for the work of the court. There will be attached to the court a specialist staff, notably marriage counsellors and welfare officers, to assist the parties at any stage … These courts will therefore be very different from the courts that presently exercise family law jurisdiction. The Family Court will, of course, determine legal rights, which it is bound to do as a court, but it will do much more than that. Here will be a court, the expressly stated purpose of which is to provide help, encouragement and counselling to parties with marital problems, and to have regard to their human problems … Parties will not be driven to the court by their own despair as a last resort; they will be encouraged to come to the welfare and counselling staff of the court whenever they have a matrimonial problem, even if they are not contemplating proceedings of any kind. This help would also be available after divorce proceedings, and this would, as I have already indicated, be of great importance where there were young children. There is no denying that more needs to be done to make the family law court live up to that vision. Too many men, women and children have been left feeling let down by a system that is increasingly difficult and expensive to navigate, but the answer is not to abolish the specialist family law court and fold it into one of the busiest and most overworked courts, the Federal Circuit Court. At the start of this year, there was one federal circuit court with over 600 cases on its docket. There are more than 25 judges across the country with more than 400 cases each. We know that men and women across the country are hurt by lengthy delays in contested family law court hearings, and delays hurt children most of all. The Australian Law Reform Commission referred to a number of concerns associated with the present delays in the family law system, including the potential for children and parents to spend long periods living in limbo while waiting for trial; the safety risks to parties and children arising from delayed resolution of disputes that involve protective concerns, including contributing to homelessness; the scope for delay and uncertainty to exacerbate conflict; and the potential for clients to consent to outcomes that fall short of the security and protection a court order could provide. But the answer to these shortcomings isnt to have matters like this jostling for space alongside hundreds of migration and other matters on the docket of already overworked Federal Circuit Court judges. As experts have made clear, this merger will do nothing to address delays. In fact the evidence from the experts, which the government should listen to, is that this merger proposal will increase cost, time and stress for families and for children. We know that the first step to a betterfunctioning family law system is to invest in it. As the Australian Law Reform Commission found: … the family law system has been deprived of resources to such an extent that it cannot deliver the quality of justice expected of a country like Australia, and to whose family law system other countries once looked and tried to emulate. A specialist family law court is important because family law matters are very different. The parties to family law matters are not like the parties that generalist courts tend to deal with—they are far less legally sophisticated than commercial parties. It will often be the first time that either party has been in a courtroom. These people are more vulnerable and are in the midst of the most stressful and emotionally difficult period of their lives. Abolishing the specialisation of the Family Law Court is not the right response to this challenge. The President of the Law Council said: This is a terrible gamble with the lives of children and families. Community Legal Centres Australia said: … moving away from a specialist family court model would be a retrograde step and expose survivors of family violence to unnecessary risk. Womens Legal Services Australia has opposed the merger on the basis of: … ensuring the safety and best interests of the child and the safety of adult victimsurvivors of family violence in family law proceedings. NATSILS have said that the merger will: … disproportionately impact the most vulnerable including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and families who need the most support. When I was in the Northern Rivers last week, the family workers who are working with women and children subjected to violence were horrified that this appears to be the law reform priority that is highest in precedence for this government. The government has tried to defend this bill by saying that it will reduce delays and backlogs in these two courts by creating a single point of entry for family law matters, by developing common rules of court, by enhancing judicial appointment criteria and by streamlining appeals. All of these are worthy aims; not one of them requires this bill to be implemented. The Chief Justice of the Family Court told a Senate committee last year that all of this could be achieved without legislative change and certainly without abolishing the specialist Family Court. In fact, if the government were looking for ways to improve the experience of families, they could do a lot worse than look at the recommendations of the 2019 Australian Law Reform Commission report, which has been sitting forlorn, unloved and unattendedto on the AttorneyGenerals desk for years. It was sitting there while Senator Hansons inquiry was pursued—another misplaced priority. The Family Court itself hasnt been sitting still. It has initiated a project to allow early determination of family violence matters. It initiated a COVID list that has allowed matters to be held virtually and has helped to improve accessibility for users. Theres another thing the government should do. At the start of my remarks, I mentioned a supersplitting proposal that the government promised would be in place by July last year. It hasnt been progressed because its not a priority for them right now. Failures like this have consequences, as Ill explain. There is a separate program which is designed to divert people away from lengthy and costly divorce hearings. Instead parties may go to mediation where a more amicable settlement can be reached more quickly and more cheaply. Separation is never easy but this makes it quicker and cheaper to divide assets and reach a compromise that both parties can live with. But theres a problem: it turns out that proceeding with mediation around property settlements requires both parties to trust that all of the information they need to fairly divide property at mediation is on the table, and that requires the super reform that the government has been sitting on, which would allow the ATO to provide that information directly into the process. The governments failure to deliver on its promise—the promise that it made back in 2019—to have this super reform in place by July last year is stopping families from being able to mediate their family law disputes. The Womens Legal Service has written to the AttorneyGeneral about this. They have briefed the Minister for Women. But here we are, years later, and there is no action. This was a concrete plan. It was developed on the basis of evidence. It was supported by experts and family advocates. It would make family law proceedings fairer and easier for men and for women. And there is no progress on this at all by the government and no sign, no indication, of when it will be progressed. The minister has said, As soon as practicable, or some other such diversion. But, as the minister and her officials told us at estimates last year, I guess it is just not a priority for the government.","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[11]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator McALLISTER (New South Wales) ","(11:53):"
"0","0","0","1","1","MemberContinuation","247512","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," These related bills, the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019, are an abuse. They are an abuse, in that the governments reckless agenda, an agenda that seeks to overturn almost 50 years of specialised legal practices, is wrapped up in a fake notion of reform. It ignores the experts and it ignores the voices of everyday Australians. This government must own up to what theyre really seeking to do here: abolish the Family Court, a proud and lasting legacy of the Whitlam government. When it was put to the floor back in 1974, debate on the Family Law Bill lasted 28 sitting hours spread over six days. It was important. There were disagreements, there was debate, and lasting momentous change was made.  The Family Court is a Labor legacy, an Australian legacy, a parliamentary legacy—one that Im very proud of. Its one that Labor is proud to defend in this chamber. The Family Court of Australia is a single standalone court, one with real knowledge, real expertise and real understanding of the delicacies and importance of matters before it. Family law is not like any other aspect of law. Its emotionally charged. Judgements have real, deep repercussions. Theres no doubt that in some areas it does require reform. But, instead of a scalpel, of course the government is using a sledgehammer. This 500page bill is the most significant change to the Family Court since it was established almost 50 years ago. As my colleague Senator Lambie rightly pointed out in this chamber moments ago, this bill has gone from being a lawyers picnic to a lawyers banquet. Like most of the legislation this government puts to the Senate, it is legislation that is not reliant on research, not reliant on the advice of experts, not reliant on the voices of everyday Australians. It is legislation based on a sixweek desktop review conducted by a pair of accountant from PwC and a host of other consulting firms. What will this legislation do? It will effectively abolish the Family Court by merging it into the Federal Circuit Court, a single court with two divisions. It will abolish the appeals division of the Family Court, so, instead of a scalpel, there will be a sledgehammer. As Ive said, there is no doubt that the family law is in need of reform. As the Australian Law Reform Commission noted only two years ago in a report on the family law system, noone could have foreseen the growth in the incidence and awareness of family violence or child abuse—none of us here. These are twin plagues within the fabric of Australian society. Without a court that can specialise in these incidents and that can see them day in and day out—a court that contains the interrelated, colocated services and resources that families in distress are desperately in need of, dealing with not just the legal issues but the human issues—we will not provide the care and support that families in distress need. Whitlam envisaged the Family Court in this way: a court that deals with people not as legal matters but as human beings. The realisation of Whitlams vision has never been more important. The vulnerable children and families of Australia need a court that is not only efficient but also safe and sensitive to their needs, to their vulnerabilities. What did the Australian Law Reform Commission find in its report? It found: … the family law system has been deprived of resources to such an extent that it cannot deliver the quality of justice expected of a country like Australia, and to whose family law system other countries once looked and tried to emulate. Those damning words are a product of years of neglect. Under Tony Abbott, there was neglect. Under Malcolm Turnbull, there was neglect. Under Scott Morrison, there is further neglect and a failure to act appropriately. There have been eight years of Liberal neglect. It is outright vandalism that judges in both the Family Court and Federal Circuit Court have not been replaced in a timely manner. Funding has been frozen despite review after review highlighting the increasing demand for Family Court services. In a classic move by the Liberal Party, they pick a service they want to undermine, that they want to underfund, they ignore calls to support it, let it wither on the vine overwhelmed by demand and underresourced, and the response is always the same—a reckless attack dressed up as reform. This government is ploughing ahead with a sledgehammer to this court, to its purpose and to its role. This bill will make a number of changes to the courts. It will combine the Federal Circuit Court and Family Court into one court with two divisions. The current Family Court of Australia would become Division 1, while the current Federal Circuit Court of Australia would become Division 2. Both divisions would operate under the leadership of a single chief justice and deputy chief justice with a single set of rules and a single point of entry. The Appeal Division of the Family Court will be abolished and replaced with nothing. Instead, all Division 1 judges will be able to hear appeals either as a single judge or as part of a full court. When this new structure was first proposed in the 45th Parliament, the current AttorneyGeneral said it would stop appointing new judges to Division 1 as they retire. This would effectively lead to the abolition of a division—the division of the Family Law Court of Australia, slowly but surely under this government. Those opposite may be trying to back away from this now but we know his tactics. We know hell pursue his ideological pursuit relentlessly, ongoing. This is just a tactical step back whilst he continues to pursue that position of not replacing experienced, knowledgeable judges, people who have the expertise and the capacity to deal what is often for many people human drama and human pressure in their lives. As I say, this ideological pursuit will be pursued relentlessly. Some might ask why this government is so hellbent on this proposal? It must have some great evidence up its sleeve to proceed with the abolition of an institution like the Family Court. As my colleague Senator Ayres highlighted earlier, the Morrison government has claimed this proposed merger is informed by independent reviews and inquiries lasting over a decade. The AttorneyGenerals website lists five reports under the heading The evidence base for the reforms yet not a single one of the reports listed recommends this bill—none of them, not even one of them! None of these reports consider anything as radical as what is contained in this 500page bill. Is this how legislation is conducted in this country in important areas that affect so many people in our country and will affect so many into the future? It has even relied on a hollow, fake report. Theyre just outright citing evidence that has nothing to do with the bill. The interim report published by the Joint Select Committee into Family Law says that 70 reviews of the family law system have been undertaken since the court was established. Not a single one of these reviews calls for anything like what the AttorneyGeneral is proposing—not a single one. This is a bit like the science of climate change: despite all the evidence saying one thing, the government are focusing on minuscule pieces of evidence to confirm their predetermined view, a prejudged view, that doesnt have any relationship to the evidence that was provided by so many experts. Theyre resting their entire 500page bill on a sixweek review of data by PricewaterhouseCoopers. Well, you get what you pay for, dont you! It was a desktop review conducted in the space of a little more than a month. Isnt that pathetic on a matter that is so important to so many of us in this country! It was one sixweek desktop review against 70 comprehensive reviews, none of which recommended this bill. Maybe the government has consulted on this bill. The senators present would be surprised to hear there has not been any meaningful consultation, of course, in relation to what would be the most significant change to the Family Court in its history. There was no consultation with legal professionals, with family specialists or with counsellors or childrens psychologists. Its just simply outrageous to hear there was not consultation with a single judge who sits on the Family Court—the absolute arrogance of the AttorneyGeneral and this government! They believe they know so much better than the people who have dedicated their lives and careers to making the Family Court work. Since the government chose to ignore the judges of the court, as they have many of my fellow senators, let me quote a few of the things these judges have said about the governments proposal. These are the experts, the people who have been dealing with these matters for such a long period time—people like Elizabeth Evatt AC, the very first Chief Justice of the Family Court of Australia—who have criticised the proposed merger. She warns us: Merging the Family Court into a generalist court will undermine the integrity and the structural specialisation of the Family Court. The impact of losing this institutional specialisation is not properly understood, and has been downplayed. The increasing number of cases in which issues of family violence and child abuse are raised has led to an even greater need today for family law jurisdiction to be vested exclusively in specialised judges— I repeat: exclusively in specialised judges— who can give their full attention to the needs of family law clients without being diverted to exercise other unrelated jurisdictions. She goes on to say: The current bill undermines this principle, is not in the public interest and should not be enacted. Then there is the Hon. Alastair Nicholson, who, from 1988 to 2004, was the second Chief Justice of the Family Court. Now, what did he have to say? He said: What those proposing this merger do not seem to understand is that family law is complex and nuanced, and it is not to be judged by the output by numbers of cases as if the Courts are sausage machines. Throughput is important, but so is the quality of the decisions made. Cases can be extremely complex and require specialist knowledge of the type that has always been available in the Family Court, which has provided leadership in the proper interpretation and principles to be applied by other courts with family law jurisdiction. I think thats just so telling. The judge said the court should not be judged by output, by simply a number of cases, as if the court is a sausage machine. The President of the Law Council of Australia, Pauline Wright, has said that the proposed merger would result in the effective abolition of the Family Court of Australia, a respected, specialised and focused court dealing with family law issues. The 2019 merger bills, if passed, would also mean that Australian families and children will have to compete for resourcing and hearing time with all federal matters—that is, other matters like migration, bankruptcy and those sorts of things that the Federal Circuit Court and the federal courts deal with. There must be an increase, not a decrease, in specialisation in family law and violence issues. This is critical for the safety of children and the victims of family violence. The National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services said those that oppose the bill— (Time expired)","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[12]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator SHELDON (New South Wales) ","(12:05):"
"0","0","0","1","1","MemberContinuation","247512","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," Courts are daunting places. Theres a secret code when you go to them that noone tells you about. There are specialised rules that even some of the lawyers have a hard time figuring out. They are adversarial places and they are incredibly difficult to navigate if youre going through a family breakdown or, worse, going through a family breakdown that involves family violence. I know lawyers get a bit of a bad rap, particularly in this place, but I decided to go back to university when I was a bit older and study law, and my motivation for doing that was that I had spent a week with a friend in the court system throughout the time of a hearing, and it occurred to me that the system had not been built by women or for women experiencing sexual and family violence and that, to understand and to change the systems, we needed to get more involved in that conversation.  There have been steps taken by state governments and federal governments over time to build specialised courts, including the Family Court, to deal with the very difficult experience that families have when they go through a breakdown and family violence is involved. But this legislation, the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019, is a backward step, because it abolishes the Family Court of Australia and it means that we will no longer have a specialist standalone family court. In other parts of the country—in Queensland, I know—were actually creating more specialised domestic violence courts, but the government want to go in the other direction. They say right now that there are two separate courts—the specialist Family Court of Australia and the nonspecialist Federal Circuit Court—and they both hear family law matters. The government claim that this merger will help reduce delays and backlogs in these two courts, by creating a single point of entry for family law matters. The creation of a single point of entry, though, and the development of common rules, forms, practices and procedures—making these courts easier to navigate for women and for family members that come to them—are being done and can be done without legislative change. You do not have to take my word for it. The Chief Justice of the Family Court told the Senate committee last year that all of those changes can be achieved without legislative amendment. So what is this really about? Why is this government pushing ahead with a merger which abolishes the Family Court of Australia? You can understand that Labor is very defensive of the Family Court and of all of the reforms that were introduced in 1975 that made the lives of families, particularly women, better. The Family Court was established as the dedicated legal forum for resolution of family law matters through the Family Law Act 1975—a proud Whitlam government legacy. It was formed to provide a less adversarial forum for the resolution of cases concerning family law. It was structured to foster an informal, supportive atmosphere with proceedings based on the notion that family law matters should be perceived as matters of interpersonal relationships rather than morality. The Family Courts resolutions were to be informed with input from the social science experts, social workers and inhouse counselling, and were services structured into the court. These features were designed to move administration of family law away from a model which primarily sought to assign blame in interpersonal relationships. The Family Court continues to function as a specialised court right now, but this government wants to get rid of it. In passing the Family Law Act 1975, the Whitlam government ushered in a major change to divorce law as well. Before the passage of this legislation, a marriage could only be dissolved if one party could prove that the other was at fault in the marriage breakdown. Matrimonial offences such as adultery, cruelty or desertion had to be proven before divorce could even be allowed. These things, according to Whitlam, were symptoms rather than causes of marriage breakdown. In introducing nofault divorce, Whitlam argued that the process also reduced the chance of the parties having any sort of workable relationship after the divorce and that this was against the interests of children that the couple might have. It was the first instance where the interests of the children were being considered as the primary reason, purpose, for the family law system. There was vocal opposition to this reform at the time. Some argued that it would increase marriage breakdown and relationship instability, while others argued that it would encourage promiscuity and destroy the institution of marriage—havent we heard that before! The law abolished the requirement for blame to be assigned and in doing so made sure that many women in violent relationships would be able to leave. The family law system is in crisis right now, but this bill will not fix it. In Cairns and Townsville, the North Queensland Womens Legal Service provides an amazing service to women living in regional Queensland, and I meet with them regularly. The first time I met with them I thought there would be a range of issues that they wanted to discuss, but the No. 1 thing that Kate and her hardworking team wanted to talk to me about was this governments proposed merger of the Federal Court system, because they feared it would mean more delays, more increased costs and less justice for women in the family law system. In some Federal Circuit Court and Family Court registries, it is taking on average 12 months for court appointed family consultants to produce family reports. We know the delays are there. A family report is an absolutely critical document that provides an independent assessment of issues in a case, and those reports help judges to make lifechanging decisions about arrangements for children. The average waiting times for the production of family reports in Cairns are up to three months, and, in Townsville, theyre also up to three months. The Law Reform Commission spoke specifically about the importance of family consultants and the need to ensure that family reports were produced as quickly as possible. It is essential for all those involved in family law proceedings, but particularly for children, that family reports are thorough and prepared as quickly as possible so as to avoid delay of any attempts at settlement or ultimate adjudication of the matter. These family reports are essential, but the delays in producing them are impacting heavily on families and children across the country. Its completely unacceptable. This legislation wont fix those delays; resourcing will fix those delays. But this government is not in the practice of producing the resources that the family law system needs. In producing this merger legislation, theyre actually creating more work for fewer judges. There has been no evidence yet to support these changes. Instead, after giving their firsthand experience on this matter to the government, the overwhelming evidence from stakeholders—who work hard and slug it out in this system day in, day out—is that this is not the way to go and that what is required is for the family court system to be specialised even further. Some of the other speakers, particularly Labor senators, have spoken today about the sham consultation process that this government undertook to justify this change. But we know that no fewer than 110 stakeholders, ranging from the Law Council of Australia to womens legal services, community legal centres, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services, child protection advocates and disability services from across Australia have written to the AttorneyGeneral asking him to abandon this proposal. But they have been ignored. Some of the most vulnerable people in our society and the people that act for them every day have just been completely and utterly ignored by this government. Those letters and these pleas made clear that these changes will harm vulnerable children, increase rather than decrease costs, place further stress on the Federal Circuit Court and fail to address any of the fundamental problems plaguing the family law system, including the risk of family violence survivors falling through the cracks. You really have to wonder what the governments motivation is to bring in legislation like this and to undo years of progress. It occurred to me that this has been one of Senator Hansons and One Nations pursuits for some time, as is well known. And, because it is central to One Nations pursuits, it is now central to this government. This government needs to own the platform that they have given the One Nation senator to devalue the Family Court. I want to read a speech that Senator Hanson gave on this matter. These are the comments that this government must own. In characterising the family court system, she described it as: … feminists who relish the toxic antimen rhetoric and jaded partners who will stop at nothing to use their separation and the court system to crush their rivals, including unfounded claims of domestic violence. Really—thats what this government is supporting? She goes on to say: How many in this chamber … have actually experienced domestic violence? Those ar e questions that we need to ask … People feel pain and anger. There are suicides, murders, the murders of children … Labor will always stand up on this side of the chamber against comments like these. I want to make it clear: the family court system is in crisis because of this government, but there is never ever an excuse for family violence. Nobody is pushed to commit family violence by the delays in the system that this government has created. It is not a justification, and this government and these ministers must own these comments. Twelve months on from the murder of Hannah Clarke and her children in Queensland, this government is taking our family law system backwards. The Queensland government today announced changes to introduce coercive control as a crime in Queensland. But this government is teaming up with One Nation, with those horrible comments, and taking us backwards. Well, Senator Hanson, I have experienced domestic violence, my family has experienced domestic violence, and I stand with every victim of family violence today, to call out this governments nasty processes—that they will put politics before people and that they will do deals with crossbenchers to get this legislation through this week, instead of waiting and listening to the people that it actually impacts. Thats what this government stands for.","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[13]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator GREEN (Queensland) ","(12:21):"
"0","0","0","1","1","MemberContinuation","247512","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," Its a pleasure to follow on from Senator Green and echo her sentiments around domestic violence in particular, which I know have had an impact on this chamber, particularly in her first speech. Domestic violence is something that she continues to advocate about, and it is important that all of us in this chamber advocate about it when we have the opportunity.  The reality of what were dealing with today, when it comes to the Family Court, is that were dealing with people at their most vulnerable. We are dealing with people who are going through this when they are actually confronting it with the people they care about the most. You would think, given that scenario that families are confronting, that the government would be providing the evidence to actually back up these changes—given what those families out there in Australia are confronting going through the Family Court process. I feel for any families caught up in this system. Im sure weve all heard, through our offices, some of those terrible tales about how long these things have dragged on and the terrible impact its had on families and the impact its had on children. Obviously, there is the human emotion that goes into this as well. Its quite remarkable that the government have pursued these changes now. Lets face it: theyve pursued these changes over the course of many years, because they have an agenda. But they have not provided any evidence that this is actually going to make things better for those families—that its actually going to speed up the process so that families can get a resolution quicker. Its not going to make what can be an expensive process cheaper, either. All of the legal experts who deal with this system have condemned the changes; theyve said theyre not going to make a difference. All of those support groups out there that provide support to families going through the Family Court process have criticised the changes and said they are not going to make things better. The government have not even bothered to try to justify it. We know theyve set up the select committee with Senator Hanson, who has been pursuing this—as Senator Green says—for a number of years now. Theyre not even waiting for the final report to pursue this. They feel as though theyve got the numbers, and they just want to plough on through and do it without providing any evidence that it is going to improve things. Its remarkable that the government solution to a crisis of their own making—they made the Family Court system worse; they have deliberately run it down—and this is the way that theyre treating people at their most vulnerable. At the end of the day, this is typical of an arrogant government, an arrogant Prime Minister and an extremely arrogant AttorneyGeneral, who has been pursuing this for years with zero evidence. There is absolutely zero evidence that these changes are going to improve the system. The AttorneyGeneral and the government have pursued what they wanted to see through, and thats what theyve gone about doing. They feel like theyve got the numbers in the Senate so theyre going to try and get it done this week. There is a problem in the Family Court system, but these reforms are actually going to make it worse. We know that there have been almost 70 reviews of the family law system undertaken since 1974. Many of my colleagues have talked about the history, and the proud Labor history, of the Family Court system. And, of those 70 reviews, not one has ever suggested that the Family Court be structured in the way that the government is proposing, yet the government are going ahead with their changes. They should be honest about their plan, which is seeking to abolish the Family Court as a specialist and standalone court. Labor is proud of its record of establishing the Family Law Act in 1975, which instituted two major changes. It instituted nofault divorce and it established the Family Court of Australia, a specialist, multidisciplinary court for the arbitration of family disputes. This was one of the many proud Whitlam legacies, from Medicare and our worldbeating superannuation system to free legal assistance for Australians in need. The Australian Law Reform Commission also conducted a review into the Family Court system prior to the Joint Select Committee on Australias Family Law System inquiry. The Australian Law Reform Commission said: … the family law system has been deprived of resources to such an extent that it cannot deliver the quality of justice expected of a country like Australia, and to whose family law system other countries once looked and tried to emulate. There is a chronic lack of funding for the appointment and proper training of judicial resources (including judges, judicial registrars – none of whom are currently employed within the courts, and registrars), courtbased social services professionals (including Family Consultants and Indigenous Liaison Officers), and legal aid services (including Independent Childrens Lawyers). As a consequence, children and families are deprived of sufficient time and attention being given to their matter at all stages of the process … That is from the Australian Law Reform Commission. Over the last seven years, the story of the Australian family law system has been a story of neglect by Liberal governments—neglect by Prime Minister Tony Abbott, neglect by the Liberal government under Malcolm Turnbull and the ongoing neglect by the current LiberalNational government under Prime Minister Scott Morrison. In my own state, the Queensland Law Society have said the changes would not improve the system. The Queensland Law Society president, Ken Taylor, speaking on behalf of the societys 13,000 solicitors, said he was concerned that a lack of expertise in family law could result in erroneous decisions and poorer outcomes for families. He said: It is a significant risk that the quality and propriety of family law decisions will be compromised where determinations are made by judicial officers without family law expertise … Thats from Ken Taylor, the Queensland Law Society president. The chair of the Queensland Law Societys Domestic and Family Violence Committee, Deborah Awyzio, said: In our view, the Society does not agree that the structural changes will produce efficiencies or reduce delay or that the changes will reduce complexity or legal costs in the family law system … The society has long warned that Australias family law courts were in crisis, calling for further resources to the courts to avoid lengthy delays of trial dates and judgements. Its exactly the point that weve been making consistently and in these speeches—that the evidence from the experts and those who deal with the system is that the changes that are proposed arent going to speed up the process and arent going to reduce costs for the families involved. Mr Taylor went on to say: We cannot expect our judges to perform miracles – they require adequate resourcing … The solution is not this merger of the courts, its ensuring that the correct level of experience and specialisation is paired with an adequate number of judges. Again, that is from the Queensland Law Society president. An open letter that was sent to the AttorneyGeneral, opposing the merger of the family and circuit courts, cosigned by 157 prominent groups within the legal profession. As the Law Council reports: Stakeholders continue to oppose the bill out of concern the merger will increase cost, delay and stress for families. Even before the COVID19 pandemic, the Family Court and FCC were facing delays of more than a years worth of cases each. Two in three FCC judges already have more than 300 matters in their dockets, some more than 600. The Chief Judge of the FCC has previously indicated that the ideal number should be around 100 each. They are a long way off that mark.

"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I rise today to speak about what I consider to be one of the most exciting opportunities in Tasmania today: renewable hydrogen production. As a state, Tasmanias clean, green image is already synonymous with renewable energy, but hydrogen is an energy source where we are truly leading the way. At the beginning of this month, National Energy Resources Australia announced Bell Bay Advanced Manufacturing Zone as one of the successful applicants for its seed funding program, awarding the organisation $100,000 to form a regional hydrogen technology cluster. The Tasmanian government matched the NERA grant, providing Bell Bay Advanced Manufacturing Zone with an additional $100,000 to further develop Tasmanias renewable energy future. This announcement comes hot on the heels of Woodside Energy signing a memorandum of understanding with the Tasmanian government for its renewable hydrogen facility in the manufacturing zone in January. A final investment decision is expected in the second half of this year, with Woodside planning to start hydrogen production at the site by 2023 if the project is to go ahead.  Fortescue Metals Group is investigating the feasibility of developing a green ammonia plant at Bell Bay, as part of the Tasmanian governments Renewable Hydrogen Industry Development Funding Program. The project will include constructing a 250megawatt green hydrogen plant to produce up to 250,000 tonnes of green ammonia per year for domestic use and international export. Bell Bay Advanced Manufacturing Zone chief executive, Susie Bower, said a facility of this size would be one of the largest in the world and it would be powered solely by Tasmanian renewable energy. Not only do these projects show the energy industry is behind Tasmanias aspiration to become a leader in largescale renewable hydrogen production but such projects create jobs for Tasmanians in construction and operational rules, and support our economy. The combination of the states abundant and lowcost renewable energy options and the unanimous adoption of the National Hydrogen Strategy by Australias energy ministers in November 2019 shows Tasmania has the means to match the desire for this renewable energy source. Australia aims to be a major player in the global hydrogen industry by 2030, so the timing is definitely right. Our existing hydro power combined with wind power means that Tasmania can produce renewable hydrogen at a cost 10 or 15 per cent lower than other mainland power grids. We are hydroready. Bell Bay Advanced Manufacturing Zone is located in Tasmanias north, at the mouth of the Tamar River, allowing the deepwater ports, stable transmission and the transport infrastructure needed for a renewable hydrogen industry. This makes Bell Bay one of Australias strategically important locations, particularly as it sits within the northeast renewable energy zone. Northern Tasmania is already throwing its support behind hydrogen. In December, I attended a breakfast, hosted by the Northern Tasmanian Development Corporation, Bell Bay Advanced Manufacturing Zone and the Launceston Chamber of Commerce, specifically held to explore the leadership role this region could take in green hydrogen production. Hydrogen is a clean fuel that can power cars, trucks and ships, heat homes and industries, and generate electricity. It is also one of the most plentiful elements in the universe. To put hydrogens capacity as a fuel source into perspective, Australias former Chief Scientist Dr Alan Finkel, who led the National Hydrogen Strategy, said that one kilogram of hydrogen is enough to travel up to 100 kilometres in a Hyundai NEXO SUV or power a 1,400watt electric split cycle air conditioner for 14½ hours. Further, around one tonne of hydrogen is equivalent to 3.4 times the average annual consumption of an Australian house with gas heating. Indeed, Hyundai has already started delivering hydrogen electric vehicles in Switzerland and is planning to put 1,600 trucks on Swiss roads by 2025. Transport, stock and services manufacturer Alstom has already produced a hydrogen powered electric train in the Netherlands. Green steel making is under pilot in Sweden, and international shipping fleets are using clean ammonia, made from hydrogen, as a fuel source via modified diesel engines. Closer to home, the Australian governments Future fuels strategy discussion paper, released earlier this month, considers how road transport will develop in Australia. The paper explains how new technology for vehicles, including hydrogen fuel cells, will give consumers more choice, reduce emissions and increase fuel security and air quality. There are several commercial hydrogen fleet and refuelling trials planned or already underway in Australia. These include hydrogen fuel cell electric forklifts, cars, shuttle and regional buses, and trucks for mining and refineries. These vehicles are supported by demonstration refuelling facilities located around the country. The Australian government, through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, has already invested more than $400 million for hydrogen transport related demonstration projects, including with Toyota Australia and BOC Limited. There is clearly a global appetite for this resource. However, hydrogen does not occur naturally in a useful energy form. Instead, it needs to be produced from substances containing hydrogen, such as water, solar, wind, natural gas or biomass. Renewable energy can be used to electrolyse water to produce hydrogen and oxygen. When renewable electricity is used, little or no carbon emissions are produced during manufacture and use. Most of Australias energy is generated from nonrenewable fossil fuels. However, this is not the case for Tasmania, where largescale renewable energy infrastructure has been developed over more than a century. Tasmania has achieved 100 per cent selfsufficiency in renewable energy, and the state plans to double its renewable generation to 200 per cent of its needs by 2040. The draft Tasmanian Renewable Hydrogen Action Plan puts the value of the Australian hydrogen export market at $2.2 billion by 2030 and $5.7 billion by 2040. Conservative estimates suggest that global demand for hydrogen as an energy source will exceed eight million tonnes by 2030 and about 35 million tonnes by 2040. Japan and South Korea have already indicated they will need to import significant quantities of clean hydrogen as a substitute for fossil fuel for energy and transport. The Australian government has already signed a cooperation agreement with Japan and a letter of intent with South Korea to underpin future hydrogen export, and it has a plan to develop an international certification scheme for hydrogen, working closely with local and international companies. International supply chains to move hydrogen in bulk quantities safely are already being investigated. Such options include transporting liquefied hydrogen by ship or via other hydrogencarrying forms such as ammonia or liquid organic hydrogen carriers. Tasmanias draft action plan states hydrogen production and distribution costs are high now compared to other fuels, but they should drop as production scales up and with further technological development. The COAG Energy Councils Hydrogen for Australias future report shows development of hydrogen technology has been aided by the falling cost of generating renewable electricity. Over the past decade, costs associated with generating electricity from wind and solar photovoltaic—PV—have fallen significantly, by around 70 per cent for wind and 80 per cent for solar PV. The cost of making a hydrogen fuel cell has fallen by about 60 per cent since 2006. This is an ambitious vision, but growing demand will likely create pressure to accelerate the use of hydrogen energy. As Dr Finkel wrote in The Conversation: Hydrogen is just the fuel the world needs to support a clean energy future: zeroemissions, flexible, storable, and safe. The best way to work towards adopting hydrogen as our fuel of choice is for all of us—governments, industry and communities—to work together. This includes keeping a strong focus on streamlining regulation and ensuring safety as we delve into this emergent industry, opening up international markets and encouraging commercial investment. The Tasmanian governments draft action plan estimates that a 100megawatt renewable hydrogen production facility would contribute around 120 ongoing jobs regionally. Further, a 1,000megawatt facility, which could be feasible by 2030, would contribute an estimated 1,200 regional jobs and could support around 200 megawatts of renewable energy investment. I mentioned earlier job creation opportunities at the Bell Bay Advanced Manufacturing Zone. Those jobs, coupled with the estimates included in the Tasmanian draft plan, are just the beginning. Outside Tasmania the hydrogen industry could generate thousands more jobs and add billions to our gross domestic product. Most importantly, hydrogen could help Australia integrate renewable generation into our electric grid, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. Now is the time for Australia to fully embrace renewable hydrogen production, with Tasmania leading the charge.

"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I want to update the Senate today about the economic impact the pandemic has had on a local business that Ive visited and had some dealings with in the last few months—Capital Travel Manuka. Lisa Calabria contacted me quite early on in the pandemic to update me on what was happening to her business. She had just bought the business some months before the pandemic. After working for the same travel agency as an employee for more than 20 years, Lisa became the owner of the travel agency. She knew a lot of the clients and had longstanding relationships.  When the pandemic hit, the borders closed. Obviously the impact on the travel industry has been enormous. She wanted to let her local federal representatives understand exactly what that has meant for her business and also how important JobKeeper has been to allow her not only to keep her business open to deal with the refunds, cancellations and all the toing and froing that needed to happen for her clients but also to keep all of her employees employed. One employee has retired, but Lisa employs five women in her business. She has been able to keep them on with the help of JobKeeper. Its very clear from visiting with Lisa and her team how much she loves her work as a travel agent. She does it because she enjoys giving happiness and pleasure to other people. There is all the excitement that comes with organising their holidays. Its really a business that she has dedicated her career to. Aside from the emotional impact of this pandemic and the impact it has had on her business and her family, she has been trying to keep her business operational and look after her employees and clients. She and many of her employees are still chasing refunds and making arrangements for people who have had to cancel holidays. Lisa said to me that there is really no light on the horizon for the next six months at least. International borders are going to remain closed. The amount of work she gets from domestic travel is very low. People often make their own arrangements and dont need a travel agent. Also, people arent making those arrangements because of the uncertainty around border closures and the pandemic overall. There is absolutely no way the domestic tourism industry is going to go anywhere near replacing the work she would have had if the borders were open. She and AFTA, an organisation she is a member of and which Im sure many have had dealings with in the last six months, need some certainty about whats going to happen post JobKeeper. It is 40 days or so until JobKeeper ends and there isnt any clear plan from the government about what will happen. Its not just Lisa and the travel agent industry; its live events. I had a meeting with the live events industry. There is no possibility of returning to business as usual in the foreseeable future. Noone is booking big events. The border closures make it very unpredictable for events. Theres no insurance and noone can afford to put them on in light of the possibility that theyll be cancelled and people will be seeking refunds. People have lost their homes. Theyve lost the businesses theyve worked in all their lives. For many that are surviving on JobKeeper, just to keep food on the table, perhaps to make mortgage payments and to keep people employed, there is no certainty about what happens in a few weeks time. But we hear the government saying theyre looking at targeted assistance, and that may be the answer; I dont know. Were waiting to see the proposal from the government, but its clear that the aviation industry, the tourism industry, the arts industry, live events, entertainment and hospitality in certain areas are not back at prepandemic business as usual, which is not going to happen. Its going to take the best part of this year to roll out the vaccine, all things being equal and assuming that the vaccine is actually rolled out according to the plan that the government has in place. That will not be done until toward the end of this year, certainly to any substantial degree, and itll be in the second half of this year that the broader population will get vaccinated. So what is going to happen? Why are thousands and thousands of businesses across this country being left hanging? What is the benefit to the government of not making clear what their plan is for the end of March? Weve got people that need to make plans and they have no idea if their lifeline will continue. And JobKeeper has been a lifeline. We know around 1.5 million people, who have met the turnover test that the government put in place to tighten access to JobKeeper, are still relying on JobKeeper payments. We know that, even with that test in place, there are still 500,000 businesses and about 1.5 million Australian workers relying on that payment to get through this. The government suggests that nothing is going to be needed at the end of March or during April when the payments stop flowing through. There are some sounds of targeted assistance perhaps for the tourism industry, but the need is not limited to the tourism industry. Theres a whole range of businesses across this country that have had flowon effects to their business model because of the pandemic. Lisa is a really clearcut case. Lisa is a woman who has worked her entire life and, through no fault of her own, bought a travel agency, after working as an employee in that travel agency for more than 20 years, nine months before a global pandemic hit. This was her nest egg, her way to get an adequate retirement. She went from employee to business owner and now she finds herself surviving on the JobKeeper payment, which is nowhere near what she and probably her employees were earning before. She is trying to make ends meet. She has no idea whats going to happen to her and her five staff at the end of March, and noone in this government is telling her what will happen. Noone is making it clear whether there will be an extension of JobKeeper for her. She applied for one of the tourism grants announced by, I think, Minister Birmingham. Shes not eligible for one of those. She doesnt want to hear: Weve got targeted industry assistance. Heres $500 million. You can apply for this and you can apply for that. Thats not going to work for her. Whats going to work for her is an extension of the JobKeeper program in recognition of the fact that her business is still down more than 90 per cent from where it would have been had there not been a pandemic. There is a false belief that come March people will have enough savings in the banks. Treasury keeps telling us that the balance sheets of businesses and households have shot up and therefore theyll be okay. At the same time Treasury acknowledges that there could be hundreds of thousands of job losses in particular industries but says theyll be offset elsewhere. Thats cold comfort to people like Lisa and her team—her job is expendable, perhaps because JB HiFi is employing more people. Its not really the comfort shes after or the comfort she believes she deserves after working hard for so many years, paying her taxes and doing the right thing, and, here, not through any business decision of her own and not at the fault of anybody—Im not suggesting its anybodys fault—a global pandemic arrives and the government puts in place rules that basically shut down her business. It effectively shuts it down. It remains shut down. What she needs and the thousands of other travel agents around this country need—but more broadly than that as well, as Ive touched on—is some certainty that this government is going to do the right thing by them after theyve done the right thing by everybody else. Theyve worked every single day during this pandemic to try and get money returned to travellers that have cancelled their bookings. She hasnt had a day off, and she needs to know that this government understands the predicament shes in and is going to respond to it. We need to look after them. We need the travel industry to be in place when this pandemic is over.","JobKeeper Payment","STATEMENTS BY SENATORS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator GALLAGHER (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) ","(12:55):"
"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," It has become easier over the last 12 months for many of us to forget about, or at least deprioritise, the struggles of oppressed people across the world. With our borders effectively closed and the economic and health crisis having an enormous impact on Australian life, the world beyond our shores is easily forgotten. So today Id like to reflect on global human rights injustices and fights for selfdetermination, equity and dignity. There are oppressed people across the world who continue their struggles.  The people of Kashmir continue to suffer through a human rights crisis outside the imaginations of many politicians in here. About 18 months have now passed since the Indian government revoked Kashmirs special status, or limited autonomy, and further eroded Kashmiris right to selfdetermination. Kashmir remains in lockdown and has been under a prolonged communications blackout, which has had devastating impacts on the people of the region. Only in recent weeks has access to 4G internet been restored, after being blocked for more than 500 days. Basic human rights in Kashmir must be restored, including freedom of speech and association. As recently as December, we saw at least 75 Kashmiri political leaders and activists arrested following regional local elections in an apparent attempt to squash potential political unrest. Many others have either disappeared or been detained since the revocation of special status in August 2019. The Indian government must withdraw its troops, end the restrictions placed on political leaders, end arbitrary detentions and disappearances and allow humanitarian organisations full access to resume their work. The decision to forcefully reduce the autonomy of Kashmiris must also be revoked immediately, and the campaign to systematically silence and oppress Kashmiris must end. The Greens have been and will continue urging the Australian government to call on the Indian government to respect the human rights of the people of Kashmir and their right to selfdetermination. The human rights crisis in Kashmir should not be ignored. We also cannot ignore the present situation in India. Since August last year, hundreds of thousands of farmers have participated in rolling strikes against a trio of bills they say will corporatise farming in India. Many of the protesting farmers are from Punjab and Haryana and belong to the Sikh religious minority, but many others around India have rallied in solidarity. They have won significant concessions but are fighting on in an effort to see the laws repealed in their entirety. At times the scale of solidarity from the farmers on show in India has been absolutely breathtaking. On just one day in November, an estimated 250 million people participated in a unionled general strike. I want you to try and imagine nearly 10 times the population of Australia on strike, united in their cause, steadfast in their opposition to government oppression of unionism and industrial action. I want to acknowledge that the struggle of the Indian farmers has not been without cost. Many farmers have now died, and others have been injured during the rolling protests. Just this week, Disha Ravi, a 22yearold climate activist, was arrested and threatened with sedition charges for organising in support of the farmers. The striking farmers strength in the face of government suppression is a lesson in the power of workers movements. The right to strike and protest must be respected anywhere, at any time. As ever, we extend solidarity to the Indian farmers and unionists struggling for control in their workplaces the world over. I hope that we can one day see workers power like that of the Indian farmers right here in Australia. The unequal and inhumane treatment of Palestinians has continued through the COVID19 pandemic. While the Israeli government rolled out the vaccine to a large proportion of its population—now into the millions of people—very few Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza have been vaccinated. Human rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have raised the alarm about Israels apparent unwillingness to ensure that the Palestinians under its occupation are vaccinated against this deadly disease. The poverty and destitution that many Palestinians live in under occupation only makes more urgent the need to vaccinate them against COVID19. The Australian government has proven time and again that it is highly unwilling to oppose or be critical of Israel. Australia was one of only a tiny number of countries last year to oppose United Nations resolutions on Palestinian selfdetermination, illegal Israeli settlements and the proposed annexation of part of the West Bank. Make no mistake, on the global stage Australia is clearly in the minority on Israel and Palestine. To make matters worse, Australia is shirking its international responsibilities by defunding international aid activities in Palestine. In the 202021 budget, Australia cut its aid commitment to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine from $20 million per year to $10 million per year. Australia must step up and do more for Palestinians in dire need of support. Australia must show solidarity with the Palestinian people, who, for decades upon decades, have had to pay the price for settler colonialists carving up their land and giving it away. Australia must push for an end to occupation, oppression and violence against Palestinians. Just as Australia has failed to support Palestinians, so too has it failed Uighurs in China. The lack of global solidarity to support Uighurs has been appalling. In 2019 I reflected in this very chamber that there had been a deathly lack of meaningful action on this issue from the highest levels of government in Australia and around the world. Its 2021 and Im devastated to say that each word of that sentence remains true today. Without significant global outcry and action, the genocide in Xinjiang has only accelerated. More than one million Uighurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities remain detained by the Chinese government in what they call reeducation camps. Recent BBC reporting has detailed the systematic rape, abuse and torture of women in these camps. Detainees have been subjected to forced injections of unknown substances. Women are being forcibly sterilised. The denial of food and any kind of freedom has become the norm. It should go without saying that the mass detention of Uighurs against their will in internment camps is an abhorrent abuse of human rights. This systemic oppression is aimed at the erosion of their ethnic identity. They are being indoctrinated in an effort to wipe out their culture. They are forced to live under strict religious restrictions in an effort to wipe out their faith. They are constantly surveilled and threatened with punishment in an effort to wipe out their spirit and will to resist. The global community, including Australia, know that this happening but has done far too little to help. This has to change. In my first speech to the Senate I said that our country must be a friend to people who are fighting oppression, marginalisation and injustice wherever they may be. We should look beyond our borders as a proponent of democracy and human rights everywhere, not just where it is politically expedient. We do not get to pick and choose the injustices against which we must struggle. We and the entire global community have to do everything we can to see an end to the genocide of Uighurs and to see justice and freedom for all in Xinjiang.","Human Rights","STATEMENTS BY SENATORS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[3]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator FARUQI (New South Wales) ","(13:05):"
"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I will not vote for any policy target or measure that comes at the cost of Queensland jobs. Likewise, I wont vote for anything that hurts businesses in Queensland, which is why Im sceptical about the rush to net zero emissions by 2050. While those who scroll through Twitter like demented, semihousetrained woodpeckers might like bumper sticker economics, as a regional senator Ive seen these discussions play out around the patios and verandas and at the local pubs and bowls club in regional Queensland.  I left home in January and havent returned yet, as Ive been on the road listening to workers and businesses. Workers and businesses know that zero emissions by 2050 is part of this bumper sticker strategy of the Left—the Left who want to virtue signal rather than bring forward solutions. The message I hear from regional Queensland and from all of Queensland is loud and clear: at the heart of any 2050 target should be a focus on jobs and businesses, particularly jobs in regional Queensland. If we lose one job or one business, that means I will not support these targets. By all means, bring forward your plans, bring forward your costed plans, but make sure these plans protect jobs and protect businesses. Year after year we see the Greens trot into this place and drone on and dribble on and drool on like leaking fridges about shutting down coalmining as though that will provide an instant silver bullet to a longterm global problem. We saw Bob Brown lead a convoy of southerners into Central Queensland ahead of the last election. It was an utterly arrogant display, and we saw the message the people in those communities sent at the ballot box shortly afterwards. The undeniable fact is that, for any longterm planned emissions, we must focus on opening up greater opportunities for Australians, particularly in regional areas. If we are to make a plan for the next 30 years, the best way for us to have reliable and cheap energy in Australia while reducing our emissions is with a mix of coal, gas, renewables and nuclear power. These industries combine to offer strong opportunities for us to take advantage of resources, supercharge our regional economies and build a more sustainable and selfreliant future for all Australians. Jobs and businesses are more important than leftist claptrap about unrealistic targets. Today, 17 February, is a sad anniversary. Today marks one year since General Motors pulled the rug out from under our Australian Holden dealers. They smashed Holden like a corporate grannysnatching hoodlum. The decision by General Motors to discontinue the Holden operations in Australia was, of course, their prerogative. But their failure to do so responsibly and in a manner that was fair to the very people who had enabled the company to operate in the Australian marketplace is nothing short of shameful. The decision impacted not only Holden dealers but the suppliers, the mechanics, the service teams, the receptionists, the technicians and the owners of the cars and utes. The Holden family was beaten up and spat out like weekold pizza by General Motors. Over the last 12 months Ive continued to call on General Motors time and time again to treat the Holden dealers with respect and return the proud Holden brand that means so much to our car enthusiasts and motor dealers. Sadly, it appears these calls have fallen on deaf ears. How long will it be before the Holden brand—our Holden badge—is sold to a state owned company in China? General Motors betrayed Australia when they shut down Holden. I fear nothing will stop them betraying the Holden family by selling the Holden brand to China. Monday marked an important day for many Australians. Monday was the 79th anniversary of the fall of Singapore. Tuesday marked an equally important date. Tuesday was the 79th anniversary of the Bangka Island massacre of innocent nurses. On Sunday I joined my colleague Senator Paul Scarr and Brisbane City Councillor Angela Owen alongside senior members of our Army, Navy and Air Force and senior members of the Singapore Armed Forces who are based out at the Oakey Army Aviation Centre. We came together at the Shrine of Remembrance in Brisbane to mark and remember the fall of Singapore. More importantly, we did so in front of the families and friends of the 2/10th Field Regiment Association, of the nurses and of other associations, who quietly each year remember the lost and those who suffered under the brutality of their captors, and remember people like my great uncle Gray, who was a major and was in Singapore on the way to fight the Nazis when it fell and spent the next 3½ years as a guest of the Emperor. Id like to thank Libby and Wendy and their families and all the other volunteers for their work in organising the service. Id like, too, to wish Wendy, who is in hospital, the best of luck with her own battles that she is engaging in on the health front. This is a service that Ive taken part in for many years, and each year is an important reminder that we must always stand up and fight for freedom. We must fight for freedom both here in Australia and overseas. We must stand up for freedom in Singapore. We must stand up for freedom in Taiwan. We must always be on the side of freedom and democracy, not just because it is righteous, which it is, but who will help us if and when the time comes when we need to light the beacons and ring the bells for help? Our freedoms were fought for by those who gave their all so we might have our day and so we might sleep soundly in our beds. So I support the call by Julian Simmonds, the member for Ryan, along with numerous exservice organisations, for the Anzac Day marches and services to proceed in Brisbane and across Queensland.

"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," Last week the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee reported on its inquiry into diaspora communities, and I was not able to make some reflections on the report and the conduct of that inquiry then. I intend to use this opportunity in senators statements to do it today.  Australia is a place where people from across the world can be included and ultimately thrive. Its a fundamental strength for this country and its one of the things that make Australia a great place to live and a great place for our children to grow up. It connects us to a globalised world. It creates a richer and more diverse way of life. But of course there are challenges in a multicultural society in making sure that we are continuing to improve the social, economic and political participation of Australians from migrant backgrounds, and that includes having consistent and focused support and attention from this place. Addressing the inequalities of outcomes faced by these communities, often stemming from racism and exclusion, is an important and challenging task that deserves all of our attention. The inquiry was an opportunity to hear from groups doing the important work that underpins Australian multiculturalism: volunteer organisations across all of the different groups that make up the rich tapestry of our multicultural society. The committee received a suitably diverse range of submissions on a diverse range of subjects, and I want to thank all of the groups who provided submissions and, in particular, those groups that provided oral evidence. It did become clear over time that some of the participants in this inquiry were particularly interested in using the inquiry to discuss the future of Australias relationship with China and how it is expressed in the lives of the Chinese Australian community. There is no doubt that the future of this relationship should be a source of debate and critical engagement. Since Whitlam opened dialogue with China in July 1971, engagement with China has been a key part of Australian foreign policy. China is a key country in our region, and, despite some of the things that put distance between us, it is not a fact that can be wished away, as is the wish of some people in this place. Trade with China is a key source of national wealth, particularly in our resources industries. Thousands of young Chinese students choose to study in Australia. However, that relationship is complex and it is changing. A more assertive China is more active in the region, within and outside the norms of international order and rules. Australian produce has become vulnerable to trade bans, including our cotton, wine, lobsters, sugar, barley, timber and copper ore. Australia has, and should have, deep concerns about the status of Hong Kong as well as the treatment of the Uighur population in Xinjiang, and there are legitimate concerns about attempts to interfere with Australian democracy. How we manage that relationship requires strategy, requires careful reflection and requires leadership. In managing that relationship, a key advantage is the success of Chinese Australians. There are 1.2 million Australians of Chinese heritage. Per capita, Australia has more people of Chinese heritage than anywhere outside of Asia. As with any large community, there is a diversity of political views. The diversity of those views can and should easily be accommodated and expressed in our democratic system. How this could be achieved was the subject of one of the public hearings in which a panel of Chinese Australian academics, amongst others, gave evidence about how Chinese Australians engage with Australias democratic system. As has been the subject of much debate here and outside, Senator Abetz used his questions to demand that this group individually, publicly and unconditionally condemn the Chinese Communist Party. It was, in my view, an abuse of the Senate committee process and a deliberate attempt to humiliate the people who were participating in it. At least when Joe McCarthy asked people whether or not they were communists, he asked everybody the same question. This question this time was only directed to those Australians with Chinese heritage. Since that incident has been reported in the press, Senator Abetz has stubbornly maintained that his questioning was fair, that his words were misrepresented and that no request for loyalty was made. Here is what the Hansard of the event records: Can I ask each of the three witnesses to very briefly tell me whether they are willing to unconditionally condemn the Chinese Communist Party dictatorship? Later in the exchange he said: But can you not pick a side to condemn the oppressive ugliness of the communist regime in China? Why is that so difficult? Hes since given several speeches to the Senate chamber about the matter and used parliamentary privilege to make particular claims about these people, calling them apologists, Labor operatives and selfdescribed experts—not something that hes done with anybody else whos appeared before that inquiry. The namecalling misses the point. One of the witnesses, Mr Osmond Chiu, is a friend of mine. Hes a thoughtful contributor to Australian political life. Ironically, Mr Chius submission described exactly the kind of predicament that he found himself in. He said: ChineseAustralians, in particular, have found it challenging to participate in politics over the last three years because of a growing public perception that the Communist Party of China (CPC) operates within and influences the actions of ChineseAustralian communities. The thoughtless assumptions that Mr Chiu describes have, of course, a long history in this country. Chinese migration to Australia predates our federation, but so does racism towards Chinese Australians. The belief that Chinese Australians inherently have divided loyalties echoes a set of dark, racist ideas that have no role in modern Australia. The criticism of Senator Abetzs comments was entirely fair. Senator Abetzs stubborn response to his critics reflects traits that I suppose have served him well for his decades in political life. But they also reflect a set of views about China that have taken hold among particular members of this parliament. Rather than coming to terms with the complexity of Australias relationship with China and, in particular, the complexity of the issues in the Chinese Australian community and the desire amongst many Chinese Australians to participate fully in our public life, these people increasingly view themselves as the antagonists in a sort of Manichean struggle between good and evil, a sort of boys own adventure, with little regard for the consequences, particularly for Chinese Australians in our community. Its a world view thats not supported by our intelligence community. Its childish and it does a profound disservice to the Australian people, most notably Chinese Australians, because it hinders our ability to actually understand what is going on and our capacity to view the actions of the Chinese Australian community properly, and that was made very clear in later public evidence from the director of ASIO. For those senators who are concerned about foreign interference, Mr Chius submission offers this insight: The homogenous nature of Australian politics is one reason why politicians find it difficult to deal with issues like foreign interference because there is insufficient cultural and political knowledge of the foreign entities the government seeks to legislate against. A truly representative parliament is necessary if we want Australia to successfully navigate big foreign and domestic policy challenges, and to reflect the values of equality which Australia stands for. Greater involvement of Chinese Australians is of immense value to our democratic system not only in our engagement with China over the coming decades but also in better reflecting the country we represent in this building. Senator Abetzs comments and actions have undermined that effort and they undermined the purpose of the inquiry he participated in.","Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee Report: Diaspora Communities","STATEMENTS BY SENATORS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[5]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator AYRES (New South Wales) ","(13:22):"
"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I rise today to speak of a gamechanging new website for Australians planning a family, and that website is yourivfsuccess.com.au. My office was heavily involved in the formation of the Your IVF Success website and its tools, all of which were made possible with the support of the health minister, Greg Hunt, UNSW and the IVF industry.  Your IVF Success is a game changer for those who are considering embarking on an IVF journey—a game changer because, for the very first time, Australians are able to access objective and comparable data on each IVF clinics performance. The website also includes an IVF estimator that will provide women with an indication of their chances of success, based on their age and circumstances. Anyone who has ever gone through IVF or knows someone who has gone through this very emotional journey understands that, until now, it was impossible to find impartial and comparable data on fertility clinic performance. If you were to call a clinic, you would be given selective data, and only that which they chose to share publicly. Some might give you their clinical pregnancy rate, others might give you their livebirth rate and some might choose not to share data at all, whilst others will share selected stats on their website. Frankly, given the tens of thousands of dollars that Australians are forced to pay for IVF, it has long been time for the game of blind mans buff to end. Consumers deserve to be able to make an informed choice when they choose a fertility clinic. They deserve truth and accountability. Of course, this is true not only in IVF but across all medical specialties. It is my hope that one day we will have similar performance transparency for all specialists performing all surgeries in both public and private hospitals. Transparency and accountability are key to improving health outcomes for all of us. They also mean that outliers have nowhere to hide and must lift their game, all to the benefit of patients and to the benefit of the health system. From my perspective, the yourivfsuccess.com.au website has been about three years in the making. We started looking into the issue of performance transparency in the IVF industry back in 2017. We began by tasking the Parliamentary Library to help identify which countries require IVF clinics to publicly release their success rates. We found that the US and the UK were both leading the way by publishing performance data for individual clinics. We wanted to do something similar for Australian patients. After all, if it was possible to do it overseas, why should it be impossible here? Why is the IVF industry effectively running a secret society? What became clear to us was that there wasnt any legislative path we could take to make this happen. The data resided in private hands and deidentified data was able to be compiled only at a national level by UNSW through the existence of an industry code. So we had to think outside the box. We decided the closest approach would be to task the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare with collecting and reporting performance stats for every fertility clinic that receives public funds. We knew it wasnt a perfect solution, but it did show that something could be done. So I introduced the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Amendment (Assisted Reproductive Treatment Statistics) Bill 2019. That bill got the ball rolling. That bill was enough to start a conversation with the IVF industry and government and to bring all parties together. With health minister Greg Hunts support, an expert working group was formed to develop the website, which we finally launched on Monday this week. The yourivfsuccess.com.au website is a wonderful example of what can happen when we dont let the past rule the future. We had always been told that a website such as this would be impossible in Australia, that it would be impractical and undesirable to publish the performance of individual clinics in this way and that it would only create a race to the bottom. I never accepted any of these arguments. The expert working group worked extremely hard to ensure not only that the information contained on the website is rigorous but also that the data cannot be manipulated by clinics to game the system. It means that infertile Australians now, for the very first time, can view objective measures of the performance of each fertility clinic. An analysis piece on the ABC last month by medical reporter Sophie Scott and Angela McCormack demonstrated why this website is needed. It canvassed the views of 2,000 Australians. They said that they just felt like a number and they very much wanted oversight of the industry. They spoke of the emotional toll, the emotional rollercoaster, the impersonal treatment, the frustration and the profound grief that can come with IVF. Their analysis posed a number of questions that patients want answers to, such as: How can patients avoid spending outrageous sums of money to start a family? How can clinics find a way to make their patients feel less alone? Will unproven and costly addon treatments be more tightly regulated? Will success rates published by clinics become more transparent? The story said: More transparency around success rates of clinical practices would also provide patients with a more realistic understanding of their chances of becoming pregnant. This is exactly why this website was created—to give patients some of the important information that they lack as they weigh up their options. All of Australias 85 fertility clinics are listed on the website, and 92 per cent of them have consented to have their data shared. I must say, though, I was somewhat disappointed that two wellknown South Australian clinics, Fertility SA and Flinders Fertility, declined to have their data shown on the website. Both state they are proud of their clinics. I would argue that, if theyre as good as they say they are, they should be proud to display their results on the website alongside those of their peers. I certainly hope that they will do that very soon. At the launch on Monday I had the pleasure of speaking with two women undergoing IVF, Ella Mannix and Jessica Van Bridges. Both have been fortunate to have one child through fertility treatment and Jessica is, fantastically, newly pregnant with her second child. It was gratifying to see how excited they were by the website. Jessica stated that she had used two different clinics and found comparing the two and assessing her chances of success very challenging. She said that, had the YourIVFSuccess website been available at the time, she would more easily have been able to make an informed decision about where to go. She said of the website, I think it will really help to empower couples. Empowerment is what this website is all about. IVF is expensive and the process is often emotionally draining. The website can become a companion on the IVF journey for everyone who needs it. It is a useful resource and jumpingoff point for every woman who is thinking of undergoing IVF or who is wondering whether their existing clinic is best serving their needs. There are many people to thank for making this website a reality—people in the health ministers office, the Department of Health and within the industry—but I want to particularly single out Professor Georgina Chambers from UNSWs National Perinatal Epidemiology and Statistics Unit. I want to thank her for her careful attention to the performance data used and for her dedication on this project. Id also like to thank two of my advisers: Maria Moscaritolo, whose determined work helped to lay the foundations that led to the website; and Dr Des Soares, who chaired the expert working group and steadfastly corralled the various interests to deliver this particular project in a very short time frame.","In Vitro Fertilisation","STATEMENTS BY SENATORS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[6]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator GRIFF (South Australia) ","(13:32):"

My reflection is that Albo needs Queensland more than Queensland needs Albo. I say this having read the speech which the Hon. Anthony Albanese MP gave at TAFE Queensland on Wednesday 10 February 2021. In that speech the Leader of the Opposition referred to the Labor Partys policy for:  … the abolition of the discredited and politicised Registered Organisations Commission and the Australian Building and Construction Commission. I must say how disappointing it is that the Leader of the Opposition casts a slur over all those good people who are working at the Australian Building and Construction Commission and the Registered Organisations Commission, because theyre doing great work for Australia. Theyre doing great work especially for all those workers, subcontractors and others involved in the construction industry. Why are they needed? Theyre needed because at this stage in our history we have not managed to get the construction division—and I say construction division in particular, not the other divisions—of the CFMMEU under control. They are a lawless union. We need to deal with this issue. We especially need to deal with this issue because this country has generated and built up higher and higher debt and we need to get every single bang for every single buck in terms of our infrastructure spend. The people of Queensland, including those in my region, the Ipswich region, one of the fastest growing regions in Australia, cannot afford to pay an extra 30 per cent for every hospital, police station, highway and other piece of infrastructure needed. We cant afford to pay that 30 per cent surcharge because of the lawlessness of the CFMMEU construction division. Something needs to be done. Lets have a look at the facts in relation to—using the opposition leaders words—the discredited and politicised body which is the ABCC. The ABCC continues to discharge its critical role as the fullservice regulator for the building and construction industry. Since it was reestablished on 2 December 2016, the ABCC has recovered over $2.6 million in wages and entitlements for over 4,100 employees. Is this a discredited and politicised body? I wouldnt have thought so. It has collected over $11 million in penalties that have been awarded in cases brought by the ABCC. Addressing noncompliance, the ABCC has been successful in nearly 90 per cent of 81 cases decided. Just reflect on that, Madam Acting Deputy President: its been successful in nearly 90 per cent of the cases which have gone to court. This is hardly a discredited and politicised body. I dont believe that my friends who are sitting on the other side of the chamber, Senator Ayres and Senator Sterle, would ever conduct themselves like some organisers and senior officials of the construction division of the CFMMEU conduct themselves. I genuinely dont believe they would. I dont think my friend Senator Tony Sheldon would either, nor would many of the other senators—including you, Madam Acting Deputy President Walsh—who provided good service to the trade union movement. But there is a problem with the construction division of the CFMMEU, and the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Anthony Albanese, needs to recognise that. Instead of saying that these organisations are discredited and politicised, look at the facts. Let me give you an example of a recent case which was decided by the Hon. Justice Rangiah, a judge I knew for close to 25 years prior to his elevation to the bench. Hes an extremely decent judge and someone who could hardly be said to be politicised or in any way engaged in conduct other than the conduct one would expect from a superior court judge. I refer to the recent case of the Australian Building and Construction Commission against James Fissenden and the Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union. This judgement was brought down in July 2020. What happened in this case was that a gentleman by the name of Cooper Crosthwaite was working at the construction site of a new shopping centre on the Sunshine Coast. He wasnt a member of the union, and this was the problem. The owner of the company for which Cooper was working was approached by Mr Fissenden, who said that Mr Crosthwaite was not coming up as a union member. So, when Mr Fissenden then attended the Sunshine Plaza site, he was actually threatened by this union official from the construction division of the CFMMEU that unless he paid his union fee he wouldnt be allowed to work on the site. Its interesting, when you read the reasons for these judgements, how quickly the CFMMEU simply concedes. They simply concede all the relevant facts. Theres not even any dispute. So, if you go to paragraph 7 of the judgement, it says that the commissioner alleges and the respondents submit. So they admit this—that: Mr Fissenden took adverse action against Mr Crosthwaite by threatening to deny him the right to work at the Sunshine Plaza Site on 10 March 2019 which Mr Crosthwaite had been engaged to do— So they actually admit it. They admit that Mr Fissenden, their organiser from the CFMMEU construction division—not the mining division; the construction division—took adverse action against the company by threatening to deny the company and its contractors the right to work at the Sunshine Plaza site on 10 March 2019. They actually admit it. So it just comes down to a question of whats the penalty going to be? They admit they breached the law. Its quite disgusting. The trade union movement is an honourable profession, absolutely. Ive said in this place before, my father was a member of a union, my mother was a member of a union and my sister was a member of a union. I have absolutely no problem with the trade union movement and I think they carry out an absolutely essential role in terms of protecting workers rights. Ive no problem at all. Where I have an issue is where you have this blatant lawlessness, and it is just blatant. This is happening in my home state of Queensland. Workers in Queensland, whether or not theyre employees, contractors, health and safety inspectors, do not deserve to be terrorised by the unlawful thugs in the construction division of the CFMMEU. They deserve a safe place of work. Ill read further from the judgement, paragraph 31—this is from the judgement from Justice Rangiah: Two videos recording the contravening conduct were provided to the Court. The videos show that Mr Fissenden was loud and abusive, and used offensive language to describe Mr Crosthwaite. The contravening conduct was engaged in openly and in front of others at the Sunshine Plaza Site. Mr Fissendens conduct involved a threat to the incomes and revenues of Mr Crosthwaite and Norman Holdings. Thats the company he was working for. The people of Australia deserve better than this. I implore those opposite: Im not sure what discussions you had behind closed doors, but the conduct of the construction division of the CFMMEU is casting a slur on the entire trade union movement. I dont know why you put up with this. We have to find an answer to address this conduct. We can do better than this. Australia deserves better than the unlawful conduct of the CFMMEU construction division.","Trade Unions","STATEMENTS BY SENATORS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[7]/speech/talk.text/body/p[4]","N/A","N/A"

It is called Waste to Wages. In Kununurra, prior to the formation of the Revive recycling store, all waste went to landfill. Then, through the magnificent efforts of East Kimberley Job Pathways—and I want to acknowledge the CEO, Michele Pucci; and they are ably supported and backed up by Wunan Foundation and my very dear friend Ian Trust—they decided that they would start recycling. So, crews were employed with a little truck to run around town, and they started picking up recycling stuff—pushbikes, old furniture, everything you could imagine.  Its now led to two sites. One is in Mango Street. Thats a workshop where we have local Aboriginal young men and women employed to fix up old bikes, fix up old furniture—they do some magnificent stuff. They create art with old car springs. Youve got no idea of the creativity of these young people. Then, it goes around the corner—and I like to say hello to Senator McCarthy; its good to see you on there—and its sold in the Revive store. I was walking through the store with an absolute diamond of the Kimberley, and thats Paige McLachlan. Paige runs Revive, and Paige has informed me, as of yesterday or the day before, shes now being employed as a development manager, which is magnificent. As were walking through the store, were seeing old cutlery, bits of art, old clothing and all sort of bits and pieces, and it struck me as we walked through the warehouse—old furniture! For those who might not know about my background, the two things that formed a major part of my life were old furniture and the Kimberley, where I was a longdistance road train operator. I asked Paige, How does the furniture go? She said, We cant get enough of this furniture. It gets distributed through the East Kimberley. For those of us who know the East Kimberley, its not a hop, step and jump when you talk about going down to Halls Creek, going over to Wyndham, going through Warmun. But they have clientele who come from as far away as Kalumburu, which is a 12hour drive into Kununurra, and even further down to Balgo, 300 kilometres south of Halls Creek, to get secondhand furniture. I thought, How can I use my contacts and my old skills? To cut a long story short, I rang up my very dear friend Cam Dumesny from the Western Roads Federation and said, You and I have a job to do, mate. We need to go and get a truck, we need to go and get a couple of trailers, a dolly, a fuel card. Im going to get all the furniture and were going to do a road train run and we are going to supply all secondhand furniture to Revive so they can profit from the sales. And all the profit that comes from that store will go into training Aboriginal men and women in the East Kimberley. How good is that? Theyre doing that and weve seen the success. Senator Cash, I cant wait, because I know you want to get up there to see it. I hope you take a whole cohort of your mates up there too to see what a great job they are doing. Now come the thankyous. Im spoilt—I got to do what I did for 16 years and it was a pleasure. I was back in my safety boots—well, I was while I was in the yard—and back behind the wheel of a brand new 580horsepower truck that was kindly donated by ACFS. I want to thank Arthur Tzaneros, who went one step further when he gave us the truck. He threw a fuel card at us, and he actually asked if it would be alright if we could put some East Kimberley Indigenous art on the prime mover. I have the photos. What a magnificent thing. Im so grateful to Ians son, who is the artist. The scoop is all printed in Indigenous artwork—food of the East Kimberley. We also had the Wunan stickers on the side and the East Kimberley Job Pathways stickers to show the support we had. I also want to thank Nick DAmo, an old mate of mine. Nick and I started in the transport industry in 1980. We watched his meteoric rise as he went through the ranks as my codriver and then brought his own truck. He now owns his own business and employs some 70 or 80 people. Im just a baggypanted old truckie who never got past one truck. But Nick came good, and he donated a heck of a lot of furniture too. He donated the lead trailer for me, and ACFS gave me the dog trailer and the dolly. Nick threw on a big sign saying, Waste for Wages, with art on the container. Better than that, Nick got his guys, whom I used to work with—some of the older guys like Nobby and Bruno—on a Saturday, put on brekky at the yard and we loaded. I stood around and talked a lot. There was 120 cubic metres of furniture, and we hooked up the road train and off we went. I also want to thank, for his support, Mr Scott Huntsman, the general manager of All Cast. He said he couldnt supply furniture, but he supplied 1,500 face masks for Kimberley health, so that went up. Now I come to my support crew too. I had to have a support crew in case I forgot how to get to Kununurra after all these years or I forgot how to hook up the road train. My old mates Reg Cowan, Johnny JD Davis, Graeme Storky Purkiss and Erik Mac McGuinness got me up there and back and kept me lubricated with cold water while I was unloading—I just thought I would throw that in! I also want to thank Robert Bilato from North West Quarries for supplying accommodation for us on the way up and on the way back, and also fuelling the support vehicle, supplying the truck and 1,400 litres of diesel. Thats no mean feat, so, Robert, thank you very much. Now the best part: I have spoken to Paige and to Michelle. Its on again, but this time we are not doing it in November. We are not unloading a road train of furniture in 41 degree heat like we did last time. Paige, Im looking forward to working with you again and with Ash, Keira, Erik and your team. I have given Paige the task of now putting out the wish list. I rang Cam yesterday; he cant wait to get the riding boots back on. I said to him, Look, while youre at it, get a learners permit and I might even teach you some of my skills. He reckons he is going to do that. So, selfishly, I cant wait until July next year as we head back up to Kununurra again. More importantly, we will be dropping furniture off in Halls Creek for those disadvantaged families there and we will be supplying furniture for Wyndham as well. What a magnificent project by Paige and her team up there in Kununurra. I wish her all the best. I cant wait. In this place, we talk a lot about closing the gap, as we should do, and we talk a lot about our visits to remote communities and about how we love working with Indigenous leaders and Aboriginal communities. But when you see something a fantastic as this—they didnt put their hand out to ask for one cent of help; they did it all themselves—you can see the benefits rolling through the community and you can see young Aboriginal men and women break the cycle of dependency in having a job. If that doesnt bring warmth to your heart, nothing will. I urge everyone: get to Kununurra and visit Paige at Revive. The PRESIDENT: Order! It being 2 pm, the time allotted for senators statements has expired and we will move to questions without notice.","Revive, Western Australia: Employment","STATEMENTS BY SENATORS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[8]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator STERLE (Western Australia) ","(13:52):"

The Morrison government, unlike those opposite, is focused on delivering affordable, reliable and secure electricity for all Australian families and businesses. This is central to our ongoing commitment to economic recovery and will support jobs, productivity and economic growth. Our plan to reduce power bills for hundreds of thousands of households and businesses is working.  As a result of the default market offer reforms introduced by the Morrison government, Australians are already benefiting from lower electricity prices. Wholesale energy prices across the National Electricity Market have fallen for 17 straight months, from well before COVID. With wholesale costs making up around a third of residential electricity bills, and even more for industry, these price falls are delivering real savings for Australian families and businesses. Today, the Australian Energy Regulator released its draft determination for the default market offer for 202122. The DMO will translate into lower prices for households and businesses across New South Wales, SouthEast Queensland and South Australia. The DMO caps the price of the most expensive offers in the market, protecting consumers from high electricity prices. The Australian Energy Regulators draft price determination released today will drop prices for households on standing offers by up to 7.9 per cent or $136 a year, and for small businesses by up to 8½ per cent. This builds on substantial savings already delivered in the first two years of our default market offer reforms. Average residential customers who were on the highest standing offers prior to the introduction of the DMO could now be up to $802 per year better off in New South Wales, $794 better off in SouthEast Queensland and $707 better off in South Australia.

When we look at the contribution of rural and regional Australia, we see that it produces our nations most valuable export, it supplies our energy and, I think all of us in this chamber would agree, it certainly provides us here in Australia with some of our most attractive tourist destinations. When we look at the breakdown of the workforce, over 32 per cent of the workforce in New South Wales and over 50 per cent of the workforce in Tasmania and Queensland is actually located in our regions. Thats why our $74 billion JobMaker plan is such an investment in regional Australia, as is, importantly, the creation of regional jobs. Certainly the Morrison government are all about putting in place the right economic policies so that all Australians, but in this case rural and regional Australians, are able to prosper, grow and create more jobs for Australians. Research by the National Skills Commissioner shows that 51 per cent of the 260,000 resources jobs are in regional areas and over 40 per cent of these workers received their qualification via vocational education and training.

In the last couple of weeks the tourism minister has had the opportunity—in fact, since his appointment, of course—to meet with many tourism operators, many peak bodies, to understand the impacts of the pandemic and what pathways to recovery might look like. Specifically in relation to Queensland, most recently the minister was able to visit regional Queensland. He participated in a series of roundtables and he met with tourism operators with small businesses, with representatives of local industry. One of the reasons for that is because members and senators of this side of the parliament believe it is important to meet directly with those business representatives and to hear that feedback in person.  For example, the minister held roundtables with exporters and with the tourism and aviation sector, which were hosted by Tourism Tropical North Queensland. He met with the CEO of the Star, with theme park CEOs on the Gold Coast as well and he participated in another meeting with Gold Coast tourism stakeholders. So he has had the opportunity to hear directly from those local tourist operators to understand how state border closures and the loss of international tourists particularly are impacting them. I think the minister has found that experience very valuable in terms of working so closely not only with the tourism sector in Queensland but also across Australia on a postJobKeeper plan for tourism recovery. As a result of those discussions and many other engagements, the government is very conscious that JobKeeper has supported a large portion of the tourism industry.

One of the most powerful tools that we have to discourage countries from breaching their international obligations is speaking and working together to demonstrate a shared commitment to values and to goals.  Early yesterday morning, very early Australian time, I joined colleagues from across the globe to endorse the Declaration Against the Use of Arbitrary Detention in StatetoState Relations, which has now been supported by more than 55 countries. The Australian government resolutely opposes the use of arbitrary detention, arrest and sentencing, including to influence statetostate relations and exercise leverage over foreign governments. This is a malicious practice against international law. States international human rights obligations include express obligations to foreign and dual nationals. In the declaration, we have highlighted the international rules, norms and institutions that underpin stability, prosperity and human rights and that enable global cooperation. I want to acknowledge the particularly strong leadership of Canada as well on these issues. In the past year Ive been working very closely with former foreign minister FrancoisPhilippe Champagne and more recently with his successor, foreign minister Marc Garneau, including to gather international support for speaking collectively against these practices and protecting the interests of our citizens. Well continue to discuss areas of future cooperation with counterparts, as I did this morning in my conversation with US Foreign Secretary Raab. Australias support for the declaration builds on a joint statement on politically motivated arbitrary detention delivered on behalf of 35 countries at the 45th session of the Human Rights Council in October.

We know that childrens development and growth is so important to what happens to them later in life.  Each year, the federal government invests more than $260 million in early intervention and prevention services under Families and Children Activity and Family Mental Health Support Services. The programs we invest in as a government are about giving children the best possible start in life. Early support for families plays a really important role in making sure that we prevent family breakdown, child neglect, family violence, substance abuse and mental illness and, of course, making sure that the transitioning of young children into school is the highest possible priority for any child. The flowon effects of this are really very clear. It builds protections, skills and resilience in our young people so that they can go off into their lives and we can avoid intergenerational disadvantage, which is so, so important. Intensive family support programs are one example of the kinds of programs that we have been targeting. Early intervention programs, we know, reduce child neglect, by working intensively with vulnerable families to improve parenting capabilities. On top of this, obviously, a childcare subsidy is a very, very important part to help working families make sure that they are in a position to be able to access early learning opportunities for their children. We are listening to providers and working collaboratively to make sure that we achieve the outcomes for our children that wed like to see. We know longerterm ongoing funding is absolutely critical to future planning. Over the next five years we will invest more than $1.2 billion.

"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I move:  That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Reynolds) to questions without notice asked today relating to allegations of sexual assault occuring in her office. I begin by reminding senators of an important statement: Any complaint of violence—either verbal, physical or sexual—must always be taken seriously, particularly when, as members of parliament, we must be setting the standard for members of the community. This was a statement made by the Minister for Defence, Senator Reynolds, in June 2018. Senator Reynolds was expressing what I think we all agree is the standard the community expects. But standards only matter if they are upheld—and that is the test. When you claim to have standards that you dont act on, you send a signal. The signal you send is this: that there really are no standards, that there are no consequences, not for those who engage in violent acts, not for those who fail to take violent acts seriously. This week, the community has not seen the standard it expects met at the highest level of the government. Indeed, Senator Reynolds has had the opportunity to lead by example. And I compare her behaviour in this place and her actions previously with the response that we had from Minister Cash today, who was prepared to stand and speak of her offer of support to report this matter to police, her offer to sit with the complainant when doing so, and who did not refuse to answer questions in this place about what she did. Instead, Senator Reynolds did not lead by example, and she let a woman down badly—a woman to whom she had a duty of care. We know from the courageous public testimony from Ms Higgins this week that she did not feel supported when she told her minister she had been raped by a colleague. Ms Higgins says she was given the choice as to whether she was going to give up on her career. She was told by her superiors she could go to the police, but they also added: We need to know ahead of time. We need to know now. She said she realised this alleged act of sexual violence in the ministers office was being seen as a political issue, a political problem. She said she realised my job is on the line. So, rather than give up on her dream job, she agreed to be sent to Western Australia where she was just alone. It was really hard. Where was Senator Reynolds while Ms Higgins was struggling through this? I will use Ms Higginss own words to describe that: She did sort of actively try and avoid me as much as possible. She didnt like me coming to her events. She didnt like me going to things with her. I think I made her uncomfortable. And Senator Reynolds never again raised with Ms Higgins the alleged rape in her office. In his Higginss words: It was this taboo thing. It was never spoken about again. Eventually the trauma of the alleged rape and its handling left Ms Higgins feeling she had to leave the workplace. But less than a year before that alleged rape in her office, when some Liberal women parliamentarians said they had been bullied over the Liberal leadership, Senator Reynolds stood in this place and said: Some of the behaviour I simply do not recognise and I think has no place in my party … I cannot condone … what has happened to some of my colleagues … … … … … I do not recognise my party at the moment. I think many Australians will find those words jarring, to say the least, given Senator Reynoldss actions. Anyone who has read the reporting by Samantha Maiden and others about the wrenching ordeal Ms Higgins has gone through, anyone who watched Ms Higginss interview with Lisa Wilkinson, can see in her face and hear in her words the painful consequences. These are the consequences of standards not being upheld. It is not Ms Higgins who has not upheld the standards, but it is Ms Higgins who has paid for the consequences of the actions and failures of others—failures of the Prime Minister, failures of Minister Reynolds, the minister who is responsible for the defence of the nation. So, Madam Deputy President, I ask this: what are the consequences for Minister Reynolds?  The matters raised here today are, of course, very, very concerning. I cant imagine what Ms Higgins must be going through, particularly considering the fact that these issues are being discussed by us all and theyre obviously very private issues for her. But it is very important that things do change; there is no doubt about that. There is a sensitivity, though, that must be observed when were talking about such issues. The Prime Minister has said that the government takes these matters very seriously, that all matters of workplace safety must be taken seriously and that anyone who works in this place, whether theyre working for a member of government or as part of the staff that help run this magnificent facility and institution here or in electorate offices around the country, must feel that they are working in a safe workplace. The reports of the alleged sexual assault in 2019 in the ministers office are deeply distressing. Throughout the process the overriding concern of the government has always been to support Ms Higginss welfare in whatever way possible. However, its clear that more needs to be done, and the Prime Minister has announced, both yesterday in answers to questions at a press conference and in the other place today in answering questions, that the process that he has put in place will ensure that a thorough process is gone through to establish whatever changes are necessary within practices and within procedures. The Prime Minister has approached my good friend and colleague from Western Australia Celia Hammond, the member for Curtin. Celia was previously a vicechancellor of Notre Dame and had to deal with situations in that institution when she was vicechancellor. Shes very well established and highly respected. She will be working with MPs in the government on a process to identify ways that standards, expectations and practices can be further improved. Further to that, there is Stephanie Foster, the deputy secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. I sit on committees and in estimates when Ms Foster presents. While I dont know her personally, I see the way that she conducts herself through estimates and through committees. She is certainly an outstanding official and is thoroughly independent in the way that she works. In the role that she will play in undertaking a review and advising the Prime Minister on how processes can be improved, I have no doubt that she will do an outstanding job and will ensure that every avenue that needs to be explored will be explored. I think the parliament can be confident of that when she undertakes this role because I know that she is someone who is respected on all sides. We understand that this is a matter that is under police investigation. Of course, we must respect that and follow the necessary processes to ensure that that remains consistent and that there is no prejudice of that procedure, that undertaking, at all. This is an important step that the government has consistently supported from the outset, and we will of course await the outcome of that process. As a country, we are dealing with many things. We have a nation dealing with the COVID pandemic and the ramifications of that. Senator Green asked a question about the impact of JobKeeper. Id actually rather be taking my time here now to talk about the impact that JobKeeper has had and the impact that it has on protecting jobs. In my home state of Western Australia, some 350,000odd jobs were saved and protected as a result of that program. I wish I could have spent my time today talking about the impact of that because that is what we know has had a big impact in Western Australia. (Time expired)  Like so many Australians, I was shocked and appalled by the revelations of the past few days that a young woman, a ministerial staffer, had suffered and was traumatised by an alleged rape in the ministers office on the ministers couch. It is shocking to even utter those words in the Australian parliament in 2021. I am feeling sick to my stomach, as I know so many Australians will be, at this news of a woman who, so excited, so full of idealism to come and work in the nations parliament, was, after this alleged rape, so discarded, so diminished, so ignored and left so alone by the very people she came here to support and promote. There is still this culture in this country and, most disturbingly, in this parliament. It pains me to say it but, after story upon story of allegations of bullying and sexual assault in the Liberal Party, theres a culture, clearly, that does not respect women, does not support them and does not believe them. This is completely unacceptable. I think we need to examine the fact that, when the Prime Minister took over from Malcolm Turnbull, he, in response to those allegations of bullying, promised and announced a robust process to ensure that these allegations would be taken seriously. It was another announcement with no delivery. That robust process has not been delivered. The Prime Minister would also have us believe that his office apparently found out about this alleged horrific crime—a sexual assault, the rape of a staffer in his government—only last week. This claim of the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, strains credulity, as Malcolm Turnbull said. We know that the then chief of staff to Linda Reynolds previously worked for Scott Morrison and is now back working for Scott Morrison. We know from Ms Higginss own evidence, her own testimony on national television, that the Prime Ministers principal private secretary was around the office, involved in the conversation, helping to fix and manage the problem. And thats how Ms Higgins described it: she felt like she was a problem to be managed; she felt like she was a political problem to be sent away. She absolutely felt pressure to choose between her job in the Morrison government and seeking justice for her alleged rape. The Prime Minister would have us believe that noone in his office knew about this alleged rape until last week. The governments own statement this week, after Ms Higginss interview, says that the Prime Ministers office was involved back in March 2019 in assisting Minister Reynoldss office with this particular incident. So which is right: the governments statement or the Prime Ministers statement in the parliament? They cant both be right. This is a Prime Minister who does not like accountability, does not like transparency and does not deliver. But here he has failed to deliver in the most extraordinary way, letting down every woman, every person, who works in this building and letting down women right across Australia. This Prime Minister stood up and said the gravity of the situation only became clear to him when his wife reminded him that he had daughters. You dont have to be a man with daughters to understand that rape is a violent crime, an assault on a woman; that it should be taken seriously; that she should be supported; and that it should be thoroughly investigated. All across Australia people shook their heads in confusion as to how the Prime Minister of this country could not just respond as a human being. The Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence and the Morrison government continue to compound Brittanys trauma by not getting their stories straight. (Time expired)  Its tough, it really is tough, to confront the circumstances in which this parliament, as a whole, finds itself in the wake of these revelations. I come to this place as a new senator and one who has worked in the private sector for quite some time, where, rightly, the focus is on the health, safety and security of all employees, because as Australians we rightly expect to be safe in the workplace. I think the response weve seen this week from the government, from the Prime Minister down, has been one aimed at upholding that very fundamental position. The reports weve been dealing with relating to the events of 2019 are rightly felt, not only by the people in this place but by the people of Australia, to be deeply distressing. Throughout the entire process, however, I think it would be obvious to any fairminded person that the overriding concern has been to support Ms Higgins, to empower Ms Higgins and to respect the privacy of Ms Higgins. That said, as much as the governments response has thus far been made clear, it is also clear that more is to be done. The Prime Minister has immediately undertaken that we will undertake two separate inquiries aimed at addressing the culture and the environment of work in this place. Celia Hammond, the member for Curtin, a previous vicechancellor of the University of Notre Dame, has long and extensive experience of managing these sorts of issues in an institutional setting. Lets not forget, Madam Deputy President, that these are not partisan political issues but fundamentally human issues, so the fact that we have an inquiry, led by the member for Curtin, aimed at ensuring that the standards, expectations, practices and processes in this place can be improved is something that I think we all take heart from. Stephanie Foster, the deputy secretary of the department of PM&C, will also be undertaking a review, and this could include referrals to the finance department, obviously at arms length from the partisan politics of the day. In relation to this, the Prime Minister has been clear that we shouldnt presume the conclusions of those reviews. Indeed, we should be focused on ensuring that the people that work in this place get the support that they need, even in the most extreme circumstances, as has clearly been the subject of matters exposed this week. In relation to all aspects of employment, and that includes the terrible events that weve had to confront, there needs to be a change. The Prime Minister has been clear about that. But that will be a matter of good faith inquiry, which the government has committed to. The Prime Minister himself has committed to ensuring that that will be the outcome that this government upholds. In that spirit, we saw the Minister for Defence unreservedly apologise to Ms Higgins. Minister Reynolds was in fact the first woman to achieve the rank of brigadier in the Army Reserve. Today we heard from Minister Cash. Minister Cash, despite being a trailblazer in industrial relations legal practice before coming to the Senate, has also been the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women and the Minister for Women. That was a heartfelt moment that we saw today frankly, and I think that it goes to the heart of the fact that on this side of the chamber we seek only to uphold the dignity, the privacy, the integrity and the rights of those who come to work in this place with the very legitimate expectation of staying safe. So, I think it is clear that the governments response is aimed only at the right things, and that we will abstain from any involvement in party politics. The reviews undertaken are nonpartisan, across parliament and aimed at absolute integrity. We can do better. We must do better. We have been clear about that. And I look forward to seeing the outcomes.  Id like to focus my comments today on answers given by Senator Reynolds to questions asked of her by the opposition. Those questions go directly to the conduct of this minister, and the conduct of this minister is something that she has to be accountable for in this chamber. What weve seen over the last three question times is the minister, after being a bit shaky on her feet with the details and not really knowing how to answer on Monday, take the decision, probably under advice by others, to not answer any questions at all and hide behind two defences—the first one is using Ms Higgins as a defence, that Ms Higginss privacy needs to be respected now that its inconvenient for the Minister for Defence, and the second one is this notion that theres an ongoing police investigation, which, to my understanding, hasnt been confirmed. I understand theres an open investigation. But the conduct of this minister is a legitimate avenue of questions by members of this place and deserves serious answers by the Minister for Defence. As Senator Wong and Senator Keneally have said, this goes to one of the most senior offices in this place about allegations of a most serious crime occurring in this building to someone who came to work here. And, whilst we accept that there are matters that may be subject to police investigation in the future, there are matters which arent. And those matters go to the conduct of this minister: When did she know? What did she do? How did she respond? And that is what shes avoiding in this place. That can only leave us with two explanations: (1) that shes not being accurate in her comments to this chamber, or deliberately not providing information, or (2) that she was wilfully negligent in her role as an employer and as a minister. That is the only explanation we can be left with, because we saw Minister Cash provide more information frankly in one question than weve had from Senator Reynolds in many questions. There is absolutely no legal constraint on Senator Reynolds telling this chamber when she became aware, what she did when she became aware and what steps she took to support Ms Higgins. She tells us she did but she does not explain what she did. It is not unreasonable to put those questions to the Minister for Defence. Shes a senior minister in this place and there are very public allegations about a serious crime occurring not only in her suite but in her office, on her couch. She cannot any longer hide behind Ms Higgins, who deserves better. The language she uses about wanting to support Ms Higgins—she can support her by being truthful about what happened. By withholding information, what she is continuing is the coverup that has been underway for two years, which has been the cause of much trauma to Ms Higgins. Its the coverup, often, that is as traumatic as other elements of a serious crime like this because it compounds the trauma. It means that people she worked for, people she looked up to, who she expected to treat her properly havent. And Senator Reynolds does nothing—nothing—to dissuade us from that view by not answering. We know, and its on the public record, that Senator Reynoldss chief of staff knew after Ms Higgins disclosed on the Tuesday—I think—25 March 2019 what happened to her. On 1 April, Senator Reynolds was in a meeting with Ms Higgins. What happened in the six days? What happened, and why cant Senator Reynolds tell us? That is the missing link of some of what we have asked, and she is wilfully withholding that information from the Senate. Shes hiding behind a police investigation and she is hiding behind Ms Higgins. The Senate deserves better, Ms Higgins deserves better and, frankly, I think the rest of Australia believes the defence minister of this country should provide that information. (Time expired) Question agreed to.","Members of Parliament: Staff","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator WONG (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) ","(15:02):"
"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I move:  That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Families and Social Services (Senator Ruston) to a question without notice asked by Senator Siewert today relating to the JobSeeker Payment. Here we are 42 days out from when the JobSeeker payment goes back to just $40 a day—a rate the government know very well is insufficient because they knew there was an urgent need to double it with the coronavirus supplement when the pandemic hit. The government knew when they made that decision that people couldnt survive on $40 a day. Well, they still cant survive on $40 a day. But when I asked whether the government would guarantee that people on the JobSeeker payment wont go back to $40 a day on 1 April, the minister told us some information but she would not say yes or no. The fact is that people cannot survive on $40 a day. The government is subjecting people to uncertainty about their future and that is untenable. What are people going to do in 42 days time? The government this week have been floating some balloons about what they might do about our income support system. Theres one about how there are so many supplements that we might simplify the system. Some of the more cynical among us think that will be an excuse to actually not significantly increase the JobSeeker payment. But then, today, we hear of the socalled employment insurance scheme, which, some proponents would suggest, would put one per cent on the Medicare levy to pay for it, would create a twotiered system in this country which would cut people at six months, would significantly impact on the longterm unemployed, would significantly impact on young people and would significantly impact particularly older workers, who are constantly suffering from age discrimination and who find it hard to find work. Underpinning all of this is that the government and the minister kept saying, Were trying to encourage people into jobs. At the moment there are 1.3 million people unemployed and at the end of January there were 129,000 jobs. You tell me how 1.3 million people fit into 129,000 jobs. They dont. The jobs arent there for people to be able to apply for. People arent able to find work. That is still going to be the case on 31 March. The jobs wont be there. The government is floating various ideas with their favourite media people—We might simplify the system. Theres the unemployment insurance scheme. All this muddies the waters when the focus needs to be on the fact that on 1 April—a totally unfortunate day—the government perhaps will let people know that theyre going back to $40 a day. Why cant the government guarantee that jobseekers will not be going back to $40 a day? People cannot survive on that. The government actually needs to immediately let those people looking for work know that they wont drop back to $40 a day and that it will be increasing the JobSeeker payment so that people no longer have to live in poverty. No matter how much evidence is presented, the government still dont seem to get that poverty is a barrier to work. That is what also stops people being able to find work. If you havent got a home because you cant afford it because you are living on $40 a day, youre working out where youre going to sleep the night. Youre homeless. You cant put food on the table, pay for your medications or go to the dentist. These are all things people have been saying they were able to afford when the coronavirus supplement came in and doubled JobSeeker. We need to make sure that Australians on the JobSeeker payment arent living in poverty on $40 a day.

I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted. The speech read as follows— Today I am pleased to introduce the Industry Research and Development Amendment (Industry Innovation and Science Australia) Bill 2021. The amendment will officially change the name of Innovation and Science Australia (known as ISA) to Industry Innovation and Science Australia (known as IISA). Since 2016, ISA has provided strategic, wholeofsystem advice on the Governments investment in science, research and innovation, with a view to enhance the performance of Australias innovation system. As the Governments premier strategic advisory body on industry innovation, the refreshed IISA will play a pivotal role in guiding and advocating for Government policies and programs to drive economic recovery and growth – in particular our $1.5 billion Modern Manufacturing Strategy. The passage of this Bill renaming ISA to IISA therefore marks a simple but significant step in implementing these transformational policies. The inclusion of industry in IISAs name is an important signal to stakeholders in both the private and public sectors. It acknowledges the critical role that innovation and science play in enabling competitive Australian industries and driving a productive, resilient and prosperous economy. It highlights our commitment to seeking the best expert advice on these matters; to supporting genuine and practical innovation in Australian priority sectors; and to ensuring sovereign capability and industry resilience – particularly in light of the COVID19 pandemic and the need for quick and robust economic recovery. The passage of the Bill will underscore IISAs function as a direct voice for strategic industry input to government on policy development, implementation and evaluation. The name change is backed up by recent appointments to the IISA Board with strong Australian industry experience and networks, and an updated Statement of Expectations for the Boards work going forward. Finally, the name change also clarifies the role of IISA in relation to our other expert advisory bodies, such as the National Science and Technology Council, allowing for more effective and productive collaboration in future. I commend this Bill to the Chamber. Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned to 11 May 2021, in accordance with standing order 111.","Industry Research and Development Amendment (Industry Innovation and Science Australia) Bill 2021","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator DUNIAM (Tasmania—Assistant Minister for Forestry and Fisheries and Assistant Minister for Industry Development) ","(15:57):"

"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I inform the Senate that, at 8.30 am today, 27 proposals were received in accordance with standing order 75. The question of which proposal would be submitted to the Senate was determined by lot. As a result, I inform the Senate that the following letter has been received from Senator Pratt:  Pursuant to standing order 75, I propose that the following matter of public importance be submitted to the Senate for discussion: The Morrison Governments desire to make it easier for employers to cut workers pay and conditions. Is the proposal supported? More than the number of senators required by the standing orders having risen in their places— The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: I understand that informal arrangements have been made to allocate specific times to each of the speakers in todays debate. With the concurrence of the Senate, I shall ask the clerks to set the clocks accordingly.  Lets look at whats been happening with wages in this country, prepandemic and postpandemic. Prepandemic we had wage stagnation under this government—eight years of this government being in power and weve seen year after year of wage stagnation. Now, postCOVID, its very clear, when we look at reports from economists and the Reserve Bank, that were facing not only wage stagnation but wage decline. So over eight years wages have stagnated, and over the coming years wages will decline. But dont worry, because not everyones wages have been suppressed. Reports today are that in the past 12 months the incomes of billionaires have gone up by 56 per cent! So to everybody else out there: your wages have declined but, under this governments watch, billionaires are making more and more money. Actually, I dont begrudge them that. What I begrudge is the fact that government doesnt understand how trickledown doesnt work. You actually have to give working people—people in the communities, small businesses that negotiate with those billionaires and quite large businesses that negotiate with those billionaires—power to get a share of the wealth, not leave it to the small clique which they support. The system that they support and theyve generated says that billionaires are okay and the rest of us arent. Then you go to what the government is doing in the latest drive for a pay cut—scrutiny of enterprise agreements. Well, lets get rid of that! Lets make sure that enterprise agreements dont meet standards; lets make sure that the commission is rushed and required to look at and review agreements before its had an appropriate time to properly review them, because thats what the government have proposed. But theyve actually gone a step further. Theyve said that appropriate parties, such as unions, cant make applications, as they previously have done, to criticise or highlight those dodgy deals. What happens when those dodgy deals go through? Not only are workers abused; it also destabilises markets. It means that those companies who are doing the right thing are destabilised by the people who are getting away with theft. Thats legalised theft. The government have done nothing effective about wage theft, and the latest proposals are a small shadow of whats needed. What they want to do is actually legalise it. They want to put bad employees in the front seat and put good employees down on the ground. They want to make sure that there is a disproportionate and destabilising effect in the labour market. Because what are they about? Wage decline. Wage decline year after year, and their record proves it. Now they also want to have nonmonetary benefits. They want to expand the nonmonetary benefits, which were originally put in acts so that people had protections at the Industrial Relations Commission for benefits they received in negotiated agreements and elsewhere. It wasnt below the NES. But what they propose now is that McDonalds application—rather than paying you wage increases, you can have wage cuts based on getting a packet of fries! What do they say when you go into McDonalds? In this case, its: Here are your pay cuts, and do you want fries with that? This government is now making it legal for the company store to operate. That was something that was thrown out in the early 1900s in this country and progressively abolished effectively throughout the 1900s and even further. But this government wants to go back to it. They want to go back to it, because they just cant help themselves. They have to say: Heres a pandemic; heres a crisis. Who do we really need to do over? Its those people who have the chance, the opportunity and the desire to express their voice collectively. Ill have to finish on the gig economy. Bijoy Paul and four others were killed as a result of being in the gig economy. There are tens of thousands of people in the gig economy, and what does this government do? There are no regulations to support them, protect them or give them rights. In fact, if you look at a number of the governments people on the backbench, theyre fully supporting those people being exploited.  Weve just heard another divisive, old, classwar warrior rhetorical contribution to the Senate. Lets all remember that the workplace relations framework in this country is under the Fair Work Act, heralded by the Australian Labor Party and introduced by the Australian Labor Party. So that independent umpire that sets wages and conditions is now being slagged off by the Australian Labor Party, the very creator of the system. To my friends opposite: you cant have it both ways. You cannot say that you have championed the cause of workers and brought to us the fair work regime, and on the other hand somehow condemn the government for the decisions that are allowed to go through the Fair Work Commission. A fair days pay for a fair days work is a biblical injunction which is embedded at the very heart of coalition policy in this area. No Liberal and no National wants to see workers pay cut. Instead, we seek to pursue policies to grow not only jobs but also wages. That is why, after a decade of the Howard government, we saw unemployment with a 3 in front of it—unheard of for a long, long time and unheard of since—and, might I add, real wages growing without impacting inflation. That is what good, sound economic management delivers. And why do we pursue good, sound economic management? Because of the social dividend it delivers for the men and women of Australia. It takes the economic illiteracy of the Labor Party to rip apart those credentials that the Howard government left. Here we are today, grappling with a global pandemic and seeking to restore the Australian economy, Australian jobs and Australian opportunities, and weve got the shamelessness of Labor. Indeed, Senator Sheldon reminded us of dodgy deals, and it triggered something in my mind. Who actually sought enterprise agreements to see workers in the mushroom sector worse off, workers in the cleaning sector worse off and workers in the building sector worse off? It was none other than the now member of parliament and former secretary of the Australian Workers Union Mr Bill Shorten. Lets be very, very clear: there were three areas in which workers were underpaid in circumstances where the agreement was signed off by the Australian Workers Union whilst Mr Shorten was in control. And lets be very clear: there are certain allegations that, in relation to those deals, there were quid pro quos that allowed certain benefits to flow to the member for Maribyrnong. That remains to be seen. But lets be very clear: why are the Labor Party bringing this up today, and why do they do it from time to time? They do it to try to create a smokescreen to distract attention from their real policy, which is to abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission and the Registered Organisations Commission. And why are they so manic about it? Because the Registered Organisations Commission has an active investigation going on, as we speak, into the activities of the Australian Workers Union while Mr Shorten was the secretary of it. The Australian Workers Union documents that have now been filed indicate that over $1 million worth of Australian Workers Union funds have been expended in fruitless and vexatious litigation against the Registered Organisations Commission. Those people opposite who cry crocodile tears for workers have no compunction about signing up to deals that rip off workers and then rip off their union funds. Why are the Australian Workers Union spending so much money in protecting Mr Shorten? The Australian Workers Union havent done that for another secretary of the Australian Workers Union—namely, one Cesar Melhem, who is in the Victorian parliament. That issue has seen a $148,000 fine being imposed on the Australian Workers Union. Of what do I speak? Im talking about the false enrolment of various bogus members without their knowledge or consent, including workers of companies with whom the AWU had enterprise agreements and, most creatively, jockeys who were members of the Australian Jockeys Association and netballers who were members of the Australian Netball Players Association. When these allegations came to the fore, what did the Australian Workers Union do? They raised the white flag. They did not seek to defend. They did not seek to take this matter to court. Given what they did in relation to Mr Shorten, it begs the question: why? And I suppose it begs this question: if it had gone to court, if it had gone to trial, Mr Melhem may have been asked a question such as, How long have these rorts been going on and whose idea was it in the first place? In the case of the netballers and jockeys rort, the answer to these questions seemed quite clear, because on 13 February 2005 the Australian Workers Union issued a media release entitled Netball stars join the AWU, which included the following boast: The AWUs experience in representing other elite sportspeople such as horse racing jockeys will help us to better represent the interests of some of the most talented women in Australian sport. Do you know who made that boast? None other than the current member for Maribyrnong. There he was on the public record boasting about these rorted numbers being introduced into the Australian Workers Union, which in turn, of course, had the impact of being able to impact Labor Party votes and Labor Party preselections. So, there are a number of issues.","Workplace Relations","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","The DEPUTY PRESIDENT ","(16:26):"

There is no doubt that Mr Melhem and the Australian Workers Union provided to the court an agreed statement of facts, agreeing that the figures that they had presented were rorted. They were falsified. Peoples names had been put on the record without their knowledge, courtesy of the enterprise agreements and cooperation from their employers. And the boast that I just read out, which seems to have excited the interjection, was on the public record on 13 February 2005, which can be easily shown to be correct. So, I understand the sensitivity of the Australian Labor Party. When these matters, these dodgy deals, are fully highlighted, one gets to see what really motivates the Australian Labor Party in this. Is there any Australian who genuinely believes that anybody in this place would want to see Australian workers paid less? Of course there isnt. Each and every one of us is dedicated, one would hope, to the service of the Australian people and to wanting the very best for them.  We on this side know that the opportunity of employment enhances somebodys selfesteem, their social interaction, their physical health, their mental health. The social good of employment is there for all to see. That is why its so important that any policy initiative is designed to ensure that more of our fellow Australians can get onto the ladder of opportunity which is employment. The capacity to be selfreliant, the selfesteem of knowing that you can look after yourself and your fellow family members of the same household, these are the good things that come out of employment. That is why we on this side, we as a government, so unrelentingly pursue not only every single employment opportunity but also good wages and outcomes, always as determined by the independent umpire, the Fair Work Commission, established by none other than the Australian Labor Party.","Workplace Relations","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[12]","N/A","N/A"

A fundamental project of the Liberal and National parties is shifting the balance of power from workers to capital. At every turn they will privilege profits of corporations, of billionaires and of rentseekers over the wellbeing of people and communities. Their policy agenda is the result of laziness, malice and an irrational obsession with free markets and competition. Decades of marketled policy, labour market deregulation and union busting have diminished the quality of work for so many people. It has turbocharged inequality and worsened the degradation of our environment. This governments version of common sense is that what is good for big business is good for the community. They have no real abiding belief in the value of meaningful work, social labour or care; no real commitment to the rights of workers to be safe, to be happy and respected at work or to be able to work and play and flourish. The only kind of flexibility that this government is interested in is supporting the flexibility of employers to hire and fire workers. Inevitably, favouring flexibility for businesses would mean precarity and powerlessness for workers. COVID19 has shown us how dangerously precarious employment can be for workers and for society. That the government are trying to use this crisis to further undermine workplace rights, workers pay and conditions in favour of businesses is cynical, its despicable and it is staggeringly irresponsible. They have been wanting to do this for a long, long time.  With regards to the antiworker IR omnibus bill, just removing the appalling measure to suspend the BOOT wont cut it; the bill will still remain appalling. It will still make it harder for most casuals to convert to permanent work, it still effectively casualises parttime workers without any increases in entitlements and it still locks workers and unions out of enterprise bargaining; it needs to be scrapped. Maybe workers wages and conditions are abstract concepts to this government. Maybe theyre so out of touch with working people they dont know how precarity and poverty feel. I lost count of the number of times I have sat right here in this chamber and watched members of the government giggle and gossip as they vote to plunge people into poverty, to take away their rights and dignity and to entrench and worsen inequality.

That is actually driving down wages.  Dont come into this chamber and try and rewrite history. We know that its in the governments DNA. Those opposite want to weaken unions, dont want workers to have representation and have no interest in ensuring wages growth. We have seen stagnant wages year after year under the governments watch. We know there are some 13 million Australians who rely on good government and good working conditions. What we also know in this country is the attack that those opposite are now applying and trying to get through this place will only disadvantage some of the lowest paid workers in this country. If you look at aged care, we know they are some of the most underpaid employees in this country. They dont have the respect they deserve, working to look after the most vulnerable people in this community. We know, with these changes, agedcare workers will lose $12,000 per year. Thats what the agenda of those opposite is. That is so wrong. We on this side will, year after year, day after day, week after week, defend workers rights and we will do everything that we can to ensure that their pay and conditions are preserved. We dont want to see penalty rates taken away. We dont want to see changes to parttime workers. Because if you do not have a fulltime job or a job that has legitimacy so that you can go and apply for a bank loan, youre not helping the economy. The government is stifling peoples opportunities to buy their own home. The daytoday stress thats placed on so many workers in this country with the casualisation and the underemployment in this country is abuse of these workers. Thats not doing anything to actually build our economy. If you want to come out of this COVID19 pandemic and you want to rebuild the economy and get people back working, thats certainly not the way to go about it. But what weve seen, time and time again, is an attack on the most vulnerable workers. We know, whether youre talking about hospitality, retail, aged care or disability, the majority of those workers are women. So youre hitting women again and again and again. You dont want to increase superannuation for Australian workers. Once again, who are those in our community that are going to be hardest hit? And you want to change and lower the wages for those sectors that Ive outlined already, which means women are again going to be the most disadvantaged, not only in their takehome pay and the amount of hours that theyre going to have to work; just as importantly, youre attacking superannuation. We already know the majority of women in this country do not have enough money to retire on. Thats your legacy. Thats the Liberals legacy. Thats the DNA of the Liberal government, the Liberal coalition. Thats what they are about. If you want to build a strong economy and you want to build a strong, highly skilled workforce, then dont attack workers and try and take money away from them. You should be investing in TAFE, for instance, so we can skill up Australian workers so people can go and retrain when there are changes in their work environment. But what we see, time and time again, is rhetoric by those opposite coming in here. They want to drag up and vilify unions, when in fact every Australian worker needs to be a member of a union, and theres no more important time than right now, because you need their protection.","Workplace Relations","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator POLLEY (Tasmania) ","(16:46):"
"0","0","0","1","1","McAllister, Sen Jenny","121628","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," Im glad Senator Polley raises the DNA of the Morrison government, because in our DNA is jobs and more of them for all Australians. Our track record speaks to that, with 1.84 million new placements through the jobactive program since its inception in 2015. But the Morrison government will not rest on its laurels. Indeed, we look at the industrial relations bill before this place now that improves enterprise agreements—delivering on average 40 per cent more into the pockets of hardworking Australians—offers the opportunity to grow jobs, increases freedom and flexibility within the labour market and offers new protections for employees in this place.  Why, then, dont Australians already enjoy those benefits? It is because the Labor Party chooses to obstruct more money in the pockets of hardworking Australians. On the flexibility and freedoms afforded to those in the gig economy, the Labor Party are most focused on racing to the bottom, as usual, and talking about a minimum wage. The Victorian Labor governments inquiry into the gig economy found, on average, the mean wage of a gig economy worker is $32.16, which represents a 62 per cent increase on the Australian minimum wage. The Labor Party would rather that Australians not enjoy 62 per cent extra earning capacity because of their ideological attachment to standing between Australians and employers. Thirty per cent of parttime workers in the retail industry and 40 per cent of parttime workers in the accommodation and food services sectors can work extra hours under the modifications and reforms contemplated by the IR omnibus bill. Instead, we see the Labor Party saying no. Weve offered a clear and consistent pathway to convert casual employment to fulltime employment for the first time. But, by blocking this legislation, Labor would rather have casual workers remain casual even if they prefer permanency. In opposing these changes, Labor has decided that it is against casual employees and it would rather keep those casual employees as collateral damage in their ongoing class warfare in this country. So much for Labor being on your side! If youre not a casual who wants permanent work, they will leave you aside. At the moment the Labor Party are proposing to cut workers pay and conditions. Weve seen with the thought bubble from the Leader of the Opposition last week a $20 billion a year business tax and a cut for casuals equal to, on average, $153 a week. Thats right; they would take $153 a week out of your pocket and impose a $20 billion a year tax on Australian business. Weve seen this from the ACTU. Which side of this chamber proposes to cut workers pay? It is those opposite. When Labor vote against this bill they will also be voting against increased criminal penalties for wage theft. Those who have experienced wage theft or underpayment will be better protected under the reforms proposed by this government. You might think that this would be uncontroversial, but those opposite are too busy playing politics with this bill, to the detriment of hardworking Australians. The tougher civil and new criminal penalties to stamp out wage theft are simply casualties of Labors class war—collateral damage, like the casual workers they would sooner deny the opportunity of permanent employment. Indeed, a quicker way to recover underpayments where they occur is also included in this bill. Instead, by blocking this bill, Labor have said that they dont want it easier to recover wages for those exploited workers in Australia. So much for the Labor Party being on your side! In this bill enterprise agreements are said to be more easily implemented, have tighter approval time frames and deliver 40 per cent, on average, higher wages into the pockets of Australians compared to awards, and yet the Labor Party stand in their way. When we consider 2020 we should be doing everything in our power to reduce the red tape, to reduce the restrictions and to reduce the amount of time between employees lawfully reaching an agreement with an employer and the increasing amounts of money in their pay packets. Instead, because of the prevarication of the Labor Party, we see nothing. Instead, we have seen a proposal for portable entitlements. It should be no surprise to us that Labor has trotted this out. Its an attractive idea at first glance. Stop and take stock of how that would actually be implemented. We see examples already writ large in the Australian economy of the Labor Party doing dodgy deals, as Senator Sheldon referred to, joining forces, taking money from hardworking Australians and putting it away in secretive slush funds that donate money from the unions to the ALP. What motivates us is the idea that Australians be empowered to control the fruits of their own labour and keep more of their hardearned money that they earn for themselves and their families. Yet those opposite, under the union control that they seem unable to step away from, in the case of Incolink in Victoria happily take money from working Australians and donate $8½ million to the CFMEU. They take $10 million off Australian workers and give it away in wages in a jobsfortheboys scandal that, frankly, Australians should be appalled about. You tell me who cares about the wellbeing of working Australians and their pay and conditions. It seems to be the Morrison government, with a track record of being focused on job opportunities and job creation. Yet the Morrison government finds itself unable to deliver for those hardworking Australians because of those opposite. You might think that this loss of workers entitlements would be wellknown, but far less wellknown is the fact that, having taken money from those hardworking Australians and put it into a slush fund under the guise of portable entitlements, the payment of those entitlements, far from being governed by law, is in fact at the absolute discretion of the trustee. When determining the amount and period of entitlement that the worker shall receive, the decision of the trustee is final and the worker has no right of appeal. The silence from the Labor Party is deafening when it comes to defending themselves on this matter. In fact, we shouldnt expect anything less from the CFMMEU. Funded by money stolen from workers in this way, building unions break the law more than anyone. Responsible in 90 per cent of Federal Court cases for coercion, right of entry and freedom of association breaches, theyre 20 times more likely than all other unions combined to break the law. Indeed, the CFMMEU secretary at the time said, If you play by the law, youll never win. So it is no wonder that the Labor Party, beholden to these union thugs, has chosen to stand in the way of a proposal to offer Australians new opportunities to convert casual employment to fulltime employment to offer flexibility to accommodate family life, caring responsibilities, sport, education and everything else that makes up modern life. Instead they obstinately stick to their union domination, obstructing the government from implementing these important reforms.","Workplace Relations","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator SMALL (Western Australia) ","(16:51):"
"0","0","0","1","1","McAllister, Sen Jenny","121628","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I rise this afternoon to make a quick contribution. I want to draw the attention of senators to two graphs that I think are important. The first of these is the ASX 200. Its sitting at about 6,885 points at close of business today. Its actually very close to where it was in February last year, just prior to COVID, when it was in the low 7,000s. Thats one graph where we see companies doing well. We see wealth and prosperity in a particular camp. Another graph, the Australian Bureau of Statistics Wage Price Index, goes in the opposite direction. It shows that wage growth has collapsed over the last decade. That is concerning, because, whilst I absolutely respect the idea that those who go into business, invest and take a risk should get a rightful return, its got to be proportionate and reasonable. Wealth and prosperity need to be shared by all of those involved in economic activity. So these two graphs cause me great trouble. I see workers paying tax. I see companies not paying tax. These are the sorts of differences that I think we need to look at very, very closely. Theres lots and lots of focus on the traditional battlegrounds for Labor and Liberal in relation to IR. I get that there is absolutely a need to protect workers salaries and to look for an increase, but, as I look at this next IR bill, Ill be looking at it through the lens of prosperity for all.   After more than seven years of being in power, the government are absolutely out of ideas to take this country forward. All weve seen in this debate from those opposite are some bizarre conspiracy theories. I dont think theres any other way you could describe them. There are some old attacks from Senator Abetz. He does like the old attack. We know that hes always good for that. Weve seen him trot them out over the last couple of years. What we havent seen from this government is a plan to actually take the country forward. There is no plan to help workers and their families get ahead and no plan to offer those workers and their families a better future, something to look forward to. We know that they offered none of that before the pandemic, and, since the pandemic hit, as Australians have been looking for a vision of a better future, we have seen nothing from this government but attacks on workers and their conditions. It is absolutely a challenge for working people at the moment. We know that they do want to be optimistic about what the future looks like, but the government are incapable of actually having a vision. They didnt have one before the pandemic and they dont have one now to take the country forward. So stagnant have the conditions been for working Australians since this government was elected that theyve given up trying to look for that better deal with the optimism to seek a solution. No—the only thing theyve come up with is that tired old attack on workers and their conditions, and theyve trotted out trying to appeal to crossbenchers to back them in that mission. The concerning things for Australians is that the government have been in power for so long that they continue to fall back on this trick—this is the only thing theyve got. We see it with working conditions and we see it with the role that theyre trying to play at the moment in undermining superannuation and denying working Australians dignity in retirement. Lets consider what Australians are confronting at the moment. According to the OECD—and we know that those opposite have a lot of faith in the OECD at the moment; Im sure theyre all keeping a close eye on what is going on there—since the AbbottTurnbullMorrison government was elected in 2013, real wages in Australia have declined by 0.7 per cent. This is the governments record: real wages have declined by 0.7 per cent. For wage growth in 2019, Australia was third last out of 35 OECD countries. This is the record of a government that has been in power since 2013. This is what they have delivered for Australian workers. And this is before the pandemic hit. After six years in government, these are the conditions that they left for working people in Australia: real wage growth had declined by 0.7 per cent and in 2019 we were third last out of 35 OECD countries. We know the underutilisation rate is at 15 per cent, well above prepandemic levels, and 2.1 million Australians are unemployed or looking for more work. In Queensland, there is 16 per cent underutilisation, 240,000 people are underemployed and 209,000 people are unemployed. When you look around the country, when you look at whats happening in Queensland, there is such a raw deal for workers. We know that the Liberals and Nationals have dropped their pursuit of the better off overall test, but they only did that because it wouldnt pass the parliament. Since then, the AttorneyGeneral, the minister responsible, when he announced he wouldnt pursue it, called those changes sensible and proportionate. This is the minister that is pursuing these changes—or was pursuing these changes—still saying these changes are sensible and proportionate. What the Australian working people need to know and what their families need to know is that the government will not stop their pursuit of working people and their conditions. We know it becomes an ideological obsession for them, but they actually have no plan that is going to offer those workers a better deal. They have no plan thats going to give those people something to look forward to over the horizon—not tougher conditions when it comes to working people and the way they are dealt with at work. Now, after seven years, it is too late for this government to offer up that vision for the Australian people. Its really important that Labor start to identify that, and we saw elements of that in Queensland last week, where federal Labor leader Anthony Albanese started to outline some of his vision for working people in Australia, and that is important.","Workplace Relations","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p","Senator PATRICK (South Australia) ","(17:00):"
"0","0","0","1","1","McAllister, Sen Jenny","121628","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," Too many times I hear Labor take a very ordinary position, but todays statement is a new low. This Labor MPI demonstrates the counterproductive, antibusiness, antifamily and, in fact, antiemployee position. The politics of Labor is class war, and in this war the casualties are the very people that they are purporting to stand for. The worker who desires the flexibility to earn as much as possible, while balancing commitments to family, school hours and events, should not be locked into some draconian system that forces them and their employer into an unfavourable work plan, dreamed up by a union hack convinced that a class war is not only imminent but required. The world is changing, and the unions are struggling to keep up. A couple of months ago, I heard evidence at an inquiry where a union told me that employees did not want to work from home and, in fact, they had not asked them that. Yet, we know that since the pandemic the world has changed very rapidly indeed.  This position demonstrates the fantasy world that Labor live in, where jobs are magically created, and their lack of understanding of what it means to mortgage your home, to work all hours, to build a business, carefully budgeting to add another staff member, and to deal with the paperwork, the changing awards, the complexity of payments. All they want to talk about is stolen wages. I can tell you, as a smallbusiness operator, as one of the people who provide 60 per cent of jobs in Australia, that this is not a responsibility that is taken lightly. The relationship that you have with your staff is so important. The position Labor have taken can only be reached by people whove never employed someone else, whove never sweated over paying creditors and wages and hopefully leaving something in the tin for your family. It is a position based on a lie. My experience was quite the reverse. When I came into that business, I offered casual workers permanent roles. While some were pleased to take on a permanent role, there were others who absolutely did not want to. They enjoyed the additional 25 per cent payment in lieu of holiday pay and sick leave. They liked the flexibility of being able to manage their family life. They liked to be able to start at hours that suited them and me. This belief that employers are just out to exploit workers and stamp on the throat of the little guy is rooted in the Dark Ages. It bears no relevance to today. They dont understand that there is already a condition in place that allows casuals to be offered permanency and in fact converts casuals to permanency. But many casuals do not want that. They want the flexibility of home life and work. If we mandate that casuals must become permanent or that employers must alter the working hours of casual people every week in order to comply with that requirement, how is that good for employees? How is that good for families? It is just, again, a lack of understanding of what it is like in the world of small business. We should be protecting those people who want more flexible working arrangements and who want to be able to negotiate with their employer wages and conditions that are mutually beneficial. The coalitions industrial relations reforms achieve balance. They make it easier for workers and employers to get the job done with minimal fuss, less red tape and more flexibility. Again, I cannot emphasise enough the role of smallbusiness people in Australia. They employ anywhere from one to 100 additional people, and they do not create jobs from some magical fairy dust, as Labor would have you believe, but they create these jobs out of blood, sweat and sacrifice from their families. So I want to welcome Labor and the unions to join the 21st century and to listen to what workers actually want, instead of simply channelling Karl Marx to dictate oldfashioned employment practices.","Workplace Relations","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator McDONALD (Queensland) ","(17:08):"
"0","0","0","1","1","McAllister, Sen Jenny","121628","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," In serving the people of Queensland and Australia, I note that Senator Pratt is fixated on a problem, not the solution. Yesterday the government took the first step in recognising One Nations legitimate concerns for employees and employers. It booted out the BOOT. Australians need and deserve genuine improvement to our broken industrial relations system. Firstly, casual workers are being abused and exploited. Secondly, the needs of small business have been ignored by everyone except One Nation. The new bills definition of casual is complex. It suggests that the employers intention expressed at the time of commencement of employment is the only factor. Its not. The definition also refers to no firm advance commitment, yet many casuals have a firm advance commitment and many have a regular pattern of hours, because it suits both the worker and the business.  My second concern is with the proposed right to conversion. It burdens many small businesses and puts the casual loading at risk for workers who enjoy the benefit of a casual loading. The answer is to reduce red tape and complexity for small business and, likewise, to widen the window of opportunity for workers to apply for conversion. My third and overriding concern is offsetting claims, section 545A. I do not support double dipping on entitlements, yet I will fight to protect workers legal and moral entitlements, just as I have done relentlessly in the Hunter Valley for 20 months. Recently the CFMMEUs mining division agreed that their union has ignored casuals for many years, and its national legal director, Mr Bukarica, had the courage and integrity to acknowledge the Hunter Valley division has caused and enabled exploitation of casual workers. Labors Joel Fitzgibbon ignored abused casuals in the Hunter and hid their core problems. One Nation stands for the ignored workers that Labor ignores. Were ready to work together with the government and with all parties to improve this bill for employers and for employees.","Workplace Relations","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1/speech[10]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator ROBERTS (Queensland) ","(17:13):"
"0","0","0","1","1","McAllister, Sen Jenny","121628","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I am pleased to speak on todays matter of public importance on workplace relations, because it represents one of the most critical issues currently before this parliament—an issue of the utmost importance to many millions of Australian wage earners and indeed for the broader Australian economy.  It is clear that no matter the circumstances in the economy the Morrison Liberal government is hellbent on making it easier to cut workers pay and conditions. This will of course come as no surprise to hardworking, wageearning Australians, but it certainly does seem a strange way to try and rebuild our economy and improve the lives of working Australians. It seems strange because pretty much every economic commentator, including the Reserve Bank, has said that lifting stagnant wage growth poses one of the most significant challenges to Australias short, medium and longterm economic success; and strange because wages, already flatlining and already struggling for many years under this government have really taken a tumble in the past year. In fact, just yesterday, the latest weekly payroll figures from the ABS, the Australian Bureau of Statistics, showed that since 14 March last year wages for men in my state of Tasmania have fallen 5.6 per cent—fallen by more than five per cent, a real cut to the take home pay of tens of thousands of working people and their families. Mr Morrison and his Liberal government want to see those pay packets cut further. Its ideological, not to mention economic, lunacy and its been noticed in the community. Just today in the Hobart newspaper The Mercury, an eminent Tasmanian barrister, Fabiano Cangelosi, after analysing the Morrison governments industrial relations omnibus bill, wrote: The bill seeks to replicate the Howard governments WorkChoices legislation by unbalancing the beneficial value of the economy against working Australians. … … … The omnibus Bill amounts to an attempt at capitalising on COVID19 disruption to wreak lasting change on the industrial relations landscape. … … … If passed into law, the overall effect will be a workforce reduced to the level of a mere exploitable resource for big business. The omnibus Bill repudiates the core constitutional role of the federal government: to make law for the common good. These are apt descriptions of the governments bill and their intent. Just yesterday, the Morrison government again confirmed it still wants to cut workers takehome pay. The AttorneyGeneral and the Prime Minister were quite clear: they are only prepared to remove from their bill their plan to scrap the better off overall test because they do not have the votes in this place to secure passage. Theyre not prepared to drop that component because they have suddenly realised that it is unfair, and theyre not prepared to drop it because theyve accepted that enabling the further erosion of the pay of hardworking Australians is not in the national economic interest, no; they just cant get it through the Senate. In fact, in his statement yesterday, the AttorneyGeneral stated he still believed the changes to the BOOT are sensible and proportionate—not quite the description I would use for a change that would remove the safety net for workers and give employers significantly more power to cut pay and reduce entitlements, but we know that they are merely retreating on this occasion for the sake of political expediency because they know that the remaining components of their omnibus bill will continue to work towards their aim of making it easier to cut workers takehome pay, and we know that, given the opportunity, they will rapidly bring back changes proposed to BOOT. Labor has always set a very simple test when it comes to any changes to industrial relations. We would support the legislation if it delivered secure jobs with decent pay. The governments legislation still fails that test. Labor has always made it clear that, while the BOOT change was the most egregious attack on job security and workers pay in the governments bill, it certainly was not the only one. The new laws will continue to make it easier for businesses to employ people as casuals, even when they work like permanent workers. This will only result in more insecure work—and insecure work, over time, always means lower pay and fewer conditions. What is crystal clear is that the Morrison government is not on the side of working families, and it never delivers.

But its clear that not only does the government want to allow employers to cut wages; it—that is, the government—is actually leading the charge to suppress wages in this country.  One of the biggest levers the government has to change wages across our society and across our economy is its setting of public sector wages, and it is using that lever ruthlessly to depress wages as quickly as it can. Public sector wage caps have helped ensure that wage growth for private sector workers has been flat for years. There has been no pressure on private employers to lift wages. The governments official policy is, and Ill quote from government documents, that Commonwealth public sector wage rises can no longer exceed wage rises in the private sector. This policy locks in low wages and low wage growth for all workers in the country—public and private sector workers. By increasing wages to public sector employees, the private sector would have to follow and most workers would end up better off. But thats not what this government has chosen to do. We know that big businesses are pocketing more and more of their profits, and their servants in the Liberal Party want to keep it that way, and one of the ways they are doing that is by gutting protections in the already weak Fair Work Act. Make no mistake, there is a growing gap between the rich and the poor in this country, and the Liberals are working to widen that gap at every opportunity. Colleagues, the combined wealth of Australias billionaires rose by more than 50 per cent in the last 12 months, in the middle of a global pandemic, turbocharging the gap between the superwealthy and the not so well off in Australia. And that gap is still growing, because, while the billionaires get evermore obscenely rich, wage growth is flatlining and millions of Australians remain unemployed or underemployed. The Liberals want to keep wages low and they want to make sure house prices keep soaring. Thats all well and good if youre a wealthy landowner or the CEO of a major corporation or a billionaire, but, if youre a renter and a worker, youre left to fight for the scraps; and, if youre currently out of work or underemployed, youve been left completely high and dry by this government. We need to make sure that income supports rise in this country and we need to make sure that billionaires and the big corporations, particularly the big polluting fossil fuel corporations, pay their fair share of tax so we can fund quality public services in Australia.

In the words of Christine, a cleaner and United Workers Union member:  There will always be bad bosses. We do not aim to make it easier for them to cut wages and change the limited working conditions we already have. Christine is one of my heroes this week because she had the courage to speak out publicly about the governments plan to cut workers pay. She, along with thousands of Australian workers, has sent a strong message to all of us in this place, and that message is to completely reject the governments nasty industrial relations bill. Today, along with Christine, I want to recognise the courage of Karen. Karen is the registered nurse and ANMF member who came to testify at public hearings on the governments plan. Despite turning up to the hearings on time, prepared and ready, Karen was denied the opportunity to speak. She was denied the opportunity to tell her story, so I will tell her story here. This is what she wants to tell Scott Morrison and everyone in this place: We are the backbone and the forefront of our healthcare system. We are the ones who know our patients. We are the ones who keep our patients comfortable and safe. Were the ones that reassure our patients and their families. We are the ones that care for them at night, all night, when most other people are tucked up in bed. We are the ones who work weekends, doing what we always do, missing out on kids sports and family functions. We are the ones who cheerily spend Christmas Day with our patients, while missing out on our own. And she says: To allow the possibility of removing the protection of EBA standards is a slap in the face of myself and all the other nurses in the country who, without question, sacrificed so much for our community. So Australians should not be fooled: the governments backflip on the better off overall test this week will not protect Australians from being worse off under this bill. Jules is a hospo worker and a member of the Hospo Voice union. She sees right through the governments spin. Jules says: The government has worded and spun the bill in a way that sounds like its friendly to workers. After all, increasing flexibility and ending the confusion of casualisation sound pretty good, right? Wrong. When you get into the nuts and bolts, workers end up getting less. She is right. There are wholesale changes in the governments bill that will mean more lowwage and nonunion agreements, exactly when Australians need a pay rise to keep their heads above water. And there are wholesale changes in the governments bill that will make more workers casual, exactly when Australians are crying out for more job security. There are wholesale changes in this bill—this nasty plan—to make parttime work casual, exactly hurting our essential workers, who need regular, secure hours to make ends meet and to care for their own families. The experts have spoken on this bill, and Im talking about the workers, like Christine, Karen and Jules, who have spoken out about this governments nasty plan. They already work hard for wages that are, at best, modest. They are the people weve called on again and again in this pandemic to keep us safe and to keep our community moving. Cleaners, nurses, hospo workers—these are the people who fought for us during the pandemic. They should not have to fight a pay cut that is being inflicted by their own government. But today I stand with them and I congratulate them for having the courage to stand up and do just that.","Workplace Relations","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1/speech[13]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator WALSH (Victoria) ","(17:23):"

I move: That this bill be now read a second time. I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted. The speech read as follows— The Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals and Other Measures) Bill 2020 makes important amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 that will strengthen Australias customs practice. The Bill will incorporate the Customs Tariff Proposals that provided concessional rates of customs duty for goods required to combat the COVID19 pandemic. The Bill will also make a series of changes to further enhance the operation of the Customs Tariff Act and realign certain aspects of that Act with international practice. Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2020 and Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 2) 2020, were tabled in parliament in May and August this year. The Proposals created temporary concessional items in Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act that provide a Free rate of customs duty for medical supplies, such us face masks, soaps and eyewear, urgently required to combat the COVID19 pandemic. Initially, the concessional item covered a 6month period from 1 February to 31 July 2020. A review determined that the concession helped facilitate the import of crucial medical and hygiene goods and had been enthusiastically received by business and the public. As such, the Government extended the concession for a further 5 months until 31 December this year. The Bill confirms the application of those temporary concessions. This Bill also makes a series of Customs Tariff Act changes that implement six measures designed to improve the functionality of the Act and bring it back into line with international practice. The first of these measures introduces new tariff subheadings for formulated caffeinated beverages, formulated supplementary foods and formulated supplementary sports foods. The new subheadings for these goods reference the definitions provided in the Australian New Zealand Food Standards Code. These subheadings will allow the identification and monitoring of the products as they cross the Australian border as part of the Imported Food Inspection Scheme. This will help ensure that these goods meet Australian standards and are safe for consumption by the public. Measures 2, 3 and 4 realign the Customs Tariff Act with international tariff classification practices. The Customs Tariff Act incorporates the World Customs Organizations Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, commonly referred to as the Harmonized System. The Harmonized System is used by 183 countries and covers 98 per cent of global trade. The Harmonized System provides means for identifying a good as it moves from one country to another, ensuring that what Australia calls a tomato is the same as what every other user of the Harmonized System calls a tomato. The fundamental principle of the Harmonized System is that all tradeable goods have one, and only one, classification. The structure of Harmonized System Headings, Section and Chapter notes and Interpretive Rules that have been incorporated into the Customs Tariff Act, determine a goods classification. The World Customs Organization periodically issues binding rulings on the classification of goods, where the classification is uncertain or disputed, and all countries, including Australia, are obliged to make every effort to adopt these rulings. Measure 2 will introduce an Additional Note into the Customs Tariff Act stating that wheeled garbage bins, commonly referred to as wheelie bins, are not un‑motorised vehicles of Chapter 87 of the Customs Tariff Act. This new Additional Note will restore the classification of wheelie bins to a classification that is consistent with international practice after a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal held that wheelie bins be classified as un‑motorised vehicles Measure 3 introduces a series of Additional Notes that clarify the difference between vitamin products and other supplements which are medicaments with proven therapeutic and prophylactic benefits, and those intended to supplement a persons diet. This division is required by the Harmonized System. The distinction between these two classes of goods will be made through reference to Schedules 2, 3, 4 and 8 of the Poisons Standard which refer to Pharmacy Medicine, Pharmacist Only Medicine, Prescription Only Medicine and Controlled Drug respectively. The medicines listed in the Schedules of the Poisons Standard are the product of an objective and well established process undertaken by experts in this field. These amendments are required because domestic tribunal and court decisions have caused Australias classification to become misaligned with international practice. Measure 4 introduces a series of Additional Notes that clarify the distinction between goods which should be classified as specialised parts of another good and goods that should be classified as pieces of metal of various shapes. Again, these amendments are required because domestic tribunal and court decisions have caused Australias classifications to become misaligned with international practice. Measure 5 removes the $12,000 special customs duty on used and second‑hand motor vehicles applied under the PeruAustralia Free Trade Agreement and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans‑Pacific Partnership. Both of these agreements were negotiated using versions of Customs Tariff Act which predated the removal of the $12,000 special customs duty. The terms of both agreements required they be implemented as negotiated, meaning the $12,000 special customs duty had to be included in the enabling legislation. This measure unilaterally removes the $12,000 special customs duty applied to Peruvian and Trans‑Pacific Partnership originating goods, bringing them in line with the rest of the Customs Tariff Act. Lastly, measure 6 makes a number of technical amendments, which remove redundant provisions from Schedules 5 to 12, covering Australias numerous free trade agreements. These redundant provisions are phasing rates that have been fully implemented, are no longer required in the text of the Act. Debate adjourned.","Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals and Other Measures) Bill 2020","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[25]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator SESELJA (Australian Capital Territory—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) ","(17:31):"

"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I rise to speak on the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 and the related bill and express my strong opposition to this misguided reform. The Family Court was established in 1975 under the Whitlam Labor government as a standalone specialist Family Court. The establishment of the court along with nofault divorce put Australia at the forefront of developments in the field of family law. Whitlams reform served as a model that was lauded and adopted around the world. This is a history and legacy we should be proud of and committed to constantly improving, not dismantling, and that is what this legislation seeks to do—to dismantle one of the most important components of our family law framework while at the same time failing to address the real issues plaguing the current family law system.  This legislation would strip the Family Court of its essential distinguishing feature—its specialist nature as a superior court dedicated to family law. It would merge the Family Court with one of Australias most poorly resourced and overburdened courts, the Federal Circuit Court. As Ms Pauline Wright, President of the Law Council of Australia, has explained, this merger would mean that Australian families and children would have to compete for the resourcing and hearing time with all federal matters—that is, on matters like migration, bankruptcy and those sort of things that the Federal Circuit Court and the Federal Court deal with it. The merger would result in the effective abolition of the Family Court of Australia, a respected, specialised and focused court dealing with family law issues. She said—and I agree—that there must be an increase, not a decrease, in specialisation within family law and violence issues. This is critical to the safety of children and the victims of family violence. Family law matters are not like other legal matters that generalist courts tend to deal with. They involve complex relationships, power dynamics and, most importantly, the lives and wellbeing of children. These matters require nuanced, experienced and specialised responses, the kinds of responses that are made possible by a specialised court like the Family Court. At the time the Family Law Bill was debated in 1974, Gough Whitlam recognised the importance of specialisations, when he said: The Family Court will, of course, determine legal rights, which it is bound to do as a court, but it will do much more than that. Here will be a court, the expressly stated purpose of which is to provide help, encouragement and counselling to parties … and to have regard to their human problems, not just their legal rights. Recognising the importance of a specialised family court is not to deny the serious problems that currently exist in the family law system. Multiple reports over the last decade have explored these problems and diagnosed them as real causes. The Australian Law Reform Commission has conducted one of the most comprehensive inquiries into the family law system. Its landmark report, which this government has ignored, stated: … the family law system has been deprived of resources to such an extent that it cannot deliver the quality of justice expected of a country like Australia, and to whose family law system other countries once looked and tried to emulate. Over the last seven years of Liberal government, the family law system has been neglected. Family Court and Federal Circuit Court judges have not been replaced in a timely manner. Funding has not increased to match growing demand. Legal assistance services that support children and the most vulnerable litigants have been squeezed of resources. But, instead of fixing these underlying issues, the government is determined to restructure the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court in a way that makes a bad situation even worse for families and children. This legislation is not the solution. It is opposed by virtually all of the family law sector. Some 110 stakeholders have written to the AttorneyGeneral asking him to abandon this legislation. They include judges, legal sector representatives, child protection advocates and First Nations stakeholders. To take just one eminent example, Elizabeth Evatt AC, the very first Chief Justice of the Family Court, warned: Merging the Family Court into a generalist court will undermine the integrity and the structural specialisation of the Family Court. … … … The increasing number of cases in which issues of family violence and child abuse are raised has led to an even greater need today for family law jurisdiction to be vested exclusively in specialised judges who can give their full attention to the needs of family law clients without being diverted to exercise other unrelated jurisdictions. The current bill undermines this principle, is not in the public interest and should not be enacted. I want to speak briefly about the First Nations perspective. The National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services has said that the proposed merger: will disproportionately impact the most vulnerable including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and families who need the most support. Theyve said: From our experience, as Aboriginal organisations, we say that mainstreaming does not achieve efficiency or better outcomes for our people and that specialisation in the law is important and it works. Our main call is for more specialisation and more resourcing into the cultural competence of the family court system. The introduction of specialist Aboriginal Courts in the family law system has seen an increase in Aboriginal participation. We implore the Parliament to do the right thing by our communities and reject this bill which does not address the root causes of these problems. We fear, in the middle of this global pandemic, the bill will exacerbate the issues that our communities are facing. How often do the pleas and beggings of First Nations organisations have to be made in the chamber only to see them ignored? It seems youre only capable of hearing about what you can do to the First Nations peoples and not what you can do with us. Even with a First Nations minister, why is it so difficult for this government to listen and to respond to First Nations peoples? Only two days ago in this parliament, to mark the anniversary of the National Apology to the Stolen Generations, in my statement to this chamber I spoke of the terrible suffering and grief caused by the removal of children. I spoke of the continuing pain caused by the overrepresentation of First Nations children in outofhome care today. Let me repeat some of those salient facts. First Nations children are nearly 10 times more likely to be living in outofhome care than nonIndigenous children. There are currently over 20,000 First Nations children in outofhome care in Australia. They make up 37 per cent of the total number of children in outofhome care, despite representing only six per cent of the childrens population. More First Nations children are in care than at the time of the Bringing them homereport, which was published more than 20 years ago. These figures are totally unacceptable, and they are worsening. While the child protection system is distinct from the family law system, there is a critical connection. The family law system plays an important part in diverting families from the child protection system. It is an avenue for families. Its an avenue they can use to raise issues early and enable family members to step in and seek care of their children without the intervention of the state. By accessing specialist courts proactively, aunties, uncles, grandparents and parents can protect their children and ensure they remain connected to family and country in ways that are made much more difficult once child protection services get involved. A bill that diminishes the Family Court and the Family Court system is a bill that does not serve the interests of First Nations peoples. Yet, again, this government shows its disdain for the views of First Nations peoples. A good family law system would take a human rights approach underpinned by principles of selfdetermination. A good family law system would see the appointment of specialist judges with the ability to decide cases in culturally appropriate ways. A good family law system would fund the preparation of cultural reports to aid those judges in their decisionmaking. A good family law system would adequately fund the legal assistance services to provide advice and representation to vulnerable litigants, including First Nations litigants. A good family law system would provide family support services that are culturally safe for First Nations peoples. All of these things our government can do, but will they do them? No. On the vote of a couple of people were going to go down the road and destroy one of the best things done under the Whitlam government. It has proven to be one of our best institutions in this nation, despite the lack of resourcing. The government can do all of these things. Instead, they are intent on dismantling a core component of what once made our family law system the envy of the world.  [by video link] I rise to speak against the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019. These bills will rob the Family Court of its essential distinguishing feature by collapsing it into one of Australias busiest, most poorly resourced and overburdened courts—the Federal Circuit Court. This merger is being proposed without a sound policy basis and against expert advice. The Family Court of Australia is a proud Whitlam legacy. Like most of the great social reforms that have occurred in Australia—from Medicare to our worldleading superannuation system to free legal assistance services for Australians in need—the Family Court of Australia is an institution that has served our nation admirably. The Family Law Act 1975 instituted two major changes—nofault divorce and the establishment of the Family Court of Australia, a specialist, multidisciplinary court for the resolution of family disputes. This legislation is proposing to undo the second of the major changes introduced by the Family Law Act—the establishment of the Family Court of Australia as a specialist superior court. This would be a profoundly retrograde step that would harm Australian families and in particular children at their time of greatest need. The Morrison government claims that the proposed merger has been informed by independent reviews and inquiries over a decade. The AttorneyGenerals Department website lists five reports under the heading The evidence base for the reforms. In fact, none of the reports listed on the website recommended these radical reforms—none whatsoever. None of those reports even considered these reforms. In fact, the only one of the five reports that recommended restructuring the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court recommended an entirely different model that would have maintained a standalone specialist family law court. The proposal to merge the Family Court with the Federal Circuit Court is not based on any consultation with Australian families or family law experts. More than 155 stakeholders in Australias family law system have now signed an open letter to the AttorneyGeneral opposing the governments flawed legislation to abolish the specialist standalone Family Court. These signatories represent a range of professions and community organisations, from the Law Council of Australia to womens legal services, community legal centres, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services, child protection advocates, and disability services from across Australia. They also include 11 retired Family Court and Federal Circuit Court judges and chief justices, the Hon. Elizabeth Evatt AC, and the Hon. Alastair Nicholson AO, RFD, QC. Individuals and organisations oppose this proposal because they believe that it will harm vulnerable children and families in need of specialist family law assistance; increase rather than decrease cost, time and stress for families and children in the family law system; place further stresses on Federal Circuit Court judges, who are struggling under unsafe, unsustainable and unconscionable workloads; and fail to address any of the fundamental problems plaguing the family law system, including the risk of family violence survivors falling through the cracks. Northern Territory stakeholders who have signed onto that letter include representatives from the Darwin Community Legal Service, the Central Australian Womens Legal Service, the Central Australian Family Violence and Sexual Assault Network, the Katherine Womens Legal Service, Dawn House, Northern Territory Council of Social Service and the Sex Worker Outreach Program Northern Territory. National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services have said that the proposed merger will disproportionately impact the most vulnerable, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and families who need the most support. They say: From our experience, as Aboriginal organisations, we say that mainstreaming does not achieve efficiency or better outcomes for our people and that specialisation in the law is important and it works. Our main call is for more specialisation and more resourcing into the cultural competence of the family court system. The introduction of specialist Aboriginal Courts in the family law system has seen an increase in Aboriginal participation. We implore the Parliament to do the right thing by our communities and reject this bill which does not address the root causes of these problems. We fear, in the middle of this global pandemic, the bill will exacerbate the issues that our communities are facing. The CEO of Community Legal Centres Australia, Nassim Arrage, said the merger would move away from a specialist family court model, exposing survivors of family violence to unnecessary risk. Law Council president Dr Brasch QC said: As the impacts of the devastating shadow pandemic of family violence experienced during the COVID19 pandemic continue, now is not the time to proceed with an unnecessary, risky bill that has been opposed by all nongovernment members of the House of Representatives. As signatories have said, if anything, there is in fact more need for a specialist Family Court. As the Australian Law Reform Commission noted in its landmark 2019 report on the family law system, a report the government commissioned but has completely ignored, the Whitlam government could not have foreseen the growth in the incidence and awareness of family violence and child abuse since 1975. Here in the Northern Territory, the Central Australian Womens Legal Service, a signatory to the open letter, agrees that action can be taken now to further increase family violence specialisation in the family law system. Womens legal services across Australia work on the frontline to represent family violence victimsurvivors in all state and territory justice systems. They recognise that the core business of the family law court is family violence, yet the family law system is not adequately protecting the safety of women and children. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families experience family violence at higher rates than other Australian families. In comparison with other Australian women, First Nations women are 34 times more likely to be hospitalised as a result of family violence and 10 times more likely to be killed. Here in the Northern Territory, we have one of the highest rates per capita of domestic and family violence in Australia. We know this because we have mandatory reporting of domestic violence in the Northern Territory. It was something that I introduced as Minister for Children and Families in 2009. We did this in order to recognise that we needed to change attitudes towards family and domestic violence and that it is everyones problem. The National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, NACCHO, points out that there remains significant fear amongst First Nations people about engaging with the family law system as a result of the historical legacy of the forced removal of children and forced resettlement of communities. As my colleague Senator Dodson has said in his response to this bill, weve only seen again and again, in the reports this week of the stolen generations, the continued trauma of families of First Nations children throughout the country. NACCHO recommend that legal education, information options and processes be made more accessible to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in First Nations languages, plain English and formats appropriate to particular communities and age groups; and that Aboriginal community controlled health organisations, ACCHOS, are funded to provide family dispute resolution practitioners programs. English language and literacy issues have presented a barrier to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people accessing the family law system and related services, particularly when English is not a first language or when there are literacy difficulties. I have stood in the Senate on so many occasions to express the enormity of the different languages that we have here in the Northern Territory—the nearly 100 First Nations languages that are covered under the Aboriginal Interpreter Service system here. While appropriately trained and qualified onsite interpreters can be critical to mitigating communication barriers, the availability of interpreters, particularly in First Nations languages, can be severely limited. Further compounding and complicating communication barriers is the need for interpreters to be of a particular gender or age—even a particular relationship to the client. Technical legal terms and processes, the relationship between a client and their lawyer and conflictofinterest issues also make some interpreters inappropriate. Without adequate legal representation, clients may not understand their legal options and may not convey their case effectively in court. We know that there are problems in the Family Court, and these have led to unacceptable delays for families and, in particular, for children, but these issues do not arise out of its specialisation or even its structure. The reason why the family law system is not performing as it should is that for seven years the Liberal government has cut funding to legal assistance services like ATSILS, family violence prevention legal services and other Aboriginal community controlled organisations. Its failed to replace retiring judges in a timely manner and failed to even respond to the dozens of recommendations that have been made by experts to improve the family law system. As the Australian Law Reform Commission found: … the family law system has been deprived of resources to such an extent that it cannot deliver the quality of justice expected of a country like Australia, and to whose family law system other countries once looked and tried to emulate. This does have impacts for most Australians, but particularly for my constituents here in the Northern Territory, where getting to court and accessing legal services can be difficult for people in rural and remote regions, most of whom are First Nations people. The Central Australian Aboriginal Family Legal Unit points out that, due to geographic and economic restrictions, many First Nations families have limited or no access to family law services. In Alice Springs, for instance, the federal Family Court sits only three or four times a year. The local court does not exercise family law jurisdiction. This presents significant challenges to the ongoing safety of First Nations families experiencing family violence who require urgent family law orders. Will this bill help solve this issue or, as the evidence from experts points out, will this merger proposal in fact increase the cost, time and stress for families and children and place further stress on Federal Circuit Court judges? As the experts have made very clear, this merger proposal will do nothing to address delays in the family court system. There is nothing in this bill that will increase the number of interpreters, judges, registrars and other court staff. There is nothing in this bill that will force the AttorneyGeneral to do his job, even something as basic as appointing new judges as vacancies are created. There are many things that need fixing within the family law system, but this bill will do none of it. This bill will do nothing to help Australian families.  It is quite an honour to follow Senator McCarthy and Senator Dodson. If there are two people in this chamber who have some expertise around First Nations groups, then it is these two. Senator Dodsons track record is enormous, over many, many years. He is not known as the father of reconciliation for nothing. And yet his contribution today, pleading with the government, pointing out how bad the merger of the court systems will be for our First Nations people, has fallen on deaf ears, I suspect, as he said. Senator McCarthy has lived her life in the Northern Territory, a territory which has very vulnerable citizens living in it. Senator McCarthy has been a minister in a Labor government in the Territory. She has some expertise in these matters. And yet the comments that she made, in the very valid contribution that she made, about the likely impact of this legislation on First Nations people in the Territory will, I suspect, be ignored. Ive had the honour today of chairing a lot of the Senate proceedings and Ive heard a lot of the debate. Noone has put to me yet why this merger makes sense—noone. Senator McCarthy, when she started her speech, alluded to the fact that the ministers website, under the justification for the court mergers, has five reports, none of which recommend what is currently being proposed. The other issue that disturbs me greatly is: its one thing to have a debate in this place and do the best you can to negotiate to try and get improved outcomes as particular parties see fit; its quite another just to trade your vote off for some improvement in your state or some commitment to something else at a later stage. That is not democracy, and there is not a single group outside of the Morrison government who thinks this proposed merger has any merit at all. I dont know why that falls on deaf ears. Surely someone on the government side is listening. Weve yet to learn about why this merger is taking place. Certainly none of the legal centres in this country agree to it. None of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal centres think its a good idea. Former judges dont think its a good idea. So why is the Morrison government doing this? Weve seen, particularly this week but certainly since the time of Mr Abbotts election as Prime Minister, that this government really hasnt done much towards the advancement of women. Is this yet another example of that, because women are disproportionately affected by the outcomes of the family law court? Is it that continued ignorance and donothing approach in relation to women thats driving the Morrison government? Their budget this year was criticised from all sorts of quarters because it didnt deliver to women. Is that why the government are doing this? Is it a punishment of young children? Weve again seen the Morrison governments childcare policies not deliver for children. Is that what theyre doing? Australian families are now out of pocket in relation to childcare costs. Is it a continuation of not caring about the welfare of children thats at stake here? Weve seen the Abbott government, the Turnbull government and the Morrison government try to force more responsibility and costs onto the states. Is that whats driving this move? I think it was Mr Turnbull who came up with the idea, at the snap of his fingers, that somehow the states should fund their health systems. Mr Morrison is very good at saying its not his responsibility. Is this merger about forcing the states to pick up more responsibility? When we go to welfare issues and the negative outcomes that will undoubtedly result from this merger of the court system, who picks up the cost for that? Not the federal government; it will be the states, because theyre responsible for welfare. Today we heard from Senator Dodson and Senator McCarthy about the appalling state of child removal, which could get much worse with a court system thats merged. Personally, Ive had experience with the family law court. My experience was pretty reasonable and fairly quick, because I was able to settle most things amicably with my former partner. We both had to go to the family law court and explain how our children would be dealt with. Im an educated, middleclass woman, but, even for me, that was pretty onerous. I cant imagine how women and, indeed, men will get on in a merged system where those support services are much harder to access, or may, in fact, fall away. Ive also been inside the criminal court system. Ill tell you what: the court building in WA is very stark. The family law court is actually quite a nice building, but the central law courts are not a place you want to be. Theyre full of police. We already know about many peoples poor interaction with the police, but the police are there because theyve got other matters to transact. Nevertheless, thats what you are confronted with. Theyre heavily secured, as they should be. But vulnerable people who have to go through that and have their bags searched—maybe theyve got children with them—are already in an emotional state. Thats a very poor experience. WA is not a heavily populated state, but the central law courts are a big place to find your way around. Ive sat on a couple of jury trials. I did my duty. But to see the vulnerabilities that I saw as a juror was awful, and merging our court systems will put all sorts of people in the same area. Its just a very poor system. Ive spoken about this in this place before, and a lot of Labor senators made their contribution today. Is this being done because this was put in place by Gough Whitlam, the great social reformer? We know that the Morrison government certainly doesnt like Medicare. It attacks Medicare at every opportunity. The amazing reforms that Mr Whitlam put in place have lasted us through to this day. One of the really important reforms was nofault divorce and the establishment of a special court to deal with family breakup. As a young person, or even as an older person, its a big deal when you commit to someone through formal marriage. You see your life before you with a partner, maybe children, owning a home together, having your soulmate at your side—its a big deal to make that commitment. For many couples in Australia, including me, it doesnt work out. At that point, you dont want to be having to deal with more vulnerabilities or having to go to court in an emotional state and not be dealt with in a fair manner. In a Family Court situation, youre not dealing with people who are on top of their game, in lots of cases, because their emotions are all over the shop. That is made much worse when, as weve heard from many other senators, its coupled with domestic violence and family violence. If you have also experienced domestic violence, imagine then having to go to some kind of merged court. I want to talk about my mother. When my mother went through her divorce to my father, it was before Gough brought the reforms in, so they had to invent a reason for their divorce. The other point was that in the days that my mother got divorced there was a list in the local newspaper of who was getting divorced and the reasons—the reasons! My mother was a prominent woman in the local community. She was a deputy principal of a primary school. She was devastated at having to come up with a reason. Her marriage, like mine, simply broke down. The easiest way to get a divorce, when we didnt have nofault divorce, was to imagine the reason was adultery. Imagine how my mother felt putting the reason for her marriage breakdown as adultery, and imagine when that was published in the paper. What a scandal! My mum was still in love with my father when they divorced, and having to go through that bogus system of having it published in the paper that (1) she was divorced and (2) that it was adultery, must have been awful. So, thankfully, with the evolution of the specialist Family Court weve done away with nofault divorces. But, gee, you have to wonder. I believe it was under the Abbott government, though I stand to be corrected, that Kevin Andrews, the minister at that time, came up with this notion that people were going to make money available for couples counselling—it was $200, from memory—to try to stop people going down the divorce track. So weve seen a little tiny snip, snip: before you get divorced, well just give you a bit of counselling. This is from a government that stands in this place every day of the week and tells us how it doesnt interfere in the lives of individuals. It doesnt look over peoples shoulders. It doesnt tell them how to spend their money. Yet, here we have a government that wants to dictate how you get a divorce. Of course, youve heard from many senators in this place today about the resource issue at the Family Court, and none of us are glossing over that. There is a resource issue. Weve had a conservative government thats been slow to appoint judges and that has starved the court system of dollars. I remember when Senator Cash—I think it was Senator Cash—and Senator Brandis, who was still around, decided to take money off the CLCs. So, for whatever reason the government has—which is completely hidden not only from Labor senators and other senators who oppose the bill in this place but from anyone connected with the Family Court—we have a government that wants to reduce funding to the courts. When the government took funding away from the community legal centres, they denied it for about eight months. Senators Brandis and Cash finally had to fess up that, yes, they had done that, and they quickly slipped some of the money back. I mean, Ive seen how those community legal centres work. They operate off the smell of an oily rag. Were a wealthy country. We should have a properly resourced, separate family law court. I hope tonight we will hear from the minister why the government are wanting to merge the courts, because it makes sense to noone except the few people in the Morrison government who came up with this idea. Roll out the organisations that support this merger because we havent heard from them. Noone in here has named any of them. Weve just heard opposition after opposition from leading specialists, from former judges. It is a good system. Yes, there are issues with it. It is a resourcing issue. Ask anyone and thats what they will tell you. I cant believe we are here debating a bill tonight which has essentially been traded away for some kind of partisan interest. Its disgraceful and that is not how democracy works in this country. You have a fair debate, you have a fair process, and you dont go and do a side deal with a couple of senators to get your legislation passed; that is not democracy.  I rise to make my contribution to this cluster mess that weve got in front of us here. There is nothing more powerful than when you hear from senators who speak on an issue that they have either lived or breathed recently, or for many years. It is powerful and it is even more moving when they can share their experiences of the topic at hand. I myself have been lucky; I have not had to go to the Family Court. I have been a visitor at times to certain other courts. Senator Gallacher, that was all in a fair days work, wasnt it, mate? Before I talk about the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions), I want to touch on the statement of Senator Lambie. I was in here earlier this morning to hear Senator Lambies passionate contribution; it was powerful. What got me was when Senator Lambie made one statement. She said, its gone from a lawyers picnic to a lawyers banquet. I just want to share a few stories here. I consider lawyers essential when youve got yourself into a bit of manure and you need to get out of it, but, to me, they are like insuring your car—noone wants to pay it but, by crikey, you wished you had when you prang it. Im pleased to hear Senator Liness one wasnt too bad, but, from the experiences that Ive heard about and the conversations I have had with many people in the Family Court, I dont think I have heard of a happy divorce. What I have heard anecdotally is how drawn out the time is that it takes to get to the Family Court. A lot of it is created because, as Senator Lines said, there are resource issues—I get that. Im not at all having a crack at the judges and the fine people who work in the courts, but Im scathing of the lawyers picnic, banquet—whatever you call it. Lets not forget that a lot of the times there are children involved. I can see how it could be a very traumatic experience, even if it only went for a few weeks or a month, but these go on for years—years and years. Im going to say this and I make no apology to the legal fraternity out there: by God, there are some parasites amongst you people. When I was running my trucking business, I wished I could charge what you people charge. You know what I would have given to be able to charge 30 bucks for a photocopy? Do you know what I would have given for the blood, sweat and tears that I lost over the years between Perth and the Northern Territory if I could charge by the minute? My goodness me! Not only that, Ive heard stories from friends of mine who have gone through this. When they have made offers to their partners and, for whatever reason, their partners have said no—this is male and female—they then go to the parasitic legal firm that gives them false hope. I say false hope because it is false hope when they stretch it out. They get in their ear and say, We can go for this, or, We can go for that. They say, Well want more, so lets just get another hearing. By the way, we cant get there for eight months or 12 months. But well get there! Then someone might not turn up and its here we go again for another four or five months—ticktock, ticktock. You can hear the dollars falling out of the poor devils pockets into the pockets of the parasitic legal firms. I experienced a lot of this when I was on the road. I might not see a mate for a month or so until we crossed each others path, and then Id say to them, Hows your divorce going, mate? Theyd say: Oh, crikey. Youre not going to believe this. Its cost me—X amount of dollars. Im not talking 10 grand, 20 grand or 30 grand but massive amounts of money for them to be dragged through the courts and for their partner to be dragged through the courts. A heck of a lot of dollars goes to the legal representatives of both sides, who have been leading these poor devils down the wrong path all this time. Theyre walking away with 100, 120 or 150 grand while many times the settlement has been what the first offer was. Who in the heck thinks its a good idea just to give these people a licence to print money whenever they like? I just had to get that out, because noone in this land will convince me that Im not on the side of the angels here. There is noone in this parliament who will convince me that I may be a bit rough on the lawyers. I dont care who the lawyers are: it goes for the lot of you. Let me come back to the bill and the merger of the two courts. Ive been listening to the contributions that have predominantly come from this side of the chamber—theyre probably all from this side of the chamber at this stage. Where are the government senators on this? It would be lovely to know. This is the problem: when you get lawyers making laws in this building and theyre not lawyers outside, wheres the influence coming from? There are so many questions that havent been answered. The AttorneyGeneral, another lawyer—fancy that!—did not undertake any meaningful consultation in relation to this proposal to effectively abolish the Family Court of Australia. He didnt undertake any consultation, yet theres a bill that will go through tonight. Theyve got the numbers; its going to happen. There was no meaningful consultation with the legal profession or with family specialists. Crikey, youd have to talk to them, wouldnt you? Counsellors didnt get consulted. Child psychologists, Im told, didnt get consulted. Most senators have touched on the pain and the grief that families go through. And then when the kids are used as pawns—I dont even want to go down that path. Its painful enough for the people who have been through that; fortunately, I havent. There was no consultation with users of the family law system, so Australian families didnt get a say in this. Other than the Chief Justice, the government did not even consult with the judges of the Family Court. Senators, I ask you: how are we going to sit here tonight and watch a bill go through which, on the surface, appears to have been a good idea between the AttorneyGeneral and the Chief Justice. The Liberals and Nationals party rooms said: Yes, tick it off. No worries, mate. Shell be right. Lets go for it. Anyway, I know those opposite are distracted because there are other things going on, as there are in this building all the time. Im told that no fewer than 110 stakeholders, ranging from the Law Council of Australia to womens legal services, community legal services, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services—as we heard before from Senator Dodson and Senator McCarthy—child protection advocates and disability services from across Australia, have written to the AttorneyGeneral to ask him to abandon this proposal. Im wellinformed that, sadly, theyve been ignored. That doesnt surprise me, because this AttorneyGeneral, Mr Porter, has form on ignoring people. How do I know? Because I was at his office with a heap of women who were seeking access to JobKeeper, because the government had shut down their industry. All they wanted to do, in a peaceful protest, was to present a document. They knocked on the door and asked to speak to Mr Porter. He wouldnt even meet with them. So Im not surprised. Hes got form. Im still waiting for him to correct me. I know, because I was there. These 110 individuals and organisations oppose this proposal because they believe that it will harm vulnerable children and families in need of specialist family law assistance. How are you going to sleep at night with reading just that one line? Im shaking my head, hoping Im going to wake up and its a bad dream. Its going to increase, rather than decrease cost, time and stress for families and children in the family law system. So, Mr Porter, please explain to me how you think thats a great idea. You cant, because you got together with someone—and were not quite sure who it is—and made up this decision without even consulting anyone. But youll be right, mate. Youll tuck yourself in your safe office, youll get your $400,000 a year and, with a bit of luck, you wont even have to talk to your staff if they put another door in the building for you. These individuals also say that it will place further stresses on the Federal Circuit Court judges who are struggling under unsafe, unsustainable and unconscionable workloads. I touched on that. I couldnt imagine the workload of a judge. I know our workload, but I sympathise with the judges because of their workloads. They also say it will fail to address any of the fundamental problems plaguing the family law system, including the risk of family violence survivors falling through cracks. Surely that would be a red flag for the AttorneyGeneral who doesnt like to talk to people. I would love to hear from the lawyers in the party. I would love to hear that those on the opposite side even just challenged their AttorneyGeneral to find out what the hell is going on, as they quite rightly should. I would love to know why that hasnt happened—if it has happened, sadly, he doesnt even listen to his caucus. The Joint Select Committee on Australias Family Law System received no fewer than—those of us who have been around this place for a while and those who have just arrived, wait for this figure—1,700 submissions. I thought I had read the wrong figure; I thought someone had got an itchy finger and put on another zero. I cant remember how many inquiries Ive been on or how many motions Ive seen go through this place to send bills to committees. Apart from maybe the royal commission, I dont know whether we have ever seen as many submissions go to one inquiry. Gobsmacking! As a senator representing the great state of Western Australia, I would like to take the opportunity to read into the Hansard some of the concerns and reasonings from organisations and individuals in WA who made submissions, so we can look at this debate from their perspective. As weve heard, the ALRC released a landmark report on the family law system in 2019, which, sadly, this government has ignored. The Family Law Practitioners Association of Western Australia, the principal representative body of Western Australian lawyers practising in the area of family law, in their submission to the inquiry on Australias family law system said they were: … concerned this inquiry is being conducted in circumstances where the Government is yet to address the recommendations of the recent ALRC report, Family Law for the Future – An Inquiry into the System. They also said that they hoped that their submission: … directs the Committees attention to some of the relevant recommendations of the ALRC Report … Community Legal Western Australia, headed by my former colleague and member for Hasluck, Sharryn Jackson, in its submission made a standalone recommendation which relates to exactly what this bill is trying to achieve. Community Legal WA recommended: Any proposal to merge the Family Court and Federal Circuit Court of WA be abandoned, with any discussion of future amendment to structural arrangements based upon the recommendations of the ALRC. Again, this is the very ALRC that was tasked by this government to produce a report to look into the family law system in Australia. The ALRC produced that report, all 583 pages of it with 60 recommendations, and the government has still ignored it. I know it might take Mr Porter a lot longer to read 583 pages—I understand that—but wouldnt you think he would at least have the decency to respond when you ask people to send recommendations or write reports? The very first Chief Justice of the Family Court of Australia, Elizabeth Evatt, AC, has said: The proposed merger of the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court (FCC) will lead to undesirable outcomes for children and families. For any senator or any member of the House of Representatives in this nation, surely that would be the first thing you look at and say, Why? Why would I go to my caucus room and play Geppetto and get them all dancing up and down while Im pulling the strings telling them what a great thing it is, even though Im not answering anyone and Im not going to tell them what Im going to do? Who would think that you could pass a bill, then pull the guillotine on it if youre running out of time, and not think if its going to harm children and families? Who in their right mind will wake up in the morning and think, Geez, I might pass a bill, and with a bit of luck Ill be able to harm some children and a family? If I was the AG, I would be defending my stance on this. I would be busting down every door to get into every place I could to say, Youre wrong, and these are the reasons youre wrong. But, typical of Mr Porter, hes the phantom—puff! And he disappears in a puff of dust: God almighty, there are people at my door. Im sorry, Ive just run out of time. Were rejecting the bill.  I too would like to make a contribution on the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019. Knowing absolutely zero about this bill and realising that I had to make a contribution on it, Ive read as much information as I could get my hands on and listened to as many contributions as possible today. As always, when I dont really know whats going on, I go to the ever reliable people at the Parliamentary Library and ask for a Bills Digest. And, as always, they come good. In The Bills Digest at a glance—I think theres a little bit of irony there, because, at a glance, the Bills Digest is 37 pages long, so you need more than a passing glance to get across the issues that are canvassed in the Parliamentary Librarys Bills Digest. Basically, Im instructed: The Bills were first introduced in 2018 and lapsed at the end of the 45th Parliament on 1 July 2019. The 2019 FCFC Bill includes the following changes from the 2018 version: • Rather than both Divisions sharing the same original jurisdiction, there will be a single point of entry to the Court, with all matters initially filed in the FCFC (Division 2) and the ability to transfer cases between Divisions • The FCFC (Division 1), rather than the Federal Court of Australia, will be responsible for hearing family law and child support appeals • The criteria for judicial appointments has been amended to require FCFC (Division 2) Judges to have the appropriate knowledge, skills, experience and aptitude to deal with the kinds of matters that might be expected to come before them, including family violence in the case of family law matters. An express reference to family violence has also been added to the criteria for appointment of FCFC (Division 1) Judges and • Regulations may (but are not required to) prescribe a minimum number of FCFC (Division 1) Judges—the Government has stated this number is intended to be 25. So, thats the short history of the bill, and there has been a Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee inquiry, reported on 20 November 2020. Thats a legislation committee, so a government controlled committee. And: The committee recommended the Bill be passed. Australian Labor Party (Labor) Senators and the Australian Greens (Greens) issued separate dissenting reports… I think this is something that Senator Sterle has touched on, that might be just set aside as political opponents not agreeing, but the stakeholder comments referred to in the Bills Digest are quite instructive as well: The majority of submitters to the Senate Inquiry argued that greater resourcing, rather than structural change, was required to address the issues facing the family law system. They called on the government to respond to the recommendation of the Australian Law Reform Commission when it produced Family law for the future. So it was argybargy, and the government went ahead with its recommendation that the bill be passed. The Australian Greens and the Labor Party went the other way. But its instructive that the majority of submissions were against the bill. We really do get to a system here, and I think its quite instructive to skip to the Productivity Commissions evidence in this matter. The Productivity Commissions Report on government services2020 has highlighted an increase in the backlog of cases in the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court—that is, cases in the courts for over 12 months. It has identified a 34 per cent increase in the Family Courts backlog between 201213 and 201819, and a 63 per cent increase across the Federal Circuit Court. In respect of the funding and judicial appointments across the same period, the NSW Bar Association provides the following summary: … there had been an increase of just 2.73 percent, or $6.724 million, in the operating appropriation provided to the Federal Court, Federal Circuit Court and the Family Court together from 201314 to 201718. Real recurrent expenditure in the Family Court has almost halved, from $101,940,000 in 201213 to $57,689,000 in 201819. Real recurrent expenditure in the Federal Circuit Court increased from $113,486,000 in 201213 to $154,942,000 in 201819. … From 30 June 2013 to 19 January 2018, only two additional judicial officers were added to each of the Federal Circuit Court and the Family Court of Australia, bringing the total to 66 FCC Judges and 33 Family Court Judges, representing a total increase of 4.2 percent. I think that paints a picture of a steady and increasing workload, steady and decreasing financial support and there being not enough judges. This is instructive. In the 202021 budget, the Commonwealth made multiple funding commitments for the federal family law courts, including $35.7 million over four years in additional resources and judges for the Federal Circuit Court to assist with the timely resolution of family law and migration matters and $2.5 million over two years from 202021 for federal family law courts to maintain specialised court lists for urgent matters arising from COVID19. And on 13 November 2020, the AttorneyGeneral, the Hon. Christian Porter, announced two new judicial appointments—current Federal Circuit Court Judge Thomas Altobelli to the Family Court and Kylie Beckhouse to the Federal Circuit Court. Theres been a long period of lower funding and a long period of increased workload and outcomes that are not very good. Somehow or other—and I do respect the work of the Parliamentary Library—this is a very, very, very complex issue. There was a KPMG review in 2014, which stated: … it is recognised that the FCA, FCoA and FCC operate in a broader (constrained) fiscal environment which necessarily impacts on timely, efficient, equitable access to justice and facilitation of judicial decisionmaking. Equally, reported increases in case complexity and changes to the client profile mean that the courts are operating in a new landscape which presents challenges to the timely, equitable and efficient administration of justice. Presumably, in 2014, a Liberal coalition government initiated the KPMG report. At the time the KPMG review of all three courts projected budget deficits for the financial year 201415, and it was recognised that there were entrenched structural funding issues. Amongst other things, the KPMG review concluded: The current funding model for the Courts is not sustainable. The question of sustainability cannot simply be addressed through the injection of additional funds or oneoff cuts, rather it requires more fundamental amendments to the model. To achieve the current budget across the forward estimates for all three Courts would require significant cuts to service and staffing levels. Such cuts to administrative services are unlikely to form a sustainable basis or driver for longterm efficiencies. There are 37 pages of information from the Parliamentary Library, which state in relation to the PwC report: In 2018, the AttorneyGenerals Department commissioned PwC to review the operations of the courts in relation to family law matters. The PwC report measured the performance of the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court in the following ways: by backlog: between 201213 and 201617, pending cases older than 12 months grew by 38 per cent in the Federal Circuit Court, compared to five per cent in the Family Court. Around 29 per cent of all Federal Circuit Court pending final order cases were older than 12 months, compared to 42 per cent in the Family Court by time to trial: between 201213 and 201617, the national median time to trial grew from 11.5 months to 17 months in the Family Court, while in the Federal Circuit Court the median time to trial grew from 10.8 months to 15.2 months by the cost of finalisation: in the Family Court it cost near to $17,000 per finalised matter. In the Federal Circuit Court, the cost was approximately $5,500 by the amount of final orders: on a judicial fulltime equivalent basis, approximately 114 final orders were finalised per Family Court judge per annum. In the Federal Circuit Court, approximately 338 final orders were finalised per judge per annum and by the cost to litigants: the party/party costs to be paid by litigants were estimated to be in the order of $110,000 per matter in the Family Court (including court fees, but excluding appeals), while in the Federal Circuit Court this was closer to $30,000. I said at the start that Im not really across this issue per se, but the various submissions I have seen and the Parliamentary Librarys Bills Digest tell me theres a huge problem here. When you look at the Senate reports, the joint committee reports and the position of respective organisations outside of the party—and Senator Sterle commented that there were 1,700 submissions—the majority of which dont appear to be in support of the governments position, you have a huge problem which is being fixed by government in a way that wont please anybody. If it doesnt please the legal fraternity, you may be able to say that they have a vested interest. But if it doesnt reduce the time taken to get matters delivered and if it doesnt reduce the amount of money litigants have to pay then how is it going to be more efficient? I think thats a question Minister Porter hasnt quite answered in this debate. I didnt hear any comments of note from the other side of the chamber. The Labor Party are opposed to this. I understand Senator Hanson has a different view. I understand the Australian Greens are going to oppose it. The crossbenchers will do what the crossbenchers do—theyll either support, oppose or transact on it. Thats the way the parliamentary system works. I really do think that, if people are in the unfortunate situation of not being able to deal with family separation or family court matters in an amenable way and it does result in appearances at court and the use of lawyers and judges, then that should be an open, fair and transparent process. I cant imagine a family with three children going through 18 months of litigation about who has access to who, but that sort of stuff is happening. I think we are a better nation than that. People should have access to a jurisdiction that is eminently fair, reasonably inexpensive and adequately resourced so that the impacts that may be felt by children in these awful situations is minimalised. To sum up, from our position this is a very, very complex area. Its, if you like, a Labor Party legacy from Gough Whitlams day. Weve heard about people having their divorce published in the paper and the reasons why. Noone wants those days back, but we do want an open, transparent and fair system which allows access to justice, and it shouldnt cost you an arm and a leg; it shouldnt cost you half the family home. People should be guided into solutions. It isnt all that complex, and most people, when they sit down, could work it out themselves, but thats not the system we have and this wont make it any better.  I thank members for their contributions to this important debate. The Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019 bring together the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court of Australia, to be known as the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia, or the FCFC. The consequential amendments bill will facilitate the transition to the new FCFC. The FCFC will bring together the Family Court of Australia as Division 1 and the Federal Circuit Court as Division 2. The FCFC will continue to comprise the existing judges of the Family Court, in Division 1, and the existing judges of the Federal Circuit Court, in Division 2. The FCFC will provide a consistent pathway for Australian families and have common, streamlined processes and procedures to operate consistently. It will be simpler, more efficient, more effective and a more accessible court for Australian families to resolve their matters, meaning that we increase the number of matters that can be finalised each year. These proposed reforms have been developed in close consultation with the federal courts, including the heads of jurisdiction, and informed by a number of substantial inquiries over the last decade, including the 2008 Semple review, a 2014 KPMG review, a 2015 EY report, the 2017 House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs inquiry and a 2018 PwC report. Under this legislation there will be a single point of entry for all Australian family law matters, with all matters to be filed in Division 2. This will be of significant benefit to Australian families because it will simplify the process and save time and effort for those navigating the system. This is a reform that has been long called for, but to date it has not been able to be achieved or delivered. The bills will facilitate common and harmonised rules of court which will simplify forms and the case management process for the ultimate benefit of the Australian families who use the system. While there has been longterm agreement that there should be common rules and practice, this has never occurred under the current, existing, legislative arrangements. As part of the legislation, the Chief Justice will be invested with the power to make the rules of court for a limited period, after which the power will revert to judges, or a majority of judges, of each respective division. While the bills originally prescribed that the Chief Justice would have this power for two years, the government has agreed to reduce this period to 18 months. The bills retain the appellate jurisdiction in the FCFC Division 1, but all Division 1 judges will be able to hear appeals, both as individual judges and as members of a full court. Further, the bills will enable the court to deal with appeals more efficiently, as appeals from decisions of the FCFC Division 2 will ordinarily be dealt with by a single judge from Division 1. The Chief Justice will have the ability to convene a full court to hear an appeal from Division 2, where appropriate. This will provide flexibility for a full court to hear appeals involving novel or complex questions of law. Both of these changes reflect the approach taken in the appellate jurisdiction of the Federal Court, which successfully exercises a substantial and diverse appellate jurisdiction. I cant tell you, Madam Acting Deputy President, how unfortunate it is that so much of the debate on these bills mischaracterises them and the current system as a whole. Most notably, despite what has been said, the bills we are dealing with—and I make a point of this—do not abolish the Family Court. Judges appointed to the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court will continue in their existing appointments, and the government had committed to a minimum of 25 Division 1 judges, in line with the recommendation of the Semple review. The government will also now entrench that minimum number of Division 1 judges in the legislation itself, so there can be no doubt. It is also necessary to respond to claims that these bills will result in a loss of specialisation. That claim is false. The reality of our existing family law system is that the Federal Circuit Court deals with close to 90 per cent of family law parenting matters. There are around 40 judges of the Federal Circuit Court who hear only family law matters. It doesnt get any more specialised than that, and the average FCC judge hearing family law matters has, on average, 25 years of experience in family law. These judges have experience with matters involving families with complex needs, and the unfortunate reality is that they also have experience dealing with matters involving family violence. There have also been suggestions that the Family Court provides some greater level of service to families than one can get in the Federal Circuit Court. However, the CEO of the Federal Circuit Court and Family Court told the recent Senate committee inquiry: … for the avoidance of doubt, the courts internal family law services are shared between the courts. This includes registrar resources, family counsellors and registry staff. There is no difference in the level of service provided between the two at present. There have also been claims made by those opposite that the government has failed to provide funding for the federal family law courts and the family law system. That simply ignores the significant investments this government has made. Since 2015, the government has committed $84.8 million for specialist domestic violence units and health justice partnerships, whereby lawyers and social workers provide legal representation, advice and support to those experiencing family violence. The government has provided $48.9 million to establish family advocacy and support services which operate in family law registries to deliver duty lawyer and support services for people affected by family violence in their family law matters. We have banned the direct crossexamination of parties in family law matters involving allegations of family violence, and we have allocated over $20 million in funding for legal representation to those affected by the ban. Weve allocated more than $56 million to help families resolve family law property matters, including funding for Family Relationship Centres to deliver mediation, for a twoyear trial by legal aid commissions of lawyer assisted mediation for property matters and for the federal Family Court to conduct a twoyear trial of simpler and faster court processes for resolving family law property cases. Since early 2020, the government has colocated police and child protection officials in family law registries to improve information sharing between state and territory agencies, implemented with a $10.4 million investment. Weve allocated $13.5 million for the Lighthouse Project, which has commenced in the Brisbane, Parramatta and Adelaide family law registries to pilot a systematic approach to identifying and managing family safety. Weve implemented a new National Legal Assistance Partnership worth more than $2 billion, with $248 million of that being additional funding. The largest recipients of this funding are legal aid commissions, and 93 per cent of the representation services they provide are for family law matters. As part of the most recent budget, over $140 million in funding has been provided by this government to expedite family law matters and increase resourcing in the Federal Circuit Court. That includes funding for family law services; for the continuation of the current COVID19 lists being operated by the courts; for improved and safer facilities for the Federal Circuit Court in Rockhampton and Launceston; and for additional Federal Circuit Court judges and registrars, including an extra family law judge and five new family law judicial registrars. The government has also previously committed to the appointment of an additional Division 1 judge, subject to the passage of these bills. The government has always held the view that resourcing applied to what, up to this point, has been a wellrecognised failed structure in these courts would ultimately represent a situation where these valuable resources wont have their maximum impact for the taxpayer or for users of the court. As part of the implementation of these bills, the government will also provide a further Division 1 judge, two additional Division 2 judges and an extra judicial registrar to support the Adelaide registry; and an additional $14.3 million for further legal assistance in South Australia, to be used to establish a pilot program for family law matters. In addition, the government will reestablish the Family Law Council to provide further ongoing guidance on the family law system. The government recognises the advocacy and support of Senator Patrick for those initiatives. The structural failings of the current split family law system are widely agreed, and continuing to do nothing to fix this problem is not an option. Reform of any longstanding structural problem is challenging. The proposed reforms are the least radical path to end the unnecessary confusion, costs and delays for thousands of Australian families that have arisen by virtue of this split system. The government is confident that these bills will deliver a significant improvement to the lives of the Australian families that are required to navigate the federal family law courts. I commend the bills to the Senate. The PRESIDENT: The question is that the second reading amendment moved by Senator Watt be agreed to.  On behalf of Senator Polley, I move: Omit all words after that, insert: further consideration of the bills be deferred until the Joint Select Committee on Australias Family Law System has presented its final report. The PRESIDENT: The question is the second reading amendment moved by Senator Watt on behalf of Senator Polley be agreed to.  On behalf of Senator Pratt, I move: At the end of the motion, add: , but the Senate is of the opinion that: (a) the Government proposal to merge the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court is deeply flawed and will do nothing to alleviate any of the fundamental problems plaguing the family law system – a system the Government has neglected for the last seven years; and (b) further consideration of the bill should be deferred until the government responds to the Australian Law Reform Commissions report Family law for the future – An inquiry into the family law system, which made 60 recommendations for reform. The PRESIDENT: The question is that the opposition amendment moved by Senator Watt on behalf of Senator Pratt be agreed to.  The question now is that the bill be read a second time.  I table supplementary explanatory memoranda relating to the government amendments to be moved to these bills.

(2) Amendment (1), subclause (4), omit 25 Judges, substitute 32 Judges. Amendment (1) on the governments sheet of amendments, if enacted, would ensure that there would have to be at least 25 judges in Division 1 of the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia. These amendments would marginally improve a terrible piece of legislation. Lets not forget that, when the AttorneyGeneral first put forward a bill to merge the Federal Circuit Court and Family Court of Australia in the 45th Parliament, he explicitly stated that he intended not to appoint new judges to Division 1 as they retired. That would have amounted to a gradual abolition of Division 1 over time. Lets remember that Division 1 is what the existing Family Court will become if the governments legislation passes the Senate. The AttorneyGeneral was forced to back away from that position in the 46th Parliament. Under its current iteration, the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 would allow the AttorneyGeneral to make a regulation to prescribe a minimum number of judges for Division 1, but nothing in the bill would require the AttorneyGeneral to make any such regulation. The fact that the AttorneyGeneral has stated publicly that he would prescribe a minimum of 25 judges is meaningless. The Morrison government commits itself to doing things all the time, and it almost never follows through. Amendment (1) on the governments sheet of amendments will ensure that the AttorneyGeneral cannot crab walk away from his commitment to prescribe a minimum number of 25 judges for Division 1. But it would still allow the Morrison government to reduce the number of judges, in what will become Division 1, from 32 to 25. And I note that there is also a vacancy that has been created recently. We do not think that that is acceptable. That is why I have moved amendments to this amendment to prescribe a minimum number of 32 judges in Division 1 so that the number of judges in that division cannot drop below 32. But, even if our amendments to this amendment succeed, none of the changes to the bill that we are debating will address any of the fundamental problems with the legislation. The governments bill will still rob the Family Court of Australia of its essential distinguishing feature, which is that it is a court that deals only with family law matters. The governments bill will still do nothing to address any of the problems in the family law system, a system that the Liberals and Nationals have neglected for over seven years. The governments bill will still make an already bad situation even worse for Australian families. The governments bill will still, in the words of the Law Council, represent a terrible gamble with the lives of children and families. But, in the event that this bill does pass the Senate, it is better that it passes with these amendments than without them.","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[2]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator WATT (Queensland) ","(19:22):"

Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 Statement pursuant to the order of the Senate of 26 June 2000 Amendments (1) and (2) Amendments (1) and (2) are framed as requests because they amend the government amendments to the bill to require that the minimum number of judges to hold office in the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 1) is 40 rather than 25. As this will have the effect of increasing the number of judges to be remunerated, it will increase the expenditure under the appropriation proposed by clause 18 of theFederal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019. Statement by the Clerk of the Senate pursuant to the order of the Senate of 26 June 2000 Amendments (1) and (2) If the effect of the amendments is to increase expenditure under the appropriation proposed by clause 18 of theFederal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, then it is in accordance with the precedents of the Senate that the amendments be moved as requests. Im happy to rise to seek the support of my fellow senators for my amendments, particularly Senator Patrick, as he seems pretty keen to support this shoddy legislation on the condition that there is a minimum number of judges in the legislation. I want to be clear: I completely oppose the merging of these courts because, as the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services have made clear, this merger will not fix the root causes of the problems of the family law court. As at 17 February there are 32 judges currently listed on the Family Courts website, who would become Division 1 judges, not including the Family Court of Western Australia judges. The governments amendment requiring 25 judges doesnt make any sense. Its going backwards from the current number of 32 judges. It does not make any sense to go backwards at this time, particularly to a figure of 25 in view of the crippling backlogs and workloads facing the courts. The Chief Justice made a statement in November 2019 that at least one extra judge is required in every major registry to make a massive difference to the backlog. That would make it at least 40 judges. The Chief Justice said, an extra judge in every major registry would make a massive difference to backlogs—quoted in Tony Keim, A family (court) affair.","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[2]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[9]","N/A","N/A"

I was involved in the committee that actually looked into the merger of the two courts. After hearing evidence that was given, and especially being involved as deputy chair in the Family Court matter presently on foot and the advice that we actually heard, yes, there is a backlog in the court system, and, yes, the judges are terribly overworked. Why Ive come to the conclusion that Im not going to support this is that its not really more judges that we need; its more registrars and their support staff that we need. It has been shown that by putting registrars and senior registrars into the positions they can actually triage, hear the mentions and even the contraventions of orders and do a lot of the work of the judges. They can actually even hear determinations. That has been supported by judges and the Chief Justice and the Deputy Chief Justice.  Id like to point out to Senator Thorpe that by appointing judges into the Federal Courts their appointment is until theyre 70 years of age. They cant be sacked, unless theyre sacked by both houses of parliament. That is rarely ever done. When you have registrars appointed, they can be utilised when needed in the court system, and we can bring in more or less. They are doing the work and helping the judges. A Federal Court judge in the Family Court Division 1 is basically costing the taxpayers approximately $500,000 a year. That is a huge cost to taxpayers. We found that a lot of these judges are stressed and a lot of them are overworked and that, hence, a lot actually take a lot of time away from their work because of this and theyre still being paid, yet the work is not being completed—work which could be carried on by registrars. People do need to get their cases heard, but I truly do believe that instead of putting more money into judges—because in the Family Court their average of 27 judges heard approximately 500 cases a year, yet the Federal Circuit Court judges heard about 500 to 600 cases a year each—we need to look clearly at how were going to do it. I do support the AttorneyGenerals move to a minimum number of 25 judges and the appointment of more registrars. There has been a lot of streamlining that has been happening in the court system to actually address peoples needs, and their submissions are being taken up under the Lighthouse Project, which is working extremely well. I think the AttorneyGeneral is doing an excellent job addressing the needs of the courts. I must say that the Labor Party complains that the Liberal Party has done nothing in the last seven years. Well then, Id ask the same question of the Labor Party: what have they done in their time when they were in parliament here? Absolutely nothing, because the increases happened. So its alright to point the finger and have your say now on what the Liberal Party has done, but the Labor Party have in fact done absolutely nothing themselves. This is a way forward. I have been involved in this for many years and have raised the issues continually in this house. I have reviewed it, possibly more than any other member in this place, so I feel that I am very much across this and I am supporting the governments bill. I will not support the Greens amendment to this.","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[2]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator HANSON (Queensland—Leader of Pauline Hansons One Nation) ","(19:35):"
"0","0","0","1","1","OfficeContinuation","112096","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I have a couple of questions for the Assistant Minister to the AttorneyGeneral in respect of these amendments. The Greens say they wont support these laws. If these laws are not passed tonight, whats the minimum number of justices under the current legislation?   Senator Patrick, there is no minimum under the current legislation.  So the governments amendment has significantly raised the bar. I want to get an understanding. Thats not the number that the Attorney is setting; thats a safeguard, as far as I understand it. Is that correct? You announced tonight the appointment of an additional justice. I want to make sure that thats a safeguard rather than a target number.  Thats correct, Senator Patrick. The number that has been specified in the amendment is a minimum floor. Its not to suggest that is going to be a fixed number at any time and it does represent an increase from zero under the current arrangements.  Senator Stoker, you participated in the Senate inquiry with me. You are obviously performing a different role here this evening. Im wondering whether you recall the Senate being advised that there were five judicial vacancies at the moment, and thats not including the four additional positions that were announced in the budget. Can you seek some advice from the officers as to why those vacancies havent been filled? In so doing, perhaps you could also advise the chamber why, when the AttorneyGeneral is given significant notice of impending retirements, it has taken so long to fill the vacancies.  Senator Carr, I can answer that question. It is true that those vacancies exist, so your data is right on that front. They are not yet filled because a process is underway, which you would expect, Senator Carr, would be done with care and due consideration. These are important appointments. Its important we get them right. It is the case that the work is being done at the moment to fill those ones as soon as that process is complete.  I appreciate that the AttorneyGeneral would be anxious to make sure he got the right appointments, but one could also be concerned that, if it takes a long time to fill vacancies—and we started from the premise that he didnt want to fill the vacancies at all—it does imply there is a lack of real motivation to fill vacancies. Obviously the circumstances suggest that the AttorneyGeneral has had a long time to fill the vacancies. I ask you specifically: Does the AttorneyGeneral intend to fill the vacancies? When will that occur? Its no good saying to me, I just have to make sure I get the right person. It takes a bit more than that. Given the lack of certainty there has been about this AttorneyGenerals interest in maintaining the administrative efficiency of this court, how is it that it has taken so long to fill the vacancies that occurred?  Senator Carr, Ill clarify something I just said. You gave the total number of vacancies. That number is correct, although it should be clarified that most of those are in the Federal Circuit Court and only one is in the Family Court, as they currently stand. There is an intention to fill the vacancies. That process is underway. I have otherwise answered the question.  How many people have actually put up their hands to do that job, and when did they do that? How many weeks ago did they do that? Could you please give me a number on how many have actually put up their hands to do that job?  I dont have that information and its not something that is ordinarily aired prior to appointments.  Weve got positions out there that need to be filled and weve got a backlog, but you cant tell me—and its not inconfidence—how many people have put their hands up to fill that job so I can determine whos being lazy and why the job isnt being done. How many people have put their hand up to do that job and how long ago? Come on. If youve got nothing to hide, just give the numbers. This is getting ridiculous. This is an embarrassment for the Liberal Party.  Senator Lambie, its a process thats cabinetinconfidence. Its being done the same way that it always has been done. It is being carefully considered and those appointments will be made in due course.  Could you please tell me exactly what the process is? What is the average time for that process and, usually, how many put their hand up?  Its a process thats managed in consultation with the heads of jurisdictions, the chief justices and often in consultation with members of the representative bodies of the professions. It is a process that varies in the length of time that it takes depending on the complexity of those consultations. It doesnt have the usual recruitment time frame that you might have for hiring an office clerk or something of that nature, but it is the method that has always been used. Its a cabinetinconfidence process and it is underway.  Let me get this right. We have a problem in our courts but you cant tell me a time frame for the AttorneyGeneral to pick a mate to put in the job. Thats exactly how the process works. We all know how it works, so please didnt give me the runaround. The Australian people would like to know what the time frame is going to be for the Liberal Party or the AttorneyGeneral to get these jobs filled. I think its a fair question. I think its a serious question. The people of Australia would like to know, especially those people—not like you, who have probably never been through the Family Court system—who have got kids who are feeling that pain. For goodness sake, just answer the question please!  Senator Lambie, I dont accept the premise of your question, which was rather pejorative. As a process it will take as long as it takes to get it right. It is underway and I rely on my earlier answers.  Minister, Justice Forrest, in Brisbane, resigned a fortnight ago. This is a busy registry and His Honour should be replaced as soon as possible. In addition, there are 10 judges across the Family Court and Federal Court due to retire in 2021 and 2022. These judges should be promptly replaced with new appointments to avoid exacerbating existing delays. Further, judges may also be required to work through COVID19 backlogs in view of the courts reliance on audiovisual link hearings since March 2020. Could you please explain what the process is to ensure that they are all backfilled in a timely manner?  Justice Forrests announcement of His Honours intention to retire came prior to the prescribed age of 70. When there is a retirement that is out of the ordinary expectation—and I guess it is a little earlier than expected—theres sometimes a little more time required for that to be filled. That process is underway. I dont expect its far. We are taking every step we can to make sure that those appointments are as timely as possible, because, like you, we appreciate that they are important to getting through the critical work of the court.  I thought it was probably important that Labor outline our position in relation to the Greens amendments. Labor supports these amendments on the basis that this parliament should always be calling on the government to increase resources to a family law system that this government has starved of resources. Of course, the way in which additional resources can be allocated most efficiently is a fundamentally important question. Labor does not support this bill. We do not support the new court structure the government has put forward, so Labor has not considered whether increasing to 40 the number of judges in Division 1 would, if this were to pass the parliament, be the best way of allocating additional resources. This does not represent Labor policy. Our commitments that we take to the Australian people will be considered in the usual way and will be made public before the next election. However, we support this amendment because, at the very least, that is a matter that this government should be required to consider. While Im on my feet I might just pose a question to the minister. The government claims that these bills will increase court efficiency. How many judicial vacancies are there currently on the Federal Circuit Court?","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[2]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p","Senator PATRICK (South Australia) ","(19:39):"
"0","0","0","1","1","OfficeContinuation","112096","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I understand there are four.   The government announced four new judicial positions on the Federal Circuit Court in the last budget. Why havent those four vacancies been filled?  My understanding is that those four positions were provided for in an instrument that was a combined measure that is subject to a disallowance motion.  So a disallowance motion has been lodged which would in some way interfere with the delivery of the governments budget commitment. Is that what youre saying?  My instructions are that the revenue that would come from the matters dealt with in the combined measure that is the subject of the disallowance motion is whats necessary to fund the four judges.  So let me be clear on this. The government announced an additional four positions nearly a year ago. It hasnt filled them. Thats the case? I want to be clear so that I understand. You announced them a year ago in the budget and havent filled them, and were about to go into the next years budget. When you say there are four vacancies, does that include the four that were announced in the budget last year, or is the real number in fact eight?  Just to clarify, Senator Carr, it is the four new ones that are the subject of the instrument that is the subject of the disallowance motion. The older four are vacant; the ones that are from other retirements are the ones that are vacant.  So its arguable that there are in fact eight vacancies, if there are four that were announced last year plus the four from vacancies because of retirements. If we were to take the government at its word, announced in the budget last year, there are going to be four additional spots. They havent been filled, so surely it is arguable that there are eight vacancies.  Thats right. The only caveat on that is to say that we cant fill the four new ones until we have certainty on the ability to fund them.  I find it an extraordinary proposition that a government with a budget the size of the Commonwealth of Australias cant fill four judges vacancies. I say that in the context of evidence presented to the Senate inquiry into this bill—which surely, Senator Stoker, you were surprised by—that pointed out that judges of the Federal Circuit Court were dealing with an average of some 330 matters each and pointed out the size of the average document. Youd understand these terms far better than I would. Im not one of these legal eagles, but I do find the fact that youd ask an average judge to have 330 cases each—one judge had 600 cases, eight judges had more than 500 cases each, 26 judges had more than 400 cases each and 41 judges had more than 300 matters each. As I say, Im not claiming to be a lawyer, but it strikes me as an extraordinary amount of work for individual judges. There is surely a very strong case to say that this court is overburdened and that one of the consequences of that for families who are having to face the misery of going before the Federal Circuit Court is that they are having to wait years to have their matters heard. Can you confirm those figures that Ive given you? Is it the case? Secondly, why is the AttorneyGeneral so unwilling to fill these vacancies—which, on my argument, are eight vacancies at the moment—given the extraordinary workload that exists for the judges that are currently sitting? Finally, would this not lead to a situation where well get even more resignations, because of the workload pressures on the court itself?","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[2]/speech[26]/talk.text/body/p","Senator STOKER (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the AttorneyGeneral) ","(19:50):"
"0","0","0","1","1","OfficeContinuation","112096","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," Thank you, Senator Carr. There are a few things in that question. The first thing to say is that, broadly speaking, your estimates of which judges have how much on their dockets—in the answer to your question on notice that was provided to you a little while ago—is right. I dont accept the premise of your question that says there is no intention to fill these vacancies. There is a process underway for the four retirement based vacancies to be filled, and they are in the process of being selected and appointed through the ordinary cabinetinconfidence method.  The next matter to deal with is what is driving those retirements. Theres no evidence to suggest that those who have retired have done so because they were unhappy with the workload that they had, and Im the first person to recognise that the judges of the Federal Circuit Court are extremely hardworking. They will be assisted in that workload when they have more colleagues with which to share that load. Thats why we are in the process of filling those vacancies. It is worth noting, though, that the Federal Circuit Court at present operates a docket system, and that means, as you know, Senator Carr, each case is allocated to a particular judge who manages it from its commencement through to disposition. So, while one might have several hundred matters on their docket, it doesnt mean they all have to go to trial and all require a judgement. Many of those either settle or are dealt with in an ex tempore or immediate moral reasoning or judgement. Its only the case that a mere 15.5 per cent are ultimately judicially determined, in the sense that they get a final ruling. Of those, many are dealt with in the much faster ex tempore immediate moral reasoning method, rather than having to reserve a judgement and do the work thats associated with preparing a written judgement. The point is that there is great variation in the amount of burden that each of those cases presents. Some are quite small; some are much larger.

It was detailed in the summary statement made by the minister.   Minister, could you clarify with the people in this chamber: do Federal Circuit Court judges only handle—we are talking about 330 to 500 or 600 dockets—purely family law court matters?  Senator Hanson, it is true to say that the jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit Court involves a family law jurisdiction, a general federal law jurisdiction and a smaller employment and workplace—Fair Work type—jurisdiction. The vast majority of the work of the court is in family law and there are around 40 judges, the overwhelming number of judges in the court, who deal exclusively with family law.  You were saying before that each case has one judge from commencement to end. Is that normal practice? Is that normal practice, just one judge, is it? Does it ever change over to another judge?  Senator Lambie, it is a docket system, rather than a strict rule that says you can only have one judge. It means that ordinarily, as a matter of the management of the court, there is a practice of having one judge that looks after a single matter throughout, but its not exclusive and sometimes there are exceptions to the rule; it is just a general practice.  So this management, how chaotic would a court be if one person had six judges before it even got to a courtroom? How could you possibly explain whats going on in a court system?  Senator Lambie, I cant speculate on a hypothetical case or talk about this in the abstract but, if you want to refer a particular case to me, Im happy to deal with that offline for you.","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[2]/speech[40]/talk.text/body/p","Senator PATRICK (South Australia) ","(20:00):"

I cant deal with individual cases in the context of debating these bills, but were talking about family law in this context. If youve got a Fair Work type matter, we will deal with it offline.  Minister, Im interested in if you are able to clarify something for me. You said that the deal between the AttorneyGeneral and Senator Patrick was outlined in your summingup statement. Im wondering if you could be a little bit more specific for us. I thought I heard what you were saying there but I dont recall any detail being expressed on the issue of resourcing. So if I could ask you again: what is the commitment of the government in terms of extra resourcing for the family law system as a result of the arrangements you have entered into with Senator Patrick?  Senator Carr, Im more than happy to reread my summingup speech but I dont really think thats necessary. I rely on it in full, where I have itemised absolutely everything by way of the resourcing that is relevant to these bills.  It is a very straightforward question: what are the additional resources that the minister has committed to provide as a result of the arrangements entered into with Senator Patrick, and which state will those resources be directed to?  Senator Carr, as promised, Im very happy to read the bits that you may have missed from my summingup speech earlier. Ill quote from it: As part of the implementation of these bills, the government will also provide a further Division 1 judge, two additional Division 2 judges and an extra judicial registrar to support the Adelaide registry; and an additional $14.3 million for further legal assistance in South Australia, to be used to establish a pilot program for family law matters. In addition, the government will reestablish the Family Law Council to provide further ongoing guidance on the family law system. The government recognises the advocacy and support of Senator Patrick for those initiatives.","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[2]/speech[47]/talk.text/body/p","Senator LAMBIE (Tasmania) ","(20:02):"

Last week the Law Society of Tasmania president told The Advocate that, following the retirement of the Hobart based judge last year, the Morrison governments failure to appoint a new judge to hear family law cases in Tasmania is leading to unacceptable delays and angst for Tasmanian families. The President of the Law Society of Tasmania, Trevor McKenna, told the newspaper that he had raised the matter directly with the AttorneyGeneral before the judge retired, and yet no replacement has been appointed. Let me quote directly:  The lack of a replacement judge means the state is left with one hard working specialist judge doing the work of two judges tackling difficult issues including family violence, child abuse and mental health. The delays in hearing cases exacerbate the emotions flowing from people separating. It is a concern not only to the legal profession but to the many Tasmanian families coming before the court that there has been no announcement. … … … There is a single judge working tirelessly to assist families in resolving their complex disputes. It is unreasonable and unacceptable to expect a single judge should have undertake the work of two judges. So given that there are additional resources being found for Adelaide, why is the Morrison government forcing Tasmanian families to wait months and months for a replacement judge? Why is it that this level of discrimination occurs so that you can buy a vote in this chamber?","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[2]/speech[53]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator KIM CARR (Victoria) ","(20:05):"

Can I just have a time line? I think thats a fair ask. Thats my first question. My second question relates to the AttorneyGeneral.

"0","0","0","1","1","Patrick, Sen Rex","144292","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," Senator Watt is free to estimate all he likes. The matters will be set out in the ordinary way in the budget process.   I thank Senator Watt; Im sure hell have another opportunity. Im going to say, back of the envelope, probably north of $20 million when you consider that were talking about four years. But I actually want to go back to what I thought was a pretty extraordinary admission, if I heard you correctly, Minister, in an earlier contribution that you made. Ill phrase it as a question to you in case I have misheard you or misunderstood you. Have you informed the Senate that for the revenue of the four new judges, as I think you categorised them, you are relying on the massive hike in filing fees for migration matters in the Federal Circuit Court, which is currently the subject of a disallowance moved by Senator Griff? Did you just inform this chamber that, in order to put on the four new judges, you are relying on hitting people who wish to file migration matters? These people are overwhelmingly refugees, people seeking asylum in this country or temporary visa holders who want to file migration matters in this country. Youve spent billions of dollars a year torturing refugees in offshore detention centres on Manus Island and Nauru, you spend hundreds of millions of dollars every year on our punitive onshore immigration detention system and yet you want to hit up the same cohort of people with increased filing fees in the range of 450 to 500 per cent increases, which you are trying to introduce. Youre saying that you need that revenue in order to pay the wages of four new judges. Is that what you just told the Senate? I will leave it there. If Im accurate and Ive understood you correctly, I will have a response. But is that right? Are you saying that you need that massive increase of nearly 500 per cent in filing fees for migration matters in the Federal Circuit Court, that you need that revenue in order to pay the wages of four new judges? Is that what you just told the Senate?  Senator McKim, Im glad you have raised that because it gives me an opportunity to provide clarity. The arrangements for the four additional judges to whom I referred in the context of the disallowance motion are for the new judges that have been allocated for the Federal Circuit Court. But the work that they do is related to migration, so, strictly speaking, their workload wont be in the family space that is addressed in this bill, though it should be said that the vacancies of attrition have a relevance to these family matters. But it is true to say that it is absolutely relevant to the funding of those additional migration Federal Circuit Court judges that there is a fiscal responsibility in the way that we operate that court, and that means that the fees associated with, for instance, filings for migration cases will be applied to cover costs associated with dealing with migration cases, such as the costs associated with those judges.  It is the great Liberal dream, isnt it—a userpays justice system? Dont worry yourself one iota about access to justice. Seriously, you have a go to get a go in this country, according to the Prime Minister, but you only get access to justice if you have a fat wallet or deep pockets. Thats what you just got up and told this Senate. I make the point again: this is the same cohort of people that you are happy to spend billions—with a b—of the taxpayer dollars on every year, establishing offshore detention centres on Manus Island and on Nauru. You are still spending north of $1 billion a year, even though the numbers in those centres, thankfully and belatedly, have come down significantly. You are prepared to spend that money. You are prepared to spend money running an intensely punitive onshore detention regime in this country, where innocent people who have done nothing wrong are imprisoned arbitrarily and indefinitely at a massive cost to the taxpayer. You are then saying that you have to come in and hit the same cohort of people who are trying to appeal politicised decisions made by government agencies to deny them refugee status, to deny them the migration status that they want. They want to file an appeal against that in the Federal Circuit Court, and you want to put their fees up by nearly 500 per cent in order to fund these new judges. Ive got an idea for you, Minister: just fund them out of the consolidated fund. Thats the way you should be funding new judges. You dont need to increase fees by nearly 500 per cent in migration matters, pricing a whole cohort of people out of the justice system—some of whom, I might add, are denied work rights by your government, and many of whom have been recently or over the last two or three years cut off income support by your government. Theyve got no money, they are begging for food, and the charity and refugee sector have had to step up to feed and house these people because you treat them like they are criminals, like they are dogs. But they are actually people, human beings, with children and families, and your governments actions have resulted in them getting kicked out on the street. Many of them cant work because you wont give them work rights. Many of them dont have income because you cut them off our social security system. And now you want to increase their filing fees by 500 per cent. Ive got an idea: fund the new judges straight out of the consolidated fund.","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[2]/speech[66]/talk.text/body/p","Senator STOKER (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the AttorneyGeneral) ","(20:12):"
"0","0","0","1","1","Patrick, Sen Rex","144292","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I would like to know whether you, Assistant Minister Stoker, or the AttorneyGeneral have the courage to stand in front of Senator Griff and tell him what is going on here with his disallowance motion that he intends to put up? What are you doing and where do you intend that money to come from? If you know he is doing that disallowance motion, have you—either yourself or the AttorneyGeneral—had the courage or the decency to go and see Senator Griff in relation to his disallowance motion?   Senator Lambie, these matters were made clear in the Senate when they came up. Theyre on the record.  I do just want to pursue this issue a little further. What weve learned tonight—and I think this is the first time this has actually been on the record—is that these new four judges positions will be funded from the governments proposed fee increases in migration matters, which are now the subject of a disallowance motion moved by Senator Griff. I will have some followup questions, but can I just confirm that that is correct?  The filing fees for the Federal Circuit Court were, if one were to do a comparison over time, quite low for many years compared with those imposed in the AAT and in the Federal Court or the Family Court. As part of the 202021 budget, the Morrison government is providing $35.7 million in funding to provide additional judicial and registrar resources, primarily for the Federal Circuit Courts migration jurisdiction but also in the family law jurisdiction. Ill delve into the detail of that so that its not just the broadbrush answers I gave earlier. Ill give you some precision, Senator Watt, since it has peaked your interest. That will support an additional three general federal law judges—when I say general federal law Im talking about the migration work predominantly—accompanied by two additional registrars, and one additional family law judge, which makes up the four, accompanied by five additional registrars, as well as serving to increase the base funding for the court. This increase in judicial and registrar resourcing will allow the court to resolve more matters every year, which will assist in addressing the backlog in migration matters and reduce the time families with family law matters spend before the courts after separation. The additional resourcing is offset by an increase to the application fees, which I referred to a moment ago, for migration litigants in the Federal Circuit Court. As I mentioned a moment ago, currently the Federal Circuit Court application fees for migration matters are significantly lower than the fee that is imposed, for instance, in the AAT. This change will adjust the Federal Circuit Court application fee from $690 to $3,330 so that it is set at the midpoint between the fees in the lower AAT and the higher Federal Court fee. Well continue to make sure that applicants have access to the court system by maintaining a full fee exemption where paying the fee would result in financial hardship, and it will be accompanied by a new partial fee exemption set at half the full rate, which will deal with many of the circumstances referred to in the commentary given by Senator McKim a little bit earlier. By way of example, of the more than 25,000 migration lodgements in the AAT in 201819, only 3.6 per cent sought a fee reduction, and less than two per cent of those qualified for one. Importantly, the revenue from that change, as I said at the outset, is being reinvested in the courts to improve the efficiency and the experience of court users, including to provide assistance for families navigating a separation and for applicants of migration matters.","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[2]/speech[70]/talk.text/body/p","Senator LAMBIE (Tasmania) ","(20:19):"

I take it from that, then, that the fee increases being proposed for migration matters, which are the subject of the disallowance motion, will be used partly to fund these four additional positions that were announced for the Federal Circuit Court in the last budget and for other things as well. Its partly to fund these new four positions?   Its as I just outlined.  As I said, in last years budget the government announced these four new judicial positions in the Federal Circuit Court. Has the government ever made public that fulfilling that commitment would require increases to court fees, which are now being proposed?  It was set out in the budget papers and in the Senate at the time.  I havent had an opportunity to review the budget papers, but youre assuring the chamber that that detail was made clear in the budget—the detail being that fee increases would be required to pay for a commitment the government was making in the budget? I can go and have a look at the budget papers and see that, can I?  Im also instructed that it was set out in the AGs budget media release. So it is absolutely made public.  We will obviously go and have a look at that, because that was certainly news to me. I also just want to briefly return to the deal that the government has done with Senator Patrick in return for his support for this legislation. Is there any other registry, apart from the Adelaide registry, that is receiving additional Family Court resources in conjunction with this bill?  We have announced that there will be an additional judge appointed. The location for that judge has not been fixed. We will consult with the head of jurisdiction about where that is most needed, and thats how it will be placed.  When was that announcement made about the extra judge?  I understand it was in the 201819 MYEFO. If Im wrong about that, I will correct the record.  That announcement about an extra judge that might end up somewhere else was made two years ago, so its got nothing to do with this legislation at all.  It was related to this legislation, because it was related to this bill. This bill wasnt passed then. The bill is being dealt with now.  But, in terms of announcements made this year that are clearly related to the passage of this bill, its only the Adelaide registry that is receiving extra resources—thats correct, isnt it?  Senator Watt, I dont know how much more clear I can make it. All of the things that I set out in the summingup speech are additional resources that come as part of a package for this bill. You will notice when you review the summingup speech that the additional judge for a location yet to be determined is listed in those items. I dont see how I can make it any clearer than already provided.  So why is it only the Adelaide registry that gets a special sweetheart deal involving four extra judges and a $14.3 million pilot?  Ive got nothing to add. Ive answered the questions.  Noone has asked that question, which is: why is it only the Adelaide registry that is getting the special sweetheart deal of four additional judges and a $14.3 million pilot? Why only Adelaide?  Ive outlined the additional resources that come from this bill. Ive outlined the additional resources from previous budgets. It cant be made any clearer than that.  This may help Senator Watt. To save some time, I seek leave to table a document that was referred to in Senator Watts speech, because I will ask a couple of questions of the minister.","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[2]/speech[74]/talk.text/body/p","Senator WATT (Queensland) ","(20:23):"

"0","0","0","1","1","MemberContinuation","144292","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Senator PATRICK: First of all, Ill just go to some of the claims being made by the Labor Party. I want to put on the record that Ive been involved with this bill for well over two years. I was involved in the Senate inquiry back in December 2018 and, since that time, I have been advocating to the AttorneyGeneral for additional resources for South Australia. Thats my job as a South Australian senator. So I want to make it very clear that the measures that have been announced by the Assistant Minister to the AttorneyGeneral today are measures that I had talked to and advocated to the AttorneyGeneral two years ago. This is not something that was come to overnight. I, as a South Australian senator, will always advocate for South Australia, and Ill point out that theres nothing that stops Senator Watt from wandering over to the AttorneyGenerals office and advocating for the registry in Brisbane, if he chooses to. Unfortunately, hes bound by party lines. If you look at the Constitution—I know you know it, because you are a very learned lawyer, Senator Watt—you will note that in the Constitution we dont have parties. We dont have parties in the Constitution; we have senators that represent their states. What you may have done in failing to advocate for Queensland is put your party ahead of your state.  I proudly stand here and say that I have advocated for my state to deal with an issue that I know has caused difficulties for the community in South Australia—that being a lack of resources in South Australia. Please do not stand up in the chamber, Senator Watt, and suggest there is anything wrong with a South Australian senator advocating for resources for South Australia. I make it very, very clear: I made this arrangement with the AttorneyGeneral in the last parliament; this is not an overnight thing. Ive been advocating for this for well over two years, and Im very grateful that the government has listened to my advocacy. Ive presented my case, and the Attorney has listened and granted these resources. Try it. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, Senator Watt is a Queensland senator, but—as far as Im aware, and he can stand up and tell me if Im wrong—he hasnt gone to the Attorney and sat down with him and said: This is what Id like for Brisbane. This is what Id like to have happen in the Brisbane registry. He doesnt, because hes got to comply with his party guidelines. So I just wanted to clarify that in relation to the advocacy that Ive done for South Australia for some time. I want to go to some issues. I might point out that, throughout this entire process, Ive been engaging with Mr Dreyfus in the other place. Theyve been respectful conversations. I wont go to the nature of those conversations, but, in almost every conversation Ive had with him, Ive asked him what the alternative arrangements would be. You revealed tonight, Senator Watt, that you dont have alternative arrangements; youre going to make those arrangements public just prior to the next election. I wanted to see what the alternative might have been to the governments proposition, and the Labor Party would not tell me. In your speech on the second reading—I listened very carefully to it, Senator Watt—you advocated the New South Wales Bar Associations model. I want to go to page 6 of the document that I tabled. It talks about lack of resources in the courts across both governments, but it also says: The Family Court can be a gold star institution once again but this requires reform in two key areas— One of them is resourcing. The other is: … structural improvement to unify the family law system by creating a single family court … I ask the minister: isnt the effect of this bill to create a single court, a single point of entry, under what is now called the Federal Circuit and Family Law Court?","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[2]/speech[92]/talk.text/body/p[5]","N/A","N/A"

He has accused me of failing in my duties to the people of Queensland. I, of course, would argue that, by opposing this bill, as all Labor senators are doing, thats how Im fulfilling my duties to the Queensland public. This is bad law that will make family law matters worse for people who are already struggling with a failing system. Unfortunately, Senator Patrick does not have the same principled position on this that Labor senators and, indeed, other crossbench senators do as well. But, if he wants to ignore his principles and do a deal with the government, thats a matter for Senator Patrick.  When did the government agree to dedicate additional resources to the Adelaide registry and not to other registries?","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[2]/speech[94]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator WATT (Queensland) ","(20:35):"
"0","0","0","1","1","TEMPORARY CHAIR, The","10000","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I dont accept the premise that we have not provided resources in other places. There are a range of resources provided as a consequence of this bill, including, as Ive already outlined, resources that will be ultimately located in places other than Adelaide.   When did the government agree to the additional judges registrar and pilot in Adelaide?  It was finalised as a part of discussions about making sure that the bill was suitable to the crossbench. I couldnt give you a precise date, but it was something that evolved as a consequence of the interest that has been taken by the crossbench in getting this law right over a period of time.  So, in the last few days, the government has agreed to the additional resources for Adelaide to ensure that the bill is suitable for a particular crossbencher?  Ive answered the question.  Im not sure if the minister is aware of the workload in the Adelaide registry relative to other registries. If its of a mind to allocate more resources to the Adelaide registry, would it not be appropriate and fair for the government to dedicate similar resources to other registries in the country that have at least the same or bigger workload issues?  The needs of the court are regularly considered, and these things are always under consideration.  I note that the minister is a senator for Queensland, as are you, Mr Acting Deputy President McGrath. I would expect that the minister would be advocating heavily for the needs of Queensland registries. Is the minister aware, for instance, that the average time between the date on which a matter is filed and the date on which judgements are being delivered in Adelaide is currently 20.2 months, whereas in the Rockhampton registry its 21.3 months, and in Brisbane its 23.8 months? Minister, as a senator for Queensland, why is it then that the Adelaide registry is receiving additional resources when Brisbane and Rockhampton, for example, have bigger workload issues and longer delays for applicants in the court?  Thank you, Senator Watt. Youre right: I do advocate very fiercely for the needs of Queensland. Queenslanders watching these proceedings will be pleased to know that the Lighthouse Project pilot, for which funding has recently been allocated by the government, is operational in Queensland. Indeed, there is funding approved as part of the most recent budget, as a consequence in particular of the advocacy of Queensland senators from the coalition side, for upgrades to and improved and safer facilities in, for instance, the Rockhampton registry. I dont accept the premise of your question. There are enormous investments being made in Queensland.  Thank you for enlightening the chamber about those investments, but neither of those investments will do anything about the lengthy delays that are being experienced by family law parties in either Rockhampton or Brisbane, will they?  Thankfully, this bill will.  Minister, are you aware that in the Cairns registry it is currently, on average, 41.2 months—well over three years—after a matter has been filed in the family law jurisdiction that a judgement is delivered? In Cairns it takes 41.2 months, well over three years, to have a family law matter finalised, yet the government decides to invest additional resources in Adelaide. Whats so bad about Cairns? Why doesnt Cairns deserve the same as Adelaide when the wait is more than double the wait in Adelaide?  Im glad you raised that question, Senator Watt, because it provides an opportunity to explain the good work that the Chief Justice is currently doing in Cairns. There can be a tendency for distortion in some of the statistics. For instance, there are some matters that can be finalised quickly because they are simple matters; some matters are quite complex. Theres also inconsistency between different judges as to whether they tackle the tough ones first and get those reserved judgements out first or whether they deal with some of the smaller fish and leave those more difficult ones on the shelf to be dealt with after the little ones. In Cairns, there was a practice of the judicial officer dealing with the simpler matters first. Im pleased to say that the Chief Justice is actively tackling that right now to make sure that the position of Cairns will be even better because those longer, tougher ones are being tackled.  Thats very reassuring but the fact remains that currently in Cairns people are waiting twice as long to have family law matters resolved as they are in Adelaide. So again I ask you: why is the Cairns registry not getting the increase in resourcing that were seeing in Adelaide? Is it because theres no Independent senator from Cairns who is prepared to sell out their principles and do a deal with the government in the way that Senator Patrick has?  I dont accept that pejorative premise of the question. This entire bill will reduce the times that are taken for matters to progress through this court, and all people who use the court will benefit from that.  Minister, can you advise the chamber whether any other commitments have been made to Senator Patrick, particularly in relation to the AAT—whether they be changes to the resourcing of the AAT, structure of the AAT or procedure of the AAT? Have any commitments been made by the government to Senator Patrick in relation to changes to the AAT?  The statistics that are provided for how long it takes to finalise a matter are demonstrative of the cases that have concluded. Right? You understand that? The very fact that the statistics for Cairns show that in the six months to 1 January 2021 the matters that are concluded have the figure 41.2 shows that there has been an active, strategic and careful tackling of the oldest cases to clear them out, to make sure that there is resolution of those matters instead of letting them hang around. The people of Cairns should be comforted to see that spike in numbers because it means the oldest, longest cases are cleared rather than hanging around.  I want to go to the question of advocacy, and Ill just describe to those that might be listening how things might work on a pragmatic level. As a South Australian senator, I often take advantage of the fact that Senator Ruston is a South Australian senator and a minister. Throughout my engagement over the last three years in relation to matters dear to my heart and to the hearts of my constituents, I will often contact Senator Ruston and talk to her, whether it be about wine, water or a social security matter. I take advantage of the fact that, as a minister, shes in a position of power and that Ive got close access to her, because I can just pick up the phone and say, Can I have a coffee with you, please. In that context, we have the Assistant Minister to the AttorneyGeneral, who is a Queenslander. So I ask the minister, the assistant Attorney: how many times has Senator Watt picked up the phone to you and said, Id like to have a sitdown with you and talk to you about lack of resources in the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court in either Brisbane or Cairns? I wonder how many times hes picked up the phone and taken advantage of the fact that youre a Queenslander and a minister in that portfolio. He clearly has particular concerns. How many times has he picked up the phone and advocated for Queensland with you about that issue?  If Senator Watt and I had had conversations, I wouldnt reveal private conversations. But, as we havent had any, I think I can put that on the record.  There needs to be some clarification here. A lot of misperceptions have been thrown around the chamber. Labor is asking what deals have been done. The fact is that Senator Patrick has actually got an extra judge or registrar or whatever. Good on him. Good luck to him. No problem. I remember talking to former Prime Minister Turnbull. To get the backpacker tax through, the Greens were given $100 million for Landcare. Also, for Senator Lambies vote for the tax cuts there was $150 million that went towards housing in Tasmania. Good on them. No problem. Our job here is to stand up for our states. Now, Ill put something on the record. Have I done any deals? None. Zilch. Nothing. That is because I didnt ask for them. I believe in this policy and I have called for a merger of these two courts. The family law courts need to be addressed, and thats exactly what has been done here. Youre playing politics, because youre not really looking at facts and you have not been involved in understanding what is happening in our family law system. The facts are that in the 202021 budget the government provided the Federal Circuit Court with funding for an additional family law division judge and five family law judicial registrars. This will further help support the work of the court and alleviate pressure on judges.","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[2]/speech[95]/talk.text/body/p","Senator STOKER (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the AttorneyGeneral) ","(20:36):"

As the CEO of the Federal Circuit Court told the Senate committee inquiry into the bill, the chief judge has also focused on supporting judges through greater assistance from senior registrars and registrars aimed at alleviating the workloads of and pressures on judges. Registrars are doing this by undertaking many highvolume duty lists, as well as interim and interlocutory disputes, and by undertaking dispute resolution in both property and parenting disputes. There is a program at the moment, the registrar assistance pilot. The Federal Circuit Court has recently introduced the registrar assistance pilot, whereby judges can be provided with assistance by a registrar conducting duty list work, ADR or FDR or other appropriate court work. In the first six months of the pilot operation, registrars have provided the equivalent of 128 days of assistance, dealing with over 1,500 procedural hearings.  Its not all about the judges, and thats what youre going on about. Its about clearing the backlog in the courts. I visited the court in Brisbane last week and I spoke to them. Because of COVID they had extra cases put on, but theyve cleared those cases and also cleared about 13 or 15 per cent of the backlog. I mentioned before the Lighthouse Project that has been introduced. That is streamlining by merging the two courts. You have two sets of rules and two sets of processes. This is merging them all into the one process, which is easier for the Australian people who are going through the system. The Lighthouse Project is done online. They can sort out the domestic violence problems that they have. They know how to triage it and put them through the system. Contravention orders have had a big backlog. They take over seven months in the Family Court and 6.9 months in the Federal Circuit Court to be heard. They hope now to address those within 14 days. If were honest with ourselves, its not just the judges. There are a lot of other things that need to be addressed if were going to make improvements in the family law courts. Yes, families have had to wait a long time to have their hearings. The Federal Circuit Court deals with 90 per cent of the cases that are heard. In the 202021 budget the government announced it is providing significant investment—around $120 million over four years from 202021—for the family law system. This includes funding for family law services of $87.3 million; an additional family law federal court judge, five additional family law registrars and further support staff; funding of $2.5 million for the federal family law courts to continue operating specialist COVID19 lists; $4.8 million of additional funding for the Family Violence and CrossExamination of Parties Scheme; and $7.7 million for the relocation of federal law court registries in Rockhampton and Launceston to safer and more secure premises, so there is something for Tasmania. Also there is $1.8 million of funding to implement federal family violence orders and $2.5 million of funding for a new case management system for the Family Court of Western Australia. The government has also introduced legislation, which has now passed this parliament, to support the implementation of the new family safety risks screening and triage processes being piloted in the family law courts, which is to be known as the Lighthouse Project, with $13.5 million of government investment. So you cant say that the government have sat on their hands and done nothing about it. As I said before, it is the Labor Party that sat on their hands and did nothing about it. When I was here in the other place in 1996 I was talking about family law matters. Nothing whatsoever happened over the years. This is why I have been so involved in this whole matter. I take my hat off to Rex Patrick. He is supporting the government on this, as is One Nation. I do believe that it is going to help the people of Australia. Stop playing politics in this place and look at what is right for the Australian people. Im sick and tired, and so are the people of Australia. Were fed up with you knocking something purely because youre on the opposition bench. It has been proven that this is going to help the Australian people. People are suffering, families are suffering, kids are suffering and all youre worried about is your job in this place. Its about standing up and representing the Australian people the best we can. We should come to a decision that is going to be beneficial to them and solve their problems, because, through the family law system, too many kids are being dragged away from their families, too many people are suiciding and too many people are being murdered in this country. This is part of the way of dealing with this and helping those families. It is not just the mums and dads; it is the grandparents and extended families. I heard that through the whole inquiry weve gone through. This is a start to mending the problems that we have. It is about time that, instead of nitpicking and carrying on with politics, we actually tried to agree together on what is best for this and started working for the Australian people.","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[2]/speech[114]/talk.text/body/p[5]","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","1","MemberContinuation","BK6","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I just want to go back to the document that I tabled. For the assistance of those who have a copy, on page 11 it has a diagram of the model that Senator Watt suggested would be the right model for the future. This is the model of the New South Wales Bar Association: Family Court of Australia 2.0. I look at the diagram, and, at the very bottom of it, it talks about a single point of entry for all family law matters. Then it talks about a Division 2, which is formerly the family law jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit Court. Then it talks about a Division 1, which is the former Family Court of Australia, original jurisdiction. Then it shows an appeal division, which is the former Family Court appeals jurisdiction. Appeals from the Family Law Appeal Division go to the High Court. Thats exactly what is being done in this bill. So, Minister, unless Ive got this wrong, this is actually the model that is being implemented by this bill. Is that not the case? Isnt it effectively the very model that Senator Watt advocated for in his second reading contribution?   Thank you, Senator Patrick, for the question. It is substantially the same as what is being proposed in this bill. Ill highlight the similarities and differences, if thats of some assistance. The model that is proposed in the 2.0 model does involve a single point of entry, and there is a single point of entry in what is contained in this bill. There are two divisions, just as in the 2.0 model, although it is slightly differently structured so that its not necessary for all Federal Circuit Court judges to resign and then get reappointed. The different structure thats been used avoids that inconvenience or that administrative consequence. In relation to family law appeals, the 2.0 model envisaged a separate appeal division, whereas there is an ability to appoint either a full court or a single judge to hear appeals in Division 2, and, again, appeals to the High Court are in the usual way. So there are remarkable similarities between the New South Wales 2.0 model that was advocated for by Senator Watt and that which is proposed by the government in this bill.  I just wonder—and maybe Senator Watt might wish to answer the question—whether or not hes talked to you about what is clearly a very similar structure to what hes advocating. Has he made representations to you, in his role as the senator representing the shadow AttorneyGeneral, as to what his fundamental issue is with the current bill, noting its very similar to the model he proposes?  I havent had any discussions of that nature. Though it is worth noting that, in what I understand was 2010, the then Labor government proposed a bill based on this model. It was really not all that different to the bill that is before this chamber, and it represents some irony that we are arguing at length today.  I have come to this debate today in the middle of a really important discussion, essentially because there has been a bit of back and forth about the waiting times in Far North Queensland as opposed to the waiting times in Adelaide. But can I just firstly deal with this issue around the 2.0 model. As the minister says, there are some similarities. One of the main differences is that the 2.0 model is a specialised model. It is proposed by people who are experts in this field, and we take the advice of those stakeholders who are working in this field day in, day out, dealing with family violence matters. Thats the model that they have proposed, and it is different from the governments model, the model that youre voting for tonight, because its substantially supported by stakeholders. The governments model is opposed by those organisations. That matters. It counts for something, because those people are the one whose are dealing with this on a daily basis. I also want to address some of the comments that Senator Hanson made, because I think this is important in the context of us talking about waiting times—how long people who are engaging with this process have to wait to get some sort of resolution, which, as we know, in Cairns is about 41.2 months now. Senator Hanson comes at this with some justification, and some of the things that she talks about—the stress that people go through and the terrible conflict that is created through the family law system—are certainly relevant, and noone is discounting that. I said in my speech today, and I will call it out if the minister wont, that, when Senator Hanson makes comments that imply that somehow the family law system is the reason why people commit family violence, those comments are wrong. They are wrong, and they should be called out every single time that she says them. It says a lot about this government and this minister that they dont call out those comments, because family violence—","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[2]/speech[115]/talk.text/body/p","Senator PATRICK (South Australia) ","(20:54):"

"0","0","0","1","1","TEMPORARY CHAIR, The","10000","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," Senator Green, there was an awful lot in that contribution. The bill will, across the board, reduce waiting times. As I have stated in earlier answers to questions, there has been some considerable and commendable work done by the Chief Justice to clear from the Cairns registry the cases that represented the oldest ones. So theres been a significant improvement demonstrated on the current numbers. So I will rely on my previous answer there.  There was earlier commentary that Ill take as a question about what Ill paraphrase as an allegation that this bill would somehow reduce specialisation; I dont think that mischaracterises your concern. The idea of a loss of specialisation is, quite frankly, false. The very same specialist Federal Circuit Court judges that are hearing family law cases today in the Federal Circuit Court—there are 40 of them, they exclusively hear family law cases and they have an average of 25 years experience apiece in family law—will continue to hear family law cases in the merged court. Interestingly, the level of expertise at present in the Family Court is actually lower, in the sense that the practitioners that have been appointed to that court are not exclusively family law practitioners. So in many ways this represents, at worst, the same level of specialisation and, at best, the opportunity for improvement. Its worth saying too that, to the extent that there has been a concern expressed that wraparound services—particularly in relation to family violence—might be affected, that is a misconception. I referred earlier to the evidence of the CEO of the Family Court and Federal Circuit Court to the Senate committee, who made it very clear that there is no difference between the wraparound services that are provided in the Family Court and those provided in the Federal Circuit Court. Because the internal family law services are shared between the courts, they are already identical. So, again, theres no expectation that there will be a decline in wraparound services for those needing them, particularly in family violence cases, and one can expect no adverse impact on specialisation. Indeed, at this point in time, we have better specialisation in the Federal Circuit Court than we do in the Family Court.","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[2]/speech[120]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator STOKER (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the AttorneyGeneral) ","(21:06):"
"0","0","0","1","1","TEMPORARY CHAIR, The","10000","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I just want to go back to the Cairns registry and the comments made by Senator Green in terms of her listening to her constituents and to people in her community. That is indeed what I do. I know that she does work actively in her community. I might put on the record that I attended all of the hearings in the last parliament in relation to this bill, which caused it to be substantially changed, basically to the form that it is now. But even over the last couple of weeks, I have spoken to people from the Law Council, Ive spoken to justices of the court, Ive spoken to community legal services, and I have spoken, indeed, to the Chief Justice of the Family Court, to the Deputy Chief Justice and to the former AttorneyGeneral under the Labor government who introduced the bill. I wont go to the details of the conversation with the Chief Justice, but I asked them to guide me in whether or not this bill would help them, and the impression that I walked away with was that it would.  The difference perhaps between what Ive done and what Senator Green may have done is that, having received all the information that was provided to me as I listened to the community and various different stakeholders, I then turned and walked to the AttorneyGenerals office and had a conversation, one of many conversations, with the AttorneyGeneral. Indeed, I also recall having a conversation with the assistant minister outside the chamber just recently about this bill as well. There are two parts of what you need to do. You need to listen to the community and then you need to actually go to the people in power. Thats a different prospect to probably what happens normally, where you go to caucus and you complain and you work up tactics and all those sorts of things. Thats not how you successfully advocate for your state. What you do is you pick up the phone and say, I would like to speak to the AttorneyGeneral. Im a senator for Queensland. I am sure that you would get an audience. Thats how you properly represent your state. So I might ask the same question of the assistant minister, who is a Queenslander, so no doubt shares lots of common views. I would ask the assistant minister: how many times has Senator Green wandered up to you and sought a meeting in respect of courtrelated matters in Cairns?","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[2]/speech[121]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator PATRICK (South Australia) ","(21:09):"
"0","0","0","1","1","TEMPORARY CHAIR, The","10000","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," None.   Assistant Minister, the head of Womens Legal Services Australia said: Our opposition to the proposed merger of the family courts is centred on ensuring that the safety and best interests of the child and the safety of adult victimssurvivors of family violence in family law proceedings. Safety must come first in family law. What do you say to that?  We, too, think safety is an extremely important consideration, and thats why we have made, for instance, recent investments in improving safety facilities and the like in Launceston and Rockhampton. That is an important consideration. The Lighthouse Project is an important investment that is all about family violence and safety. These are extremely important considerations, and they are at the forefront of what we do.  This is the head of Womens Legal Services in this country who is very concerned about this bill and the proposed merger. Are you concerned that somebody who is heading up an Australian body such as Womens Legal Services is concerned? Are you concerned about that? Youre making decisions in this chamber when peak bodies, including the Law Council and others, and judges, are saying that this is no good. Do you have any comment to make to those people? Whats your comment to those people, Minister?  Senator Thorpe, of course we listen to and consider and engage with organisations that have experience in these areas, and we will continue to do so in the time to come. We are always open to new ideas or new strategies for improving peoples safety. Thats part of the reason why we have invested in domestic violence units, its part of the reason why we have invested in the Lighthouse Project and its part of the reason why we have invested in the kinds of location upgrades that I referred to earlier. Safety is very important, and thats why we are doing what we are doing.  Minister, the PwC report commissioned to justify the proposal in the amended merger bills was done without consulting key First Nations stakeholders. Why?  Senator Thorpe, I dont accept the premise of the question, in that youve suggested that the only purpose of that report was some sort of reverseengineered justification. That wasnt the case at all. The consultation process that is constantly being engaged in involves all the heads of jurisdiction. This bill involved consultation with heads of jurisdiction who have ontheground understanding of the communities in which they work, and, importantly, there was engagement with the multitude of reports that considered a range of issues, including those affecting Indigenous Australians, and all of those were factored in and considered as part of formulating the bill.  Just to add my experience to it, I visited the Southport court last week, which is a specialised court—we have about five in Queensland—that deals with domestic violence. I cant remember the name of the senator who raised this issue, but, just to bring this to the notice of the house, in the specialised court they actually do have special areas. If people have concerns about attending the court, they notify the court and security guards go outside and escort them into the courthouse. There is a section for men to sit and there is a section for women to sit. Theres also a special area that people, men or women, can go to if theyre very concerned or traumatised or they have any problems. We are addressing those concerns. The merger of the two courts is not—if Womens Legal Services is raising as a concern that the merger of the two courts shouldnt go ahead purely based on safety, nothings going to change; whether we leave the system the way it is now or whether we merge the two courts, it is not going to change. But they have been addressing the concerns of any Australians, men and women, who are faced with domestic violence to ensure their safety, and they provide that safety to them.  Minister, the AttorneyGenerals Department gave evidence to the inquiry into family, domestic and sexual violence in December 2020 that there hasnt been a specific study of what impact the merger would have with respect to family and domestic violence issues. Why are you persisting with this flawed proposal?  Ive made it clear how this bill does not adversely affect specialisation, and I dont have anything further to add to that matter.  Minister, can you tell me where in the final report of the Australian Law Reform Commissions review of the family law system it recommends that you collapse one court into the other?  It doesnt.  I just wanted to go back. I didnt actually get an answer to one of my earlier questions to Senator Stoker, which was: has the government made any other commitments to Senator Patrick, particularly in relation to the AAT?  No. But while Ive got Senator Watt—I beg your pardon, Senator Lambie, Ill be quick. Earlier Senator Watt put to me that there were four existing vacancies, and I agreed to that. Ive just checked it with the office, and I have the numbers in front of me now. The existing vacancies are actually six. Five are in the recruitment process. The sixth one represents the very recent notice given by Justice Barker from Tasmania. That was on 31 January, and there is no candidate for that one yet, but the others are all in an advanced process.  I wanted to find out a little bit more about the $14.3 million pilot program for Adelaide. Could you give me a little bit more detail on that? I think that was over four years, so when does it start? Can you give me some detail on what thats all about?  Senator Lambie, it is a pilot project for legal assistance services, and well have some more detail to flesh that out shortly.  Is that the only detail you have for $14.3 million that you just gave for a pilot program in South Australia? Youve got nothing else to add to that? Is that it, the bare bones, for that $14.3 million? You havent actually gone any further than that? If you cant answer that, maybe you can get up and reply to me, if thats okay, through the chair, Senator Patrick, what you are hoping to achieve out of that $14.3 million that youre getting for the pilot program?  Im happy for Senator Patrick to add anything he would like to, but I can say that we will have more to say about that in due course. But the purpose for which it is to be applied is for legal assistance for a need that has been identified and brought to us by Senator Patrick. Hes evidenced the need for it, and thats why the action has been taken.  Ill just put on the record that I havent agreed to anything in great detail with the Attorney. But, after consultation with stakeholders, one of the areas that is lacking in the Family Court area, particularly for those that need legal aid, is that they often go to legal aid and get assistance up until the point when theyre basically listed to go to court and, in those circumstances, what happens then is the person whos been supported, in essence, gets cut loose. They either have to appoint a lawyer or a barrister or selfrepresent. This is not in any way disparaging of any selfrepresenting litigant. Often they are forced because they have no other alternative. So one of the things I have talked to the Attorney about is the ability to perhaps look at funding beyond the advice stage into the court stage, and that has direct application in respect of this bill, because one of the aims of this bill is to streamline processes. Again, with no criticism of any selfrepresented litigant, but they can tie up the court because of their lack of expertise. I know theyre only doing it because they have to. This may be an avenue. As I said, the details are not sorted out, but the general principles are that we can perhaps extend this, and thats why it is a pilot. You will have heard the Assistant Minister to the AttorneyGeneral talk about a pilot to work out whether or not, by spending money in that area, we can actually assist people and, at the same time, reduce delays in the court. I also want to respond briefly to Senator Watt in relation to the AAT. I want to confirm that my discussions with the government in relation to the AAT have mostly centred on my concerns about appointees. You might recall that on 1 August 2019 I moved a motion in the Senate relating to the AAT, calling on the federal government to urgently introduce a bill into the parliament to repeal section 7(3)(b) of the act, which is the section that allows attorneys on both sides to appoint people—some might call them mates; others might call nonlegally qualified people—to the AAT. Do you know what? There will be silence in the chamber right now because both sides have made questionable appointments to the AAT. I put that to a vote, and Im looking the Hansard now, looking at the Journals, and Senator Watt voted against that. Those are my most recent discussions in public and in this place in relation to the AAT. Sadly, I was advocating for a change, recommended by no less than Justice Callinan, who had done a review into the AAT, to remove that particular provision that allowed those sorts of appointees. Im of the strong belief that, in order to be in the AAT, you really do need to be qualified, not because someone, one of your friends, has influence in this building. I just wanted to put that on the record. From memory, thats my last dealing with the AAT, with the government and with the Labor Party. Unfortunately, in both instances, I was not supported.","Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[2]/speech[122]/talk.text/body/p","Senator STOKER (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the AttorneyGeneral) ","(21:13):"
