It would have been a miracle if mistakes had not been committed. So one of the big reforms which will be introduced into this Department is to have some business method of dealing with it. If I can do that it will be the means of securing a more economic handling of money, and will tend to greater efficiency of the Citizen Forces. I want to place before your chamber certain business proposals connected with the Defence Department. I desire to know whether, in effect, this statement is true; if so, whether the Minister can state what proposals he intends to submit to the Chamber of Manufactures of Sydney, and whether they are going to be taken into the Cabinet, or a secret conclave of Ministers is to decide what shall be done in connexion with the business policy of the Defence Department?","DEFENCE DEPARTMENT","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[1]/question[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

An event is just about to happen in .the history of the Commonwealth, which, I am sure, will cause regret, not only to the members of this Parliament, but also to the public.

In my opinion, he has been the superior of some of his predecessors, while he has been quite the equal of others in every respect. I only wish that I could say the same of his advisers for the time being. During their brief term of office, I am sorry to say, they have not done much which commends itself to my judgment. Of course, their twelve months administration has not been entirely devoted to a policy of misdirection or mischiefmaking. Before I conclude my remarks, I hope to show that, in one respect at least, the Minister of Defence has taken a very creditable stand in endeavouring to uphold the defence policy of Australia. In doing so he has earned my personal esteem for taking so decided a stand against the erroneous view of the understanding arrived at by the Minister of War in the Old Country. Apart from that, I am sorry to say I cannot congratulate the Ministry upon a very bold advance during the past twelve months. Some very curious statements have been made, not only in this Chamber, but outside it, by members and supporters of the present Ministry upon public matters. Senator Oakes made a lengthy address here, of which the burden was that the Labour party depended in a great measure for their public support upon the existence of trusts and monopolies in Australia, and that the moment the law against these bodies became supreme the people would have no further time for us. He tried to make it appear that we lived, not upon what we have actually achieved or proposed to achieve, but upon what we threatened to achieve. He said we had levelled a threat against trusts and combines, and that only so long as that threat survived would the Labour party be in the ascendant. He even went so far as to suggest ti) at the existence of combines and monopolies here was the breath of life to the Labour party. That is a curious rendering of the position. The honorable senator will search in vain through the history of those bodies in Australia for one sympathetic word expressed towards the Labour party, or for the slightest evidence that any money has ever been subscribed by them to help the Labour party into power in the same way as, I believe, it has been subscribed to help the honorable senators party. Seeing, therefore, that trusts and combines have not befriended the Labour party in this country, and have never taken an active part in securing our return, I fail to see any cogency in the honorable senators remarks upon that point. His leader, Mr. Cook, in the other Chamber, as well as throughout the country, said that when once these industrial pests the trusts and combines were made amenable to law in Australia the last prop would be knocked from under the Labour party. That is Mr. Cook in his latest light. I do not know in how many lights he has appeared in the politics of this country, but they certainly must be very many.

At any rate, that statement of his is only in keeping with his former assertions, both inside and outside Parliament, with which we are not much concerned. The fact remains that we have laid ourselves out to make war upon these combinations, that up to the present no friendship has existed between us and them, and that the last thing that enters their minds in a corporate capacity is to help any Labour member into this Parliament. Their attitude towards Senator Oakes and his party has been entirely different. They nave been smiling on his party from the start, and it has been living under their shadow ever since they gained any strength in the industrial life of this country. The Liberal party has been assisted, as has been shown on the sworn testimony of the chairman of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, to the extent of £50,000, more or less, for the purpose of resisting our proposals for the giving of extended powers to this Parliament. The honorable senators party had charge of that money. Mr. Knox did not go behind a bush in speaking about it, and all honour to him for being so frank, because we are looking for men in the front rank of politics and industrial concerns who will give honest and straightforward expression to their opinions. When Mr. Knox made his statement regarding that £50,000 he did something which reflects a great deal of credit on him. That money certainly did not go into the coffers of the Labour party, yet Senator Oakes asks us, to believe that the trusts and. ..combines are the friends of the Labour party, or that we have befriended them, whereas if there is any deadly enmity towards them in Australia, . it is entertained by us.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","LYNCH, Patrick","KRZ","N/A","N/A","N/A","840","It must be so. I can quite imagine what happens at some of those hole and corner meetings away back in New South Wales, where the press is not present, and an organizer like Senator Oakes comes along to tell the old story to the women folk. I can picture the poor deluded dames belonging to. the Liberal party listening and drinking in the tales poured into their ears by men of the Senator Oakes type, about the horrors of the. Labour party. When he ventures in a Chamber like this, under the light and glare of public opinion, with the press present, to put forward such a serious statement as that the trusts and combines are friends of the Labour party, we can easily imagine what a .want of veracity prevails at Liberal meetings, when the press is not present to keep the. honorable senator in check. That is only a sample of what has been taking place throughout the militant career of the Labour party. .We have been continually subjected to these misrepresentations, and we generally have to devote about half of our valuable time and energy to removing the false impressions made on the public mind by men of the Senator Oakes type. I draw attention to his atrocious statements merely as a sample of what is said by the honorable party to which he belongs in their attempts to delude the electors, as unfortunately they have too often succeeded in doing. It has been stated by Senator Millen that the Government have had great difficulty in getting their financial Bills through this Chamber. We have been told that we have mutilated their financial measures. Senator Millen, in view of the high position he occupies in this Chamber, should, above all things, try to keep as close as he can to the truth, even if he cannot actually speak the truth in every word he utters. I recognise that it is quite a strain for some men to adhere rigidly to the truth on all occasions. Some of them are so peculiarly constituted psychologically that they like to sail as close as possible to the . truth all the time, while never attempting to tell it. It does not require very much investigation to ascertain how much truth there is in Senator Millens statement regarding the Governments financial measures. We can remember when the Government brought down a loan measure which, as a matter pf fact, embraced everything that the Government placed before us in the way of financial proposals. That Bill had attached to it a schedule of amounts to be expended on certain public works, including one item of £400,000 for the development of the Northern Territory. How did the Labour party, whom he accuses of having mutilated their financial proposals, behave? On the first occasion we gave him every assistance to pass the Loan Bill, with certain exceptions, which the Government knew would run counter to our platform. In regard to .the item of £400,000 for the development of the Northern Territory, we had this spectacle, that the very senators sitting behind the Government, who ought to be here on all occasions to see that the Minister gets the greatest help in putting any financial proposals through, were not present. Senator Oakes, who is fore most in his belabouring of the Labour party with reckless accusations, was not here; so that if any person shared in the process of mutilating the financial proposals of the Government it was their own friend and supporter, their faithful adherent and watchdog. Old Tray, in fact, was never so subservient as are some supporters of the present Government here; he was faithful. Where was Senator Gould on that occasion, too? He was not accounted for. Where was Senator Keating? He was not here either. When the financial proposals of the Government were at stake, where were these three gallant supporters? As for the lonely supporter left, Senator Bakhap, because they have only four supporters here, he did not backup the Ministry on that day. He was the only supporter, in fact, who was found in opposition; he was the only one who was found mutilating their financial proposals. When Senator Millen, who now calls out when a little criticism is levelled against him, tells the Senate and the country that the financial proposals of the Government were mutilated here, my reply is that those who took the leading hand in mutilating them were the members of his own party, either by their absence or by their direct opposition.

I regard money spent on the northern part of Australia as money not wasted, although it may be seemingly wasted. If we wish to make the north attractive, and induce people to leave pleasant parts in the south and go there, we must be prepared to pour money into the development of that country. What happened? When this proposal, after being defeated by a slender majority, was sent back to the other House, it was returned to the .Senate in due course, but there was not one of the Government supporters present. All four of them were absent; the entire following of the Fusion Government here vanished. We saw the mutilation then, and who took the leading part in it. When the Fusion Government wanted their financial proposals for developing the Northern Territory carried they had to rely upon the members of the Labour party. Had they relied upon their own followers here the measure would never have been carried. So much, by the way, in regard to any truthfulness in the statement of the Minister of Defence. The VicePresident of the Executive Council, too, has been saying things at different times. In fact, he has an incurable habit of saying particularly wrong things. I notice, although it is not quite pertinent to the present discussion, because a Royal Commission is inquiring into how the last elections were conducted, that Senator McColl made a very definite statement on the subject, and, like his leader, Senator Millen, he was just as far from accuracy.

It is well known that they were not returned on their merits but merely because there happened to be some disaffection in the ranks of Labour in New South Wales.

The Prime Minister was very much concerned about the fulfilment of that undertaking. The original contract provided that the delivery of the sleepers should commence in June, 1913, but, eventually, it was altered to provide that the first delivery should take place in November of that year. The Western Australian Government then set about making the necessary arrangements for fulfilling the terms of the contract. They found it necessary to lay down a large and expensive plant, and to connect that plant with the railways of the State. The work was one of herculean proportions, but Premier Scaddan and his colleagues faced it most courageously in their desire to keep faith with the Commonwealth Government. It is quite true that during the months of November, December, and January, no sleepers were delivered by the Western Australian Government, and up till that time, therefore, the contract was not observed.

As regards the Port Augusta end, there are already ample sleepers cut in the Bunbury district ready for shipment under the 200,000 jarrah contract, and we have entered into shipping arrangements for the karri supplies as per contract for shipments commencing in April, and the nondelivery in JanuaryMarch will be overtaken before these supplies are actually required for use at the Port Augusta end. In any event, we can supply jarrah sleepers to make up any deficiency.  He had an assurance that for every powellised karri sleeper which waa not delivered, a jarrah sleeper would be delivered at the contract price. Yet in the face of all these assurances the contract was cancelled. If honorable senators will refer to Hansard for last year, page 4660, they will see that on the 18th December the VicePresident of the Executive Council declared that there were then three months supply of sleepers at both ends of the line. In other words, there was a sufficient supply to carry the work on till the end of March. In such circumstances it is difficult to believe that the contract was cancelled because time was regarded as its essence. The reason advanced by the Prime Minister for his drastic action was that it was necessary in the public interest, and because the construction of the line was a matter of urgency. But what happened afterwards? We found the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs groping round in all directions for an excuse to justify, the cancellation of the contract. Speaking in the Masonic Hall on the 3rd February last, he stated that Mr. Fraser, an engineer in New South Wales, found from experimenting with the powellising process, that blue gum so treated had not been a success. But I would point out that blue gum and karri are very different timbers. The honorable gentleman also stated that the Powellising Timber Commission had advised thai the use of. 9ft. sleepers should be abandoned, and that 8ft. sleepers should be substituted for them. He affirmed as a further reason why the contract had been cancelled that the arsenic in the powellised sleepers was expected to produce bad effects on the hands of the workmen who were required to handle them.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESSINREPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[1]/para[2]","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","LYNCH, Patrick","KRZ","N/A","N/A","N/A","846","Exactly. Notwithstanding the assurance of Mr. Scaddan that in February of this year the Western Australian Government would have been in a position to supply the full complement of powellised karri sleepers, and that thereafter they would have been able to deliver supplies regularly, the contract was cancelled. This is a sample of the Jeddart justice of the present Government. They pronounce judgment, and procure evidence afterwards. Since when, may I ask, has the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs exhibited anxiety for workmens hands? I would like to know whether in his election addresses in his own constituency he manifested so much concern for working men as he displayed for the men whose hands he declared would be injured by the arsenic in the powellised sleepers. The real and unstated reason why the contract with the Western Australian Government was cancelled was that Ministers did not wish that contract to proceed while a Labour Government in that State was exploiting an industry for the benefit of its people. Of course we have heard all sorts of hollow professions in regard to the treatment meted out to that Government. I heard Senator McColl say that they had received the same treatment that was extended to every other contractor. But did they ? In connexion with the supply of locomotives for the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway a matter which was described as urgent what did the present Government do? They extended the time for months, but they would not give even a months extension to the Labour Government of  Western Australia. The Government, therefore had one law for the State Labour Government, and an entirely different law for a private contractor. The circumstances of the case did not in the least warrant the ruthless cancellation of the sleeper contract. By their action in that instance the Government turned adrift in the West men who had their homes put up, and who had gone there to supply their requirements. It was a case with the Government of, Our troubles. Another phase of the karri contract that has been lost sight of by the people is that although up to the present karri, as even its friends will admit, has not been the equal of jarrah, it is believed that by the completion of the powellising process it will become quite the equal of jarrah as a railway timber as time goes on. The process has already been applied in the western State to railway sleepers, and the Government there are perfectly satisfied, on the authority of their engineers, that it is going to be successful. I could, if I had time, quote a statement by the Minister of Works in the Western Australian Parliament, showing how powellised sleepers were put down, together with unpowellised sleepers, and taken up at the end of six years in the presence of the State Governor and members of the Ministry, when it was found that the powellised sleepers came out as sound and as good as on the day they were put in, whereas the unpowellised timber was found to be attacked by dry rot. The same result followed in the case of sleepers put down for three years in a sand cutting a wet place where conditions most favorable to dry rot prevailed. With the powellised karri sleepers in that case were put untreated sleepers in such a condition that they were calculated to create or accelerate the disease of dry rot in the powellised timber, yet when the powellised karri was taken up after three years it was found, according to the authority which I hold in my hand, to be as sound as when it came out of the tree. Mr. Kelly threw doubts upon the powellising contract, but that was after the contract was cancelled, so that it is quite clear that the Government cancelled the contract in the first instance on a most flimsy pretext, and afterwards cast about in all directions for reasons. These flimsy reasons were put forward by the Prime Minister as late as the 7th February, al though the contract was cancelled on the 28th January. The Government were not justified in cancelling the contract, either on the ground of delay or on the ground of the merits or demerits of the powellising process, nor even on the ground put forward by Mr. Kelly of the necessity for maintaining a regular supply of sleepers at the railhead at both ends of the line. It is abundantly clear that the real reason behind the action of the Government in this case was that they did not want to encourage the Scaddan Government of Western Australia to exploit the sleepergetting industry by State action for the use and benefit of the whole of the people of the State.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESSINREPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[1]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

All I wish to say with regard to the Teesdale Smith contract is that although the Government have some very blind followers in another place, not one among them rose to defend the action of the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs. They had not the hardihood to defend an action which was entirely indefensible. Any man with a grain of common sense in his composition would know that 7s. a yard was an outrageous price to give for the removal of the earth and other stuff to be found in the cuttings on the transcontinental line. The Assistant Minister of Home Affairs if he had the merest smattering of knowledge of everyday events would recognise that to give 7s. a yard to remove that material, which could be removed for anything from 2s. or 2s. 6d., or up to 4s. at the outside, was simply making an inroad into the public funds.

The Government have been castigated by some of their own supporters in the other Chamber in this matter, while none of the others rose to defend Mr. Kelly for doing a thing which has certainly no parallel in the history of railway work in the Commonwealth. We are called together on the authority of some Ministers for a short session to dis cuss two measures called test Bills, which appear to be the gage of battle so far as the parties in this Parliament are concerned. They do not mean anything in themselves. They are not measures which mark off party lines, or stand for great principles. The Bill which deals with preference to unionists in Government employment is confined to a very narrow circle, although it is linked up with a great principle which the Government have not touched. There is ample work for the Government to undertake and to carry to completion, not only this session, but next session, without touching those two insignificant measures. They announced twelve months ago what they were going to do, but they have not even attempted to carry out their programme, nor do I believe they ever had any intention of carrying it out once they were securely installed on those comfortably cushioned benches. In August of last year, the Fusion Government announced a policy covering quite a wide range of subjects affecting the welfare of the people. Amongst the measures announced then was one to rectify the anomalies in the Tariff. What are the Government going to do about that matter? In the meantime, they have referred that thorny question to the InterState Commission. In that regard they have secured one more means of evading their responsibilities. What are they going to do to give relief to some of those industries that we are told are at present languishing for want of assistance at the hands of this Parliament ? They have attempted  nothing, and done nothing, in that direction. Why do they not bring down a Bill now, if they want to give relief or encouragement to those Australian industries which twelve months ago they assured this Parliament needed assistance ? We were informed that  important proposals for the development of the Northern Territory will be made. Where are those proposals now ? I look in vain for them.

It is not even mentioned. Two. paltry, insignificant test Bills are to be put forward simply as placards, but the vital interests of the Commonwealth, which include the putting of our loan indebtedness on a proper basis, are to be left to the tender mercies of the money lenders in the distance. No effort is to be made by the Government to bring in a Bill and effect those savings which they say could be effected. This shows a still further dereliction of duty, an abandonment of those promises by which the Government gained a lot of sympathy and support in the past. They have figured before the people as high and mighty authorities; as men who would make two blades of financial grass, so to speak, grow where only one blade grew before. But what do they propose to do here? Nothing, so far as we are vouchsafed any information, but to bring in two paltry Bills. The Government also promised a Bill dealing with life and fire insurance and bankruptcy, so that eight measures which were promised twelve months ago as affecting the peoples welfare in many serious ways have been tossed overboard, or at least we hear nothing about them today. We are told, too, that the Government are going to bring in a Bill to settle the trusts in Australia once and for all, although as on other subjects we have heard two voices on the subject. We had, for instance, that small, thin, squeaky voice saying from the Opposition bench in the past that there were no trusts in Australia, or if there were, the law was allpowerful enough to deal with them. What is the position today? Why is no effort made by the Government to bring forward and put in the forefront of their fighting programme a Bill to deal once and for all effectively with the trusts? A Bill is certainly mentioned in the opening Speech, but the two measures which are considered to be of vital importance are the two insignificant examples that I have referred to rather frequently. How do the Government propose to deal with the trusts? I suppose that they have their own remedy. At present some members of the Liberal party profess to see no danger in the trusts. Mr. Kendell, who moved the adoption of the AddressinReply in another place, affected to believe that to have a Beef Trust here was quite harmless.

This is amply proved by the way in which members of the party are allowed to express their individual opinions on the question. I am concerned now with the fact that we are threatened in Australia with that allpervading trust the Beef Trust, which is the greatest trust in the world. We know that if it gets even a controlling interest in the large pastoral areas of this country, which it is at present attempting to do, the people of Australia consumers and sellers alike will be at its mercy for ever more. I do not know whether the Government are susceptible to enlightenment on this question, but I propose to quote for them opinions expressed, not by a member of the Labour party, or one who sympathizes with that party, but by impartial men in London. These opinions have appeared in the British Australasian, which cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be considered friendly to the Labour party.

As for the cattle raisers, they have not yet felt the full pinch. That experience will come later, when the Trust has accomplished its end, crushed out competition, got control of the market, and then, instead of paying the high prices for stock which it is now offering as a bait to the shortsighted cattle raisers, drops the prices to whatever level it chooses . Then the fat will be in the fire.  Unless the meat packers of Australia and the stock raisers are firm in their determination to resist the blandishments of the American Beef Trust, said another importer,  I am very much afraid there are troublesome times ahead, for the industry and all concerned with it. Some men I know talk glibly of the Australian antimonopoly laws being sufficient to hold the Trust in check.

There are antiTrust Acts in the United States, but the Beef Trust simply snaps its fingers at them, as do many other Trusts for that matter. The best thing the Federal Government or the State Governments can do is to pass a drastic antiTrust law before the Trust gets a firmer foothold in Australia.  The Trust is looking further ahead to the time when the opening of the Panama Canal will bring about much swifter communication between the Atlantic ports and Australia. The Trust fully realizes the great and growing importance of Australias packing industry, and my advices from the United States are to the effect that it is determined to secure at all costs a controlling interest in it. It would be a good thing if the Australian public could be aroused once more to the danger the still greater danger which now threatens them. The danger is a very real one a grave menace to their progress and prosperity, and to the development of a valuable industry and the sooner they realize this the better for all concerned.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESSINREPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[1]/quote[6]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

I have quoted them for the benefit of honorable senators on the Government side. Let me say that if the Government shut their eyes to this danger; if they deliberately stick their heads in the sand like the ostrich, and will not press forward with a measure to deal with the trust, which is of vital importance, and prefer to insist upon carrying the measures of minor importance to which I have referred, they will be showing themselves entirely forgetful of the vital needs of the people of this country. This session of Parliament is, apparently, to be absolutely wasted. The course pursued by the Government provokes irritation on one side and on the other. The Labour party are being challenged to .defend the position they took up on the hustings and in this Parliament. We are challenged in the Senate to retrace our steps and to turn our backs upon the attitude we formerly adopted. That is an invitation, which, so long as there is a member of the party true to our policy, will never be seriously entertained. I have said that the measures which the Government pro pose to press forward, circumscribed as they are, do not indicate much; but one of them involves a great principle to which the Labour party gave their staunch adherence when before the electors. What has been the history of the Government party in the immediate past ? Every measure of importance passed by the Labour Government during their three years of office was resisted by them. When they had an opportunity to give effect to their views and their promises to the people, what did they do? They did nothing whatever. There is no indication in the GovernorGenerals Speech of any intention on their part to repeal the measures which they fought so bitterly in this chamber. Although the land tax was railed against here and in another place, it is not to be repealed. It was described as a measure which infringed upon the domain of the State activities. It was described by Sir John Forrest, in particular, as a confiscatory measure. The confiscation under it continues, but no attempt is to be made by the Government, of which Sir John Forrest is a member, to stop that confiscation. The members of the Government party declaimed against the Commonwealth Bank, the note issue, the maternity allowance, and every other measure of farr reaching importance which was carried through the last Parliament by the Labour Government. All those measures met with the systematic opposition of the present Government and their supporters. But no attempt is to be made to repeal any of them.

If we could only induce them, instead of posturing, to come out into the open and make a plain and truthful statement of their views, their numbers in this Chamber and in another place would be greatly reduced. Their policy is to resist to the last every advance and reform; but once it reaches the statutebook they cry off. They do not dare to raise the issue again, lest they should not see the inside of Parliament if they did so. If they stood to their guns, as the members of tine Labour party do, they would be candid and open.  If they were steadfast to the attitude they adopted during the three years in which they were in opposition to the Labour Government, I should have some sympathy for them. They have, on the contrary, adopted a cowardly attitude, and, though they are now in possession of the Treasury bench; they do not dare to propose the repeal of the measures which they denounced when in opposition. Let us consider the example which was set them by the Labour party. What did we do ? When we were in opposition we took our stand against the Naval Loan Bill. We could not prevent the passage of the measure, and it went through. We said in this, and in the other Chamber that we did not want a Naval Loan Bill, and that the correct policy for the people of Australia to pursue was to meet the bill for defence when it accrued, and not pass it on to posterity. In spite of our efforts the measure reached the statutebook. A defence measure was also passed by the Government of the day, and much trumpeting was indulged in in regard to it. The essence of that measure was to allow the safety of Australia to depend on boys, on stripplings up to eighteen years of age. When on an appeal to the people, a Labour Government was returned to power, what did we do ? We instantly repealed the measure against which we had declaimed in this Parliament. The first thing we did was to repeal the Naval Loan Act, and the next thing was to introduce a Defence Bill which put the defence system of the country on a proper and workmanlike basis. Herein lies the difference between the Labour party, the candid and straightforward party, and the party now on the Treasury bench, who oppose to the last every measure of reform, but when it reaches the statutebook never have the grit or courage to remove it. I do not wish to be too hard upon the Government and their supporters, because I know they are going straight to their doom. No matter what may be said about the change of public opinion, I am sure that if an appeal were made to the electors tomorrow, the Government would find that, notwithstanding the advantage of their position, due to the way in which they are supported, their policy would not find favour with the electors.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESSINREPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[1]/continue[18]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Irvines proposal to alter the constitution of the Senate. Here is a gentleman who thinks that the constitution of the Senate should be altered, and why? Why does Sir John Forrest want the constitution of the Senate altered ? Why does every reactionary member of the present Ministry want the Senate altered ? The reason is that the majority in the Senate have developed a habit of voting on the side of the people and in their interests. The presence of the Labour party in the Senate in such large numbers has completely defeated the hopes indulged in by the men who framed the Constitution. I remember well that in Western Australia, Sir John Forrest felt quite sure that, because of the way in which the Constitution was framed, no agitator would ever reach the Federal Parliament, and certainly none would ever be elected to the Senate. The right honorable gentleman took a hand in building up the Senate on the plan which appealed to him, and what is the result today ? The representatives of the party with which he is associated are about seven in number in this Chamber. We have seven lone, gaunt specimens on the Government side. There are so few on this side of the Chamber that the winds whistle through, and I am liable to catch cold because of the draughts over here, while on the other side we have the serried ranks of Labour representatives whose advent to the Senate was never contemplated by the framers of the Constitution. Sir John Forrest builded better than he knew when he gave his approval to the constitution proposed for the Senate. The voice of the Democracy of Australia has entirely defeated the hopes he entertained regarding it. The seven senators on the Government side in this Chamber are like seven black stumps in an open plain after a bush fire has passed over it. They are seven disconsolate wrecks of the party that planned the constitution of the Senate in such a way that it was hoped only their own representatives would be found here. The members of the Labour party are here, however, and are going to remain here. Mr. W. H. Irvine wants to revise the plan of the Senate. What does the honorable gentleman want? He wants to have the small States practically wiped out?, I should like to hear what Tasmania and South Australia have to say about that. I should like to hear the opinion of the people of the larger State from which Senator Gould comes, because one of the ideas in connexion with the proposed alteration of the constitution of the Senate is that the more populous States should be divided and so secure a larger representation.

There is nothing in the Constitution which forbids this Chamber from exercising its undoubted constitutional rights.

I need only instance the award given in the Australian Tramways employes case. It is about twenty months since that award was given, and the employes of the Adelaide Tramway Trust have not yet benefited to the extent of a halfpenny by it, although it was very much in their favour. The Adelaide Tramway Trust have fought it right through, and the case is still pending before the High Court. The principle of preference to unionists is one which the Labour party will never surrender. They have fought for it for a long time, and will continue to fight for it until it is in practical operation. We are not like the honorable senators sitting opposite.

If the present Government are successful, however, they will absolutely destroy industrial peace. The Labour party are fighting for preference to unionists, because they desire to preserve industrial peace. When the workers of Australia agreed to band themselves together in organizations, and register them under the Federal and State Arbitration Acts, they at once, by that very action, surrendered the right to strike. Trior to such registration and organization, the workers, if not satisfied with the conditions under which they were employed, always had at their command the weapon of the strike, which they used because they had no other.

Such a remark is unworthy of him. Even if they have all gone the one way, they have still a long way to go yet before the workers get their fair share, and I for one am prepared to see that they do go further. Suppose that the men employed in our great industries who sought the Arbitration Court for a settlement of their grievances had used the drastic weapon of the strike, what would it have cost Australia?

The employers cannot go on strike, but what do they do when adverse decisions are given against them? I remember when the bakers in Melbourne and suburbs got from the Wages Board an award increasing their wages considerably. Although the employers were equally represented on the Wages Board, what did they do? They appealed to a Judge of the Supreme Court to prevent the payment of the award, and were successful. The Judge upset the decision of the Board, and the men did not get the increase awarded to them.What did the men do? They started a cooperative bakery, and very soon brought the employers to their senses. There are many ways of striking. When an employer drags a case along from Court to Court, and prevents an award from being operative, is not that worse than a strike? Decidedly it is.

A perusal of the newspapers will disclose that preference to unionists was then totally condemned, not only by the occupants of the Treasury bench today, but by their supporters. They told the farmers, particularly in connexion with the rural workers, that preference to unionists would be injurious to them, and not .to return a Labour candidate, because if he were returned he would be in favour of the principle. No cry which our Fusion friends used at the last elections had more effect than their cry of no preference to unionists. They did not qualify it in any way. They did not limit it to employes of the Commonwealth Government, but roundly condemned preference to unionists holusbolus. It was the means, to a great extent, of turning the scales temporarily in their favour, and particularly in ,the rural districts. When they made these statements, one would expect that, as men and I presume they are men when they got the reins of government they would bring down a measure to amend the Act which covers the whole gamut of our industrialism. But they have not had the moral fibre to attempt to do that. They bring in this trumpery, twopennyhalfpenny Bill dealing only with preference to unionists in Commonwealth employment. So far as I am concerned, if the measure affected only one employ6 of the Commonwealth Government I should be against it. If a double dissolution is brought about I should not care, so far as the Labour party is concerned, to go to the country on a more popular cry than that of preference to unionists.

If the Government were sincere in condemning that provision of the Act under which the writer of every article or letter in a newspaper during an election campaign must sign it with his name, why did not they persevere with the Bill they introduced for the amendment of the Act instead of dropping it and sending us a paltry measure to restore voting by post ? There are many provisions of the existing Act which the Government have condemned, but they lack the moral courage to send up to the Senate a measure to give effect to their views.

There are in the Speech four or five paragraphs referring to .the Premiers Conference which sat a few weeks ago in Melbourne. I have no objection to the Premiers meeting in conference. That is their business, not mine, but I do not see why this Parliament should concern itself so much with that meeting, or follow the Premiers lead,. This Parliament can go on with a number of important national questions without waiting for a lead from the Premiers of the States. .Those questions are vital to the welfare . of the people, and are waiting to be dealt with, and the GovernorGenerals Speech should not be burdened by, or the time of this Parliament taken up with, references to such conferences as those. The Government would have been much better guided if they had allowed the Premiers Conference simply to go its own way. If any good resulted from it, good and well ; but, quite apart from it, the Government should have brought down to this Parliament a bold national policy for the development of . Australia, if they have any such in their minds. The fourteenth paragraph of the Speech refers to1. the question of immigration, an important matter that deserves the serious attention of every Government. It is absolutely imperative to attract to our shores a hardy and virile manhood and womanhood to assist us in the development of our resources, but the present system or systems of encouraging people to our shores are detrimental to the best interests of the Commonwealth. There are too many schemes in operation. There are six separate systems, with one State vieing against the other, and the representative of one State saying to the intending immigrant,  Come to my State, the other States are no good to go to. Such a condition of things results not in putting Australia properly before the eyes of the people of the Old World, but is really libelling it, because every State is good to come to, and every portion of Australia is good to live in. It would be wise for the Commonwealth Government to suggest to the various State Governments to leave the question of immigration entirely alone. Let the Commonwealth Government take it over and bear the whole cost, so that we may have one system of immigration directed through one channel from a common centre. The scheme could be worked through our High Commissioners office in London, and the stream of immigration could be diverted to the various States as they are ready to receive it. I am sure the States themselves would not be sorry to be relieved of the present trouble and expense, and if the Commonwealth Government took full and sole control far better results towards the development of Australia would be achieved.  Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. In paragraph 11 of the Speech it is said that  a Bill will be introduced, giving additional powers of control over combines affecting or likely to affect injuriously the trade and commerce of Australia. I welcome that declaration, because it shows that the Fusion Government have made a volte face on the question of trusts and combines. Their attitude today is in complete contrast to the position they took up during the last referenda campaign.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESSINREPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[2]/continue[70]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Time and again they have twitted us with having been three years in office, with an absolute majority in both Houses, and having yet failed to legislate to counteract the evil influences of the trusts. We did legislate in an endeavour to cope with the evils, but we found when we had exhausted the constitutional powers of Parliament that we had to face a higher tribunal which interprets the Commonwealth Constitution ; and we discovered that, according to the interpretation of that body, we had exceeded our constitutional powers. If honorable senators opposite are sincere in their desire to cope with trusts and combines, I assure them that legislation of the kind which they propose to introduce will not effectively combat the evil.

Then there was a cry from the people for a revision, in order to make the Tariff stronger in its protective incidence. As a most pronounced Protectionist, I would have welcomed a reopening for that purpose.

This is one of the most important questions to Australia, and, with all due respect, I do not think that the InterState Commission is a body that should deal with the question. For months past they have been taking evidence from the representatives of various industries throughout this island continent, and will, I presume, continue that work ; but after they have come to a judgment on the evidence adduced, their recommendations will come before this Parliament, for the Commission cannot alter one line in the Tariff Act. This Parliament will review every line of the Tariff that is submitted by any Government for revision, and, consequently, the work of the InterState Commission in this connexion is an absolute waste of time. The Constitution, of course, confers very great powers on the InterState Commission, and I do not complain of that fact, but their time could be better spent in dealing with questions which are more within their ambit than is the review of the Tariff, because this Parliament must be the final arbiter, and when it comes to review their recommendations a great deal of time will necessarily have to be spent here. I come now to the transcontinental railway. I desire to supplement the remarks of Senator Lynch on the cancellation of the sleeper contract. It was cancelled unjustly. It was an unjust blow to the people of Western Australia. The State Government was singled out deliberately by the Federal Government for a special attack, whilst other contractors were let go scotfree, although they had not lived up to the letter of the contracts.

For some time after the sleeper contract with the State Government was cancelled, not one solitary truck or bogie had been supplied by that company. It was months overdue with the delivery of these necessaries, and, as a result, delay was caused in the construction of the railway, and in the very early history of constructional work, too. Yet there was no threat held over the head of the company that if it did not speed up with the delivery the contract would be cancelled. No, there was not even a threat of the imposition of a fine for the delay in delivery. Why was this favoritism extended to the Clyde Engineering Company and the guillotine dropped on the head of the State Government? Senator Findley has just put the matter in a nutshell, and reluctantly I come to the conclusion that it was because the State Government was a Labour Government, and was erecting State timber mills to supply the sleepers, that the guillotine was dropped. What was the reason advanced by Mr. Cook in his letter to Mr. Scaddan? The contract was cancelled because, he said, that at a certain time delay  might  occur in the construction of the line. Bead his letter as you like, you cannot find a single sentence to say that he cancelled the contract because delay had occurred. It was cancelled on a mere assumption, and not on a matter of fact.

As regards delay in delivery of sleepers, let me remind the Minister of Defence that the two principal officers in connexion with the construction of the line at that time, Mr. Deane and Mr. Hobler, gave evidence before the Royal Commission on the powellising process. They were asked if there was a sufficient supply of sleepers at both ends of the line, and if any delay had occurred. The EngineerinChief and the Assistant EngineerinChief swore that no delay had occurred, and that there was a supply of sleepers for three months at one end, and a supply for four months at the other end. Despite the evidence of these two responsible officers, Mr. Cook cancelled the contract with the State Government. Furthermore, when the Treasurer was in Kalgoorlie about February of this year, Mr. Mahon, its representative in the other House, and myself introduced to him a deputation representing the workers engaged on the line, asking for better conditions, and better remuneration for their labour. The right honorable gentleman, in reply to our representations, admitted, from what he had seen at that end of the line, and where he had seen the rails and the sleepers stacked, that there could be no delay in construction as the result of nonsupply of sleepers. Although we have the statements of the Treasurer, the EngineerinChief, and the Assistant EngineerinChief that no delay would occur, still the contract was cancelled. It was most shameful treatment to mete out to a private contractor, let alone to a State Government. Had it not been a Labour Government the original contract would have been in existence today. .It is a costly matter to the people of Western Australia that the contract should have been cancelled. Hundreds of thousands of pounds had been spent in the erection of mills; over 2,000 employes were ready there to commence operations; their wives and families were assembled there; business men were prepared to open stores in order to supply the necessaries of life; but by one stroke of the pen all this was quashed, and these men and the State have had to suffer through the arbitrary act of the Prime Minister and his Government. Not only has an opportunity been denied to the people of Western Australia to demonstrate to the world the virtue of karri timber, but the opportunity has been denied to them to reap the benefits of the rich soil in which the karri trees grow. There would have been a new tract of country opened up for cultivation, and new resources developed. But all this has been stopped. It is shameful treatment.

That is all I nave to say about the handing over of the transcontinental railway to contractors. It is quite evident from the cancellation of the sleeper contract with the Western Australian Government, and the intention of the Government to let the construction of the line to contractors, that they have been squeezed between the Timber Combine on the one hand, and the contractor on the other, and have had to yield in order to keep faith with their friends. I cannot leave this question without referring to the industrial dispute at present in existence at the western end of the line. I certainly regret the dispute, but it has been practically forced upon the men by the present Government. It might be well to briefly trace some of the events that have led up to the dispute. When the Fisher Government were in power, and some of the members were in Kalgoorlie at the turning of the first sod of the transcontinental railway at that end, I introduced to the then PostmasterGeneral and member for Kalgoorlie, Mr. Frazer, a deputation from the men setting forth certain claims for increased wages and better, conditions of labour. Mr. Frazer heard their representations, and submitted them to his colleagues. He came back again to. a meeting of the men, at which I was present, and intimated that certain concessions would be granted, such as free shovels, shade protection at meal times, payment for shifting camp, walking time going to or from the job, whichever the men chose, and one or two other concessions. As regarded the schedule of wages submitted, he explained that that would be considered later on. Before an opportunity could be given to fully consider the schedule of wages submitted by the men, the Fisher Ministry was displaced, and it devolved* upon the present Ministry to carry on negotiations. When, unfortunately, Mr. Frazer paid the debt of nature, I was asked by the men at Kalgoorlie to continue negotiations for the payment of wages at a certain scale from the depot at Kalgoorlie to the 60mile peg, and from the 60mile peg further on. I took up the negotiations, and wrote to Mr. Kelly. I sent him the schedule, and one or two other letters. Somewhere about last January, I got replies from the Department to the effect that Mr. Kelly would give the matter attention. On the 11th or 12th January, I got a telegram from Mr. Kelly saying that the mens request could not be granted, and that he was writing. I awaited his letter, and that letter practically shut the door in the mens faces. He would not negotiate any further. He said the men were getting the best wages, and were being supplied with goods at Kalgoorlie rates. I proved afterwards that that statement of Mr. Kellys was wrong, since at that time the men were being charged from 10 to 15 per cent., more for their goods along the line than the prices obtaining in Kalgoorlie. Next day I wrote to Mr. Kelly, pointing out to him in all seriousness that he had taken up a .dangerous attitude, that these men had been waiting many weary months to get the question of wages and conditions settled ; and that if he now shut the door in their faces his action might be the means of bringing about industrial trouble. I asked Mr. Kelly, in view of these circumstances, to reopen the matter, and go into the whole question with representatives of the men. From that day to this, Mr. Kelly has not even acknowledged the letter. Here is a Minister of the Crown who complains about the men going out on strike, but who did not have even the common courtesy to acknowledge a letter from a senator of Western Australia appealing to him to reopen the matter with a view to preventing industrial strife. The men are out today asking for a minimum of 13s. 4d. per day, the wage which a contractor ort another portion of the job is paying, and the wage which has been paid on railway work in the northwest of Australia by other contractors. It is true that the Government offered the men an increase of something like lOd. per day.

The following is an example of extra claims by contractors : In addition, the Department had to meet expenses of £30,000 in contesting the claims. A few Comparisons. In Queensland the maintenance for day labour lines was only half that for contract lines.

I do not like to leave Australia to obtain examples, and particularly do I dislike having to go to America for them. But I am going to America for a good example, because it is the home of private enterprisethe country where the railways, tramways, telegraphs, telephones, and waterworks are all in the grip of private enterprise. In that country we find that the Panama Canal has been completed under the daylabour system. Anybody who knows anything about that Canal, and about the country through which it passes, will realize what a huge undertaking it was. De Lesseps failed in his attempt to construct it, and he was the archangel of private enterprise at that particular period. Eminent engineer though he was, he failed, and his failure was more colossal than was the undertaking itself. Corruption and bribery existed any amount of it. As the result of De Lesseps failure, reputations were shattered, and some men were imprisoned. But the United States Government stepped in and Colonel Goethals has completed the work. The great success which has attended the attempt of the United States Government to build this Canal under the daylabour system is due largely to the fact that they placed first and foremost considerations of health and sanitation. They took every precaution to safeguard the health of their employes. Under the management of De Lesseps the death rate reached the appalling rate of 240 per 1,000, but under the administration of Colonel Goethals it was reduced to 16 per 1,000 in this diseaseridden jungle 25 per cent, less than is the mortality rate of a number of North American towns. Not only were the principal centres of activity carefully looked after, but the outlying native settlements were closely watched. Their water supply, their refuse and mosquitoes received vigorous attention. The United States Government went further and established hospitals in which every comfort was provided for the patients. The Government also erected comfortable houses, provided with lawns and plantations, and supplied them to the workmen rent free. That was not all. The Government established what were termed community stores where all the necessaries of life were sold at practically cost price, with the result that living today on the Isthmus of Panama is cheaper than it is in any other part of America. That is an example which might well be followed by my honorable friends opposite if they are sincere in their desire to prevent the gradual increase in the cost of living. The United States Government also erected bakeries and supplied loaves at 2d. each from one end of the job to the other.

I recollect that when the Fisher Government proposed to establish a steam laundry in the Northern Territory, the present Minister of Defence and others , ridiculed the idea. It is worthy of remark, however, that the United States Government did not think it was beneath them to establish a steam laundry, not merely for their own employes, but for outsiders. They also became butchers. They erected butchers shops, and supplied the people with meat.

In Western Australia the same story is told. The people there are assured that it is because a Labour Government are in power in that State that the cost of living is so high.
