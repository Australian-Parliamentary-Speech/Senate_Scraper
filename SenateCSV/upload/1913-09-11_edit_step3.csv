The president of the chamber (Mr. A. J.

Mr. Donaldson urged the establishment of a meteorological station at Cairns. Mr. Hunt, in reply, declined to establish a meteorological station at Cairns. It would be creating a precedent, and other ports would want the same. He intended, with the consent of the Deputy PostmasterGeneral, to arrange for the interchange of data several times daily between Thursday Island and Brisbane. During the cyclone season on the northern seaboard he would arrange to get a set of data exchanged along the coast.","WEATHER WARNINGS","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[3]/question/quote/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

During the recent electoral campaign I predicted from many platforms that if the Liberal party were returned to power they would immediately proceed to repeal the great social and industrial legislation passed by the Labour party during the last three years. The election is now a matter of history, and, although the Labour party have a pronounced majority of twentytwo here, unfortunately we are in a minority of one in the House which makes and unmakes Governments, where the Cook party are in office. Thank heaven, they are not in power so far as passing legislation is concerned. I find from a statement submitted here by the representative of the Government that my prophecy has been fulfilled. We are told that our electoral law is to be attacked; the secrecy of the ballot is to be violated ; an attempt is to be made to smash unionism, to ostracise the hardy bush worker, to deprive the mothers of Australia of the maternity allowance, because, we are informed, the Act is to be placed on a poverty basis; and what is more, the statement indicates that the workers of Australia are to be asked to contribute towards the maintenance of a standing industrial army an army of unemployed to be available when the captains of industry require them. These are the men who talk about class legislation, and scarcely are they in office on a microscopical majority of one in the other House and before they are in real power in Parliament than they propose to repeal the beneficent laws passed by our party in the interests of the people of Australia. A great programme this is to tamper with the franchise, to penalize unionism, to handicap Australian mothers, and to ask the workers to pay tribute to the captains of industry! Had our opponents swept the polls by an overwhelming majority, we would not have been surprised at this procedure indeed, we would have expected it; but for the Government to come down here and adopt this repeal policy without an emphatic mandate from the people is a rare example of arrogance and impudence. To hang on to office on the casting vote of the Speaker is bad; to try to do business confronted with an overwhelming majority in the Senate is even worse; but to expect to carry this repeal policy in a Parliament so constituted is an outrage on public decency. Yet the VicePresident of the Executive Council said yesterday that the duty of the Opposition is to give the Government a show. Did we not give them a show ? These men who were supposed IX possess a monopoly of the intelligence of Australia met the Parliament and confessed that they had no policy to present. The  Labour party, in a spirit of fair play, said,  We will give you time to prepare a policy, and we gave them, I think, over a month for that purpose; and then they come down and ask us to give them  a show. A show to do what ? To repeal the great legislative enactments of our party. A nice chance there is of them getting that show, so far as we are concerned ! Proceeding, Senator McColl contrasted the action of his party towards ours three years ago with our action towards them today. Any man who is not approaching his second childhood would be able to recognise that there is not any analogy between the position of the Fisher Government three years ago and that of the Cook Administration today. Three years ago the Fisher Government came into power in the House of Representatives with an undoubted mandate from the people, and they also had an emphatic majority here. They were told by the people to go on and give effect to their policy. What is the position of the Cook Government? In the other House they have not a majority at all unless they contemplate making the Speaker a party hack, and I hope that he will not nor do I think he will condescend to be made one. In the Senate they have no majority at all. Indeed, they are, as everybody knows, in an overwhelming minority, being only seven to twentynine. It is lunacy on the part of any man to contrast the position of the Fisher Government with that of the Cook Administration today. But I had better proceed to deal with the precious policy document that is before the Senate.

Nothing has occurred in the Commonwealth since its inauguration so serious as the cruel, and unjust charges which have been flung at the Labour party and the people. of Australia regarding the conduct of the recent general elections. At every Liberal rally which has since been held, Liberal prevaricators some of them old enough to know better, and some of them holding positions of responsibility which should have prompted them to act with more prudence have declared that at those elections corruption was practised in a wholesale fashion by the people of Australia. We were told by the Tory press that impersonation, plural voting, and gross irregularities had been resorted to, and scores of pettyminded Liberal politicians took up the parrot cry. Unfortunately, this foul calumny on the integrity of the people of the Commonwealth has not remained within this continent. It has been cabled throughout the civilized world that the people of Australia conduct their elections in a corrupt fashion. That circumstance must have a most damaging effect on the high character that we have hitherto enjoyed.

Anybody reading the cablegrams which have been published throughout the .world regarding the conduct of those elections will have a very poor opinion of the honesty of Australians. The present Government, thinking that they had discovered something which would discredit the Labour party and the Labour movement, proceeded immediately after the elections to issue special regulations, having for their object the holding of a scrutiny. But for the vigilance of the Labour party that scrutiny would have been conducted under conditions that would not have savoured of fair play. We beheld the extraordinary spectacle of a Government attempting to hold a scrutiny without scrutineers, until their efforts were blocked in another place. Every name on every roll in every division has since been carefully examined, and with what result ? We find that there were 2,760,216 persons enrolled, of whom 2,033,251 voted. Out of these, 5,760 names have been ticked off on the rolls more than once. The inquiry into all the alleged gross irregularities has revealed this, and nothing more. Just prior to that investigation being held, we were assured that, in connexion with the Fremantle election, there were thousands of duplications of votes. We were told that in certain streets the whole of the people had voted more than once. What are the facts? There were 33,613 persons on the Fremantle roll, of whom 28,628 voted. Out of that number the names of 156 persons had been ticked off on the roll more than once. That is the only offence which has been established. In Oxley, Queensland, it was stated that more people had voted than there were names on the roll. That statement was freely made, and members of the Liberal party were going to prove it. But inquiry has revealed that, out of 38,238 persons who were enrolled, 31,372 voted, and all the alleged irregularities boiled down to this: that 135 names had been ticked off on the rolls more than once. Instead of the recent elections having been conducted corruptly, it may yet be found that those elections the first conducted by a Labour Government in the Federal sphere were the cleanest ever held in the Commonwealth. The worst that can be urged in regard to the conduct of those elections is that the names of 5,760 persons were ticked off on the rolls more than once.

But, in spite of the irrefutable evidence submitted, we yesterday witnessed the spectacle of a responsible Minister; to his shame be it said deliberately stating in this chamber that there had been double voting. I have here a report by Mr. R. C. Oldham, the Chief Electoral Officer, in which he clearly sets forth that there were no corrupt practices indulged in at the recent elections. As the report has already been read in this chamber, I do not propose to read it again. For any man, in the face of the evidence which has been forthcoming, to assert that corrupt practices were resorted to in connexion with the conduct of the recent general elections is an infamous libel on the people of Australia. Such a libellous statement could only emanate from a diseased and criminal brain. Coming closer to this Liberal repeal policy, for as such it may be described, I find that it is proposed to reform our electoral laws. I think that the Government are more likely to deform them. Just imagine the present occupants of the Treasury bench talking about  an efficient electoral system; and about placing Parliament on a sound basis ! Why, they have been lifelong opponents of everything which makes for a sound representative parliamentary system. They talk about duplicate voting. Yet they tried as long as they could, and by every means in their power, to make duplicate, and even triplicate, voting the law of the land. In my own State I recollect, in the early nineties, one man who had no fewer than thirtyfour votes at an election. At that time plural voting was regarded as the exclusive privilege no, I should not say privilege; as the absolute right of the Conservatives. In my own State plural votes were exercised to such an extent that I know of an instance where one man had the right to cast thirtyfour votes in one election. It was only after the fiercest battles that the Labour party succeeded in abolishing plural voting, and establishing what we possess today an adult suffrage which is the broadest on earth.

Why revert to a system which has been tried and found to be little better than open voting? Yesterday Senator Millen was hungering for information with regard to corrupt practices in connexion with postal voting. I propose to give him some evidence. Anybody who has had experience of the postal vote would be very careful about supporting the reintroduction of it. I happened to be a candidate in Queensland at the only two State elections at which postal voting was permitted. At the two elections I was a candidate in different electorates, and they happened to be the constituencies in which postal voting was most abused. I claim, therefore, to be in a position to point out some of the possibilities of the system. I shall not enter elaborately into details now. An opportunity will possibly be afforded on another occasion if ever the socalled Electoral Amendment Bill reaches the Senate. But I may say that I found that after the issue of the writ .every day was a polling day, and every house was a polling booth. The secrecy of the ballot was grossly violated. What is worse, a reign of terror prevailed throughout Queensland. In Charters Towers the mine managers called at the houses of the miners working under them, and induced their wives to vote for their party under the grossest, vilest forms of intimidation. Our opponents talked about the postal vote being of great convenience to country people. What was the experience in Queensland ? At the 1907 elections, nine town electorates polled more postal votes than the whole of the rest of the State put together, and in 1908 the town electorates polled 13,615 postal votes against 7,009 polled in the whole of the rest of the country. The people of Queensland became so disgusted with the system, after a fair trial at two elections, that they immediately demanded its repeal.

There is no harm in correcting the honorable senator when he gets off the right path. We are told that if the postal vote is not reintroduced the women of Australia will be seriously handicapped. Is there anything in that argument? All the evidence proves the contrary. Here is some evidence which may emphasize the j>oint. At an election, when there was no postal voting in Australia namely, at the last election a higher percentage of women voted than ever before. I will give the figures. In 1903, at the first election under postal voting, 39.96 females voted. At the election of 1906, the percentage of females voting was 43.30; at the election of 1910, the percentage was 56.17; but at the last election, when there was no postal voting, the percentage of females who voted was 69.71. It might be contended by our opponents that, of course, the women voted at the recent election in a higher ratio because of the greater excitement that prevailed. That may be true, but it does not alter the facts, because we find that there was a smaller percental difference between the number of women and of men who voted at the last election than at any previous election. In 1903, there was a difference of 13.13 between males and females who voted. In 1906 there was a difference of 13.08 per cent. In 1910 the difference was 11.41 per cent., and at the last election, when the postal vote was not used and when this alleged handicap was supposed to be imposed upon the women in consequence, the difference between males and females voting was only 7.51 per cent. These figures clearly prove that there is nothing in the contention that the Labour party seek to handicap or harass women in their efforts to record their votes. I will want to have very strong evidence submitted to me that no corrupt practices will be possible before I give a vote for any system of postal voting.

I wish to deal now with another portion of the Ministerial statement, containing their proposal for the exclusion from preference of unions and unionists who subscribe to political funds, and their proposal to deprive the rural workers of the benefits of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Three things are aimed at here, with one end in view. The Government propose, if they can achieve their desire, the smashing up of unionism. They want to water down the little preference which unionists have, and they wish to exclude altogether from preference unions that take part in politics, and to deprive rural workers of the benefits of conciliation and arbitration.

Moreover, the fact of the nonexistence of the complex problems and organizations of older countries rendered initial legislation comparatively easy. Hence rapid changes in laws regulating industry occur, and are likely to occur. To a great extent the trades unions were responsible for these laws. They steadily and continuously urged an amelioration of the condition of the working man, and by organization and discipline they presented a united front to opposing forces, and attained many advantages by a recognition of the principle that unity is strength. Their efforts have resulted in improved conditions. Particularly shorter hours, a healthier mode of life, and safeguarding against accident. One great aim of presentday industrial legislation has been said to be to extend !: the reasonable comforts of a civilized community  to those engaged in every branch of industry. The standard of wages must, therefore, be maintained at a satisfactory level. Large organizations have been able to attain their ends by force of numbers, and, in the case of the great bulk of the artisan and similar classes, through the solidarity of their unions. The smaller and less perfectly organized industries, unable to maintain an effectual struggle with hope of success, are now receiving, by legislative enactment, the benefits already gained by the trades unions.

Owing to the efforts of unionists, we can today boast of shorter hours and better wages, with the result that the people are better housed, better clothed, and better fed. They have more time for recreation and for education; and this has resulted in benefit, not only to one class, but to every class in the community. Because of his better housing and clothing, and his higher education, the worker has been made a more efficient man, and the productivity of labour, has thereby been greatly increased. Apart from this, by these laws we have treated the working classes as men and women. We have demanded that they shall be treated as human beings; and, in treating them thus, not they alone, but the whole community lias profited. This Parliament, in passing the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, submitted the strongest argument possible in favour of preference to unionism. This Parliament recognised that arbitration was impossible without unionism, and, in proof of that, we find that unions alone can register under the Act. Therefore, as unionism has made arbitration possible, and arbitration has made industrial peace possible, I claim that unionists have an undoubted and indisputable right to preference. This is an age of combination. Capital is organizing its forces as it never did before, and Labour is compelled to organize its forces to save itself from the rapacity of capital. We find that the Conciliation and Arbitration Act of the Commonwealth and the measures passed to promote industrial peace in the different States all demand that unionists shall obey the law. On the other hand, no restraint whatever is imposed upon the nonunionists. Seeing that the unionist is supposed to obey the law, and that the nonunionist may utterly disregard it, and, without responsibility or penalty, may do what he pleases to upset every effort which unionism makes for the improvement of the condition of the people, surely the unionist, who has to obey the law, and is prepared to submit to it and to abide by the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, is entitled to some form of preference. The only thing I can see in the programme of the Government is a proposal to give preference to  scabs. That is the only alternative to preference to unionists, and it is the inexorable logic of the position the Government have assumed . They propose to give preference to  scabs, and to deny preference to the unionists, who are entitled to it. Then they tell us that because a unionist subscribes to political funds he is to be deprived of preference, and by this means they seek to divorce political and industrial unionism. Why, they might as well attempt to wipe out unionism altogether, to wipe out the Labour movement, as attempt to bring about this divorce at the present time. Political unionism and industrial unionism were married long ago, and the offspring of that alliance has been the Labour movement the grandest movement on earth and it will take something more than the Cook Government to bring about divorce. The Government are quite well aware, and any man who knows anything about the great Labour movement today must realize, that unionism without politics is a thing of the dead past. It has long since been discarded by every leader of note in the Labour movement throughout the civilized world, and it is simply because the Government know that these two forces are inseparable that they try to strike this vindictive blow at the great Labour movement. Honorable senators will all remember, as I think Senator McGregor recalled yesterday, that in the early nineties, during the great maritime strike and during the great shearersstrike, when our opponents were telling the soldiers to. aim low and lay the unionists out, we were advised to adopt constitutional means in order to achieve our ends. Well, we did adopt constitutional means. Unionism caine to the conclusion, and rightly, I think, that they should seek State intervention for the settlement of their grievances, and as that implied the passing of industrial legislation, unionists rightly concluded that they should be represented in Parliament. Thus started the great Labour movement in Australia. It has grown in every State _ in the Commonwealth. In every State Parliament a great  Labour party lias arisen. It has been the dominant factor in many States, and certainly it has been the dominant factor in the entire Commonwealth, for ,it has ruled Australia through this Parliament during the last three years. Because our opponents realize this, because they have recognised the growth of the power and influence of this great movement, they now seek to destroy it. Why sir, they might as well try to do what an historical old lady tried to do long years ago, to brush back the tide, as to brush back the onrush of Democracy. Political unionism and industrial unionism are inseparably connected : the man who injures one injures both, and now that the Government have thrown down the gauntlet, and sought to destroy unionism, they will find that the great machinery of the Labour movement will be brought into play for the protection of unionism. I am quite sure that every member of our party will use every means in his power to defend the great Labour movement, to defend the great industrial unionist movement, to defend the brave men who, by their selfsacrificing efforts, have made it possible to have a Labour movement at all. The Cook Government have reckoned without their hosts, believe me, in making this unnecessary onslaught upon industrial unionism. But, perhaps, the cruellest effort of all is their attempt to ostracize the rural workers. Why in the name of fair play should this great body of workers be politically and industrially ostracized 1 If it is good that preference should apply to one industry, why should it not apply to all industries? If the principle is good, why should it not be extended? The bush worker is undoubtedly amongst the best class of our workers. He has more to put up with than have any other workers. But for the hardy bush workers the men who have developed our great primary industries Australia would not be the prosperous country it is today. It is an unfair thing that the bush workers should be forced to resort to the cruel, obsolete, barbarous method of the strike, because thai is all that is to be left to them. If they are to be denied preference, if they are to be deprived of the benefit of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, what more will be left than theobsolete method of the strike, with the terrible sacrifices which it involves? We hear a constant wail from our opponents a wail, perhaps, which has some justification in ii that the trend of population in Australia is towards the cities, to the impoverishment of the country. Is this proposed measure of the Government calculated to improve that condition of affairs ? Hardly ! If the bush worker of the future considers himself unduly handicapped, as he undoubtedly will be if the Bill is ever {sassed, then he will wend from the country towards the city to the detriment of Australia as a whole, and to the detriment of the men whom it is sought by the Bill to benefit, because, if the workers come into the towns, there will be a scarcity of labour in the country, and the farmer himself the man whom they pretend to help will be the very first to feel the pinch of the proposed amendment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. There is one aspect of this question which I would like to submit for the consideration of the Senate. When a protective Tariff was before this Parliament, the workers, through their representatives, cheerfully voted for Protection for rural industries the same as for any others. I hold in my hand a list which I can read, if necessary, showing where the great products of the rural districts have been, protected by this Parliament in the interests of those engaged in rural industries. If the workers of Australia, through their representatives, have been quite prepared to make the sacrifice of paying higher rates for the necessaries of life in order to protect the rural industries, is it not a fair proposition that, in return, they should be afforded at least the protection of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act? Again, scores of millions of money have been expended in the various States in building railways for the opening up and development of the rural industries, and for the enhancement of the value of the lands of the farmers. The workers, as well as every other section of the community, are paying their share of the interest on that money. Yet the worker, who has to pay from the miserable pittance he receives towards the interest on the money that has been expended in improving the holdings of the men engaged in rural industries, is to be denied the bare justice of being able to apply to the Arbitration Court for an improvement in his condition. Already in this  Parliament in the other House an Agricultural Bureau Bill, has been introduced, and, of course, it will involve a great expenditure, and rightly so. I believe in doing everything we can to develop all our rural industries, and, therefore, I am quite favorable to the expenditure of the money involved in the establishment of an Agricultural Bureau. The workers of Australia will have to contribute towards that expenditure, in common with other classes in the community; yet they are going to be declared, under the proposed law, political, social, and industrial outcasts. A grosser injustice was never inflicted. It was never contemplated that any party would inflict such an injustice on any class of our citizens. Some of our representatives in another place, at all events seem to think they were sent to Parliament for the avowed purpose of representing the farmers. They are quite justified in representing the farmers by every means in their power, but I would remind them that there is another class in the community whom they are also expected to represent, and that is the employes in the farming industries. They should remember that they are sent to Parliament, not to represent one class in the community, but the whole of the community. I propose to say a few words on the socalled national insurance scheme of the Government, but perhaps I had better first read the paragraph on the subject in their statement 7.Inquiries are being made and material is being gathered necessary for the formulation of a comprehensive scheme of national insurance on a contributory basis, embracing sickness, accidents, maternity, widowhood, and unemployment. The maternity allowance is being claimed in a very large proportion of the total cases of birth, and the expenditure is likely to amount this year to about ^650,000. Ministers feel that the obligation of the public should be limited to proper provision for necessitous cases, and that nl] other cases would be better and more economically provided for by the scheme of national insurance, referred to in previous paragraph. Perhaps the most audacious attempt of the Government is that in which they seek to mutilate the Maternity Allowance Act. If in that Act the Labour party had discriminated between the rich and the poor as it is now proposed to do they would have been charged with having enacted class legislation. Indeed, our opponents might have gone further, and have charged us with having granted a preference to unionists. Now they are whining because £650,000 is to be paid this year by way of maternity grants a sum equal to the payment of £5 each to 130,000 mothers. Instead of this matter being one for regret, it ought to be an occasion for jubilation. If the people had not claimed the maternity grant, the present Government would have at once declared that they did not require it, and would have urged that as an excuse for the repeal of the Act. Now, however, that the money is being claimed, they affirm that the allowance should be granted only in necessitous circumstances. Truly we have an extraordinary Government in power. They are not content with tampering with the ballot, and with endeavouring to smash unionism. They now propose to make an onslaught on the mothers of Australia, and on the most humane and progressive piece of legislation which has ever been enacted by any Parliament a Statute which has exalted Australia and Australians in the eyes of the world. Yet the Government and their supporters pretend to be very solicitous about securing a vote for sick women. It is nothing short of hypocrisy for the Ministry to be prepared to afford facilities to women to vote while seeking to deprive them of the maternity allowance. I will undertake to say that the Maternity Allowance Act has brought light and happiness into thousands of homes, and has given thousands of women a better chance than they ever had before of surviving the most critical period of their lives. Coming to the question of unemployment insurance, I am of opinion that any scheme in that direction will need to be very carefully examined. I am prepared to assert that the scheme proposed by the Government is nothing short of a capitalistic device to fleece the workers of the little which they are already getting. Broadly speaking, unemployment is not so much the fault of the individual as of the community in fact, the community, and not the individual, is generally responsible for unemployment. As an instance of that, let me point to weather conditions. Droughts are responsible for very serious depressions, which lead to great unemployment. In some cases, floods, too, produce the same results. Then, again, inventions may dislocate certain industries and lead to unemployment. Even a change of fashion may lead to unemployment. In most cases, it is the community and not the individual, which is responsible for, and should bear the brunt of, unemployment. One writer has put the matter very concisely. He says","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESSINREPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[2]/continue[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

So long as the captains of industry are eager to obtain high profits, so long shall we have unemployment. When any commodity is selling at a high figure, the natural tendency is to produce that commodity as rapidly as possible. This leads to an abnormal demand for labour for the time being. That demand is succeeded by overproduction, and overproduction always leads to glut and to unemployment. Surely the individual cannot be held accountable for this, and yet he has to suffer. When this condition of affairs obtains, not only in one industry, but in several industries, a very acute situation arises, and the unfortunate worker, who has absolutely no control over these circumstances, is compelled to suffer. Then we have the everrecurring financial crises, and with them inevitably come unemployment. Today, the man who is in work is always anxious. He is ever in dread lest a sudden termination shall come to his employment, and the individual who is out of work occupies an even worse position. To him especially if he has a family the task of discovering where he can get employment is a positive nightmare. In most instances unemployment, therefore, is due to circumstances over which the workers have no control. Every fairminded man must admit that some alteration in these conditions is necessary. But it would be monstrous for any Parliament to seek to compel the workers of Australia to support our unemployed. In asking the workers to contribute to a system of national unemployment insurance, the Government would be asking them to subsidize a fund the avowed purpose of which is to maintain a surplusage of labour, which would always be ready to go to the rescue of the captains of industry. When there was a demand for labour, these men would be ready to rush in and spare the capitalistic brigands of industry the necessity of paying higher wages. It would be most unfair for the workers of this or any other country to be asked to pay tribute to any system of national unemployment insurance. Dr. Zacher, who was formerly an Imperial insurance officer in Germany one of the countries which has had more experience in national insurance than most others says ","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESSINREPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[2]/para[9]","N/A","N/A"

The nation being financially responsible for unemployment insurance, would seek to remove the cause of unemployment rather than to relieve unemployment. That is what we want.

Even if the system which I have suggested has some evils associated with it and I deny that it has any it would be a hundredfold better to adopt it and to avert this terrible social calamity than to go on as we are doing today. If we could but remove the causes of unemployment and the dreadful consequences of it, we would transform society. A properlyorganized community, in which everybody was employed, would enormously increase our standard of comfort and intelligence ; and, as an outcome of that, would enormously increase our efficiency and our productivity. It would pay a hundredfold the cost to the nation of sustaining an unemployment scheme out of the Consolidated Revenue. Confidence in the ability of men to secure permanent employment would enable our citizens, eagerly and willingly, to take on the duties of citizenship which our present accursed system forces them to abandon. The marriage rate today is a direct testimony to the uncertainty of employment among men. They are afraid to assume the responsibilities of citizenship because, under our present economic system, they are liable to be thrown on the scrapheap, and their families may be driven to want. But under the scheme which I have indicated, the marriage rate would be enormously increased, and the population statistics would, as a natural consequence, be increased. After all, what Australia wants more than anything else is population. We should secure it by this just and rational method of giving reasonable tenure of employment to our own citizens.

I may remind honorable senators that when a policy of obstruction was practised during the last session of the last Parliament, it was referred to by the supporters of the present Government and by their press as a great and effective protest on the part of the Liberal party against the methods and proposals of the Labour party. I have not the slightest desire to enter into anything in the nature of obstruction, but I am going to insist on my right as a member of the Senate and as a representative of Tasmania, to discuss all matters that come before us for consideration as fully and freely as I like, always providing, of course, that I conform to the rules of the Senate. Opposed to us today we have what I may term though it may seem harsh the miserable remnant of a discredited party, discredited because they have not had the courage to declare themselves to be what they really are. They claim to be Liberals, and they are not. They are Tories, but have not the courage to admit it. The result is that at the recent election that party, not representing fish, flesh, or good redherring, received the punishment that any set of men would deserve who deliberately set themselves the task of deceiving the people. When we look at honorable senators opposite, we realize all the sham and hypocrisy lying behind the claim that they have a majority in Parliament and a mandate from the country to control Commonwealth affairs. They make this statement, knowing as well as I do that their party in the Commonwealth Parliament is in a minority of twentyone.

I appeal to the Government to take some action in the matter which will relieve that gentleman of the charge that he was deliberately hanging up the return for the Hume electorate in order that the late Government might draw a few pounds more of public money. I wish now to come to the interesting document which is termed the policy of th present Government. The one thing that stands out very prominently in the memorandum of the Government policy is the declaration to do away with preference to unionists. There is a qualification that they are going to destroy preference to unionists in the case of unions that are not strong enough to secure preference for themselves. Wherever there is an industrial organization or union which, because of its numbers and financial standing, is unable to secure preference for itself, the political party led by the present Prime Minister is going to deprive it of preference. Preference to unionists is good or bad in principle. If it is good, there is no reason why its benefits should not be extended to every section of the industrial community. If it is bad in principle, there can be no justification for extending it to any section. If the principle of preference to unionists is sound and the Government have, in effect, admitted that it is there can be no reason for limiting its operations, more especially when we remember that we in Australia have, thank God, advanced very much beyond the methods of industrial warfare adopted by other nations, and have, perhaps with some success, settled industrial disputes by referring the matter in controversy to a properlycon.stituted authority. Whatever faults and I admit it has some our Arbitration Act may have in the minds of our friends opposite, it is a thousand times better to settle the disputes by conciliation and arbitration than to revert to the method of settling disputes which recently characterized the outbreak in Dublin with the bayonet and the policemans bludgeon.

We believed that the best way to attain that object was by the establishment of a compulsory Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and that is our belief today. If our friends can recommend a safer or more expeditious process we shall be glad to hear of it. I do not hesitate for a moment to say that the qualification hedged round their declaration regarding preference to unionists would be removed entirely if there was any possibility of the Liberal party gaining strength at another election. But they know as well as we know that they are lucky indeed to be permitted to carry on with even the casting vote of their presiding officer as a result of the last election. We know that it was sheer apathy and indifference on the part of our electors that permitted such a thing to come about. Our supporters, with a knowledge of what that indifference has cost them still burning in their, minds, would welcome an early appeal to the country, but our friends opposite want to postpone the evil day of another appeal to the electors, in the hope that the electors will have forgotten all about what took place then. They can take the House of Representatives to the country tomorrow if they wish. If they were as anxious to get the verdict of the people as they profess to be, it is waiting for them tomorrow, or the next day, or as soon i>s they like to go. Let them go and get the verdict. They can accept my prophecy here and now that their control of the government of Australia would be terminated very quickly. Again I submit the proposition that preference to unionists is, in principle, the only means by which we can march towards that goal of industrial peace to which we are all looking forward. When we call upon an organization to surrender something we ought to be prepared to make some allowance to it in lieu of the sacrifice. Our honorable friends on the other side know that the members of an industrial organization, when they bind themselves under an award of the Arbitration Court, surrender absolutely the right to strike, and so dislocate the affairs of a particular industry or employer. The award of the Court is not, however, binding upon those workers who are not members of an industrial organization. Although they benefit by what has been done by the efforts of the industrial organization, they are not bound to respect the dictum of the Arbitration Court that no disorganization shall take place; and they can strike when they like, and so disorganize the business of an industry or their employers. When the members of an industrial organization are so hedged round with these conditions, as I believe they ought to be, so far as an industrial agreement is concerned; when there is no possibility of the men bettering the terms of their contract by a strike, some consideration ought to be given to them in the matter of preference. Again, may I point out that the Melbourne Age is very emphatically opposed to the action taken by the Government in that connexion. Probably the meanest and the most callous proposal of the Government is the one to exempt rural workers from the operation of the Arbitration Act. What a sop to Cerberus! Every one knows that it was from that quarter they obtained their support, and that in consequence of the great outcry they made quite recently about the rural workers log, they were bound to take some action. It does credit to their courage that they have attacked the weakest and most defenceless section of the industrial community. Senator Mullan dealt with this question most forcibly, and his remarks had the effect, I noticed, of making Ministers look very much ashamed of themselves. There is no doubt that the agricultural employes are the most sweated section of the community. Until the advent of the Labour Government they never had any opportunity or hope of getting their grievances redressed or their conditions regulated by a proper authority, and that right was extended to them by their inclusion within the scope of the Arbitration Act by the recent Labour Government. Here, again, we are faced with this proposition : if the principle of arbitration is good for certain industries, how can we deny its application to other industries? Why should the man in the factory, or the man in the mine, be specially catered for in the matter of industrial legislation, and why should his wretched and much more sweated brother in the agricultural districts be denied the benefit of that legislation? There can be no justification for the proposal of the Government, and here I am reminded of the Liberal platform, under the auspices of which Senator Bakhap was returned.

It is no exaggeration to say that on agricultural machinery alone last year the men on the land throughout the Commonwealth had to pay unfair toll, to the amount of £1,000,000. That is no mere party statement, but one which can be supported by the report of the Royal Commission which specially investigated the matter. According to the evidence taken by that body strippers and harvesters could be sold for £50 apiece, and, after allowing for depreciation of plant, &c, would show a profit of 10 per cent, on the capital employed. But instead of the machines being sold for that sum, they were sold at from £75 to £80 each. As there were 8,700 of these machines sold in Australia in 1911, and an extortionate charge of £25 was made upon each of them, the farmers upon this one item alone were robbed of £217,000. The same monopoly has control of the seed drill business. This implement, it was ascertained by the same Commission, could be manufactured and sold at a substantial profit for £22. But a fair profit does not content the Trust which controls this particular machine. Instead of selling it at £22, they exacted for it £36 from the farmers of Australia. As there were 17,100 of these drills sold in 1911, the farmers were thus called upon to pay the Trust £239,400 more than they ought to have paid. If the overcharge on these two machines alone were equally divided between the farmers and the Trust, the former would have been able to pay their employes a better rate of wages, and, at the same time, would have made a bigger profit on their operations for the year. My honorable friends opposite have never gone to the length of explaining to the farmers of the Commonwealth that there is a Wheat Ring in Australia, and that by reason of its operations they lost on the crop for 1911 no less a sum than £625,000. This result was brought about by the manipulation of prices. In bindertwine a similar set of conditions obtains. Three or four years ago the man on the land could purchase his twine at a fixed price, but today, although the cost of producing this article is not one whit more than it was, he has to pay 25 per cent, more for it.

In the memorandum of Ministerial policy we are told that it is the intention of the Government to maintain the existing Tariff. For a brief period prior to the last election, and at intervals during the past three years, scathing articles appeared in the press denouncing the late Government for not having taken steps to remove Tariff anomalies, and to extend more effective Protection to a number of industries which were alleged to be languishing. I am a Protectionist up to the hilt up to the point of prohibition. I believe that everything that can be manufactured in Australia should be manufactured locally and that upon such articles we should impose such a high duty as would make it impossible for imported articles to compete with Australian production. I believe, further, that everything which we cannot produce locally should be admitted free. I was, and I am still an advocate of the doctrine of the new Protection. But I am loyal to the Leader of our party, Mr. Fisher, who, prior to the last elections, declared that if the verdict of the people was against the new Protection he would accept that verdict and proceed as early as possible, if returned to power, to extend to Australian industries that protection which the electors had directed him to extend to them. But what is the policy of the present Government? The Free Trade members of it know that they dare not move for a reduction of the duties upon some of the items of the present Tariff, whilst the Protectionists know that they dare not move for increased duties upon other items, although the existing duties do not afford our industries adequate protection.

This matter of the shipping and mail services has been brought more than once under the notice of the Government. Now that the seal of silence has been removed from the lips of the Government, we may expect the courtesy of a reply to the frequent questions on this subject asked by honorable senators on this side. How do the present Government propose to rescue Tasmania from under the heel of this monopoly ? If the newspapers correctly represent their views, the Government are going to enter into a contract with the Union Steamship Company for seven years, giving the company an increased subsidy. They propose to grant a subsidy which would enable the Commonwealth to pay interest on the cost of two new Loonyanas. The statement I am about to make is not presented for the purpose of giving offence to the party opposite. I say that it is not reasonable to expect that our friends are likely to take any action that is calculated to conflict with their own interests. By that I mean that many of them are more or less heavily interested in the shares of certain shipping companies. I am not finding any fault or suggesting that there is anything wrong or improper about that.

I say that in view of the fact that members of the party opposite are interested in concerns of that kind, it is unlikely that they will do anything to bring about the establishment of a Commonwealthowned line of steamers trading between the mainland and Tasmania. Members of the party, who, before this was mooted, perhaps, for many years held large interests in shipping companies, and who continue to hold those interests, cannot be expected to become enthusiastic over a Commonwealtliowned line of steamers to establish communication between the mainland and Tasmania. We are engaged in linking up the East with the West of Australia by a Commonwealth railway, and that is a perfectly proper thing for us to do. It is a necessary and natural corollary of that that we should link Tasmania with the mainland by a Commonwealth line of steamers, affording to our people a more rapid and less expensive service.
