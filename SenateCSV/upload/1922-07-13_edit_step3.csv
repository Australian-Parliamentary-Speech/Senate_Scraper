It is estimated by those in a position to judge that approximately 100,000 people in Australia are directly or indirectly concerned in the sugar industry. In addition to the actual growers of the cane, the number of which I gave last night, there are approximately forty sugar mills in which large sums of money have been invested, and I believe I am correct in saying that if the mills had to be replaced today the expenditure involved would be in the vicinity of £500,000. The sugar industry is in a very different position to other manufacturing concerns, inasmuch as the strain upon the plant during the crushing season is exceptionally heavy, and the result is that continual replacements have to be made, sometimes at considerable cost. During the recent visit of the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) and other members of the Federal Parliament, it was explained that certain portions of the plant have to be replaced once every season, whilst other parts have to be renewed less frequently. Moreover, a serious breakdown in the plant of a sugarmill involves very heavy expenditure. The Queensland sugar industry also provides a very excellent market for agricultural implements manufactured in the southern States.

These facts may appear insignificant to some, but they are of importance and must not be disregarded when the whole question is under review. There is also every a probability of power alcohol being manufactured on a large scale from molasses, which is a byproduct. Experiments recently made at the Bundaberg Distillery show that a greater mileage can be obtained from power alcohol than from benzine, and that there is less likelihood of carbon accumulating in the cylinders. At present the Department of Trade and Customs is actively cooperating with those engaged in the industry in completing arrangements for power alcohol to be profitably manufactured in Australia from molasses, which at present is not utilized in any way. The molasses are poured into the sea, and consequently become a waste product. That huge waste ought to stop, and. the molasses converted into something of benefit to Australia. By the introduction of power alcohol a very great benefit would be conferred both upon the sugar industry and upon Australia.

I intend to state the consumers case in due course, and Senator Wilson and Senator DrakeBrockman need not be concerned on that point. The agreement I am referring to is the last agreement entered into, when the price was raised from £21 to £30 6s. 8d. As a result of the agreement, and of the stabilizing of the industry, it has been possible for many of those engaged in the industry to build decent homes for themselves, instead of occupying humpies, which were their homes in the past. In some cases they have been able to erect houses for themselves, and they are living as white people should. They are in a part of Australia where every effort ought to be made to give white men and white women reasonable comfort. They are developing the tropical areas of north Queensland, and are entitled to better conditions than those who are living in the more genial climate of the south. They have been enabled to buy fertilizers to secure a better return from the land. The millers have been able to improve their plants by uptodate machinery, and as a result have got a greater return from the cane. The whole industry is being run on a more economical basis than before, and that has been brought about by its stabilization. Senator DrakeBrockman interjected some time ago, At whose expense? If Senator DrakeBrockman,Senator Wilson, and other carping critics who know very little of the subject they are talking about would take the trouble to find out what the worlds parity was for sugar when the Queensland growers were making sacrifices and selling it at 3½d. per lb., they would realize that Australia is still in the debt of the sugargrower.

They had this member gagged, and they bundled him out, neck and crop. I do not believe that this attitude reflects the true opinion of the people of Australia. I would give the majority of the people of Victoria and of the other States credit for being just as jealous of the interests of the sugar industry as citizens in the eastern States would be, say, of the wine industry in South Australia. I cannot imagine that the  rags  that constantly harp upon the sugar question represent the true views of the general community.  Now I come to the consumers point of view. Had it not been for the Queensland sugargrowers during the war period, instead of sugar being obtainable at 3½d. per lb., the price would have been more like1s. 3d. if the whole of that commodity had had to be imported. Many of the big manufacturing concerns built up a huge export trade during the war, and they did so only because of the fact that sugar was obtained from Queensland at a very much cheaper rate than it could have been got from other parts of the world. There were big overseas contracts, and the manufacturers profited because the Queensland growers did not demand worlds parity, but were patriotic enough to supply a cheap article in order that the large Imperial and other contracts which manufacturers in the south entered into might be carried out. Although the Queensland growers have played the game right through, many others, unfortunately, are not playing the game at present. The subjoined figures indicate how Australia would have fared between 1915 and 1921 if sugar had had to be purchased in foreign markets at worlds parity: Those figures are very striking, and show that there was a saving of £12,329,950 to the consumers through Australia having a sugar industry of its own. Apart from the actual saving to the community, there was a large amount of employment given, and manufacturers had the opportunity to accept large contracts for the hundred and one things for which sugar is required, enabling Australian products to be made more widely known abroad. Sugar is selling at 6d. per lb. today because, when the price was high a year or two ago, the Queensland production was not sufficient for Australian requirements, and the Government had to import sugar at a very high figure. If the Government had determined then to charge the consumer a fair price for the product, the people of Australia would have been obliged to pay from10d. to1s. per lb., and there would not have been the present overdraft in the sugar account which is responsible for the present prices, because it has to be wiped out. But, even under the renewed agreement, it will be possible, I understand, to provide sugar at a cheaper rate than at present, and also to insure that the overdraft shall be liquidated at no distant date. It must be remembered that in spite of statements to the contrary, the export trade is still being supplied with the cheapest sugar in the world, quality considered, and owing to the rebate principle, export business is not being injured in any way. My own opinion is that certain vested interests in Australia are endeavouring to use the Queensland sugar industry to force the fruitgrowers to accept unfair prices for their products. They are trying to pit the sugar industry against fruitgrowing without any justification whatever. Both are great primary industries; both are essential to the true development of the Commonwealth, and it is the act of a little Australian to endeavour to pit one against the other. I sincerely trust that honorable senators, during the time they may have at their disposal, will make themselves fully acquainted with all the conditions under which sugar is grown.","AddressinReply","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In spite of an agitation that is going on in certain quarters, I believe the majority of the people are sufficiently alive to the importance of the industry to realize that a renewal of the agreement will be in the interests of all concerned, and that this great primary industry is one that should be jealously guarded by the whole community.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","COX, Charles","JRT","N/A","N/A","N/A","374","Well,I appeal to those honorable senators who may have time at their disposal to have a look at Rabaul and the surrounding district. If they do so, I am sure they will be quite satisfied that everything is being carried on most satisfactorily. The authorities have cleaned out a number of men who were unsuitable for the work, and there are still a few Germans left who might well be got rid of. We have only had the mandate over Rabaul for about twelve months, and I think that General Wisdom and his staff have, during thai time, done very fine work. Theirs is an uphill task; but still they are doing splendidly. Frequently we hear the complaint that Government undertakings always fail. Very seldom do we hear anything about mistakes made by private enterprise. The Germans, who are supposed to be a very clever people, made a mistake in Rabaul some years ago. The planters established big plantations of Assam rubber, which has now grown to beautiful forests, so dense that it is almost impossible to see the sun through the trees; but, unfortunately, Assam rubber is not suitable for that class of country. It is worth only about twofifths of the price of Para rubber. If the Australians who are now in charge of the plantations are only left alone, I have no doubt as to their ultimate success. It is not advisable, however, that every returned soldier should endeavour to get hold of a plantation, because a fair amount of capital h required to work one of those properties. The prospective settler should know something of the conditions of the country, and, in addition, be equipped with sufficient capital. A cocoanut plantation takes from ten to twelve years to come into full bearing and during the whole of that time it must be kept absolutely clean. This is somewhat difficult because the variety of grass that grows there is injurious to the cocoanut tree. It has, however, been found that when the cocoanut trees are sufficiently grown cattle will eat this grass, and thrive fairly well on it, and they are now being introduced. It is believed that this will be found to be a means of getting rid of this grass.  I also visited Papua, or British New Guinea, and I may inform honorable senators that a bore has been sunk 1,200 feet in exploring for oil, and every one there seems very pleased at the prospect of striking real oil there in a very short period. It is as well that we should know that the Government have not been idle in this matter. The man in charge of the whole business is an Australian, and there are three Americans, who are specialists at the work, engaged in the actual drilling. The place at which they are now expecting to strike oil, Po Po, is about 100 miles from Port Moresby, and it is within 30 or 40 miles of Yuille Island, where there is a beautiful port, from which it can be shipped, if it should be obtained, in large quantities. I understand that there are good prospects of the discovery of oil in the late German New Guinea, at Eitape, also, and exploration for oil is going on there now. Speaking generally, the prospects of Papua at the present time are considered very bright. Copper has been found, and a good deal of money is being spent in recovering it; and I am informed that the industry is likely to be a big success. If oil and copper are discovered in payable quantities, Papua will be a wonderful asset for Australia.","AddressinReply","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It should be remembered that there are no big plantations in Papua, such as there are at Rabaul. Honorable senators must not run away with the idea that the whole of Papua, or British New Guinea, is fertile, easy country. It is very much broken, and there are only small plantations in pockets in different districts. When I was there a couple of men had gone over to Cairns to purchase a few small boats. The shipping difficulty there is to secure a sufficient number of small boats that can cross the little bars and navigate amongst the many small islands, in order to pick up a few tons of copra here and there. Papua at present is no place for big ships. There are ports at Yuille Island, Port Moresby, Samarai, and Mission. Entering the port at Mission is like entering through the door of the Senate chamber. The boat goes full steam ahead until it gets through the entrance, and then must go full steam astern, to avoid hitting the bank on the other side. When a vessel is turning in the port the chief officer is stationed at the bow and the second officer at the stern, and one is shouting to the captain to go full speed ahead, while the other is shouting to him to go full speed astern. Honorable senators may smile; but I am not exaggerating what takes place. There is deep water in the port, and a vessel is perfectly safe once it gets through the entrance. At Samarai, Port Moresby, and Yuille Island there is plenty of water for shipping. Copra is brought to Yuille Island, Port Moresby, and Samarai.. Samarai appears to me to be the real commercial centre of New Guinea.

The boats engaged in conveying copra to these ports are small sailing boats or oil launches, carrying only from 10 to 20 or 30 tons. So far as I could see, there is little inducement at present to put on bigger boats in the Papuan and New Guinea trade than are now being used. If copper mining is developed, and oil is struck, there will be a need for larger boats. While I was in Rabaul a sailing ship arrived that had been chartered by some people who were not satisfied with the terms and conditions under which they were previously getting their copra away. It took them a long time to load the vessel ; and I think they overestimated the quantity of copra they could get, and had some difficulty in filling the vessel. She was waiting there some weeks for a load. In the circumstances, I think that it would he just as well if people who speak of the lack of chipping facilities for Papua and New Guinea visited the Territory and saw for themselves what is taking place.  A good deal of pearlshell is being exported from Papua, and a fair amount of shell from which buttons are manufactured. Bechedemer and a little sandalwood and ebony are also exported.","AddressinReply","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Some complaint was made here concerning the treatment of a man whose leg was taken off, and I may inform honorable senators that the story I heard in New Guinea was that this man was clearing timber and a tree fell on him and broke his leg. The natives with him became frightened and ran away, leaving him for some days. When they came back they made some effort to get him out of his trouble, but he was 80 miles from any doctor, and it was five days before a doctor could see him. The doctor rushed up to the place prepared to look after the man, but when he got to him he found that blood poisoning and gangrene had set in, and that his case was hopeless. He told the man that there was no hope for him, and that he would die in a day or two, and that he would not operate on him.

Before some of us came into close touch with tilled Minister, we were inclined to believe that there was some truth in the vitriolic; comments published when he was selected by the Government to represent this portion of the British Empire at Washington; but those critics have been well and truly confounded by the admirable results achieved by the right honorable gentleman at that memorable gathering.  While congratulating the Minister, may I also express my appreciation of the policy which he has outlined in connexion with the development of the Northern Territory. Since the Commonwealth took over the Territory vast sums of money have been squandered in a vain endeavour to settle it, and grandiose schemes have been submitted from time to time, framed apparently in an endeavour to make it run before it walked, and to construct a Paradise without any foundations. The Minister has indicated that he intends to follow the policy that has been successful in. other portions of the Commonwealth. The whole history of Australia from its early settlement shows that first of all came the pastoralist, then the agriculturalist, then the cities, and lastly the secondary industries.","AddressinReply","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","DRAKEBROCKMAN, Edmund","JXP","N/A","N/A","N/A","377","That came in between. The policy outlined by the Minister is one that appears to be sound, and which does not aim at achieving results in five minutes. It has been formulated with the idea of providing a solid foundation for the future development of that great Territory, and of honouring the trust imposed in this Parliament.  Very closely associated with the work of the Minister for Home and Territories at Washington, and in a great measure in consequence of the admirable results attained, is the reformation and reorganizing of the Defence Forces of Australia. Let me say at once that I view with concern, and a certain amount of alarm, the reduction of the Defence Forces of this continent. The Defence vote last year was reduced by approximately £2,000,000 when there was a howl in many parte of Australia for economy ; but in my humble opinion the direction in which the Government exercised the most rigid economy is the one in which they should have shown the greatest caution. In consequence of the action of Parliament we have today a very much reduced Defence Force, both naval and military. The Military Forces have already been reduced, whilst the Naval Forces are in process of reduction. That brings me to the question of compensation proposed to be paid to those members of the Defence Forces who are being compulsorily retired. Honorable senators are aware that when it became necessary for the Minister for Defence (Mr. Greene) to act in accordance with the instructions of Parliament, he sent out a circular, the full text of which I shall not quote, although I have it before me. The circular letter sent out by the AdjutantGeneral stated that, subject to parliamentary ratification, payment of compensation would be made to compulsorily retired officers, warrant officers, noncommissioned officers, and men of the Permanent Military Forces of Australia, and all compulsorily retired officers, warrant officers, noncommissioned officers and men, in addition to any leave accruing to them under the regulations, should be paid as compensation one months salary for each year of service, subject to certain conditions. These, broadly speaking, are that the minimum compensation shall be £200 to any officer, and that to any warrant officer or noncommissioned officer six months pay, and to all other ranks three months pay. These are the proposals which the Government intend to place before Parliament and I trust that at least the amounts which the Government propose shall, in fact, be paid to those gentlemen. One of the weaknesses of a Democracy, excellent institution though it is, is the tendency to disregard the rights of small numbers, and to have too much regard for the voting power in the community, as well as insufficient consideration for absolute justice to public servants who have done valuable work in any capacity. I ask honorable senators to consider the position of these men, some of whom have been in the Service for over thirty years. I am informed that the average length of service of officers about to be retired is from fifteen to twenty years. Many of these men have devoted the whole of their lives in acquiring highly specialized professional training, which can be used only by the Commonwealth, because once they are out of the Service, there is no scope for the employment of the special training they have acquired. They are in the position of a prominent barrister who has lost his voice, and who, although he may possess the greatest skill and knowledge, his forensic ability cannot be applied. They can also be compared with a surgeon who becomes paralyzed, because all his knowledge would be of no avail unless he could employ his hands. That is the position of these highly trained professional men, who have devoted all their energies to the service of their country, and who are now to be turned adrift. I trust there will be no hesitation in granting to these men the compensation which the Government propose, and which Parliament will be asked to sanction. In this connexion, I desire to direct attention to similar action which is taking place in another part of the Empire. It has been found that, in India, the number of junior officers is largely in excess of immediate requirements, and consequently it has become necessary to retire a large number of them. The minimum that it is proposed to pay to any officer in Australia is £200. but the minimum that it is proposed to pay to any officer retired from the Indian Army is £850.","AddressinReply","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

They are still at that period of life when they can strike out in practically any direction, whereas the men who are being retired in Australia are mostly of advanced years. They are not in a position to strike out in a new direction, but are mostly saddled with great responsibilities. Many of them have wives and families, and they are being turned adrift to find new avenues of employment, after having devoted the whole of their lives to attaining a high,;i professional standard. There is now no opportunity of using the qualifications which they possess. I submit, therefore, that there should be no hesitation in granting to these men, at least, the sum proposed by the Government, but, on the contrary, I hope that the Government will be able to see their way to increase the amounts proposed.  I have not touched upon the question of the noncommissioned ranks, because the hardship to them is not so pressing. In the circular that was sent out it was stated that any man who cared to retire might do so voluntarily, subject to approval by the Military Board, under the conditions set out, and to financial arrangements being made by Parliament. It so happened that, in response to this invitation, more warrant and noncommissioned officers volunteered for retirement than were actually required for that purpose. They are mostly comparatively young men. . Unfortunately, die consequence of this request for voluntary retirement was not quite what was contemplated by the Government, and I believe I am correct in saying that, as a result of it, we have lost to the Australian Forces some of the best warrant and noncommissioned officers that we had. Had the Government insisted upon making their own selections and dispensing with those whom they thought should be retired, we could have got rid of a number of men whom we could well have spared, but the consequence of allowing voluntary retirement has been that we have lost the services of some of the most valuable warrant and noncommissioned officers that we had, and have retained a number of men whom those who know them would gladly have disposed of. In that respect I think the action taken by the Government has been rather unfortunate. Possibly they did not foresee I believe they did not that there would be such a large number of these junior grade men wanting to get out of the Service. Rhat brings me to another point. In the past in Australia we have had very little consideration for the claims of the commissioned ranks. That, I suppose, is due again to the fact that we are a Democracy, and are always thinking about votes. When we came to consider what gratuities should be paid to Australian soldiers at the end of the war, we apparently thought it democratic to place the chief commander of the Australian Imperial Force on exactly the same basis as his batman. £% John Monash was paid the same amount of gratuity as the batman at the Base Depot. The position is absurd. Either a man like Sir John Monash should have received no gratuity at all, or1 he should have been paid an amount similar to those paid in the British Army. While I am on the subject of that gentleman, I may mention that I have never been able to understand the official attitude towards him. Whether it was due to fear of him, or to the possibility of his coming into political prominence, I do not know ; but personally I have always thought that he has never been properly treated in this country. Possibly it is because he has never been properly appreciated in Australia. I believe that is more or less true.","AddressinReply","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I say deliberately, with a fairly .full knowledge of what I say and of the history of the war, that Sir John Monash was probably instrumental in saving a year of war to the world. We all know perfectly well that on 8th August, 1918, when the Australians first made their break through the German lines, plans were well advanced for the following years campaign, and even for the year after that. Nobody thought that the Allied Forces would succeed at that time in breaking down the German resistance. Probably the only man who really did think that anything of the sort might be done was Sir John Monash. He had worked out a new scheme of tactics. He had demonstrated in the battle of Hamel, by what we call leapfrog tactics, how it was possible to break through, consolidate, and keep possession of the full depth of the advance. Having demonstrated how it could be done, he then formulated a larger scheme, which was accepted by GeneralRawlinson and sent to the CommanderinChief. I believe the CommanderinChiefs reply was, Let them have a go at it. It cannot do any harm, anyhow. They did have a go at it, and the Australians and Canadians, working together, on the 8th August, 1918, smashed through 10 miles on the first day, to the amazement and surprise of the whole world. I was fortunately at the apex of that smash through, so I know how far they got. The immediate consequence of it was that the Generalissimo took advantage of the success, instead of waiting for the following year, when it was intended to make an attempt to break completely through. The following up of that success resulted, as we know, in the complete débâcle of the German armies. That was the work I put it very crudely, shortly, and broadly, perhaps of Sir John Monash. Success was, of course, made possible by the wonderful troops under his command, but nevertheless the idea was conceived by him, and the attack was carried out under his direction. How are we going to estimate the value of his services to Australia, to the Empire, and to the world? What recognition has ever been accorded to him in Australia? And yet, how can we reckon the money value of this accomplishment alone? Possibly he saved to the Empire hundreds of millions of pounds.

I have always felt intense resentment, as every other member of the Australian Imperial Force has, of the way in which our chief has been treated, and of the failure of the general public to appreciate the work he accomplished on behalf of Australia, the Empire, and the whole world.  It will be remembered that, when we first enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force, certain promises were made to all ranks that in the event of their being killed their dependants would receive certain pensions. The amounts promised in those days were fairly small, and in consequence of the increased cost of living many of them were subsequently, very properly, increased; but the relative amounts promised to the various ranks when the Australian Imperial Force was formed have not been maintained. The widow of a major today receives the sum that was originally promised to her, and the widow of a private gets a sum very nearly equal to the pension originally promised to a majors widow. J£ it was right and proper in the first place to differentiate between the amount to be paid to the widow of a major and a private respectively, the same relative difference should be preserved ; but that has not been done. Of course, people say that it is democratic to put them all on the same mark; but I think it is quite wrong. We who were on active service knew very well that the risks run by the private were altogether less than those to which the junior officer had to submit.","AddressinReply","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[14]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

On many occasions, when I offered promotion to men in the ranks to positions as commissioned officers, they declined, saying that, being married men with dependants at home, they could not afford to run the extra risk involved. Yet the pension for the widow of a junior commissioned officer has been kept the same, as that of the widow of a private. When the question of pensions comes up for revision, as I understand from the GovernorGenerals Speech it will, I hope the Government will consider the claim of these comparatively few people who have not a very large vote in the community. I trust that justice will be done to them, and less regard will be shown for the larger, and noisy, crowd, who possess many votes.  To return for a moment to the matter I, was dealing with when I was induced to , mention the name of Sir John Monash, 1 would like to point out, as I have done on other occasions, that it seems to me to be a fatal mistake to allow the very excellent staff we created and discovered during the war, to be dissipated. The very excellence of the Australian Imperial Force appears to me to be creating a danger for us today. The notion has got abroad that the brass hat is a person to be looked on with contempt, and that when we put an Australian into a uniform he at once becomes a complete and accomplished soldier. Another equally erroneous idea is that we can put a couple of red tabs upon an officer, and he at once becomes a complete and accomplished staff officer.","AddressinReply","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[15]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

A great many of them had been civilians in their ordinary avocations. They had not attained those qualifications merely by having red tabs placed on their uniforms ; it was the result of hard learning in a most difficult school. Seeing that we have all that knowledge in Australia, whatever we do let us keep together an efficient staff. Now we find that Parliament, in its wisdom, has said that the Defence vote has to be reduced, and there is an element in the community that would like to wipe out defence altogether. In response to the clamour of those who desire to wipe out the Defence vote, and of those who wish to reduce it almost out of sight, Parliament has been compelled to cut it down by £2,250,000. Consequently, many of these staff officers are being allowed to go. It is time the people of Australia put on their thinking caps, and called a halt. It is all very well to say that in the next war we will have the good old British Empire to keep the flag flying. It may not happen that way. We may walk right into trouble in the next war without being given twelve or eighteen months to build up the necessary staff of instructors. While I realize that there is nothing finer in the world than the Australian manhood, nobody can make soldiers out of them in five minutes. Yet the false notion exists that we only have to put a musket in an Australians hands to make him a complete and finished soldier.  While the Conference at Washington succeeded in reducing the navies of the world, it did not reduce the armies to any extent at all. There is no agreement between the Great Powers to lessen their armies. The agreement is merely one to limit the navies, but the relative strengths of those navies are retained, with this difference, that the dominating position of the British Navy which obtained some seven or eight years ago no longer exists. The Empire is in the same position under the Washington Agreement as another great nation so far as naval strength is concerned. The position, therefore, seems to me to be that, while we have reduced the navies, we have not altered the armies of the world, and Australias vulnerability has not been minimized. In fact, we are in exactly the same position as before. If armaments had been reduced to merely police or local requirements, I could have understood the feeling that seems to obsess Australia that we now require no defence at all; but since that is not the position, I cannot understand this demand to do away with defence in Australia. While the relative strength of the great nations is retained, it seems to me that Australias position, except for the honorable understanding that has been arrived at with regard to the Pacific, is as it was before, and any menace that may have existed prior to the Washington Conference is there still. Armies are not transported by fleets of battleships, but by fleets of transports. If it were possible under conditions that existed before the Washington Conference to threaten Australia, it is possible still to threaten this country. In any event, the Naval Agreement will last only for ten years at the longest.","AddressinReply","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[19]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The cost of producing rubber I have obtained my information from the Demara Rubber Company, which honorable senators will please understand is one of the largest plantations in Papua is 9½d. per lb., f.o.b., Port Moresby, and the cost of transhipment to Sydney is another 2d.,making the landed cost in Sydney11½d., whereas the latest Sydney quotation, that is worlds parity, is only 7¾d. Now that is the position of the rubbergrowers. I remind the Senate that a large number of plantations has been established in Papua at the instigation of the Commonwealth Government, and that we are also concerned about the future of. a large number of plantations established in exGerman New Guinea by German planters prior to the war. It is impossible, in the face of the figures I have quoted, for these plantations to continue operations unless the planters get some relief somewhere and somehow, because no industry can go on producing an article at11½d. per lb., and selling it for 7¾d. per lb. The figures dealing with rubber production in Papua are rather interesting. I cannot speak for the rest of the islands, because the details are not available to me. In 1919 Papua exported 207 tons, valued at £33,000; in 1920 242 tons, valued at £41,000, and in 1921, 255 tons, a very considerable increase, valued at only £1,850. Now that is part of the position. Last year we imported into Australia rubber goods to the value of £511,000, and the previous year goods to the value of £240,000. The entire production of Papua and New Guinea could be used in Australia. We are committed to a policy of Protection, and yet we give no protection whatever to the rubber industry of Papua, which as I have already stated was established at the instigation of the Government.

Owing to the limitations imposed by our Navigation Act, planters are forced to send their products to Sydney before they can be transhipped elsewhere. But that is not the whole of the trouble. The principal foodstuff of the Islands is rice, which comes from China, and again the unfortunate consumer of the product is obliged to see ships carrying his rice go right past his door, so to speak, down to Sydney, and then the product is transhipped back to Port Moresby, or elsewhere in the Islands, all of which means additional cost to him. That is one illustration of the unfortunate effects upon Australia of the operation of the Navigation Act. The Dutch packets that sail right past Port Moresby are not allowed to take the rice that is required there into that port, but must bring it on to Sydney. Brums, Philp, and Company in due course pick it up at Sydney and take it back to Port Moresby, and the people of Papua have to pay the freight from Port Moresby down to Sydney, and from Sydney back again to Port Moresby, because exemptions are not granted to ships visiting Papua from the restrictions imposed by the Navigation Act.","AddressinReply","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[26]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If copra could be shipped direct to England its production would be quite a profitable industry even at present reduced prices, but it is not a paying proposition because it has to be sent from New Guinea to Sydney, and thence to Great Britain, or wherever else it is required.  To give a further illustration of the misfortunes of the people of Australia because of the iniquitous legislation of the Navigation Act, let me inform honorable senators that, whilst maize coming here from South Africa has to pay a freight of 22s. 6d. per ton, maize coming from Cairns to Melbourne has to pay a freight of 40s. per ton. Sugar pays a freight of 25s. per ton from Cairns to Melbourne, and sugar brought from Java to Melbourne pays a freight of only 15s. per ton. These are some of the anomalies due to the monopolies created on the coast of Australia through the existence of the Navigation Act. I wish now to say a word or two on industrial matters, but before referring to industrial matters proper I should like to make some comment on the recent appointments to the Arbitration Court. I do not, of course, propose to criticise either of the two gentlemen recently appointed to the Court. Such action would be highly improper on my part, and would rightly be prevented by the President. But I will say that in my view it is a. great mistake to appoint men to the position of Judges for a term of years. The high standard that has always obtained in British Courts of Justice is due in a very great measure to the fact that the Judges are appointed during good behaviour and for the term of their usefulness, and can only be removed, speaking generally, for improper behaviour, and even then only by a resolution of both Houses of Parliament. Men even when they obtain the high position of Judges are still human beings, and if we are to; appoint men to the Judiciary in Australia for a term of years, we shall run serious risks. The men so appointed may possess all the necessary qualifications, and be excellent persons for such positions, but they will still be men, and whether they actually depart from the high moral standard that has always characterized the Judiciary in Australia, or whether they do not, it will always be said by interested parties that they do depart from it. It will be said, rightly or wrongly, that men in such positions whose term of office is drawing to a close will be calculating upon who is in power, or who is going to be in power, or whom it is necessary they should please with their various judgments.","AddressinReply","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[27]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I wish to say, with regard to the Arbitration Court, that, in my opinion, arbitration has been a failure in Australia. Honorable senators will remember that when arbitration was first introduced by men of the high calibre and standing of the late Mr. Deakin and the late Mr. Kingston, it was promised that we would witness a new era in which  sweet reasonableness ,! would take the place of force. That promise, has not been realized. Instead of having the industrial peace which was promised us as the result of the introduction, of arbitration, we find that between the years 1913 and 1920 in New .South Wales alone, there were over 2,000 strikes, involving a loss of about 11,500,000 working days. That occurred under the arbitration system that obtains here today. In the Commonwealth during the same period there were over 3,000 strikes, involving over 900,000 working people and resulting in a loss of 17,200,000 working days. If that could happen during the period referred to, how can it be said that the system of arbitration in Australia is anything but a complete failure ? There are more industrial disputes and there is more industrial unrest in Australia than in any other part of the world. Let us compare our position in this regard with that of Canada. For every fortyfour industrial disputes that take place in Canada, there are 400 in Australia. In Canada there are no industrial tribunals such as we have here. The various industries are there allowed to work out their own salvation, and employers and employees are not interfered with in the same way as they are here. Arbitration was introduced in Australia to eliminate industrial disputes. They were to be brought before the Arbitration Court, and  sweet reasonableness was to prevail.

In New Zealand, in a period of great prosperity, they had no strikes, but when that period came to an end they began to have strikes; and if Mr. Seddon, who boasted continuously that New Zealand was a country in which there were no strikes because of their industrial system, had lived long enough, he would have realized that New Zealand under its industrial system is a place in which there are more strikes than in any other country in the world, with the exception of Australia.  Let me go back to the Constitution. The framers of the Constitution desired that industrial enterprises extending beyond the boundaries of any one State should be dealt with by the Commonwealth, and that purely State industries should be dealt with by the various State Parliaments. That would be a very desirable condition of affaire, but under the interpretation given to the Constitution by the High Court of Australia it has been possible for every industry in the Commonwealth to artificially manufacture an InterState dispute. Consequently, by a paper warfare, if I may use the expression, it is possible to bring before the Federal Arbitration Court every industry in Australia. That was never contemplated by the framers of the Constitution. They intended that such industries as shipping and shearing should come under the jurisdiction of Federal Arbitration Courts, but that other matters should be left to the control of the States. At present, the States are able to legislate with regard to all these matters, and so also is the Commonwealth, and the consequence is that throughout Australia we have this wretched overlapping of awards in practically every State, and industrial harmony under such conditions is practically impossible. We find the workers in one trade in, say, New South Wales, ignoring the State Court and manufacturing an InterState dispute in order to get a Federal award. If they are not satisfied with that they revert to the local tribunal.","AddressinReply","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[35]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I believe that when he made that statement he was quite correct, and that, unlike a good many of the utterances that come from Queensland representatives in connexion with the sugar question, it was not a mere half truth. I do not intend at this juncture to condemn the Sugar Agreement, because I am not going to pass judgment on incomplete information. The people of Queensland and Victoria are in the same position. They have both given judgments, and those judgments are based on incomplete, if not false, premises. If one is to believe the information obtained from the press, the taxation that is going to be paid by the rest of Australia for the benefit of the sugargrowers in Queensland will amount to no less a sum than £6,000,000. If that be true I am not sure whether it is true or not, but it is one of the things stated in the press in Victoria then it is too much to pay to one section in the community.

They have been prejudicing the position without giving us the complete facts, and without even knowing the complete facts themselves. Because they are making such a loud noise about it, and penetrating peaceful meetings of Melbournes housewives, I am inclined to think that possibly there is some truth in the assertions that are being made by the housewives. Certainly they are paying more for the privilege of using Queensland sugar than they would have to pay if there were no Queensland sugar industry. I am not going to say that the price is too large, if it be true, as has been asserted, that we have to pay it in order to maintain a White Australia. But I want to know what the true facts are. I do not want to pay, and I do not want, my State to have to pay, a large sum of money to a privileged few in any portion of the Commonwealth.

They pay very heavily under this wretched Tariff that now operates for the benefit of manufacturers in Victoria, and for the privilege of using Queensland bananas.

I desire to associate myself with the paragraph in the GovernorGenerals Speech expressing sympathy with those who have been bereaved since the Senate last met. I congratulate the Minister for Repatriation (Senator E. D. Millen) on having, to a great extent, regained his health, and on having reappeared in good fighting form. As a young member I am ready to recognise the great assistance I have received from him from time to time, and I hope he will long remain Leader of the Senate.  I did not feel able, at the time of the selection of the Minister for Home and Territories (Senator Pearce) to represent Australia at the Washington Conference, to congratulate him, but I now realize that it was one of those occasions when I have been in error. I freely admit it, because one who does not make mistakes seldom does anything. I wish to state that, having been put to the test, Senator Pearce was not found wanting. From what one can learn from the press and from general comments on his achievements at the Conference, the record is, indeed, complimentary to him. I was somewhat disappointed that Senator Russell left the Ministry. I received all possible assistance from him when I entered the Chamber as a new member. Last session his duties were altogether too much for any individual senator. He carried the burden of the Tariff, after which Bills were shot into this Chamber like peas out of a pod, and it was impossible for any honorable senator to make himself familiar with all the measures. I again protest against such hurried legislation. If we are to be of service to the community it is our duty to make ourselves conversant with the measures upon which we have to vote. There were so many Bills put through at the end of last session that the messenger could not walk rapidly enough in handing them up; he had to run. I congratulate my friend Senator Earle upon his elevation to Ministerial office, but I cannot congratulate the country. There is nothing personal in that remark. I cannot look with pleasure on a Ministerial position  being given to one whom we have learned to regard as the high priest of Protection. I would have liked to see somebody else given the position, so that the producers would have had a friend at court rather than a man who would .put further burdens upon them.

When a certain statement was made yesterday by my friend Senator Lynch, I looked around the Chamber to see if any one had burst out laughing. He said that the Senate was not a party House. A mistake was made in the first instance in having the same franchise for the Senate as for the other Chamber, but that is the settled law of Australia, and the error has been intensified by virtually wiping out the very principle for which the Senate was called into existence. I refer to the attendance of senators at party meetings. Members of this Chamber are sent here largely to protect the smaller States. It was recently stated by Senator Thomas that New South Wales looked for the time when it could alter the Constitution in regard to the representation of the States. I would like to utter a word of warning to the senators coming from the smaller States that they should take care to protect their rights and privileges as senators. The Senate serves a very useful purpose, but if representation is to be granted on a population basis, the sooner this Chamber is abolished the better. It would be a deplorable thing if this Chamber were to be controlled on the same party lines as apply in the other House. Today there is a huge majority in favour of the Hughes Administration. We have to remember that another party may be in power in the future, although I hope that day is far off.

Unfortunately, like the poor, we shall always have the unemployable, and, in order to distinguish the unemployable from the unemployed, I may inform honorable senators that during the recess I took advantage of an opportunity to make myself conversant with the large production areas in New South Wales and Queensland. I was at Rockhampton on one occasion inquiring into the prospects of the cotton industry, which is being established in Queensland. A grower, who had 22 acres under cultivation, told me that there were plenty of men about, but, unfortunately, they would not work. When I inquired the reason, he said that they would not work so long as they could line up at the bureau and get a few shillings per day from the Government to keep them. And so I say that while we may have the unemployable Avith us, we still want immigrants of the right type ; people who will be prepared to produce and not accept food without working for it, as so many are doing today in some portions of the Commonwealth. I absolutely object to custodians of the public purse in any circumstances feeding people, instead of giving them work to do. The necessity for charity is, at all times, deplorable, but it is quite another thing to feed men who will not work.","AddressinReply","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Senator DrakeBrockman had something to say concerning the EastWest railway. Unfortunately, the Commonwealth Government are in an unfavorable position in regard to that line. The railway traverses some of the finest bush pastoral areas in the Commonwealth. Some of the stationowners are doing very well, indeed, but with one lessee holding 2,000,000 acres of land along the line and with other large areas in single holdings, the financial position of the railway must be unsatisfactory. Within the last ten days a gentleman interested in that part of the country informed me that he had a look over one of these properties which had been bought five years ago, and upon which a considerable sum had been spent by way of improvements. After riding round the station, and noting all the improvements, he informed the lessee that if the improvements had been put in one corner of the station the lessee would have had a decent property, but, as matters stood, the station was too big to be properly handled. This is a matter which the Commonwealth Government should look into, and, if possible, rectify, in order that, by a more satisfactory development of these pastoral areas, the burden of the Commonwealth taxpayer in connexion with the EastWest railway may be lightened. The station to which I refer, which comprises 2,000,000 acres, would, if properly subdivided, carry at least forty small pastoralists, all of whom, I am sure, could do well upon that class of country. The railway owned by the Commonwealth runs through State properties, but the State Governments as a rule are not prepared to assist the Commonwealth in the matter of subdividing lands.","AddressinReply","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The creation of important and costly positions is becoming a serious matter for the Commonwealth. As Senator Fairbairn very forcibly put it, if we look through the GovernorGenerals Opening Speech we shall find proposals submitted for the appointment of Board after Board in almost every Department. I believe in the system of having a man at the helm with some responsibility. If the man at the head of a Department cannot fill his job he should be kicked out. The trouble in the Public Service is that men because of seniority are appointed to important positions, and no matter what sort of duds they may be, they stay there until they are sixtyfive years of age. My contention is that we must have efficient men in charge of our Departments, whether in Great Britain, the United States of America, or here. Ministers must have good men at the helm in their various Departments. I am not so foolish as to expect that the Minister for Repatriation (Senator E. D. Millen) shall be able to inform me concerning the details of every branch of his Department, and tell me how every penny is spent. That is not his duty.

I hope that good business men will be appointed to represent Australia as Commissioners, and that their appointment will not involve the creation of expensive establishments. We require markets for our produce. Australia has wonderful resources. We have the goods, and I am a believer in dressing the shop window. It is folly for a man to pay a big rent in a main street and not to take the trouble to dress his windows. We want men to go to various parts of the world to push the consumption of Australian goods. If that were done, we should be making progress in the Eastern markets which we are not making today.  Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. In regard to the question of taxation, it is very disheartening to realize that there is not to be any reduction, and I trust that every economy possible will be exercised, so that the heavy burden that is being carried by many will be considerably lessened. One is often surprised at things done in the administration of the Departments, and I now wish to direct particular attention to the action of the Government in connexion with the issue of passports to oversea travellers. In addition to procuring a passport, there are other regulations which have to be complied with.","AddressinReply","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue[25]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

All the proceeds have been donated to patriotic and charitable funds, and, notwithstanding this, the band is called upon to submit a return to the Department.  Before concluding, I desire to refer to the Committee appointed by Parliament to inquire into a proposed agreement between the Commonwealth and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. As a member of that Committee, I was astonished to see a minority report issued by the honorable member for. Batman (Mr. Brennan), who was a member of the Committee. The members of the Committee exhaustively considered the proposed agreement. We are all deeply grateful to Senator John D. Millen for the services he rendered. His technical knowledge and general business ability were of great assistance to the Committee in coming to a decision. After the provisions of the proposed agreement had been threshed out, it was decided to appoint a subCommittee of three to prepare a report embodying the wishes of the whole Committee. The subCommittee of three consisted of Senator DrakeBrockman, Senator John D. Millen, and the honorable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan), and these three gentlemen prepared and submitted a report to the SolicitorGeneral (Sir Robert Garran) to be sure it was in order. It was then brought before the full Committee!, and adopted without a dissentient voice. The honorable member for Batman played his part in the preparation of the report, which is now in the possession of the Government. During our proceedings, I did not hear one discordant note, and it was with the greatest surprise that I read in the Victorian press some weeks afterwards the minority report of the honorable member for Batman. If that honorable member wished to voice his feelings for political or other purposes, he should not have adopted that attitude, which was unfair, misleading, and unjust to the other members of the Committee. If I am to be expected to serve on similar Committees in the future, I shall expect men to play the game.","AddressinReply","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I understand from the information submitted that an attempt will be made to make the lives of those who are living in country districts a great deal happier. I am not one of those who everlastingly refer to the hardships which some country people experience. I think that the average man in the country is happy, in spite of the everlasting speeches that we hear about the fearful, dreadful things that he has to put up with. I was at a meeting recently at which the first speaker said people were dying before they could get a doctor there. The next one said that the only novelty they got was listening to the wild dogs tearing carcasses to pieces by night. The next spoke of going to a place a few weeks previously where he saw a tworoomed tin house, with manure bags used for partitions, and where a poor little girl of fourteen had to cart water 9 miles in a temperature of 105 degrees. Yet they all came in together with the chorus,  Go on the land. I believe that the pioneer of the future must go through the same hardships as the pioneer of the past. If a man is going to reap the unearned increment on land, he must develop new country, and he cannot expect to be spoonfed by the community.  SenatorCrawford. People are objecting to unearned increment now. I am not doing so. I am only too ready to get a bit of it, if I have a chance. With regard to the question of railway gauges, I am one of those who believe that if it is to be tackled, and if the tackling of it is justified, the gauges should be made uniform throughout the whole of Australia. I will not agree with any policy that does not approach the problem in a big way. It should either be done properly, or left alone. I have heard that a sort of backdoor entry is to be made from New South Wales to Western Australia. I think that may come later, as a developmental railway; but to say that it is going to meet the requirements of the Commonwealth with regard to a uniform gauge is all rot. The main trunk lines should be unified first. I agree with the suggestion of the Royal Commission that we should have an independent director of works to see the affair through. He should have almost absolute control, and should employ his own staff. We have men in Australia who can tackle this big proposition, and I am sure that if we get hold of the right one, and work the thing on business lines, we can build the railway and accomplish what we are after at a much smaller cost even than is estimated in the report.","AddressinReply","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","WILSON, Reginald","KBJ","N/A","N/A","N/A","398","No. That is done by the Government. The official whose appointment I have suggested will be a construction director. It is not the intention of the Commonwealth Government to take over all the State railways. If they were to propose to do so they would have all the States against them at once, and that would be the end of the performance. The conversion to a uni form gauge can be done without inconvenience to the public where the 5ft. 3in. gauge is in use, by the addition of a third rail. The real difficulty will be in those States where the gauge will have to be increased. I am assured that between Melbourne and Albury a third rail could be put in and the points altered at a given date. Later, the third rail could be taken away and used for lighter traffic or for a third rail elsewhere. The remodelling of the rollingstock would, of course, have to be undertaken. All the facilities of the States could be used for this purpose, although it might be necessary to enlarge them. The Minister for Home and Territories (Senator Pearce) said it would be two or three years before they would be likely to get on with the work. I think so, too; but during the year we are in, and for the next year or two, it will be necessary to provide work in Australia. If the task is to be seriously undertaken, there is nothing to prevent the preparing of bridges and cuttings, and the undertaking of other big jobs which will not interfere with the existing rollingstock or traffic. If it is absolutely essential that we should have a uniform gauge, I certainly would start in the direction recommended by the Royal Commission. We do not want to build up a tremendous Civil Service, which, at the end of the job, we shall not know what to do with; but the men who are being turned out of other Departments might be used in this work.  Personally, I want to see the Commonwealth Government go out of all trading concerns. I have no two opinions about that. I have stated on the floor of this chamber, and I say it again, that it is not the function of the Government to trade, I am very pleased to see that we are getting rid of the woollen mills. I disagree with some of my friends on that matter, but I think the mills can be better managed under the personal direction and supervision of those who have put their money into them. That has always been a principle of successful business management, and always will be. I have heard it said that if it were not for the Commonwealth Government Shipping Line we should have to pay higher freights than we are paying today. I have heard that contention put forward by men who have more right to speak than I. As a matter of fact, however, it is the Commonwealth Government Line today that is keeping a lot of the worlds shipping away from Australia. When the Minister for Home and Territories (Senator Pearce) said yesterday that it was far better in the northern parts of Australia to subsidize private shipping companies than to run a Government line, I asked him whether that was not a principle with a general application. He said,  No, there is a difference. I agree that there is a difference, and the difference should be to get out of the Commonwealth Line altogether. The Government considers, apparently, that we cannot control in a domestic way one or two small ships on the coast of Australia, but that we can control a Line which trades all over the world. The Government was justified in entering into the shipping business; but today we have reached a point at which the sooner the Government clean their hands of trading and get down to the business of governing for the advantage of the people, the better. I shall do everything possible to get the Government out of all trading concerns. I come to the question of production. There are some misguided and misinformed people who are for ever criticising the Government unfairly. I claim to be at all times a critic of the Government, but I try at least to be reasonable and fair, and to give credit when it is earned. I have from time to time heard men who are connected with country interests, as I am, criticising the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) very severely for what he has done for the producer. In this connexion I am going to take the opportunity to read a resolution which was carried by one of the largest meetings of farmers ever held in South Australia, and which represented, I think, the largest organization of farmers in Australia. The resolution was moved by Mr. Price, of Paskeville, and seconded by Mr. T. Dunsford, of Upper North, I think.

Dunsford seconded, and, in a vigorous speech, supported the remarks made by Mr. Price, and eulogized Mr. Hughes services. The chairman said it gave him no small amount of pleasure to hear such a resolution moved and seconded from amongst the ranks of the farmers themselves. He thought the resolution might very well be,  That the thanks of the farmers assembled at the halfyearly meeting of the South Australian Farmers Cooperative Union Limited be tendered to the Prime Minister (Hon.

He could assure them that the success of a Pool rested very largely on the question of finance so that they could pay an advance which would enable the smaller farmers to carry on until such time as the wheat was sold.","AddressinReply","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/quote/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

Some people, for party reasons, feel that one has no right to say  Thank you  to anybody in politics unless one is sitting right in the same corner. I have a long way to go yet before I shall get into that position. I appreciate very much the assistance and help that the Government have , given to these Pools, including the Fruit Pool. I can assure the Government that, in my opinion, wheatgrowing is getting very expensive. The producers are finding it very difficult to carry their burdens, but they appreciate, nevertheless, all that has been done to make their produce as valuable as possible.  I wish to say another word about a matter that has been sadly neglected, namely, the breeding, producing, and exporting of pigs. It is startling to consider the figures relating to the consumption of pigs in other countries. In England, up to the end of 1919, £100,000,000 was paid for pigs and the products of pigs imported from different parts of the world. In 1921, Denmark exported no less than £18,000,000 worth of pig products to the United Kingdom. In 1916, the pigs in the Commonwealth represented a value of £1,006,763. In 1917, the value was £1,169,365; in 1918, £9,13,000; and in 1919 the amount had dwindled to £695,000. In the early days of the dairying industry it was felt by the States that some encouragement should be given to it, and an export bonus of1d. per lb. was granted. In 1918, all that was obtained for pig products exported from Australia mostly to Eastern countries was £419,000. Pig raising goes hand in hand with the dairying industry, and it is not too much to ask the Commonwealth Government to assist in building up a business that may be made quite as successful as the dairying industry by the granting of1d. per lb. on export pork.","AddressinReply","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/para[9]","N/A","N/A"

Why did not the honorable senator, to complete his argument, tell us how much the sugargrower of Queensland has been getting since the war in excess of the worlds parity for his product? A statement, such as he gave us, must be taken over a period of years with all the debits and credits entered to their respective accounts, and I feel justified in saying that having regard to all the circumstances the sugargrower in Queensland has not done badly in recent years. But I am a firm believer in Queensland. It is a great country. It possesses a wonderful soil, an ample rainfall, and in view of the possibilities in regard to cottongrowing, together with the sugar industry, its future is a very bright one. I want to say with no mistakable voice that whilst I am a member of this Parliament I intend to stand fast to the ideal of a White Australia, about which we have heard a good deal lately. In some quarters there is a disposition to point the finger of scorn at South Australia, but I say unhesitatingly that the white man is entitled to more wages, and will do a great deal more work than any coloured labour we can get here. The Commonwealth offers a great field for the white man who is prepared to work.  As for the Tariff, I indorse what Senator Lynch has said. When the Tariff was under discussion, one of the stock arguments was that we must do all we possibly could to assist the Newcastle steel industry. The Government had the numbers, and, accordingly, placed a very serious burden upon the producers of this country. It is estimated by those who are most competent to judge that the increased cost of a farm equipment, due to the higher duties levied, is anything from £150 to £200.","AddressinReply","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue[44]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We cannot prevent destruction by rabbits, because barbedwire is so costly. I may tell honorable senators that the last binder I purchased cost me £37 10s. cash. The same implement today costs something like £90. These are the prices which have to be paid by the young farmers who are engaged in production in this country today. What have the manufacturing industries gained as the result of the high Tariff? They have gained nothing, and this has, to some extent, been due to the fact that, to use an Australian term, the coalminers in Australia have for years been  on the pigs back. They have had both hands on the throat of the iron and steel manufacturing industries demanding anything they please for coal, and those industries have had to be closed down. I put it to the Government who are in office to increase production, and whose duty it is to do everything possible to assist production, as they have done in some instances, that in this case the high Tariff, passed with a view to stimulate production in the iron and steel industries, has resulted in closing them down. The Australian works are closed down, aid iron and steel has now to be imported, whilst 18 per cent. of the people of the Commonwealth are called upon to bear a huge burden of taxation which was imposed for the benefit of the iron and steel industries of this country.

The high Tariff wall was built to keep them going, but the demands of the coalminers have prevented it becoming effective, and our people have to import the materials necessary for the building of machinery. I say that, in the circumstances, the position must be seriously reviewed by the Senate and by the Government, otherwise the Government cannot claim that the Tariff represents anything but sectional taxation, which is unworthy of any Australian Government. We are always insisting that people should go out and develop the waste parts of Australia, but it should not be forgotten that the man who goes on to new country pays in respect of the machinery he must use three times as much taxation as the man occupying inside developed country, because the life of an agricultural machine in new and undeveloped country is not more than onethird of the life of a similar machine in developed country. The life of a binder used in the middle north of South Australia is at least four times as long as if it were used in rough country. The men in Australia engaged in developing new areas are, therefore, carrying a huge burden of taxation which was imposed for the benefit of the secondary industries, and I ask the Government now in the name of fair play to review the Tariff in such a way that justice may be done to the men who are doing so much for Australia.  I have something now to say with regard to Canberra. I visited the place with Senator John D. Millen. It is of no use to say one thing and mean another, and I frankly admit that I went up there prejudiced against the building of the Federal Capital. I had spoken several times against expenditure there. I say that now I see absolutely no necessity at this time for that place. I saw something of the great works to be done there. Apparently, we cannot carry out our obligations to the returned soldiers, but we can spend money at Canberra. What did I find there?The first place we visited was the powerhouse.

I am reminded that my friend and I had an hour or two to spare, and thought we would have a look at the dear old church at Canberra. We did so, and then decided to have a look at the tombstones, and see whether we might learn anything from them. In the northeast corner of the little cemetery we discovered a very old tombstone of sandstone. The name on it was Sarah Webb, and the date 1856. The inscription on the stone read  Here we have no continuing city, but look for one to come.  We found that one Department had charge of one operation, and another Department charge of something else, and I say now that if we are going on with the building of the Federal Capital, we should in the interests of the taxpayers of  this country organize operations there under strict supervision, and go right on with the business, or withdraw from it. . In the matter of roadmaking, I found that roads that had been made and macadamized were discarded. I found also that metal used for the construction of roads was handled six times from the quarry to the road. We find it difficult to make ends meet in Australia if metal for roads is handled only twice. At Canberra, it is taken from the quarry, put in a dray, carted some distance, and tipped out on the road Then it is thrown on to an embankment, a portable crusher is brought alongside, and the metal is fed into it. We found a crusher having a capacity of 120 to 150 tons a day fed by one man, who dropped Stones into the top of it, as a man might drop pennies into a bucket. When I saw this I said,  This is indeed going to be a city paved with gold, because I will swear that all .that stuff put on the roads at Canberra costs not less than £1 per cubic yard. Are these the lines on which the Federal Capital is to be built? I visited the place, not for a joy ride, but because of the criticisms I had passed upon it from time to time. I considered that it was my duty as a public man to make myself conversant with what was going on up there, and I say now that there is altogether too much fooling with money at Canberra. I wish to say further that just as I pay my board and lodging when I visit Melbourne to attend to my public duties as a senator, I believe that every man who goes to the Federal Capital and stays at. the accommodation house there should also pay his way. I did not pay mine, because I was told that as a member of the Federal Parliament I did not have to pay. I say that that practice is wrong, and should not be continued. If members of this Parliament visit Canberra from time to time, they should pay their own expenses. I shall oppose abuses of that sort, whether at the Federal Capital or anywhere else. It is the duty of the Government to see that they get value for the taxpayers money It is unnecessary for me to labour my views about Canberra, as honorable senators know where I stand. This is a young country, and if we are to become a great nation I repeat what I said last year that Australia may develop a Capital of the Commonwealth, but we are starting in the wrong way when we are building a Capital in the hope that it will develop Australia.","AddressinReply","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue[51]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It was unnecessary for Senator Wilson to assure us that he went to Canberra already prejudiced, with his eyes closed to the many virtues of the place, and opened, wide only to its few imperfections. I realize, as the honorable senator has done, that there are imperfections at Canberra, but they are not in any way due to the natural beauties and advantages of the site for the building of a great city.

I have watched workmen constructing cottages at the Federal Capital, and have seen bricklayers, who were being paid fancy prices, laying between 200 and 300 bricks a day, while men performing  similar work in other cities were laying between 1,000 and 1,100 bricks per day.

It is true that the Government, through the Department administering affairs at Canberra, has been most unfortunate in the type of workmen selected. Whilst all these things that Senator Wilson stated may be true, the fact remains that the work must proceed, because it is an obligation on the part of the Government to comply with the wish of a great majority of the people of the Commonwealth, and particularly the people of New South Wales, who are deeply interested in the proposal. I congratulate the Government on the fact that a clear indication is given in the GovernorGenerals Speech that it is the intention to proceed with the construction of the Capital in order that this Parliament may, at an early date, meet in the more salubrious atmosphere which prevails there. I feel very strongly upon this point, more particularly because of the general and unjustifiable attitude of opposition shown by the press in this city. I speak from a wide experience of the whole of the press of Australia when. I say that I doubt very much if there is in any capital city in Australia a press which vilifies its public men to the same extent as does the press of this city. For some considerable time the Melbourne newspapers have carried on a campaign against the public men of Australia, for what reason I do not know. Those of us who remember the influences the Melbourne press has been able to exert in past years are able to compare it with the comparatively small authority which it exercises today, and it is easy to realize that it is making a bold attempt to again secure control and domination of the public affairs of the Commonwealth, not for the sake of the people, but in the interests of those who conduct the large Melbourne journals. The Melbourne Age, for instance, is a newspaper which is dominated largely by men who are directly associated by ties of blood with our recent enemies, and it is no wonder that such men are eager to do anything they can to oppose the present Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes), who played such a prominent part in seeing that Australia did her share in the recent great world conflct.  I congratulate Senator Garling for so ably moving the motion for the adoption of the AddressinReply to the GovernorGenerals Speech. During the recent recess an election was held in New South Wales, in which the parties which confront each other in this Parliament met, and it may be interesting to honorable senators to hear details of the results, because they will give the people of Australia a fairly clear indication of what the position is likely to be after the next Federal election. It is being stated in the press of this State that the present Government is doomed, and that when the next Federal elections are held the Government will be hurled from office; but although the press makes such announcements, it is not prepared to say what party is likely to take the place of the Government, should it be defeated. We find, as a result of the recent State elections in New South Wales, that the total of Coalition and allied first preference votes over Labour votes in 1920, when the previous election was held, waa approximately 11,000; but in 1922, after considerably over one year of Labour administration, the 11,000 had increased to approximately 108,000, showing that an immense feeling has grown up in opposition to our chief opponents in this Parliament the Labour party. We have, too, the details of the metropolitan electorates, of which there are eight, which indicate that the total Coalition first preference votes show an increase over 1920 of 98,000 votes, or 78 per cent., while the Labour increase was 46,542, or 31 per cent. In. the fifteen country electorates the Coalition increase over 1920 was 77,866, or 46 per cent., while the Labour increase over 1920 in the same electorates .was 15,684? or 10 per cent. These figures show that the party supporting the present Federal Government has strengthened .its position since the advent of Labour in New South Wales, and I believe that similar increases will be found in the other States. In spite of the doleful forecast of the press on many occasions that the present Federal Government was riding to its doom, and that the people were eager to hurl it from office, the figures I have quoted prove conclusively that a majority of the people of Australia are behind the National Government. It is evident on every hand that the work which has been undertaken, although exception can be taken to, perhaps, a few acts of administration, has been in the interests of the whole of the people. I listened very carefully to the speech of Senator MacDonald, and I congratulate him upon its moderation, because, from the reports we have received, we did not expect to hear such reasonable utterances. One naturally associates with Labour men from Queensland extreme views on Labour problems, and more extreme opinions than are generally attributed to Labour men from other States. We have heard so much concerning Queensland, and what has been done there by the Labour Government,, that it is quite refreshing to find that the latest recruit to this Parliament is not nearly so violent as other Queensland representatives we have met from time to time.","AddressinReply","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Russian platform are  2.Establishment of an elective Supreme Economic Council for all nationalized industries. 3.Establishment of subordinate  trust  or industrial committees, each managing an industry, and partly nominated by the Supreme Economic Council. 4.Establishment in each shop or mill of management committees, containing elected representatives of the unions and technical staff, and subordinate both to trust committees and to the Supreme Economic Council. 5.Industrial unionism, i.e., organization on the basis of industry only. Comparing that with the objectives of the Australian Labour party, we find 2.Government of nationalized industries by boards upon which the workers in the industry and the community shall have representation. 3 and 4. Establishment of an Elective Supreme Economic Council by nationalized industries. 5.Industrial unionism. Is it any wonder that we find, in view of this alignment of the Australian Labour movement with the Russian Communistic movement, that many earnest Labour men in Australia today are asking themselves where they are, and are endeavouring to place their connexion with the organization in Russia?","AddressinReply","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/para[5]","N/A","N/A"

Certain very wellknown public men were present, and the honorable gentleman who leads the Opposition in this House (Senator Gardiner) I very much regret that owing to illhealth he is not here tonight addressed himself to the question.

I mention these facts because I feel that it is necessary to point out that the Labour party, as far as the next Federal elections are concerned, are not honest.

He or his Government dismissed the Government Printer, who believed that the Labour party were sincere when they said that they believed in the freedom of speech. We hear this statement about the freedom of speech very often; we hear it from the howling mobs at election meetings, who do their best to prevent opposing candidates being heard at all. This gentleman believed that Mr. Theodore was in earnest when he said that he believed in freedom of speech, amongst other things. He exercised the right of freedom of speech, and because he did so he has been thrown out of his office in one of the most tyrannous ways that has ever been seen in the affairs of any State of this Commonwealth.

From a< wonderful and important report that has been issued .by the Legislative Committee of the New South Wales Parliament. It drew attention to certain grave features with respect to the depopulation of many rural centres, but the* honorable senator went a good deal further. None of the remedies that the report suggested was proposed by my honorable friend. He could not find any bitter attack on the Civil Service in that report such as he made. There was no hint whatever of the advisability of reducing the salaries of our public servants, as he suggested. The report contained no insinuation that the people of Australia were not getting from the Public Service a fair return for the money expended. It is hard to conceive how any man, look ing the facts in the face, could come to the conclusion arrived at by the honorable senator, that we are on the road to ruin, and that the only way to avert the disaster is to reduce salaries in the Civil Service. I cannot indorse that view at all. In certain respects I know that there is room for improvement, as there is in every large concern, whether a private enterprise or a governmental institution. There will always be found men who do not give as good service as they should for the money they receive. If such is the case it is for the Government to remedy the trouble at the earliest moment. I believe the Government are determined to do the right thing to see that the finances of Australia and the administration of Departments are placed on a proper basis, so that the people will get the utmost possible under the circumstances for the money invested.  It has been pointed out that so far no definite proposal has been made for a reduction of taxation. I intend to reserve my remarks on the financial situation until the Budget speech has been delivered,, but I would like the Government to give serious attention to this question. Although I know it is almost impossible to do anything in the direction of reducing taxation, there are directions in which some amelioration of the conditions under which taxation is levied might be brought about so as to lighten the burdens of the people. Despite the attacks made on the Treasurer (Mr. Bruce) and on the Commonwealth Government, more particularly by the press of Melbourne, I feel sure that the Government are prepared to reduce the burdens of the taxpayers wherever possible. Most of the other proposals in the GovernorGenerals Speech I cordially indorse. As to one or two of them, I am somewhat doubtful, and I shall require a good deal of information before I can register my vote in their favour. On every matter mentioned I shall exercise the utmost liberty of speech and action. Honorable senators who are associated with the Nationalist party are not bound by any pledge of an outside organization. We are not told by executives or any other body how we are to vote. We are here to do what we consider to be right in our own judgment, irrespective of what any one outside the Parliament may. say. The Senate has shown at times that it can take a stand even against the expressed desire of the Government which the majority of honorable senators support. I hope the Senate will always exercise independence of thought and action with the object of promoting the interests of the (Commonwealth. If we become merely a Chamber for registering the opinions of the Government in power, so matter who they are, we might as well not be here at all.","AddressinReply","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/continue[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
