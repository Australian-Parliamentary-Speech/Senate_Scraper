This is the statement made by Senator Millen in Sydney on 6th June  It is quite obvious from their tactics and utterances/ remarked Senator Millen, VicePresident of the Federal Executive today in discussing the attitude of the Labour Party in the Senate last week,  that they intended then and intend in the future, not only not to facilitate business, but to do all they can to obstruct it. This was made abundantly clear by the admission of some of their members that the} did not regard the motion for a three weeks adjournment as at all unreasonable, even while they opposed it. Personally I should take no exception to any tactics that they may employ, but I think it is only right that the public should have an opportunity of noting that at the same time that a party is threatening obstruction it clamours loudly that the Government ought to press on immediately with business that it declares to be extremely urgent, but which it yet threatens to obstruct.  How ill it comes from the other side to talk in that fashion. Take the last years record of the members of the Labour Party. It will be found that there was a difficulty in securing the attendance of sufficient Conservatives to keep a quorum. Out of thirty sitting days last session, some honorable senators opposite were absent seventeen days. I regret that I was not able to be here on the occasion of the last sitting of the Senate. The reason why I was absent was that I was attending the funeral of the late lamented Premier of South Australia, the Honorable Thomas Price. It amazed me to read such base insinuations coming from Senator Millen..

The Labour Party must be abused, come what may. I say again to Senator Millen that if nothing else will appeal to him, at least he will recognise that it does not pay for a Minister to indulge in this sort of abuse of a party the members of which have been more regular in attendance than have the members of any other party here.
