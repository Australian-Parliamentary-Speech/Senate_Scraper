I am now in a position to inform the honorable senator that a report has been obtained from the technical officers of the Marine branch of the department who advise that theFurneaux Group, the large area of islands referred to, lie too far to the westward of the shipping track to constitute a menace to vessels travelling between Sydney and Hobart. Babel Island is about 40 miles and Cape Barren about 30 miles distant from the track. On account of the distance a light on either Babel Island or Cape Barren would not be of any service to vessels traversing the usual track between Hobart and Sydney.","SYDNEYHOBART SEA ROUTE","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[2]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

But if either House of the Parliament passes a resolution of which notice has been given at any time within fifteen sitting days after such regulations have been laid before such House disallowing any regulation such regulation shall thereupon cease to have effect. The following are extracts from the Standing Orders of the Senate, in Chapter XXIX. headed  Accounts, Papers, and Returns  : 358. Accounts and papers may be ordered to be laid upon the table . . 361. Other papers (namely, papers other than certain papers not material to the present question, which are obtained by an address presented to the GovernorGeneral) may be presented pursuant to Statute, by the President, or by Command of His Excellency the GovernorGeneral. 862. All Papers and Documents laid upon the Table of the Senate shall be considered public. 363. A document relating to public affairs quoted from by a Minister of the Crown, unless stated to bo of a confidential nature, or such as should more properly be obtained by Address, may be called for and made a public Document. 364. A Document quoted from by a Senator not a Minister of the Crown may be ordered by the Senate to be laid upon the Table; such Order may be made without Notice immediately upon the conclusion of the speech of the Senator who has quoted therefrom. I am asked to advise whether, when a Regulation has been made and gazetted, but not yet laid upon the Table by a Minister in accordance with the statute (the fifteen sitting days specified in the statute not having elapsed) (1 ) it is in order for a Senator not a Minister of the Crown to move, under Standing Order 364, that the Regulation be laid upon the Table; (2)a resolution of the Senate (of which notice has been given or which has been passed before the regulations have been laid before the Senate pursuant to the Statute) disallowing the regulations, would be effective to cause the regulations to cease to have effect. I.will deal first with the second question. Section 10 of the Acts Interpretation Act 19011930 imposes a duty upon Ministers to lay a regulation before each House within the specified time; and also gives Ministers an absolute discretion as to the particular time, within the specified time, that duty shall be performed. In my opinion the words  laid before such House , in the concluding paragraph of section 10. have reference to the laying of the Regulation before the House pursuant to the preceding provisions of the section i.e., to the laying of theRegulations before the House by a Minister in pursuance of his statutory duty. In my opinion, therefore, a disallowing resolution, passed by the Senate before the Regulation has been laid before the Senate by a Minister in pursuance of the Statute, or of which notice has been given before the regulation has been so laid before the House, is not within the terms of the statute and is inoperative. My answer to the second question is therefore  No . On this construction of the Statute, it becomes unnecessary to answer the first question. I would point out, however, that Standing Orders 363 and 364 are rules of debate. Standing Order 363 is based upon a rule of the British Parliament cited in May (13th Ed. ), page 328, that a Minister is not at liberty to quote from a state paper not before the House, unless he is prepared to lay it upon the Table. Standing Order 364 is an extension of this rule to documents quoted by private members. The purpose of the Rules is to prevent a document from being quoted in debate without giving members an opportunity to see the whole document. They do not contemplate the laying on the Table by a private member of a document which will in the ordinary course be laid on the table pursuant to Statute by a Minister.","Regulations: Motion to Disallow","TRANSPORT WORKERS ACT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/quote[2]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

The suggestion that honorable senators are wasting time on this matter is unworthy of the Government or of any person holding executive office. The miserable tactics in which the Government is now engaging constitute one of the most deplorable instances in the history of the Commonwealth Parliament. They are a travesty of constitutional and parliamentary government, and I hurl the suggestion back in the teeth of the Leader of the Senate that the action of the Opposition is merely a waste of time. The Opposition is attempting to protect m;en who are guilty of nothing except loyalty to the awards of the Arbitration Court, which was properly constituted by this Parliament. Loyalty is a virtue that is probably unknown to some honorable senators opposite. The Opposition is using every means in its power, and will continue to do so, to bring relief to those oppressed loyalists by repealing the iniquitous regulations which the Government seeks to perpetuate. Recently, the Leader of the Government, with the petulance of a perturbed parrot, suggested that the Government would reenact these regulations from day to day, if necessary. I contend that that is flouting parliamentary government, that it is subversive of constitutional principles, and will bring upon Parliament the contempt that it would so richly deserve if such a course were persisted in. Not only is it contrary to all authority, but to the very provisions of the statute under which the regulations were made. Although in the hurlyburly and heat of the war period certain decisions were given by an eminent predecessor of yours, Mr. President, it is obvious that Parliament never intended under the Acts Interpretation Act to relax its power of control over any statutory rules or regulations. It is apparent that  within so many days after  simply indicates that there is a limit of time within which Parliament must act; that otherwise it will be deemed to have sanctioned the regulations. This matter is a vital one from the Constitutional viewpoint: Whether Parliament is to hand over absolute power for a certain period to an executive which behaves itself as this one has.

I have no desire to see the Senate do anything which would amount to a travesty of government. I hope that honorable senators will not be led away by what they may consider to be the real issues in this conflict, but that they will view it from the constitutional aspect, as is expected of the Senate. The Leader of the Opposition (Senator Pearce) first of all moved a certain resolution for the adjournment of the Senate. Then a certain document was called for and tabled. The motion now before the Senate does not expressly allege that that document is the regulation. It is very ingeniously worded to cover what might be a regulation, and what might be a disallowance of that regulation. As you said, sir, in that inimitable style for which you are noted when dealing with diplomatic problems, it is a matter for the courts of law to decide. I do not think that we should leave the law in a state of uncertainty. In urging the rejection of the motion of the Leader of the Opposition, I am not appealing to the Senate to do anything more than they and their colleagues appealed to this party to do when Labour was in Opposition. I refer to the occasion when an attempt was made to disallow Statutory Rule 273 of 1916, under the War Precautions Act 191416.

Never previously in the history of Australia has a government stooped so low as to defy the decision of the Upper House in an important matter such as this.

The Government then deliberately held its hand in order that it might act behind the backs of the representatives of the people in this chamber. It refrained from taking any action until Parliament was in recess. Then it made regulations and brought them into immediate operation. When Parliament resumed a few weeks ago the Government refrained, for a considerable period, from laying those regulations on the table. When they were tabled they were disallowed by the Senate. Immediately following their disallowance, regulations in the same terms were gazetted and brought into force again. Does Senator Daly stand for practices of that kind? Does he approve of the action of an administration which seeks to defeat wellknown principles of parliamentary government by taking away from the representatives of the people in Parliament any check upon the regulation making power of a government? In this country the only authority to make laws is the Parliament, elected by the people. But Parliament has power to delegate its authority in certain matters. It may delegate authority to the executive to make regulations, under specific conditions. There is no portion of the British Empire in which the delegation of this lawmaking power to the Government is as wide and as generous as in Australia. But this wide and generous provision imposes upon the Government the responsibility at all times to act honorably and decently. The moment that a government, by trick or. subterfuge, abuses that power, it brings itself into contempt, not only in the Parliament, but in the eyes of the people. The Acts Interpretation Act, under which this delegated power is given to the executive, provides that regulations shall be tabled in both Houses, and, if disallowed in either, 3hall thereupon cease to have effect. Parliament, I remind the Senate, pronounced upon certain regulations, which thereupon ceased to have effect. But the Government, in order to circumvent the Senate, immediately reenacted the regulations which had been disallowed, and brought them into force. By its action the Government virtually set itself above the people. It said, in effect,  We do not care what the people say, or what the representatives of the people in Parliament say. We have this delegated power, and intend to use it. It is true that it was never given to a government to be abused in this fashion, but, having got it, we are going to keep it, and we do not care to what extent we abuse it. Lt must be obvious to all who give the matter a moments thought, that the abuse of this power by a government means that the authority of Parliament, in regard to regulations is entirely abrogated and destroyed. If the action of this Government is to pass unchallenged, there will be no longer any power residing in either House of Parliament to render ineffective regulations made by governments. Does Senator Daly stand for that principle ?","SolicitorGeneral. 26th March, 1931","TRANSPORT WORKERS ACT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I go further and say that, if they have not been tabled by the Government, they ought to be. I add that, in not laying the regulations on the table immediately they were promulgated, this Government was guilty of a gross and grave abuse of its powers. The provision in section 10 of the Acts Interpretation Act is not designed to enable a government to sneak away from and defraud Parliament of its rights. It ia intended to give the Government a proper opportunity to do its work. The instruction that, regulations made must be laid on the table of either house of the Parliament within 30 days means that the Government must table regulations at the earliest possible moment. Every decent government has at all times observed that practice. It has been the invariable rule, when regulations have been made during a recess, to place them on the table of either house immediately on the reassembling of Parliament. The regulations to which objection is now taken were withheld, not because if. was inconvenient to lay them on the table, but for the express purpose of muzzling the representatives of the people in this chamber. The action of the Government in this matter is contemptible, improper, and unjust.

Both in this chamber and outside, the Government has stated that it will continue to issue these regulations despite their disallowance by the Senate because of a mandate which it has received from the people. I deny that that is so. The Senate, which is representative of States as such, is more representative of the people than is another place. If the Government is so keen on effect being given to the will of the people, why does it not make an appeal to the electors? Only a small section of the community is affected by these regulations, yet all the powers of government are being used on their behalf. Every conceivable subterfuge is being resorted to by the Government to further their interests. The persons affected are where they are because of their own actions. The action of the Government in resorting to all these subterfuges is degrading. If the Government continues to use its executive power to defy the Senate, I am prepared to go to any length to bring it to a sense of its responsibility. The Senate has certain constitutional powers which it has every right to force the Government to recognize. Senators OHalloran and Dooley said that for some time there has been peace on the waterfront. They cannot say that that is the result of these regulations having been gazetted. These regulations were not framed to bring about peace on the waterfront. It is true that there has been comparative peace on the waterfront for some time. It is also true that since volunteer workers took the place of members of the Waterside Workers Federation pillaging on the wharfs has decreased enormously. Prior to the employment of volunteer waterside workers, Australian ports were notorious for the pillaging that took place. I do not say that amongst the members of the wharf labourers unions there are not any honest men. Many of them are honest, worthy citizens, who for fear of victimization have been compelled to shut their eyes to what went on. The trouble is that the organization was used by gangs of thieves for the carrying out of their nefarious purposes. I have no doubt that the motion will be carried. Should the Government again gazette the regulations, the Senate would be justified in going to any length to assert its constitutional authority.

The argument of the Government Whip (Senator Hoare), who suggests that because the men working on the waterfront at Port Adelaide do not live in the vicinity of the port the regulations should be allowed, is illogical. As Senator Hays mentioned by interjection, the work on the waterfront is at present being efficiently carried out. It is ridiculous to suggest that regulations should be framed, merely because those who reside in Port Adelaide are not getting all the work. If the volunteers working on the waterfront at Port Adelaide or the Outer Harbour prefer to live at Glenelg, or some other attractive suburb in the State, they should not be prevented from working on the wharfs. Since the Transport Workers Act, which provides for the licensing system, came into operation, there has been a complete cessation of those industrial upheavals, which were continually occurring at practically every port in the Commonwealth. The Transport Workers Act was not passed for the purpose of excluding members of the Waterside Workers Federation, but in order to ensure peace on the waterfront at a time when. Australia was threatened with a big industrial upheaval.

I am sorry that I have misrepresented the honorable senator. But undoubtedly the men who obeyed the courts award are now known as the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union, and the purpose of these regulations is to deprive them of work.  I want to show that work on the waterfront is now being carried out faithfully and well. In North Queensland it is certainly being carried out more expeditiously and at a lower cost than it was prior to the passing of the Transport Workers Act. The primary producers have reaped the benefit, and there has been less pilfering. According to Senator OHalloran, the purpose of these new regulations is to ensure peace on the waterfront. What was the position in Queensland prior to the passing of the Transport Workers Act? Every year, just at harvest time when it was necessary to get sugar away to the refineries in the south, there was a strike in practically all the northern parts of Queensland. The people of Bowen depend largely on the fruit and tomatoes that they can send away to the south. Their season lasts for about three months. Prior to the passing of this act there was always a strike when the farmers were ready to get their produce away. They had either to face ruin or pay heavy transport charges by sending their fruit and tomatoes south by train. It is only in recent years that there has been a train service available to them. Two or three years ago the position became so desperate in the North Queensland ports that sugarfarmers in the Cairns district and many members of the Australian Workers Union, timbergetters and others on the Atherton tableland, were obliged to combine into an army for their mutual protection. They entrained for Cairns and cleaned up the waterfront there. They afforded protection to men who were prepared to load sugar, timber, and produce into ships at the wharf. Previously, there had been upheaval after upheaval in Cairns, but, fortunately, the moderates among the federation men eventually came out on top. Work is now proceeding peacefully at Cairns. In Bowen it was necessary for the mayor of the town to organize the whole of the townspeople. They marched down to the wharf and voluntarily did the loading and unloading of cargo in order that their businesses might not be ruined. Such was the state of affairs in practically every port of Australia prior to the coming into force of the Transport Workers Act when the Waterside Workers Federation had absolute control on the waterfront, and it continued until men, whom the Prime Minister now describes as  scabs , came to the assistance of industry and agreed to abide by the awards of the Arbitration Court. Since then the work of the waterfront has been carried on continuously, but prior to that there was no peace in the transport industry, and the primary producer had no assurance that ho could get his produce to market. It is useless for honorable senators opposite, one after another, to plead the cause of the members of the Waterside Workers Federation as against the men who are working on the wharves at the present time. I quite agree with Senator Reid that there are probably thousands of men in the Waterside Workers Federation who were not in sympathy with the action taken by the executive of the federation, and I think that some honorable senators opposite expressed disapproval of the action of that executive in not abiding by the award of the Arbitration Court. But when we know that men have been working peacefully on the waterfront, and that they have reduced pillaging to practically nothing, and have given continuity of service, why should we sacrifice them by throwing them out of their jobs? I do not propose to do so, nor do I propose to place the primary producers of North Queensland once more in danger of being brought nearly to ruin season after season by handing over the control of the waterside work to the members of the Waterside Workers Federation.","SolicitorGeneral. 26th March, 1931","TRANSPORT WORKERS ACT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[11]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As this subject has been threshed out in the Senate on several occasions I do not intend to say anything upon the question of the disallowance or otherwise of these regulations. I have risen merely to give a few figures to show how the cost of loading and unloading of vessels has been brought down since the Transport Workers Act has been in force. We should regard this matter from the point of its effect on the prosperity of the country; because only by bringing down costs of production can we compete in the worlds market and restore prosperity to Australia. The figures I have relate to general stevedoring charges at Townsville, Bowen, and Mackay. The cost of discharging cargo at Townsville, in 1927, prior to the passing of the Transport Workers Act, was 13s. 8d. per ton. In 1928, during which year the act was in operation for three months only, this charge was reduced to 13s., but in 1929, when the full effect of the regulations made under the act was felt by the late Government, the cost fell to11s.1d. per ton. The figures in regard to Bowen show an enormous reduction. In 1927, the cost of loading sugar was 8s. 2d. per ton. In 1929, when the regulations were in operation for three months only, the cost was reduced to 5s. 1.8d. per ton, but in 1929, when the regulations were in force for the whole twelve months, the cost of loading was only 2s. 5.6d. per ton. Compare that with 8s. 2d. per ton. in 1928. I have not the figures in regard to frozen meat for 1927, but for 1928, when the regulations were in force for three months only, the cost was 18s.1d. per ton, whereas in 1929, when the full effect of the new regulations was felt, it was only 10s. 6d. per ton. For general cargo, which includes tallow, hides, &c, the cost of loading was 12s.8d. in 1928, and 4s. 5d. in 1929. These figures speak for themselves.

The operation of the Transport Workers Act reduced costs, and increased employment. For those reasons I shall do all in my power to oppose the reenactment of regulations which would bring about a retrogression to the state of affairs which existed before the Transport Workers Act was introduced.

I propose to comment briefly on the reply given by the Treasurer (Mr. Theodore) through the Leader of the Senate, to a statement I made on the 19th March, regarding newspaper reports of a speech delivered by Mr. Theodore at a public meeting in the Cremorne Theatre, Brisbane, on the 14th instant. I said that he was reported in the newspapers to have made certain statements which were grossly misleading, and I was fortified by the fact that at least three persons had told me that they had heard those statements by wireless. I brought the matter before the Senate, and the Treasurer, through the Leader of the Government, said that his statement was not as reported in the newspapers, but was in the terms of a speech he had made in another place on the 12th March. I have consulted the report of that speech in Hansard, and have also taken the trouble to refer to the reports in the Brisbane newspapers of the public meeting on the 14th March. I quote, first, from the report of Mr. Theodores speech published in the Daily Standard, which, I understand, is a Labour journal ","BrucePage Government Finance","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It appears that one must speak plainly in this matter, if the people of Australia are to be informed of the true position. lt is extraordinary that a man occupying the high and honorable position of Treasurer of the Commonwealth, should endeavour, by misrepresentation, to inflict a deadly blow upon political opponents who, for the most part, are always prepared to deal fairly with the Government and its supporters. The honorable gentleman must have known that his statement in Brisbane would mislead the people. He should be condemned in the strongest language, because it is generally understood that, as the result of such statements, which it is not always possible to refute promptly, Australia is in its present position, largely owing to the borrowing and financial policy of the BrucePage Administration. But, as I have shown, the figures supplied by the Treasurer himself to Senator Glasgow, give the lie direct to any such suggestion. The Treasurer also admitted, in his reply to Senator Glasgow, that the bulk of the money borrowed by the BrucePage Government was raised on behalf of the several State Governments. The amount required for purely Commonwealth purposes was comparatively small. Furthermore, the sum of ?20,000,000 was paid off the overseas debt, thus making the net increase, for Commonwealth purposes, ?4,500,000. It was necessary that I should again refer to the statement of the Treasurer because he endeavoured to make honorable senators believe that, when speaking in Brisbane, he merely repeated what he had said on the floor of the House. If that were so, all I can say is that the Brisbane newspapers reported him incorrectly and those who heard his address over the air evidently failed to understand what he said. I did not quote extracts from the reports in the other Brisbane newspapers, but in essence they agreed with the report which appeared in the Labour journal. I take this, the earliest opportunity available to me, to again place before the people of Australia, the true position, and conclude by saying that it is not fair, even in politics, for the representative of any party to make public statements which are absolutely untrue.

I protest as strongly as possible against the action of the Government in adjourning Parliament for a period of nearly three weeks without first passing legislation to provide for immediate financial relief to be given to the wheatgrowers of Australia. It is incredible that any government with a sense of its responsibility to our primary producers, upon whom the prosperity of Australia so largely depends, should give the wheatgrowers a definite promise of assistance and then agree, in the middle of this weeks sitting, to a lengthy adjournment in order that the Ministers and their supporters may attend a labour conference in Sydney. Our wheatgrowers should receive assistance at the earliest possible moment. They should have been in a position to purchase superphosphates at least a month ago, because in some of the earlier districts in my State farmers are already carrying out seeding operations. Unless help is forthcoming promptly, thousands of farmers will he unable to purchase superphosphates this year. A great number are in actual need of sustenance. They were led to believe that they would receive a bonus on production this year. Immediately Parliament reassembled, I brought their desperate plight under the notice of the Government. Since then honorable senators have attended regularly the sittings of the Senate in the hope that legislation for the assistance of the farmers would be sent up from another place, but up to the present we have been disappointed. It also appears that the bill which is being debated elsewhere, provides only for n bonus of 6d. per bushel on the exportable surplus. This will work out at about 4£d. per bushel on the total production. But the point which I wish to impress on the Government is that, from the point of view of encouraging next years wheat production, £1 worth of assistance given to our wheatfarmers today, would be worth £5 worth of help given a couple of months hence. The State Governments are anxious to assist the growers, but unfortunately they have not the means. Therefore, this Government should use every endeavour to give effect to its promise to do so. In addition to the £3,500,000 to be paid by way of bounty on export the Government proposes under a bill now before another place to make available £2,500,000 for distribution by the State Governments for necessitous farmers who  Deed fertilisers to put iu their crop. Some such help as this is required if our wheat production is to be maintained. When the Wheat Bill introduced in the other House was being considered the Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page), suggested that the money should be raised from the Commonwealth Bank, the loan to be secured by a sales tax on flour. We do not care whether the Perkins plan is adopted, and a sales tax of £7 4s. a ton imposed, or whether a smaller tax of £2 10s. is decided upon. Even a tax of £2 10s. would be sufficient to pay off the whole loan, interest and principle, in three or four years, and should not make it necessary to increase the price of bread. Dr. Earle Page intimated that his party was prepared to support the bill, without prejudice to its declared hostility to a fiduciary note issue. As soon as it became evident that the bill was likely to receive the generous support of members of all parties the Government shelved it. I maintain that we are not doing a fair thing by the farmers if we adjourn Parliament now for nearly three weeks without first passing the Wheat Bill. In all the wheatgrowing States of Australia the farmers are in urgent need of the assistance that has been so often promised them. In Western Australia, at least 8,000 farmers are in a desperate plight at the present time. They need a full bonus of at least 6d. a bushel on this years production to meet the most urgent of their obligations. Many of them were put on new land, which they had to mortgage to its fullest capacity in order to make it productive. The State instrumentalities are unable to carry them any longer, and they need money, not only to put in this years crop, but, in many cases, for actual sustenance. We naturally expect that the Government, which urged them to grow more wheat, and which last December had a bill passed through Parliament guaranteeing them 3s. a bushel at the port of export, should now keep some of the promises it has made. It is evident that the Government, in seeking this adjournment now, is preparing once more to abandon the farmers to their fate. Western Australian members of this Senate have gladly come 2,500 miles to attend the sittings of Parliament in the hope that legislation to assist the wheat farmers would be put before them, but during the past three weeks the time of the Senate has been wasted on unimportant measures. Although tomorrow is a regular sitting day both Houses are adjourning this afternoon, and I venture to prophesy that a number of Ministers will be present at the Federal Labour Conference in Sydney tomorrow. I further prophesy that some Ministers, probably including the Treasurer (Mr. Theodore), will be headhunting for some Labour members of this chamber, who only a few weeks ago were working strenuously to secure the reinstatement of the Treasurer in the Cabinet. I protest against such things going on when Ministers should be here attending to urgent business.","BrucePage Government Finance","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Any one of the previous governments which, during the 30 years of federation, have occupied the Treasury bench could, without difficulty, have found the money for the payment of that guarantee. The present Government could not find it because of a general lack of confidence in its administration. A great mistake was made by the Labour party when it forced Messrs. Fenton and Lyons out of its ranks. During the absence of the Prime Minister in England, when the present Treasurer (Mr. Theodore) was a private member, Mr. Fenton and Mr. Lyons as ActingPrime Minister and ActingTreasurer respectively, appealed for a loan of £28,000,000. So great was the confidence in their integrity that the loan was over subscribed. Later, however, when disastrous changes in the personnel of the Ministry were made, the Government found that it could not borrow the comparatively small sum of £6,000,000 with which it had hoped to pay a bounty on wheat, and assist necessitous farmers. It is time that a government so unworthy of confidence tendered its resignation. Particularly in the office of Treasurer there should be a man in whom the people have confidence. Financial institutions, as well as private individuals, would be prepared to lend sufficient money to assist necessitous farmers, and to pay the bounty if only there was in power a government worthy of their confidence.  The inability of the Government to borrow money resulted in the introduction into another place of certain legislation for the creation of a fiduciary note issue. That legislation would not be necessary if confidence in the administration were restored. No other government has over had to make the confession of failure that the present Government has made ; no other government has ever had to admit its inability to raise a shilling. Even today the Government of Western Australia would have no difficulty in obtaining money to assist the wheat farmers of that State were it not handicapped by the shackles that federation has forged. Before Western Australia entered into a financial agreement with the other States and the Commonwealth, the Government of that State had no difficulty in obtaining funds in London on better terms than were granted to the Commonwealth. Before the Senate meets again the farmers will have commenced putting in their crops. They should have been supplied with superphosphates a month ago. I protest against the callous action of the Government in adjourning Parliament for nearly three weeks without first having dealt with the Wheat Bill.","BrucePage Government Finance","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I should like to have the Ministers assurance that those very valuable reports will be made available to honorable senators. I am aware that, in the interests of economy, many reports are not now printed; but, in my opinion, these reports are of sufficient importance to justify their being printed.

The Minister said that the Governments action would depend largely on what happened to its financial legislation. I assure the Leader of the Senate that, if the Government acts more or less on the lines of Dr. Rivetts report, it will cost little, if anything, to give effect to the recommendations. I had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Rivett in London, and I know something of his investigations, both in England and in Germany, regarding the extraction of fuel oil from coal. If the Government would make the position clear to companies such as British Industrial Chemicals Limited, and the German company that is interested in the production of this fuel, there would be no difficulty in inducing them to establish works here, provided legislation to ensure the consumption of their fuel in Australia were guaranteed. Representations were made to certain financial groups in London when I was there, and a friend assured me that, if an undertaking could be given, either by State or Federal Governments, that every assistance would be forthcoming in the protection of their capital, large sums could be obtained overseas for the development of this important industry. I do not favour State enterprise; but I advise the Government to get into touch with the overseas group, which, I believe, is anxious to extend its operations to Australia, particularly in view of our failure to discover flowing oil.","BrucePage Government Finance","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I may inform Senator Johnston that he will have ample opportunity, after the Easter adjournment, to give all the assistance possible to wheat farmers and others. I can remember the time when he was not so enthusiastic as he now appears to be in his desire to assist the farmers.
