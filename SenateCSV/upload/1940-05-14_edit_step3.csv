It is too early at the. present stage to saydefinitely whether this attack is the main German offensive for the purpose of forcing a decision in the west of which the possibility has been reckoned on at almost any time since the beginning of the war or whether it, is simply the prelude to such a plan. The fighting in the Low Countries, however,, as been increasing in intensity since Friday. I propose, on behalf of the Government, to give tohonorable senators a brief review of the position on the Western Front as it appears from the latest official information. Tomorrow I shall give a more comprehensive view covering both the political and military fields.  The German offensive, was launched in the early hours of the 10th May. Troops long held in readiness poured across the frontiers of Holland, Belgium . and Luxemburg, and, at the same time, large numbers of German aircraft attacked aerodromes and military objectives over the whole region of the Low Countries and Northern France. . In combination with this attack, the Germans employed the new device of dropping troops by parachute behind the lines of the defenders. Immediately the Allies were asked by Holland and Belgium for help, Britain and France sent strong and highly mechanized forces to their aid. Those Allied troops had long been ready for such an eventuality, and in a short space of time have taken up planned positions and begun to play an important part in the resistance to the German advance. The British advance into Belgium has proceeded with almost no hindrance, .and a substantial part of the leading divisions are now in position. Some British armoured units have been in contact with the enemy. In Holland, the situation in the southwest must continue to give anxiety for some time to come. According to the latest reports, German troops are still being landed from the air in this area and the Dutch have not yet regained control. In the northeastern provinces of Holland, the Germans have been able to make considerable advances, as these areas do not lend themselves readily to defence, and are outside the main Dutch strategic zones. The enemy has, however, been delayed by Dutch troops falling back in good order on defensive positions, and by the destruction of bridges. In central Holland, despite German advances across the Ysel and Maas Rivers, Dutch forces are maintaining stubborn resistance against the enemy in a number of places. In the south, the Germans have overrun that part of the province of Limburg which separates northern Belgium .from Germany. In Brabant, however, strong French detachments have advanced to the aid of the Dutch, and are helping them to hold the Germans. In Belgium, the German forces advancing through Maastricht, in Dutch Limburg, have advanced on either side of Liege, but have probably suffered heavy losses from the forts in front of thatcity. These forced have succeeded, however, in crossing the defensive line of the Albert Canal, which runs across the northeastern corner of the country, and the position here is causing anxiety. British and French units are helping to cover a Belgian withdrawal to prepared positions. In Southern Belgium, the Germans who passed through Luxemburg, which was overrun on the first day of the invasion, have made contact with Allied troops at Neufchateau in the Belgian Ardennes. Fierce fighting has been reported, and the German advance is still continuing. Aerial activity in tins new campaign has been intense. The Germans have launched hundreds of bombers over the Low Countries and northeastern France, and while these have been in a large measure checked by Allied fighters, they continue to inflict considerable damage on towns and communications, in an effort to disorganize the mobilization of the defending armies. The Allies, too, ba.ve bombed German troop concentrations and mechanized columns advancing in the Luxemburg area, and in Germany between the Dutch frontier and the Rhine. It will he seen from this account that the German forces now have before them a very different proposition from their lightning campaign in Norway. A courageous Dutch and Belgian resistance was put into motion immediately the attack opened, and the French and British forces now. moving up in support, both through Belgium and from the Dutch coast. are acting according to a plan long prepared to meet exactly  the present d .iii ger!. I would conclude with a note of warning against any undue optimism. Even though the full German strength Available has not yet been thrown into the scale, operations so far have disclosed a formidable menace .to the Allied position in the west, and every effort will be needed to avert it.","N/A","WAR IN EUROPE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The two statements that have been made to honorable senators this afternoon indicate that a considerable change has occurred in the world situation since, the Senate last met.The statement readby the Assistant Minister for Commerce (Senator McBride) will be. discussed at a future date. All I shall say about.it at the moment is that it indicates the terrible price that we shall have to pay for the present worldmadness. The Minister Assisting the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Collett) in referring to the war activities in Europe, drew attention to a significant point. At the conclusion of his remarks he said, in effect, that we should not take things for granted, or believethatallwas well. I drawattention to that remark because, while the conflictwas being waged some weeks ago in Norway reports alleged to beauthentic were circulated to the people of Australia ; these proved tobefalse, and they misled the people as to what was really happening in Scandinavia. I admitthatthe people of Great Britain also had false information conveyed to them...When the startling information was disclosed that things were not as they appeared to be in Norway violent repercussion, occurred. We have, in the last few days, witnessed the downfall of the Chamberlain Government in Great Britain. Actually we had been hoping that internal conditions in Germany would eventually, result in the sweeping away of the German Government; it is. notable, therefore, that the change of government occurred first in Great Britain. We may still rejoicein the fact, however, that though theper sonnel of the British Government has been altered, the peoples, of the British  Commonwealth of Nations, including the people of Great Britain, still maintain the democratic form of government, It is well that at the seat of the Empire the elected representatives of the people have been able to assemble in their places in Parliamentto discuss the nations affairs, even though such discussion involved a change of government. I direct attention to the fact that though we are engaged in a war for the preservation of democracy and all that that means, the Commonwealth Parliament is not functioning with the same flexibility as the mother of parliaments.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","SHEEHAN, James","K5X","N/A","N/A","N/A","742","Honorable senators also very often receive correspondence incorrectly addressed.. What I have said indicates quite clearly a lack of knowledge of the details of our form of government. In the early days of federation the newspapers ofAustralia devoted considerablespacetotheproceeding of the National Parliament; but that is not so today. The result is that the people are not only less informed as to what is taking place than they ought to be, but also are questioning the necessity for such an institution as Parliament. If the Government desires the people to understand the form of government associated with a true democracy, it should keep Parliament constantly in session. I hope also that while worldshaking events are taking place the Government will use every means in its power to ensure that correct statements relating to world affairs are placed before the people.  During recent days the people of Australia have been urged to play an even greater part than hitherto in the Avar activities of this country. The lightning blow struck at Holland, Belgium and Luxemburg gives strength to that appeal It: is within our knowledge that the Queen of the Netherlands and her family have sought sanctuary in Great Britain, arid that the King of Norway is practically a, fugitive in hiding in his own country. The war has entered a new phase with the invasion of the three countries which I have mentioned. In the Balkans the outlook is unsettled, and danger lurks in the Mediterranean. The invasion of Holland has brought the conflict right to bur very doors, because of the proximity to Australia of the Netherlands East Indies. No one can say what may happen in the near future. It is true that two powerful nations, with interests in the Pacific, have expressed a desire for the continuance of the status quo in the Pacific, but at any time, on some pretext or another, one of them may see lit to  protect  Dutch territory outside Europe, just as Hitlers Jinnies have invaded Holland, Belgium and Luxemburg in order to protect them against: the Allies. Because of that possibility, a duty devolves upon Australia. There are some people in this country who believe that Australia can render service to the Empire only by the wholesale exodus of its manpower, but I am pleased to notice that there are men, not only in the Labour movement, who realize the danger associated with such a policy. As the result of the cutting off of supplies from Denmark, Norway and other countries, Australia will be called upon to provide in greater measure than hitherto, foodstuffs for thu people of the British Isles. One of the most important activities that should engage our attention is the stimulation of the shipbuilding industry in Australia. If this country is to play its part, greater quantities of produce must be sent to the Allies as rapidly as possible. If, as is probable, the difficulties of sea transport become more acute as the Avar proceeds, and if, as appears likely, the Avar continues for a long period, the sooner this work is undertaken the sooner will the vessels be completed and ready for service. Some time may necessarily lapse in inaugurating the scheme, but that is all the more reason why a start should be made immediately. Honorable senators who yesterday saw the antiaircraft guns manufactured by Australian workmen at Maribyrnong will appreciate what can be done in this country. It was with a good deal of pride that I inspected those products of an Australian factory not that I am proud that Ave have to expend money and employ artisans in the making of implements of Avar, but because when the need arose, avc were able to demonstrate our capacity to make them. In view of the statements which have been made in this chamber from time to time I may be pardoned if I draw attention to the fact that the establishment in which those weapons were manufactured was the creation of a Labour government. The work of these factories Shows that we are playing our part in no uncertain way. Having regard to the call foi Australia to do its share, I shall refer to the conditions which prevailed at the termination of the last meeting of the Senate. At that time I directed attention to the fact that certain honorable senators are endeavouring to belittle those on this side of the chamber by conveying to the Australian people the false idea that those associated with the great Australian Labour movement represent a disloyal section in this country.. Some have tried to make it appear that the members of that party are opposed to the ideals for which the great British Commonwealth of Nations stands. I also directed attention to the repeated requests which have been made to honorable senators in opposition to become members of a composite ministry. Similar requests are now being made in certain quarters for the formation of a national government which, of course, would include members on this side of i he chamber. Such a suggestion is conclusive proof that impartial members of the community realize that the charge of disloyalty made against this party falls to the ground.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[1]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is most important that we should win the war, but in doing so we should ensure that our democratic institutions and those great ideals which the Australian people and the Australian Labour movement support shall remain intact. Sometimes I have misgivings that in meeting the attacks made against us by Communists and others supporting revolutionary ideas, there is a possibility that instead of keeping our ideals clearly before us we may go too far to the right. While we may declaim against the materialism of communism we must not forget the materialism of capitalism. We must not overlook the fact that whilst in some countries communism has been the means of destroying some of those things which we hold dear, the capitalist system also has been responsible for the destruction of many cherishedrights and privileges.* When we appeal to the people of Australia, we must always have a policy of development and of social justice that will be a credit to this. country. I am not suggesting that Australia at present is not a credit to those who did the arduous work of its colonization. All sorts of men and women some with rebellious tendencies came to Australia because they were opposed to the conditions under which they were compelled to live in older countries. Many men and women who left the land of their birth because of the oppression by the ruling classes, came to Australia to work out their destiny and to give effect to those principles in which they believed. Although we have much to be thankful for. I do not wish Australia to rest on its laurels, and allow our present democratic institutions to be overwhelmed by the great tragedy which is now confronting us.

If we desire the youth of this country to preserve our democratic institutions, obviously we must direct our activities in the direction that I have suggested. What is the use of making an appeal to the youth of Australia to support the present social system when thousands of boys do not know where to obtain employment? The fathers and. mothers of these Young neon le are faced with a great problem the placing of. their sons or daughters in decent positions. After spending a great deal of money in educating their children to a standard which, they feel, is necessary in order to fit them for the battle of life, too many of them discover that employment is not available. In these circumstances i3 it not likely that these young people will have bred in them a spirit of rebellion, and will not many of thom consider chat our present democratic system of government, has outlived its usefulness?  A great deal has been said in this chamber and in the House of Representatives about the need for stamping out communism from our midst. But what breeds communism? What are the reasons for its existence in this country? If the peoples of older nations in which communism has flourished, or at least taken root, had not suffered want owing to the failure of their governments to provide them with the opportunity to live decently they would not have turned to this political creed. If, for instance, the Czarist regime in Russia had dealt fairly with the Russian people, there would not have been the bloody revolution in 1917.

One would expect the honorable senator to understand and appreciate the responsibility attaching to the position he occupies in the life of the community, and, therefore, to treat important matters in a more serious manner. If we desire to ensure the continuity of our present democratic form of government, it is up to us to see that social conditions shall be such that democracy cannot be defeated. This is the plea I am making this afternoon, particularly to ministerial supporters who can influence the Government to put into operation the machinery to give effect to the ideals which I have outlined. Surely they will not turn a deaf ear to my appeal. Lf wc desire the youth of this country to respond to the call that has been made by the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies), we must give to them the facilities necessary to provide them with a decent livelihood. It is useless to make such an appeal to them, and at the same time deny them the opportunity to enjoy a full and happy life. Supporters of the Government have spoken often of the growth of dictatorships and ideals which are foreign to Australian thought. What is the use of appealing to the loyalty of the coalminers who have to go down into the bowels of the earth in order to earn a wage which, despite what may be said to the contrary, is only a miserable pittance, whilst the owners of mines are able to enjoy all the good things of life and indulge in all sorts of frivolity, such as paying £20,000 or £30,000 for a racehorse? The miners have to accept the crumbs which fall from the owners table. These things should not be forgotten whene ver an appeal i3 being made to the miners. If we inspire our people by just treatment, they will do what we desire them to do.  Before we can give effect to the sentiments expressed in the GovernorGenerals Speech we must bring about a state of affairs in which we can appeal with confidence to the people for an effort for victory in this war, so that the democratic institutions which we value may remain. We must prove to them . that Australia is a country worth defending. We must ensure also that when this conflict is over there will arise in Australia new social conditions under which the people will have a full supply of the necessaries of life. They must not he east back as they were at the end of the last war. They must not bc forced to submit to tribulations like those they suffered during the depression, when so much of what, they had struggled to obtain was taken from them. That spectre must not haunt them in the future. I hope that the Government will guide the destiny of Australia, so that all the good things which we desire for our people shall readily be made available to them.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[1]/continue[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Recent events on the other side of the world have prompted me to speak in support of the motion now before the Senate. On Friday last, after eight months of comparative stagnation, the war suddenly became one of action. The Allies are at last at grips with the enemy. Confidence in the final triumph over Hitlerism must not be associated with an early and easy victory. The struggle is just beginning. Doublecolumn headlines in our daily press announcing some minor or local success must not be taken too seriously. Often what is gained today is lost tomorrow. Illbalanced optimism should bo avoided, but there is no need far pessimism. Extravagantly worded headlines create a wrong impression and magnify a small gain out. of all proportion to the stupendous task before the Allied forces. There is no rosy path to Berlin, a city which we should have entered in November, 1918, and which must be occupied if the German, people are to be convinced of the folly of naziism.  There will be reverses, as there were  iii the Great War. History has shown that a setback is an incentive to. the Briton to redouble his efforts. That will be so again. But a big Allied reverse in the present struggle will have more violent repercussions than any setback in the last war. Nobody can accurately forecast how such repercussions will affect Australia. The situation is such that the time has passed for pinpricking criticisms of the Government. The average citizen does not really know what the Government has accomplished since war was declared in September last. There may be some items on the debit side of the ledger, but there is a far greater number on the credit side. Honorable senators opposite rightly claim to be the  watchdogs  of the countrys business. So are we on this side of the chamber, but we do not bark at anything and everything. Many of my colleagues do as I do tell Ministers where phases of the Governments war policy need closer attention. Because money is plentiful for our war services, there is .a tendency to extravagance. Sometimes it is forced upon the persons concerned because of the noncooperation and selfishness of others, and because of the tendency to make profits out of this unfortunate war. I refer to the high rents paid to wealthy landowners for housing the headquarters of our fighting services in Melbourne. The headquarters staffs were forced out of their usual location at Victoria Barrack? in order to make way for the army of civilian clerks and boards created by war emergency. Accommodation is, of course, necessary for this administrative personnel. Victoria Barracks, Melbourne, is the nervecentre of Australias war effort. From there orders are sent directly or indirectly to every sea,, air, and land unit engaged in the defence of this Commonwealth. It was inevitable that accommodation should be found elsewhere, without delay, for the headquarters of the Australian Imperial Force, the Second Cavalry Division, and the Third and Fourth Divisions now almost at war strength. A house of four or six rooms would be far too small for any one of those divisions, which are now housed in expensive dwellings in an expensive suburb of Melbourne. The rents are exceptionally high. A division in France usually had its headquarters in a cluster of huts. Honorable senators may ask why we cannot do the same here; there is plenty of park land. The answer is that municipal councils are loath to give up even a corner of park land for such a wartime service. All councillors are not so unpatriotic, but others do not seem to realize that a war is in progress. The Government should have power to acquire such space, even if a local cricket or football club be inconvenienced.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Lacking power to do that/ there was no alternative but to take four big houses, at whatever rent was de*manded. It is.. not too late even now to remove these headquarters to certain park lands> to build inexpensive wartime huts, and. to save the present excessive expenditure on rents. .  Whilst discussing governmental expenditure, I urge the Ministers concerned to take ample steps to conserve petrol. From what I can gather there is considerable overlapping in the use of the motor transport allotted to Army and Air Force units. This overlapping became so serious on the western front during the Great War that drastic action had to be taken, and a system of  pickups  and  setdowns  instituted in each corps area. A chit giving authority to use the road was issued to motor transport drivers. If it were found that the reason for taking the road was unsatisfactory, or contravened the orders on the subject from a higher authority, the officer who issued the chit was severely dealt with. The result was a considerable saving of petrol and wear and tear of vehicles and roads. I do not suggest that joyriding, in the full sense of the term, is indulged in, but, certainly, there is need for a system of central control between our capital cities and the various country camps. The roads used by units motor transport ought to be adequately policed by military personnel, in order to check reckless and careless driving. Far too many men are involved in fatal road accidents. The compensation paid must already have reached a very considerable sum. My chief object in speaking today is to urge the Government, in view of the latest developments in Europe, to expedite the training of Australias quota for the Empire air scheme. If what some of my Air Force friends of the last Avar tell me is true, there is need for a general shakeup all round. The Minister  for Air (Mr. Fairbairn), a distinguished Avar pilot, ought to be able to rectify this matter, and so remove from the mind of the man in the street the impression that too much time is wasted at our air training centres. On the army side, much apprehension is felt by exservicemen, not, I am pleased to say, regarding the standard of training the Militia has reached, but because of the inadequate number being trained. The Government announces, from time to time, the strength of the Militia, plus the number of men who have passed into the reserve lists. The last estimate, I think, was 100,000 all told. What is the good of that number? The duties of onefourth of them never take them into the actual battle zone, but are essential in maintaining, supplying, and supporting the real fighting troops. For every one casualty behind the actual fighting units, there are 20 in the latter units. Are we building up a proportional and larger reserve of trained men for actual frontline service to make good inevitable wastage, should Ave ever he called upon to take the field ? At the rate Ave are training men the answer definitely is No ! The obvious solution is to call up every male person up to and including the age of 25 years, and not merely the 2021 yearold personnel. Nothing short of 400,000 fit men, either serving iu the Militia or in the Militia reserve, will suffice. Most military men in high positions1 know that the callingup of a few thousands of men aged 20 to 21 years makes only a piecemeal contribution to our Australian army. T: venture to say m a:t. the great majority :of our fit young men will welcome the opportunity to play their part. A second batch of the 2021 years quota of national service personnel has recently gone into camp. These youngfellows will finish their four months training and return to their civil occupations, as the first batch did, healthier and better citizens. What is more, they Will in future turn a deaf ear to ardent peace advocates who are bedmates of Moscowinspired, underground disrupters anxious to see the British Empire go under in this Avar. How disappointed must the opponents of universal military training have been, when it was found how readily these young men fitted themselves into camp life and how enthusiastically they took up their duties. After the first month they were hardly distinguishable from those with longer service in the Militia. They were certainly highspirited but they..; were amenable *to. the discipline peculiar  to the old  Digger . Many of these young fellows went into camp as raw recruits, but came out with noncommissioned officer rank. For the good of the nation in these critical days, and for the benefit of our young men themselves, I hope that the Government will soon announce the extension of national service in our home defence army to include every fit young man up to the age of 25 years. We never know what is before us. It is best to be well prepared for any emergency. Finally, I shall refer to the rising cost of certain foodstuffs. The Prices Commission has done well since its appointment at the beginning of the war. Prices generally have been kept well in hand, and have not bounded up as they did during the last war. Many people do not understand, nor arc they told by opponents of the Government, that the prices of commodities brought from overseas will invariably rise, owing to shipping shortages and the higher wartime freight and insurance rates, due to the risks entailed in transportation. I can usually explain that to those who complain to me about rising prices, and they are invariably satisfied with my reply; but I cannot explain to the working man, who usually has a large family, why the prices of bread, meat and dried fruits should rise when we produce wheat and the other commodities in large quantities in this country. I can point out to them, with partial justification, that the producers of these foodstuffs must live and sell their surplus overseas in order to make both mds meet, but I myself am not satisfied that there should be an increase of prices. I hope that the Prices Commission will take steps to keep down prices of such foodstuffs as are necessary for the proper nutrition of the large families of working men, who always seem to  get it in the neck  when a war is on. The sacrifice should be more evenly distributed throughout the whole of the community.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[2]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He usually offers candid and constructive criticism of the Government, and he has not failed to do so on this occasion. I have no=doubt. that the Government will take notice of his remarks. Personally I have no great enthusiasm for the discussion of the motion for the adoption of the Address.inReply to the GovernorGenerals Speech because I have in mind the grim reality of war, and what it means to the people of Australia. Our very existence as a free country is at stake, and any criticism that I may offer to the Government will be given more in sorrow than in anger. Yet we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that the administrative acts of the Government should at all times be subjected to the closest scrutiny. Honorable senators often talk about the necessity to tune in with Great Britain, and it seems to me that this should be done at the present time. Personally, I have been greatly perturbed by the inertia and complacency of the present Government. For at least the last three years war clouds have appeared on the horizon, and we have feared that war would break out at any time; but the Government has been slow to take action to provide for the defence of Australia and for an adequate contribution by this country to the defence of the Empire. The Government has disregarded the warnings of its critics, particularly those of the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives (Mr. Curtin), who, two or three years ago, almost pleaded with the Government to embark upon, a vigorous policy of aircraft construction and the training of pilots and crews for the defence of Australia and the Empire. The advice of our Leader was not only rejected, but also ridiculed, both by the Government and the press. I claim that the advice then given was very sound, and it is pleasing to know that even at this late stage the Government is making an effort to enable Australia to play its full part in the war. Had proper preparations been put in hand two or three years ago, we could have accomplished much more in this regard than stands to our credit today.

One of the reasons for the past inactivity of the parties* now in office was that defencep reparations . involve v .the . taxing >of theirfriends. This is borne out by the fact that, so late as two years ago, when war was practically upon us, our total defence expenditure was only £6,000,000, and last year it was only a little over £7,000,000, whereas this year it will amount to nearly £100,000,000. Those figures do not reflect careful defence organization. However much we on this side criticized i he Government for its failure to prepare adequately for defence, our attitude was misrepresented by honorable senators opposite. Labour enjoys an admirable record so far as defence is concerned. Our navy was established by the first Labour Government to take office in this Parliament, and that action was taken in the face of bitter opposition by the political predecessors of supporters of this Government. Those gentlemen sneered at Fishers proposal to establish an Australian Navy. Their idea of defending this country, as part of the British Commonwealth of Nations, was ro borrow money from Great Britain with which to buy a battleship and to present the battleship to Great Britain.

I enjoyed the friendship of the late Mr. Andrew Fisher, and I know that at the time when he was doing yeoman service in the interests of the defence of this country, particularly in regard to compulsory military training,  he was accused of desiring to wreck the marriage tie. Today, however, honorable senators opposite refer to him as a Labour man of the right type. Should Senator Dein live long enough politically, which I very much doubt, he will bc able to say some day that I was a Labour man of the right type. The Labour party is fully seised of tie importance of preserving the privileges which our people now enjoy. More than any other section of the community our working people have reason to preserve our democratic; liberties. We are fast approaching the stage when, owingto the determination of the majority of the people, Australias resources will bo used for the benefit not of a few, but of the people as a whole. Only in this way can we hope to enable Australia to grow up. The wealth of this country must be used for the benefit of those who really produce it* This Government has failed completely to take adequate action to protect these shores, with the result that we find that wo. are unable to do all wc should like to do immediately to help the Allies win the war. Simply because we on this side do not agree with the Governments policy, our attitude is misrepresented. Honorable senators opposite repeatedly say,  Why do you not come and join us ? An intelligent Opposition can render great service to the country in the present emergency. It is quite possible that had we not been in opposition, the Governments proposal to grant a monopoly of the manufacture of motor cars would never have been questioned. Labours first concern in the present crisis is the safety of Australia. That also is the first concern of every man and woman in this country. Consequently, every one should make the maximum effort to preserve all of those things which wc hold dear. We should do our utmost to stem, the brutal onslaught of our enemies. The present is no time for pinpricking criticism, or for any .activity which tends to disrupt the community. So far as industrial strife is concerned [ am convinced that we have reached a stage when strikes are no longer of advantage to the workers, or to the community as a whole. We should march along democratic lines. For instance, the money which has been expended in connexion with the present coal strike could have been much more profitably and wisely devoted to political education among the workers concerned, with the object of securing greater representation in Parliament and having their grievances adjusted in a constitutional way. A desire for unity in our war effort is  evident among the people as a whole. I have been inundated with correspondence from persons in all parts of Queensland, seeking guidance as to how they can contribute to our war effort. So far the Government seems to be concerned only with the idea of roping in the boys of this country. The peril now confronting Australia is immediate, and, consequently, the services of every section of our people should be utilized forthwith in order to strengthen the defence of Australia. The Government, however, seems to have no concern with the organization of our people, other than the boys, whom it is content to train for a period of three months. If our difficulties prove to be so great as now seems likely the Governments attack on defence problems is somewhat belated. Had it been a little more active in: this direction three ot four years ago, . I am sure that the people would have supported it. Today it. is rushing into huge expenditure, which threatens to upset our economy. No doubt, it hesitated to deal with this matter at the right time, because it refused to face up to the taxation problem involved. However, it is now forced, by the necessity of the nation, to come to grips with it. I have no desire to hamper the Governments defence policy, but we on this side can do a service to the country by protecting the interests of the workers in respect of defence measures.  Much has been said in this debate concerning the present coal strike. So soon as the Government is confronted with really important problems, such as those which concern the wheat  industry, for instance, instead of attempting to solve them it turns its attention to the activities of a few alleged Communists. In the past primary producers struggled for the establishment of orderly control of production, but such proposals were bitterly opposed by Nationalist governments. However, in a time of war this Government suddenly discovers that it is beyond the  ability of individuals, or of private enterprise, to control primary production efficiently. I hope that after the war the Government will retain at least some share of the control which it has now assumed over primary production and marketing, and so continue to protect the interests of our producers. I am greatly perturbed at the position of the countrys finances. It will be very difficult for us to borrOW overseas. This Government was incapable of visualizing the possibility of war, and the difficulties arising therefrom. It relied upon the belief that improved prices for our exportable commodities would enable us to finance our overseas requirements. Today, however, we are unable to secure sufficient shipping for the transport of those commodities. I can only regret that, this Government did not have the foresight to provide for such a position as now confronts us. The Scullin Government endeavoured to implement a sound policy for the encouragement of secondary industries, by building up the home market. Dependence on overseas markets is a rotten basis on which to build the economy of our country, because it involves not only acceptance of world parity prices, which may be unpayable, but also competition with industries subsidized by governments in other countries.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[3]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I do not now reflect in any way upon the honorable senator who has just interjected. However, the policy of the Country party has been that our producers should sell on overseas markets at any old price. They are not concerned that such a policy means low wages for the man on the land. The Scullin Government implemented a sound policy for the encouragement of secondary industries in Australia. With the object of building up the home market, it greatly curtailed imports. If succeeding governments had continued that policy our economic position today would be much sounder. The only suggestion the present Government can make for overcoming existing economic difficulties is that we should borrow overseas the money we require for defence. This is on all fours with the defence policy enunciated in Fishers day by predecessors of honorable senators opposite borrow from  Great Britain to buy a battleship and then present it to Great Britain. The present standard of living in this country can be maintained only so long as we are able to find employment for all of our people. Our young men and women must be given economic security in order that they may be enabled to marry and have families. That is the best way in which to populate any country. However, we are not encouraging industrial development along sound lines. In this connexion I mention the cotton industry in Queensland. Today we are importing nearly all of our requirements of cotton goods, although with a little encouragement from this Government,, such as the provision of irrigation in suitable areas, this industry could quickly be developed to a stage at which it could supply all of the lIn W cotton we need for manufacture.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[3]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am pleased that, on reflection, it decided to persevere with its assistance.  I shall deal briefly with some of the factors which tend to hamper the development of industry generally in this country. The Treasurer (Mr. .Spender} is a little more radical in his views than were most of his predecessors. High interest rates constitute one of the greatest handicaps to industry at the present time, and make it almost impossible for us to compete with overseas producers. If the Government is able to limit interest rates it will be doing something that will be of very great assistance to Australia generally. This may not bc an appropriate time to discuss social legislation, but I believe that the Federal Parliament should long ago have instituted a system of widows pensions. In fact, it is a blot on our good name that nothing has so far been done in this direction. A widow, with three or four children to look after, is doing a full time job, and it is the bounden duty of the community to provide her with an income that will enable her to bring those children up properly.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[3]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

For my part, I do not criticize the Governments courage or confidence, but I do criticize its complacency. That is what is disturbing the people at the present time, so that when the electors had an opportunity to express their opinion a little while ago they did so by defeating the Government candidate in the Corio byelection. The Government cannot afford to go on ignoring the people. Were it not for the war, I am convinced that the Government would be defeated at the next general elections, because the people desire the country to be governed in such a way as to give the working people a fair deal, while assisting industry in every way that is necessary.

Senator Amour accused the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited of having overcharged, the Government in respect of a contract for the production of shells, and said that the amount overcharged had to bc paid back. The true facts are that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited was informed by the Government that it could have a contract for the production of 15,000 shells at i.271 the price at which similar shells were being made at a government establishment. The company accepted the terms offered, and finished the contract. It then discovered that the cost of production was 7s. 6d. a shell less than the contract price. It approached the Contract Board and sought to have the contract price reduced by 7s. 6d. a shell. The Contract Board said We cannot alter the contract; if we lower the price in one instance we may be asked to raise it in another, and that would be a bad precedent. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited immediately sent the board a cheque for approximately £6,000, representing 7s. 6d. each on 15,000 shells.

The number of factory employees today, because of the national war effort, is greater than it has ever been previously in the history of Australia.  The only place where there is no employment is on the coalfields, and the .unemployment there is of the miners own making. In this time of national crisis, when we are turning out munitions for the Imperial Government, when we are producing steel of all kinds, and airraid shelters which are sent overseas, the whole of our defensive operations are threatened by the coalminers. Honorable senators opposite, instead of standing solidly behind : the Government, openly encourage the coalminers to throw thousands of persons out of employment and to hold up the national defence effort. If they were sincere and genuine in the statements they have made, they would have stood wholeheartedly behind the Government when trouble first threatened three months ago. They would have said to the coalminers, You cannot do this in a time like the present , and they would have been listened to by the men. But they chose to sit back and not utter a word of blame against the attack by the coalminers on the safety of the people. The reason behind the coal strike is so absurd that one wonders that honorable senators who claim to represent the people should lend it any support. The men who actually work the coal, representing 85 per cent, of the total number employed in the mines, already had a 40hour week from bank to bank. Only 15 per cent, of the surface men, such as firemen and others, were denied it, and even they received higher wages for fewer hours work than the ordinary men in any other industry doing the same class of work under similar conditions. Yet the whole of the mines were thrown idle in an attempt to blackmail the Australian nation, with the result that the manufacture of munitions is being hampered, thousands of men have been thrown out of employment, and the whole of the domestic arrangements of the civil population have been upset. Not one leader in the ranks of honorable senators opposite has the pluck to tell the miners that they are wrong.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[4]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Certain provisions of his a ward could only properly be made by a bench of three judges. Honorable senators opposite, and their supporters outside, while attacking the judges of the Arbitration Court, desire us to believe that they support the principle of arbitration. Their contentions in certain regards are intensely humourous, but 1 cannot see how they can expect to reconcile the contradictions to the satisfaction of the public. The employers are expected to abide by the awards of the Arbitration Court and, apart from a few isolated exceptions, they do so; but the employees, it seems, must be free to go their own way. Some of them are saying, in effect,  We shall not accept the courts award. We shall appeal to Hitlerism. We shall blackmail the business community, and hold it to ransom, because the Arbitration Court has not given us what we want. It has been said that a former Prime Minister (Mr. Bruce) desired to abolish industrial arbitration ; but that is not the true position. The fact is that there is a great deal of overlapping under the Commonwealth and State arbitration systems. Mr. Bruce, being sick of this overlapping and the consequential legal entanglements in attempting to decide whether a dispute existed or not, said: Let us clarify the position. Let the people say whether the Commonwealth or the States shall have full . authority in the field of industrial arbitration . When the people were consulted they indicated clearly that they were not favorable to Commonwealth evacuation of the field of industrial arbitration: Honorable senators opposite say that they are favorable to arbitration and the adoption of constitutional methods for the redress of their grievances, but now that they have an oppor tunity to adhere to their declared views on this subject they are curiously inactive.  Surprising contrasts are to be observed when we compare our position in this war with our position in the last war. I have been a member of Parliament during two wars. During the last war, apart from a few pacifists and eccentric humanitarians, we were a united people; but on this occasion, when the issues are, if possible, more vital and the risks greater than in the last war, we are not united.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[5]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I interjected that it was not so. However, that is a matter that could well be left alone now. I admire men who, of their own free will, offer themselves in the service of their country. It is unfortunate that Senator Leckie should endeavour to place class against class by suggesting that those with whom he is associated bear a much heavier proportion of taxes than any other section of the community. Perhaps the honorable senator is not aware that 1,000 persons in Australia share £8,000,000 annually, while there are 1,500,000 whose wages do not exceed £5 weekly. Unfortunately, thousands who do not receive any wages at all have to depend on sustenance from the State in order to live.

The Opposition is powerless in that respect.

Not one member or supporter of the Government has mentioned the fact that the AttorneyGeneral (Mr. Hughes) did not attribute to the miners all of the blame for the closing of the coalmines. He said that the owners were also at fault and certainly were not exempt from just criticism. I, and other members of the Labour party, want to see an early settlement of this dispute. Therefore, I strongly resent Senator Leckies attempt to belittle the efforts of our leader. Our colleague Senator Cameron is also bending all his energies to end the trouble. That is why he is not in this chamber tonight.  Communism and its alleged association with the Labour party have been the subject of a great deal of talk recently. The Labour party stands, as it has always stood, for constitutional methods for the introduction of social and political reforms. In that way it is opposed to the Communist party, which believes in revolutionary action. Senator Dein has admitted that there have been good Labour governments in Australia. The constitutional reforms which they effected are enduring monuments to their memory, and we may confidently expect similar achievements in the not distant future when the people decide once more to entrust the reins of office to Labour. It has been well said that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance. This is emphasized in connexion with wartime censorship in Australia by means of which various organizations, without a vestige of Communist tendencies, have been deprived of the right of free speech. Many electors in Western Australia have asked me to protest against the unfair method of applying censorship. None of them has association with any of the foreigners who are said to come to this country in order to cause disruption.

The right to free speech and free expression of thought through thepress we feel, is the main, principle underlying democracy, and any attempt to restrict this privilege makes us wonder where we are heading. Has not our Prime Minister on many occasions stated that he does not seek, however long the conflict, to restrict the right to free speech and criticism? Is not the war itself being fought to retain this very right that is now being partly taken from us by the recent promulgation? The action taken will prevent the full presentation of views on the conduct of the war. Censorship1 shall presumably be of comment or criticism made by persons regarding the prosecution of the, war: and who shall be the judge of whethera criticism is in the best interests of the country or not? My board feels that the regulations, if permitted to continue, will make of our democracy a laughing stock, and suggests that urgent and deep consideration be immediately given the matter with the object of restoring the rights that every British subject is fighting for.  The following points effectively coverthe views of my board: (1)It denies one section of the Australian public (not by any means only the Communists) the right offree speech. (2)It gives a departmental chief power by regulation to declare any newspaper a Communist newspaper . without adducing a shred of evidence in proof, and thereby to subject it to the new restrictions. (3). Under this regulation already, several newspapers, which cannot without gross exaggeration be called  Communist , have been subjected to the restrictions. (4)The subjects listed as banned for publication are not necessarily subjects which, if mentioned, would beof value to the enemy, but which may be inconvenient to the Government. (5)Other newspapers which do not come under the regulations will bo allowed to publish facts and views relating to these matters.

The statements contained in the letter which I have just read are correct. One of the valued privileges for which we are fighting today, is the right of free speech. I agree that some censorship of publications and public statements is necessary in wartime; but I believe that the restrictions now imposed are too severe, and T. fear that this system may be maintained even when the war is ended. Unfair discrimination is shown in that some newspapers are allowed to publish articles on certain subjects, whereas other newspapers are not permitted to mention them.  The training of aerial gunners isan important aspect of Australian defence measures. We all believe that this country should be well equipped with fighting planes and I am pleased that the Government has decided to increase our air strength. It is, however, regrettable that certain weaknesses have been disclosed in the training of aerial gunners. Although eight months lave elapsed since the outbreak of the war, it was not until a few weeks ago that an aerial gunnery instructor was sent to the Pearce Aerodrome iu Western Australia. Air Force pilots must undergo rigid tests before they are passed as fit for active service. Since aeroplanes travel at speeds of 200 and 500 miles an hour, the efficiency of aerial gunners is of particular importance to the safety of both pilots and aeroplanes. Therefore, their training should be as comprehensive as that of pilots. In order to conserve overseas exchange the Government has, since the commencement of the war, imposed severe restrictions on imports to this country. We all recognize the necessity for these drastic measures, which bring in their train a certain amount of unemployment.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","FRASER, James","KKR","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","I hope that some such amendment will be made. Representations have been made to the Commonwealth Treasurer by the Government of Western Australia on behalf of companies operating lowgrade mines in that State. Many of them are not producing to their full capacity because restrictive measures have prevented the importation of the necessary machinery to operate them profitably. The Premier of Western Australia has asked the Commonwealth Government to make available sufficient money to provide those mines with the machinery that is needed. The total cost would be about £250,000. The money was not available when war broke out, and later, because of restrictions imposed by the Imperial Government the matter of financing the installation of the machinery necessary for the development of the mines was stopped. Consequently, mines have had to reduce production drastically. Serious consideration should be given by the Government to this matter, since gold will continue to play an important part in the provision of the funds required to meet our overseas commitments. N.G.M. Limited, at Nevoria, on the Yilgarn goldfield, has, under the management of Mr. G. Lovell, expended £72,000 on development, and has disclosed supplies of ore sufficient to warrant the erection of a treatment plant of a capacity of from 5,000 to 10,000 tons monthly. It was on the point of obtaining the further capital necessary for plant purposes in London, when tfe war ended negotiations. The ore resen ts of the Ora Banda United Gold Mine, at Ora. Banda are in the vicinity of 500,000 tons, valued at 4.35 dwt. a ton, indicating that a plant of the capacity of from 20,000 to 30,000 tons monthly is warranted. A large developmental expenditure of over £100,000 took place on the property, and the manager, a young Englishman, returned to London just before the war to discuss the provision of a plant. The war interrupted operations, and finance not being forthcoming, the property is now under exemption. The manager himself was recalled to his English regiment. There are a number of other mines involved in this project and the machinery necessary with the exception of some power units can be manufactured in Australia. I do not suggest that the Government should advance £250,000 either to the Government of Western Australia or to these mining companies ; but if  the necessary capital could be provided, arrangements could probably be made for the mining companies to pay back, say, 10 per cent, of the value of the gold won. This would not only reduce unemployment in Western Australia, but also provide new wealth. Although defence expenditure in respect of Western Australia has been authorized to the amount of £600,000, much of that money will be expended in other parts of the Commonwealth from which necessary materials are obtained.  A statement regarding the position of the wheat industry has been made by the Leader of the Country party (Mr. Archie Cameron), and no doubt his remarks will cause some surprise even to Senator Johnston.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[5]/para[16]","N/A","N/A"

The meeting recommended that a reexamination of such appraisements be made. It also requested that the average prices per lb. be published immediately each appraisement was completed, giving also the average appraised price for each State. The Commonwealth Government was requested to appoint a royal commission to inquire into the pro,duction costs of the wool industry.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[5]/quote[5]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

Apparently, the Minister could not resist the emoluments of office; but before he accepted office he fought the Government on these matters. Now he declares that the wheat and woolgrowers have had a fair deal.  Honorable senators on this side will always be prepared to help the Government in its prosecution of the war. However, the Government can hardly expect us to agree with it upon every detail of its proposals. Criticism will be necessary, and we shall not hesitate to voice it. I can only hope that the Government will be prepared to accept our criticism in the spirit in which it is offered. The Government .deserves censure, for instance, for bringing troops from Western Australia to Ingleburn for military training, at a. cost of £22 a head. That was sheer waste of money, because every facility exists in Western Australia for the training of recruits. It was stated that these troops were brought to Ingleburn for brigade training. If such training cannot be given in Western Australia, recruits from that State will have an opportunity to obtain it on disembarkation overseas.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[5]/para[22]","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","FRASER, James","KKR","N/A","N/A","N/A","764","I shall do so. Here are the facts as I obtained them in an inquiry which I made as the result of the widespread dissatisfaction voiced against the scheme  The State Committee constituted under the apple and pear acquisition scheme made the following appointments : Mr. C. H. Merry to be supervising secretary. Mr. Merry is a public accountant, who is also secretary of the Fruit Shippers Association. Mr. Cansdale as secretary. Mr. Cansdale is an employee of Westralian Farmers Limited, which is allied with Producers Markets and Mount Barker Cooperative. Westralian Farmers Limited is a very large cooperative concern covering all sections of commerce and ships fruit and vegetables to northwest ports, Darwin, and overseas. Mr. Q. Lantzke, as assistant marketing officer. Mr. Lantzke is a son of the chairman, Mr. F. W. Lantzke. and previously worked in his fathers business. A fruit assembly, committee was formed comprising the fruit shipping firms, to carry out the work of assembly in the country. The address of this committee is that of the supervising secretary, Mr. Merry, and the firms represented are Patersons Limited, Westralian Farmers Limited, George Wills and Company (Burridge and Warren), and some smaller companies. These firms were to be paid 1Jd. or lid. a case for this work, and with at least 800,000 cases to be handled will receive £5,000 for their work. Export licences have also been limited to the firms mentioned, who are well represented on the committee, and also on the staff of same. One of the first actions of the committee was to circularize all growers giving details of how to pack, etc. Growers were informed that the central packing sheds must be used as far as possible. These are owned by Patersons and Westralian Farmers Limited, who are well represented on the committee. Growers were ordered not to put their name on the case, thereby losing all their goodwill, but packing houses such as Mount Barker Cooperative and Patersons had their name on the cases and Patersons had the apples wrapped in special paper with their name on it. When challenged, it was said that the prohibition only applied to growers. One company, F. Emery Limited, has specialized in export of fruit and vegetables to the northwest ports and Darwin. In addition an attempt has been made to extend its operations to Singapore and Malay States, so far with success. The Assistant Minister for Commerce (Senator McBride) inspected this firms methods when in Perth during last year and complimented it on its special packing arrangements. F. Emery Limited was refused an export licence for apples and pears because it exported only 64 cases last year. This firm is only young, and the ridiculous position is that it can export oranges, grapes, vegetables and salads, but cannot send apples or pears to its clients. The companys rival in this trade is Patersons Limited, which is represented on the committee. Emery recently wanted 25 cases of apples for a client in the north, and when he applied, to the committee he was supplied with apples, with Patersons label on the case and name on the papa on each apple. Surely a. good way of advertising to a rivals client! If th, apples are the property of the Commonwealth, why should this company bo allowed to show ite name at all ? Licences have been issued to five auctioneers and four private treaty merchants operating in the metropolitan markets. Before considering the applications the committee demanded detailed information about each applicants business, number of cases sold for previous year, prices, etc. Applicants felt that Unnecessary details were asked for, especially when three of the members of the committee were engaged actively in the markets in opposition to them. This information could be used to the benefit of those licensees sitting on the committee. Originally it was laid down by the committee that only merchants handling 10,000 cases or more would be considered. One merchant, a returned soldier with eight children, was refused, and only when the Returned Soldiers League made inquiries did he receive consideration. But this man has been severely handicapped by the distribution of the fruit by the committee and only received single lots except on rare occasions. He cannot obtain a line that is 10/20 cases., from the same grower and the same variety, size and grade. He has been forced to purchase his supplies from another licensee on thi3 account. In the licence, which has to be read to be believed, there is a clause which stifles all criticism of the committee, its officers and its actions. If any licensee says anything derogatory or does not at all times assist the committee to the utmost of his ability, his licence can be withdrawn without advancing any reason whatsoever.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[5]/continue[34]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

At the outset of my speech I would like to commend those responsible for the formation of the Coalition Government, representing members of the United Australia party and the Country party, that has been formed during the time that Parliament has been in recess. It is gratifying to note that the Prime Minister is now assured of a majority in both Houses of Parliament to assist in providing the maximum efficiency in Australias Avar effort. The addition of Country party members to the Cabinet will also give direct representation of the country interests affecting so many of the population of Australia. It is now sometime since the GovernorGeneral delivered his Speech at the opening of this Parliament, and many changes have taken place since then. The greater part of the Speech dealt with matters arising out of the war, and in the interval since that Speech was delivered we, in common with the rest of the civilized world, have been astounded again and again at the ruthless audacity ofHerr Hitler and his Government. When we listened to His Excellencys Speech, Denmark and Norway had been invaded, but now Holland and Belgium are fighting for their existence against German aggression, and already thousands of casualties have occurred. The difference between ourselves and Germany lies largely in this : Germany has accepted without reservation the doctrine that might is right. By a series of lightning strokes Germany has overcome one small nation after another by sheer weight of numbers and superiority of equipment. Great Britain and its Allies are also mighty, and they have right on their side as well. They are using their power in defence of small nations, and for the preservation of the liberties of weaker peoples. They. have set themselves up as a barrier between the atrocities of Hitlerism and the rest of Europe. They are fighting now in defence of their democratic principles, for the freedom of the individual, freedom of speech, and the freedom of the press. Individual rights were abolished in Germany a long time ago. Even the rights of the family have been invaded, and parents no longer enjoy the power to educate and control their children as they think fit, and to choose their careers for them. This right has been assumed by the State, and family life, as we know it, has almost ceased to exist. The Empire and its allies, though under an initial disadvantage, are striving heroically to check the spread of these evil doctrines of naziism.  Members of the Opposition have said that the Government is very dilatory in its handling of Australias war effort. Ten years ago the. whole of the defence, system of this country was broken down.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","COOPER, Walter","JQP","N/A","N/A","N/A","766","I ask the honorable senator that question. The Scullin administration was responsible. I do not say that Australia was singular in that respect. At that time the great nations of the world were suffering from the malady known as warsickness, and that will probably occur again at the termination of the present outbreak. The people naturally get tired of war effort. Wo were living in an atmosphere of false security. Military training was suspended, troops were disbanded, and war vessels were sunk, while all the time our present enemy was secretly arming. Prior to that our navy was fully manned, our air force such as it was was in good condition, and our military training was equal to that of any other country. When the need for preparedness again became apparent,it was not an easy matter to get back the men who formed the basis of that training, and reerect the whole of the fabric that had been destroyed. As Senator Keane is well aware, we are an entirely democratic community. Honorable senators are elected to represent the views of all sections in each of the States. Nine years ago it was not an easy matter to convince the people of the necessity for making an immediate start to build up a huge defence force. Until the last two years, on account of the isolation of Australia, it lias been very difficult to make the people realize the apprehension and fear of attack felt by the people of Europe. Even now a large number of people in this country do not realize the gravity of the position in which Australia stands in consequence of the recent massed attacks in Belgium and Holland. Understanding of the realities of the situation has to be developed in the public mind. In that regard, the Government has received no assistance from our honorable friends opposite. In the years that have gone, general elections have been fought on a moderate war policy, and during the whole of that period the Government has received no assistance from honorable senators opposite in its efforts to establish a strong defence force. The Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives missed an excellent opportunity when he criticized the defence policy of the late Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) upon the return of that gentleman from Great Britain, after having consulted the British defence authorities. Had the Leader of the Opposition agreed at that time to assist in the development of a strong defence force, instead of criticizing the Prime Minister of the day and leading the people to believe that there was no necessity for alarmist propaganda, he would have had a good chance of obtaining control of the treasury bench. If honorable senators are frank they will admit that the Government has done a good job in respect of defence.  When what the Government has done during the last, two years is quietly studied, no criticism can be levelled at it. At the end of the last war, the only ammunition made in Australia was 303, and very little of that was produced. The Australian troops in Prance were supplied with Canadian ammunition and rifles. At the present time not only our own troops, but also those of Great Britain and New Zealand, as well as the Singapore base, are supplied with small arms ammunition, that is made in this country.

At the end of the last, war, however, those works employed only just over 2,000 men. Honorable senators opposite have particularly stressed the need for Australia to manufacture everything that is required to prosecute our war effort. Members of the Government party have shown by the results that have been obtained that they agree with that contention. Practically the whole of the criticism from honorable senators opposite has been confined to pettifogging details, and has ignored large issues. Senators Sheehan, Aylett. Brown and I yesterday had an opportunity to see what the Maribymong works can do. We saw only a small section of the works. 3 saw the same section eighteen months ago, and its output today is more than treble what it then was. Yet the Opposition says that the Government has clone nothing. The Department of Supply and Development has been responsible for that expansion. To it is due the credit for the turning out of the two guns which were handed over to the military authorities for testing last Monday. The workmanship in these guns is equal to the best in any part of the world. I was told that when the blue prints were sent to Australia the statement was made that it would take the workmen of this country three years to produce those two guns; yet they were . produced in ten months. A year or two ago, when it was suggested that machinery for ,: th making of munitions should be purchased overseas, even from Germany, we were criticized and were asked why : it could not be manufactured in Australia. In the Maribyrnong works I saw machines from practically every country in the world. A very good machine which was purchased from Germany is doing excellent work there. .The Government deserves credit for its foresight in this direction. Critics had to admit that these machines could not be manufactured in Australia. Munitions could be produced in hundreds of thousands of tons only by obtaining the machines that we needed before the outbreak, of war made it impossible to purchase them from foreign countries or even from Great Britain. I understand that the Department of Supply and Development intends to expand its operations further, and that before long 17,000 .persons will be employed .at these works. While inspecting the shellmaking department of the works, I was struck by the fact that if we were short of men for this class of work, as we probably shall be before the war ends, much of it could be done by women, as it was in England during the last war, and probably is at the present time. A certain number of mechanics who have had some training could be released and trained for service as air force mechanics, of which there is probably a shortage at the moment. If this were done a good number of men could be released for the fighting services, where they are already greatly needed, and will probably become much more needed as time goes on.  The Government has dealt in a very effective way with our surplus raw materials. Almost immediately after the outbreak of war Cabinet took this matter in hand, and within a little while had completed deals that stand out as among the most successful that we have known in this country, lt was eighteen months after the outbreak of the last war before anything effective had been done to dispose of our surplus primary products, whereas negotiations were in hand only three weeks after the declaration of this war. In a very little while much of the ground work had been covered, and several disposal projects had been practically completed. Our wool had been sold to the British Government and appraisements were actually being made within about three weeks. During the .recent parliamentary recess I travelled through a number of wool growing districts in Queensland, and I found that the majority of the woolgrowers were satisfied with the prices they were getting for their wool. Whilst I do not deny that some growers were discontented, I could produce hundreds of letters from other woolgrowers indicating that they are perfectly satisfied with the position. Whereas they received an average of only 10£d. per lb. for their wool last year, they will receive an average of 13$d. per lb. this year. If honorable senators who represent Western Autralia had interviewed the woolgrowers of that State and put the position to them frankly, as 1 have done to many woolgrowers in Queensland, they would have been well repaid for their Work. The woolgrowers of Australia will not only receive something like Id. per lb. above their valuation, but ultimately they will also receive the 10 per cent, that is being retained and is earning interest.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[6]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","COOPER, Walter","JQP","N/A","N/A","N/A","768","I was informed that my case would be considered. It was inevitable that in a scheme involving between £60,000,000 and £70,000,000 some anomalies would occur During the first year of the appraisement scheme during the last war, the returns of the woolgrowers were down 9.2 per cent, on the official valuations. Under the first appraisements on this occasion they may be still further down. However, I feel quite satisfied that, in the aggregate, all the growers will finally receive a better price this year than they obtained last year.  In any case honorable senators should look at the alternative to the scheme. Had the British Government not purchased our wool it would have been left on our:.hands until we could effect sales overseas and arrange the necessary shipping. We must all realize that the shipping problem itself would have been extremely difficult. Under the Governments scheme all a. grower has to do is to convey his wool to the nearest appraisement centre. I shall not discuss at the moment whether there should, or should not, be additional appraisement centres, except to observe that I agree with Senator Eraser that in large States like Western Australia and Queensland, additional appraisement centres should be established by the Central Wool Committee. In Queensland there is one appraisement centre only, situated at Brisbane, in the southeastern corner of the State. The . large woolgrowing centre of northern Queensland has to send wool to the seaboard ports and ship it to Brisbane, involving in many cases 1,000 miles of sea freight. Appraisement centres could be granted with advantage to both central and northern Queensland. After :i appraisement wool from the centres mentioned could be shipped directly overseas, thereby making a saving in the handling of the wool. I think it quite likely that in the future there may be fewer appraisement centres in some States. My main point at the moment is that under the existing scheme the woolgrower receives his cheque, as a rule, about four weeks after his wool is appraised, and he is then finished with the whole matter. He does not have to bother about the destination of the wool. Even if the ship carrying it should be sunk at sea he is not adversely affected, for that is a matter that concerns the British Government. Moreover, the woolgrowers will be entitled, after the war, to 50 per cent, of any profits on resale to other than Allied interests.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[6]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We do not know whether raw wool, tops, or the finished  Article will be brought into the reckoning. Some ships carrying wool, for which the growers had already been paid, have been sunk, but such losses are borne by the British Government and are not offset against the profit on resales. On the whole, I consider that the woolgrowers are being well treated. They are selling their wool at quite a reasonable price. The wheatgrowers are in a more difficult position, mainly because wheat is not in so much demand as wool. Shipping is an important factor here also. If it is possible to obtain wheat from some muchnearer source than Australia, time and shipping being vital factors, the British Government would be fully entitled to take advantage of the nearest source of supply. Time is of the essence of the contract with us as it is with Germany. If we are to win the war we must consider the strategical movement of war supplies as well as of troops. Our wool is urgently needed overseas, whereas our wheat is not. The fact should not be overlooked that within the last few years the wheatgrowers of Australia have received a great deal of assistance from the Commonwealth Government. Whilst I sympathize with the wheatgrowers of Western Australia, I must direct attention to the fact that our first job is to win the war. That is vital to us, just as it is to Great Britain. Obviously, if Great Britain be defeated we shall be defeated. In that event we shall lose not only our wheat but also the land upon which it is grown.. It is, therefore, surely our first duty to concentrate upon the job of winning the war.

Unless we do that we shall lose everything we have.  I wish now to discuss for a few moments the important subject of interest rates. Those who wish to be fair to the Government must admit that in this respect it has done well and deserves commendation. Interest rates have undoubtedly been kept at a reasonably low figure. I do not remember what, the position was eight months after the outbreak of the last war. I am given to understand that interest rates at that time were very high. When I returned to Australia in 1920, after my service overseas, I found that interest rates were higher still. The Monthly Review of Business Statistics for March, 1940, issued by the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics, shows that in 192829 the interest rates on fixed deposits varied from 4 per cent, for three months to 4$ per cent for twelve months, and 5 per cent, for 24 months. In March, 194)0, the rates varied from 1.75 per cent, for three months to 2.5 per cent, for twelve months, and 2.75 per cent, for 24 months. The interest rate for deposits with the Commonwealth Savings Bank was 3.9 per cent, in .192829 and 2 per cent, in March, 1940. The yield on Australian consolidated bonds of all issues was 5.35 per cent, in 192829, and in March, 1940, it was 3.52 per cent. In March, 1940, the yield for 1941, 4 per cent, issues, was 3.13 per cent.; for 1944 and 1947, 4 per cent, issues, it was 3.32 per cent. ; and for 1950 to 1961, 4 per cent, issues, it was 3.60 per cent. The figures relating to rates of interest on first mortgages for New South Wales are also very informative. In February, 1940, 17 per ient. of such mortgages were at 4J per cent, or under, 31 per cent, were at over 4i per cent, and up to 5 per cent., 39 per cent, were at more than 5 per cent, and up to 6 per cent., and only 10 per cent, were at more than 6 per cent, and up to 7 per cent. In November, 193S, the corresponding percentages were 22 per cent., 40 per cent., 30 per cent., and 5 per cent. Those figures indicate clearly that the Government has the financial situation well in hand. There has been no disorganization of the money market or of stock exchange operations.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[6]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It would not he wise to reveal the present strength of the Royal Australian Air Force, but the Government has announced that it hopes to have 1,500 aircraft in this country before 1941. That represents about 132 squadrons, compared with eight squadrons at the end of the last war.

Consequently, I approve of the main proposals outlined in the GovernorGenerals Speech, insofar as they affect Australias participation in the war.

That promise has been honoured fully; between September and. Christmas of last year, the Country party assisted the Government in respect of all of its main proposals. Indeed, it was responsible for keeping the Government in power. Many amendments desired by members of the Country party have been accepted by the Government. It can truthfully be said that its promise of support of the Governments war effort has been fully honoured by the Country party. Since December, the circumstances have changed, for the Country party has accepted the invitation of the Prime Minister to join in forming a composite government. It did so without any bargaining.

I shall do all that I can to support the Government in its prosecution of the war, and I hope that its efforts in that direction will be intensified. Most Australians recognize that, if Great Britain is at war, the other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations are automatically at war too. Australia is now, as it was in 1914, in the words of a great Australian statesman, Andrew Fisher, with Great Britain  to the last man and the last shilling . There are few Australians who do not realize that our national existence is at stake, and that our retention of everything we value our liberty, our parliamentary institutions, the political and social standards we have built in this country depends on the success of the allied forces. It is worthy of mention as a passing thought that our security for the last 150 years, since the settlement of New South Wales began, has been due, just as it is due now, entirely to the might of the British Navy. The story, of .Australia during that. period is a romance. How people came here and settled the land, the way in which population was attracted by the gold discoveries, the development of flocks and herds, the establishment of factories and the growth of our great cities all make romantic history, but such achievements would not have been possible had we not been treated with the utmost freedom by the Old Country, which handed Australia over to those who settled here. Australias great development and protection have been due to the might of the British Navy and to the liberty of the British flag. It is well to recall, too. when arguments about war policy crop up, that it was not Hitler who declared war on Australia in his arrogance and blindness he thought that we might be out of it it was Australia which declared war on Germany immediately after Great Britain had done so, through our democratic institutions, and a Prime Minister, elected and supported by the majority of the Australian people. That is a strong reason why the Australian forces should be utilized where they can be of most advantage in our defence and to secure the victory of the allied forces. Consequently, I oppose entirely the isolation policy of honorable senators opposite which is so different from the war policy of the Labour Government of our near sister dominion, New Zealand. In this connexion I commend to honorable senators opposite and to the Australian Labour party the notable example of the British Labour movement which in its three different sections, industrial, political and trade union, in the last couple of days, unanimously approved of the action of the British Parliamentary Labour party in joining, a national government under Mi\ Churchill. 1 am pleased to see in the British Cabinet . such men as Major Attlee, Mr. Herbert Morrison, Mr. Arthur Greenwood and Mr. A. V. Alexander. ","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[7]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Those men have not changed their high character and their noble principles overnight. Neither has the democracy of Great Britain changed its view?, because yesterday the Labour conference at  Bournemouth, on a card vote of the Labour movement of Great Britain, decided by 2,213,000 to 170,000 votes to approve of the action of the British Parliamentary Labour party in joining the National Government.

It is our duty to speak for them. The prosperity of the nation depends more on the primary producers during wartime than at any other time, because agricultural production is required for clothing and feeding the Allies, and the gold industry for finding money for the support of not only the Australian nation but also sister dominions and the Old Country itself. The need of Great Britain for primary products is intensified today when millions have been withdrawn from industry and put into the fighting ranks. Apart from the overwhelming issue of the war, the decision of the Country party to enter the Government was not greeted with any great enthusiasm by Country party supporters in Western Australia and the eastern States.

Members of the Country party organizations accepted the view thai under war conditions coalition was inevitable. But a party which has always had the interests of the nation first in its mind, .nevertheless, does expect and has the right to expect definite results from the coalition and from the boards which are handling their products. Those results should be in the direction of greater justice, more assistance and more just financial payments for the products that have been acquired, in most cases without any consultation by the Commonwealth Government with the producers. I warn Federal Country party Ministers that they are on trial, and that, their success or failure will be judged by the treatment which the primary producers receive from the present Government. I am supporting the new Administration wholeheartedly during the period of the war, but its success will, from the point of view of country organizations, depend upon the justice which primary producers receive, more particularly, with respect to the prices which they receive for their products. Results are expected. There are five Country party Ministers in the Cabinet, some of whom are administering departments particularly vital to the interests of important primary industries, and those engaged in them. Whilst we entirely approve of the presence of Country party Ministers in the Government during the war period, the men. and women members of those organizations which built up the Country party movement, and who sent, their ..representatives to this ^Parliament, expect definite results from this Government. We expect injustices to be removed, and better results than previously to be obtained. The primary producers are looking for more satisfactory treatment with respect to the commodities which they produce, and more just treatment, from the various boards which are handling their products. The Country party was formed with, the definite. object of protecting and furthering the. interests of country people, and particularly those engaged in primary production. The .Country party joined the Government in order to assist in.; the successful prosecution of the war., and its success will be judged by the measure of assistance .given to those engaged in primary production. The members of the Country party are pleased to find that the Minister for Commerce (Mr. Archie Cameron) is also Deputy Prime Minister, and, therefor, Deputy Leader of the Government. I believe that the present Prime Minister ..(Mr. Menzies), or whoever has the responsibility to lead, the nation in this t ime of crisis, should have the support of a substantial majority in both Houses. At the same time the members of the Country party hope that those persons engaged in primary industries will receive assistance and consideration, commensurate with the high position to which Mr. Archie Cameron has been elevated as a result of the work of country . organizations. We cannot forget, the good work which has been achieved by men and women in country districts in building up: Our organizations.  Their representation in this Parliament is due to. the activity dis played by various leagues, conferences and organizations, all of which have been instrumental in formulating the policy which we support. The objective of the Parliamentary Country party is to see that justice is done to those engaged in primary industries, and their past record is one of splendid achievement. If their representatives do not obtain results when in power the continuance of a Country .party cannot be justified to the rank and file. .

The compulsory acquisition by the Commonwealth of wheat, wool, or any other commodity, carries with it the constitutional obligation upon the Commonwealth to pay a just price. The . Government cannot say that it. is: entitled to acquire wheat, wool, apples or any other product under whatever conditions it decides. It has not the power to do so. Thank God, we. have a Constitution, and even a Commonwealth Government operating in such a remote place as Canberra cannot override the Constitution. The acquisition of wheat, wool and other products has been carried out under section 51 of the Constitution, which is not only a charter of public liberty, but also a deed of right for the protection of the people. Section 51, which confers various powers upon the Government, provides that Parliament shall have power to make laws with respect to the acquisition of property on just terms from any State or person, for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws. The Government lias power to acquire property from any person, but only on just terms. Lt cannot sell property so acquired a.t any price it pleases. The legal and constitutional power of the Government to take over farmers products is governed entirely by its doing so on just terms, which means fair and reasonable prices. Pair prices mean at least the cost of production, plus a reasonable profit to cover the producers labour. When the Government acquires wheat or wool it; has to pay the producer a just price.

Paragraph 17 of the first report of the Royal Commission on the Wheat Industry stated that 3s. a bushel at sidings would enable one half of the wheatfarmers of Australia to carry on under the conditions in respect of cost of production and interest obtaining at that time. The report, which was issued in 1935, also pointed out that threefourths of the producers would be able to continue, without readjustment, if the price were 3s. 10}d. a bushel at sidings. That, I submit, is the lowest price which the Government should now pay for the wheat which it has acquired, because a just price can only be regarded as the cost of production, plus a reasonable margin of profit. As costs have increased substantially in recent years, the price of 4s. a bushel at sidings, now asked by Australian wheatgrowers, is reasonable and has my full support. A lower price could not be regarded as a just price. So far the Government has paid, for the last harvest, only 2s. 10 1/2d. a bushel at ports for bagged wheat and 2s. Skl. a. bushel for bulk wheat. I appeal to the Government to do the right thing for the wheat industry, which is the greatest source of employment, both direct and indirect, in Australia.

In Western Australia, with which I. am best acquainted, many hundreds of wheat farms have been abandoned during the last few years. I am sorry to say that farmers in relatively good districts are still leaving their properties.

The people of Western Australia are probably i lie hardestworking in the world. They hove produced for export more primary produce per capita than any other community. But the task of settling and developing that large area of Australia is much too great for such a small population. Western Australia needs the sympathy and direct financial assistance of the wealthier eastern States in the great work of distributing the population more evenly. Western Australia cannot develop unaided nearly onethird of Australia. I hope that the Commonwealth Government will not be backward in giving the assistance that is needed.  I was pleased when the Leader of the Federal Country party (Mr. Archie Cameron) accepted the position of Minister for Commerce in the reconstituted Commonwealth Government; but I warn him and the Government that the success or failure of the Coalition Ministry will bo judged largely by the measure of financial assistance given to the primary industries of Western Australia and of the Commonwealth. The development of that large State is a national responsibility. We do not want to see nearly all of the population of Australia on the eastern side of the continent, while the western portion is denied opportunities to establish secondary industries. Western Australia, being far from the Seat of Government, is unknown to many members of the Commonwealth Parliament, and has never even been visited by many members of this Parliament, including some Commonwealth Ministers. I make my appeal on behalf of Western Australian wheatgrowers on the grounds of national expediency, and I repeat that the Government can acquire the wheat crop only on just terms. A just price is, at the very least, the cost of production, which was fixed by the royal commission in 1.935 at 3s. 10 1/2d. a bushel at sidings. That price was modified slightly in later reports for those districts where there is a * big local market for byproducts. Unfortunately, Western Australia has only a small population in towns, so the disposal of byproducts does not mean a great deal to the industry in that State. The Government should be bold and do a fair thing by accepting the recommendation of the commission which, five years ago, recommended a price of 3s. 10 1/2d. at sidings. I shall not quibble about an extra lid., but I would make the price 4s. a bushel at sidings, and thus bring some measure of prosperity to wheatgrowing districts which, today, are being abandoned. Hundreds of young men have left their homes. I know of areas in Western Australia where there used to be as many as six cricket teams; but last year, even before the war had started, it was not possible to arrange a cricket match because the young men had left the povertystricken wheal lands for the goldfields and the cities, where there are better chances of employment and better industrial conditions. The Government must do something to bring prosperity and reasonable living and working conditions to the wheat farmers and their employees. If it fails to do so, the Country party cannot remain an integral part of it.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[7]/continue[14]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The only way in which primary producers can be recouped for increased, costs of essential commodities is by receiving higher prices for their products. I have just returned from Western Australia, and every wheatgrower I met, and many others who wrote to me, asked me when the Government would pay a second advance on wheat. I understand that next month the British Government will pay for approximately 25,000,000 bushels of wheat, which it has purchased. Western Australian farmers have received for hulk wheat at ports only 2s. 8 1/2d. a bushel, from which 4Jd. has been deducted for freight. I urge the Government to make another advance of 9d. or at least 6d. a bushel. It is essential that this money should be found at once.  The argument that I have, advanced with regard, to the obligation that rests on this Government to pay a just price for wheal, which is compulsorily acquired applies also to wool. I admit that a greater price for wool has been obtained than that received in the preceding season, but the fact remains that the price in that season was one of the lowest recorded for the last 25 years.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[8]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The small woolgrower in Western Australia should be paid a price equivalent to that which he received in the past. I estimate a fair price to be ls. 3d. (sterling) per lb., which is approximately ls. 7d. (Australian). The small woolgrowers are dissatisfied with the present price. I have not met one of them who agrees with the opinion, expressed by the Minister that the majority of the growers are satisfied with the present price. The Government has compulsorily acquired the wool,., and, therefore, it should pay a just price. for it. If the Government wishes to act generously towards Great Britain in respect of the sale of our primary products, I agree with its motives ; but I. say it should be generous at the expense of the community as a whole, and not merely at the expense of wool or wheatgrowers, who are at present embarrassed financially. Some time ago the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives (Mr. Curtin) suggested that we should make a gift of 1,000,000 bushels of wheat to Great Britain. If the Government wishesto be generous let it. make such a gift, but let it first pay to the Australian grower a fair price for his product, .and not be generous at someone elses expense.  Grave dissatisfaction has also been caused among woolgrowers because of the refusal of the Government to establish appraisement centres at Albany and Geraldton. Although. sheep are widely distributed in the coastal areas of Western Australia, and despite the length of the coast line of that State, only one appraisement centre has been provided in Western Australia. This is in marked contrast to the treatment meted out in this respect to the eastern States. In Victoria, for instance, appraisement centres have been established at Geelong, Melbourne and Ballarat. I cannot understand why a centre has been established at Ballarat where the wool must now be unloaded, although eventually it must be despatched to the seaboard. These three centres in, Victoria are within 40 or 50 miles of one another. Yet in the large State of Western Australia only one appraisement centre has been established. During the last war the AttorneyGeneral (Mr. Hughes), when he was Prime Minister, immediately consented to a request that appraisement centres be established at Albany and Geraldton. Immediately the request was. made Mr. Hughes ordered that centres be set up in those places. However, a deputation consisting of all of the Western Australian representatives in this Parliament, as well as representatives from other States, has unsuccessfully made a similar request to, not only this Government, hut also its predecessor. Albany has a wonderful deepwater harbour and is on the direct shipping route from the eastern States. Geraldton also has an unanswerable claim. Yet our requests have produced nothing but sympathy, but sympathy without action is like mustard without beef. It seems that the present Government is lacking in backbone in this matter. . In Queensland, with its long coastline, only one appraisement centre has been established. The Government refuses to set up a centre at Townsville, Rockhampton or Bowen. I cannot understand how any Minister with any knowledge of the geography of Australia can say that one appraisement centre is sufficient for Western Australia and Queensland, and, at the same time, agree that Victoria needs three centres, one of which is inland. Apparently the Government has not sufficient backbone ; otherwise it would do the fair and proper thing without delay and grant our request for the establishment of appraisement centres at the places I have indicated.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[9]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The request embodied in the resolution was placed before the Minister at several meetings in Western Australia. We asked that an additional member should be appointed as a representative of the small woolgrowers of Western Australia. On every occasion the Minister replied that he was in favour of majority growercontrol on all commodity boards and committees. He mentioned certain boards which he had appointed when he was previously Assistant Minister for Commerce in connexion with which he had applied this principle. The Minister has now held his office for some weeks, and this request has been placed before him time and again by representatives of Western Australia in this Parliament. There has been a Cabinet meeting in Western Australia, and Ministers have been accorded welcomes. I hope that there will be more meetings there. Ministers have said that they were pleased to visit Western Australia to see its disabilities for themselves, and that there ought to be a Western Australian on every one of these marketing boards, because of the peculiar conditions prevailing in Western Australia, and because of its isolation. In spite of this., however, our requests for the appointment of a Western Australian to the Central Wool Committee have been rejected.  We  desire a revision of the earlier wool appraisements, particularly the first  and second. Glaring injustices were committed in the first assessment and, to some degree, in the second, and some action should be taken to recompense those growers who received 2d. and 3d. per lb. less for their wool than they would have obtained had their wool been appraised later. We further desire that the Tariff Board should be asked to inquire into the costs of producing wool. Some time ago, the committee which inquired into this matter stated that it cost 14d. per lb. to produce wool throughout Australia. Yet the Government has sold the last clip at less than that price, despite increased cost of production. The fact that such widely divergent opinions can be put forward by different authorities shows the need for an impartial inquiry by a responsible body before the price is fixed for next years clip. The whole subject should be inquired into by a competent tribunal, and I know of no more competent tribunal than the Australian Tariff Board. It would probably recommend a price that would give the small grower a fair return for his labour and. the capital lie has invested. The Australian. Wool Producers Federation asks, and 1 support the request, that the Tariff Board should inquire into the costs of producing wool, and that no sales be made of next years clip to the Government of Great Britain except at a price that will give a fair return to the producer say, ls. 3d. per lb. sterling or ls. 7d. per lb. in Australian currency. The Government proposes to place a heavy burden of taxation on the country. I believe that Australians in all walks of life are prepared to make the sacrifices demanded of them by the war. The Government, however, should expend wisely the huge revenues, which are being raised by taxation and by loan for the prosecution of its war effort. All expenditure should be carefully scrutinized, and waste should be eliminated. In this connexion, we do not wish a recurrence of the waste involved in bringing soldiers from Western Australia to the eastern States for training. There is an uneasy feeling that defence expenditure is being confined almost exclusively to the eastern States. We have asked that munitions be manufactured at the Midlands Junction work shops and elsewhere in Western Australia, but that has not been done. We are now told that no more private soldiers will be brought to the east, but that recruits for technical units will have to come to the eastern States for training. Let us have a change in this regard. Let us try to develop an Australian sentiment. If it is necessary to bring all these men to one point for training, let them, for a time at any rate, be all brought to Western Australia. This would have the advantage, also, that the men from the east would be some distance on their way to their destination. I urge the Government to repeal not merely to amend or alters the tax on gold production. At present half of the excess price of gold over and above £9 per oz. is taken by the Government as a tax. The price now is £10 13s. 6d., so that the tax amounts to 16s. 7 1/2d. per oz., irrespective of whether the mine is making a profit or not. A similar tax was imposed iu South Africa, but it was discovered there to be a foolish mistake, and the incidence of the tax has now been altered so as to give relief to lowgrade shows. The Australian Treasury supports the tax in its present form because it brings in four or five times as much as would a tax on profits, the same kind of tax as is imposed on all other Australian industries. The gold tax has to be paid whether a mine is working at a profit ot not, and certain big mining companies working on lowgrade ores are working at a loss. So serious is their plight that they are likely to suspend production.","N/A","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[9]/para[4]","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","JOHNSTON, Edward","KP8","N/A","N/A","N/A","780","No, it is of much lower grade, about 2.7 dwt. A great deal of gold has been produced at Wiluna, thanks to the enterprise of British investors, who expended £1,000,000 on equipment and developmental work. The company also received a Government loan, which was repaid in full without any loss to the lender. Because of unfavourable developments at depth, which no one could have foreseen, the British investors in this company will not get. their money back. Though the mine is a losing proposition, the company will have to pay £50,000 this year to the Federal Government in this unjust tax. This money, expended on exploratory work, might have revealed fresh ore bodies, the discovery of which would give the mine a new lease of life. At the 2,000 feet level there are ore bodies assaying 2.7 dwt. a ton, which could and would be worked if the tax were repealed. The State Government has spent several hundred thousands of pounds in the construction of a railway to Wiluna, which carries a population of about 7,000 persons, who are dependent on one mine. The monstrous injustice of taxing this community out of existence should be realized even in Canberra. The Commonwealth Parliament is composed largely of men who, having been elected by populous centres, naturally know a great deal about the eastern States, with a large concentration of the population, and the expenditure of money, principally in Sydney and Melbourne. Unfortunately, a good deal of the administration is in charge of men who know nothing about primary industries or the outlying parts of Australia. That is why there is such a monstrous injustice as the taxing of gold, which is required for the prosecution of the war, on the basis of production. The greater the quantity of gold produced, the more tax is paid, whether or not there is a loss on every ounce produced. It is a wrong method of taxation, which would not be accepted in respect of any other Australian industry in the eastern States. Goldmining is 100 per cent, a country industry, and nearly 80 per cent, of the production comes from Western Australia. It is stated that at Kalgoorlie the heavy incidence of this tax results in the passing over of a lot of lowgrade ore which could be worked if the tax were removed. The tax should be opposed by all parties in this cb amb r, on the ground that it is contrary to all of the accepted principles of taxation. Gold is vital to Australia and the Empire, in order to secure the dollar credits that are needed in the United States of America. Modern wars are waged by mechanized armies. We can secure aeroplanes and much of the equipment, petrol and other essentials only from countries that are outside sterling exchange. It is imperative that our pro*duction of gold should be increased, to enable us to make purchases in the United States of America. Production should be encouraged, not discouraged by a monstrously unfair and stupid tax. If the commodity that is most necessary to enable us to wage the war is to be taxed, at least let the tax be at the rates fixed in respect of income tax, as is done in respect of secondary industries and many other things. The production of gold is so important to Australia that it would pay the Commonwealth to waive the tax, so long as a greater quantity was produced. The increase of production would not only increase the volume of employment but also enable the production of munitions for the conduct of the war to be enlarged. When the Federal Government imposed the levy of 50 per cent, of the amount received by gold producers in excess of £9 per fine oz., it reached the decision hurriedly and without conferring with the leaders of the State Mines Departments or other authorities on the subject. Again I complain that the Government does so much of its own volition, without consulting interested parties. Since the impost, strong opposition has been voiced to what is considered the unfair principle of taxing production value, instead of the profits that mayaccrue from the commodities produced. lc appears significant that gold production has been, singled out for imposition in view of the fact that the value of production in Western Australia has reached such pleasing figures. The prices of raw materials generally, especially those that are required for war purposes, have increased since the war commenced, in a number of instances to a greater degree than has the price of gold. If there be one commodity that should not be selected for a special levy, it is gold. Undue taxation discourages this industry by retarding contributions of capital, and, subsequently, by inducing an indifferent attitude by the public towards it. Goldmining is an activity of variable temperament. Suitable encouragement will reflect favorably on the industry, whilst the reverse will slowly but surely lull public interest into somnolence. The Government appears to be under the impression that gold itself has the special virtue of being of value apart from the cost of winning it. This is a fallacy. Should a prospector or a mining company win a quantity of gold at a cost greater than its value, he or it would be better off without the metal, and consequently gets out of business. The Mount Magnet Company, through its engineer and director, has recently issued the statement that that big mine will soon go out of operation unless the tax on the production of gold is lifted.. The higher the value of gold, the better for all concerned. Residents of mining towns, workers, and traders, all receive value from rising gold prices. If there be any doubt concerning this, doubters should compare the active conditions today at Kalgoorlie, Wiluna, Mount Magnet, Coolgardie, Agnew, Marble Bar, Norseman, and other mining centres, with the conditions of those places when the ruling price for gold was S5s. per oz. The change is due to the higher price of the metal, enabling ore of lower gold content to be profitably treated. In other words, payable ore reserves have been inestimably increased. One does not need to possess much minim* knowledge to know that. Increased ore reserves demand treatment plants of greater size, and this means additional employment. It is estimated that one mining employee causes employment to be found for four others engaged outside the industry. I cite towns like Westonia, where there is very little except goldmining, and about 100 employees are responsible for a population of five times that number. The Government of South Africa imposed a tax on gold production, but later removed it, realizing that the principle was wrong and militated against production, especially in relation to lowgrade ore deposits, and even highgrade properties which possessed lowgrade ore bodies within their boundaries. Canada considered the imposition of a gold levy, but, realizing the folly of the policy, did not proceed with it. Thus, of the three great goldproducing countries of the Empire Australia alone inflicts this levy on production. In India, Rhodesia and West Africa goldproducers are afflicted with a war levy on gold, but as cheap coloured labour is employed in these countries the imposition is less burdensome than in Australia. Suggestions have been made that lowgrade mines should receive special consideration, with a view to compensating them for the levy. That, however, would not remedy the position. I am not prepared to say what would be. a fair grade to fix. Threepennyweight ore might be profitable in one locality, whereas in another, remote from railway facilities, it would be quite unprofitable. I consider that the impost should be entirely discontinued, and the legislation which imposed the tax repealed. We should adhere to the usual method of taxing profits by means of the income .tax which is applied to other industries. Even 5dwt. ore in one place might be high grade in another at Big Bell for instance in consequence of different conditions. The tax is wrong in principle and detrimental in its reactions, and should therefore be removed. An equable levy on the industries profiting from an increased output due to war conditions should be imposed. I therefore urge the Government to repeal the gold tax as it is altogether unjustifiable to impose . the tax on this commodity, which is so essential to the maintenance of our economic life.  I do not intend to refer at present to the other legislative proposals referred to in His Excellencys Speech. I shall conclude by saying that I entirely support the war effort of the Government and commend it for the actions it has taken to prosecute the war. I am particularly pleased that the Communists within our midst are to be dealt with effectively. There can be no doubt the disastrous coal strike, which is paralysing our industries and dislocating the life of our people, is entirely due to the machinations of the selfconfessed Communists who are the leaders of the coalmining unions. I hope that the Government will go to the utmost limits in dealing with the Communist menace in our midst. Question resolved in the affirmative. Motion (by Senator McLeay) agreed to.
