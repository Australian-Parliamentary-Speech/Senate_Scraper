I rise to speak to the motion in. order to direct attention to a matter which appears gravely to affect the privileges of this chamber. I refer to an announcement that appeared in the afternoon press of the 8th May last relating to the Presidency of the Senate. The Sydney Daily Mirror of that day, under the heading  The Prime Minister Offers Senate Presidency , published the following statement: ","N/A","ELECTION OF PRESIDENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","MCKENNA, Nicholas","KTN","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","The Sydney Sun ran a more lengthy story on the same day under the heading  Kew Post likely for McLeay . On the following morning, the Sydney Morning Herald, under the heading  Cabinet List Delayed. Hitch over Senate President , gave a rather long and circumstantial account of the summoning of Senator McLeay from South Australia, his meetings with the Prime Minister and others and his summoning to The Lodge, his rejection of the offer, its subsequent submission to Senator OSullivan and its rejection by him. I direct attention to the constitutional position. Section 17 of the Commonwealth Constitution I shall read only the earlier part of it provides that the Senate shall, before proceeding to the despatch of any other business, choose a senator to be the President of the Senate. I emphasize the words  the Senate shall . In other words, the appointment of the President is a matter for the Senate, and not for anybody else. If these press reports are accurate and I cannot certify as to that it is clear that there was an attempted usurpation of the constitutional rights of the chamber by the Prime Minister. It is also completely clear that the disposal of the high office of President of this chamber is one of the matters that is not within the disposition of the Prime Minister, whatever constitutional rights he might enjoy. It is my belief that the reports were accurate. F may be wrong in my assumption, but my belief is based upon several factors. There was no denial by the Prime Minister, or by anybody associated with the Government, of the accuracy of the reports, nor was a reply made to the statement which I made on behalf of the Opposition, setting out the Opposition viewpoint, which was published in the morning press of the 9th May. The report of that statement which was published in the Sydney Morning Herald of that date reads as follows: The Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator N. E. McKenna, tonight issued the following statement:  If, as reported, the Prime Minister has offered the presidency of the Senate to one of his Ministers, he has emerged speedily in the role of dictator.  His action exhibits a supreme contempt not only for the 31 Senators, who, it seems, will be supporters of the Government in the Senate, but also for thu Senate itself. Upon Senators alone rests the responsibility and they alone enjoy the privilege of electi:ig their president. It will be interesting if some of Mr. Menzies supporters in the Senate join with Labour in rejecting his dictatorial choice. I repeat that no answer has been made to that statement. I indicate to the Senate now that this is the opportunity for Senator OSullivan or Senator McLeay publicly to deny that there was that attempted contempt of this chamber. I refer also to the fact that I have been informed that many Government supporters in this Senate tendered protests to the Prime Minister when that announcement first appeared. . That also confirms my belief that there was some accuracy in the reports. I should like to say to those Government senators who supported the statement that I made at the time that, if the newspaper reports were true, their action does them credit. Having regard to the rights of this chamber it seems that the two Ministers whose names appeared in the press reports very properly rejected an offer made to them in those circumstances. The next point I make is that if it may be said that all that was done was that the two honorable senators concerned were merely offered nomination for the position of President of this Senate, all I can say is that the Prime Minister showed a complete disregard for those who support his Government in this chamber, and that their protests were thoroughly well justified. In this instance the Prime Minister either regarded nil of his supporters in this chamber as being ready to come to heel at his behest, or he sought to make fool. of the two honorable senators to whom he offered the presidency. Opposition senators would be wanting in their obligations as senators if they did not object to what, if the report be true, was obviously public contempt of this Senate. To allow such an act to pass without objection would not be proper or wise. We take that course having regard to the behaviour of the Government in another matter which gravely affects the privileges of this Senate. I refer now to its refusal, some little time ago, to allow departmental heads and Service chiefs to give evidence before a committee of this Senate.","N/A","ELECTION OF PRESIDENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[1]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

Despite the section of the Constitution to which the Leader of the Opposition has referred, it is well known that for as long as the Labour party held office in this Parliament, the President of the Senate has never been selected by the Senate as such. The truth is that according to Labour practice the choice of a nominee is made by a body, the majority of the members of which are not members of this chamber and that the nominee so chosen is invariably elected to the presidency of the Senate. With that practice in mind and nobody knows about it better than does the Leader of the Opposition I have no hesitation in describing his remarks as completely unctuous and hypocritical.  The Minister for Shipping and Transport (Senator McLeay) has told us what happened as far as he was concerned. I shall make my own position clear: Prior to the swearing in of the new Cabinet, and in the course of conversations with the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) about other matters, the right honorable gentleman asked mc whether I was likely to be a. candidate for the office of President. I told him that f was not. At no time has the Prime Minister attempted to exercise any influence whatever, or to interfere in any way, with the choice by the Senate of its President. It may suit the Leader of th, Opposition to rely with childish faith on newspaper reports in the present circumstances, but my frank belief is that he does not believe the reports to be true. All the world may know that the choice by members of the Government parties of their nominee for the office of President was entirely a matter for themselves, without interference by members of the House of Representatives or by any outside organization such as the Australian Labour party federal executive. In my humble opinion, the choice is wise and I regret very much that this opening ceremony has been marred by the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition.","N/A","ELECTION OF PRESIDENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","BROWN, Gordon","K6P","Queensland","N/A","N/A","10","I am very happy about the selection that has been made by the political parties opposite and its endorsement by the Senate, and I assure you, Mr. President, that we on this side of the chamber will help you to the best of our ability in carrying out your duties in this chamber. Of course, there may be times when we shall fall from grace. Indeed, I remember that some years ago I myself fell from grace on two occasions, and was suspended. I hope I shall not suffer at your hands in that respect. Perhaps my occupancy of the chair for nearly eight years has mellowed me somewhat, so that I shall behave myself, as all good senators should behave themselves.  May I point out that, apart from presiding over this chamber you will have many duties to perform in your new office. I hold strongly that the public of this country should know more of the duties performed by members of the Parliament and by the President of this chamber. There is, unfortunately, a common belief among the people that the President merely comes into the chamber, offers prayers, calls the Senate to order occasionally and for such services draws a nice salary. Whilst I am on my feet 1 take the opportunity to point out that the President of this chamber has many duties to discharge, some of which are quite onerous. Indeed; of late years they have become much more onerous, as I know from experience. In conjunction with the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President has to direct, the activities of many men and women and of a number of departments of the Parliament. Amongst his duties he is jointly responsible for the administration of the Parliamentary Refreshment Rooms, in which many persons are employed, the Parliamentary Gardens, the Parliamentary Library, the Parliamentary Reporting Staff and the staff which ministers to honorable senators in this chamber. It is clear, therefore, that the Presidency of this chamber is no mere sinecure. By way of reassurance, however, I point out that in the discharge of the duties of your new office you will have the willing assistance of the very experienced officials of this chamber, who render such splendid service to the Senate. I must say, however, that during your occupancy of the chair you will have to suffer somewhat. I have suffered for hours in the chair listening to various speakers. As an example, I recall very clearly one occasion when I left the chair about 25 minutes before the usual time for the suspension of the afternoon sitting. That incident occurred many years ago, and it was not concerned in any way with any honorable senator who is now a member of this chamber. Two honorable senators had taken part in a very tiresome debate late in the afternoon. The first of them was a rather boring speaker, but the second speaker was even worse. When he had concluded and another speaker rose for the call. I immediately suspended the sitting of the Senate until 8 oclock. The Leader of the Government met me in the. corridor outside the chamber and inquired the reason for my action. He wanted to know whether I was, perhaps, going to Government House. I replied,  No ; it was more than human nature could stand . Having delivered myself of that anecdote, i must confess that the standard of parliamentary speaking has improved since then. Nevertheless, I think that on occasions the speeches delivered in this chamber are still very uninteresting. I think that a big improvement could be effected, both in the interests of the public and of honorable senators themselves, if we trained ourselves to speak in a manner that would be more interesting to the listening public. May I inform you, Mr. President, that I was instrumental in having installed in the Presidents suite an instrument that will enable you to follow the proceedings in this chamber. When you listen to that instrument I have no doubt that you will, like myself, be somewhat unpleasantly surprised by some of the speeches. Those of us who hear our speeches broadcast might be even more unpleasantly surprised than was the elderly parson in the Old Country, who, on hearing a broadcast of his own voice, exclaimed,  Good God ! Have I been talking like that for 20 years? Quite understandably, he refused to enter the pulpit , again until he had improved his delivery. Summing up my remarks, Mr. President, I say that although you will undoubtedly be bored at times, I know that you will be able to bear with it. If I may interpolate another anecdote, I shall remind the Senate of a remark made by a former Duke of Devonshire, who was a bewhiskered old gentleman. While addressing a gathering he had closed his eyes for some time and droned on. At the conclusion of his address a young lady who congratulated him on his remarks, remarked that it was a pity that he had gone to sleep while delivering them. The Duke corrected her in these words :  No, my dear young lady, I did not go to sleep. 1 wish I could have gone to sleep. I closed my eyes because my speech was so boring. That story reminds me of a highly respected Irish gentleman who, many years ago, occupied the chair that you now adorn. While I was still comparatively a new member of the Senate I. was approached by him one day. He said :  Look, Gordon, we want you to be on the panel of Temporary Chairmen . When I replied that I was not interested in having myself appointed a temporary chairman, lae said :  Ha, me bhoy, you want to look to the future. You never know what may come forth . I replied :  To be quite honest with you, 1 do not know how you can tolerate sitting in that chair, listening to those interminable speeches . He said :  I in stand it, me bhoy, because an extra thousand a year makes the seat very soft . I hope, sir, that in times of mental distress that knowledge may be some solatium to you. I know that many times [ have felt so tired of the debates that f have been tempted to walk out into Gods fresh air. The recollection of the solatium has restrained me, however. In conclusion, I offer you my sincere congratulations on your appointment as President and on behalf of members of the Opposition we welcome your appointment. I repeat the undertaking that I have given you outside the chamber, that I. shall do all in my power to assist you in the discharge of your onerous duties.","N/A","ELECTION OF PRESIDENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Senator OSULLIVAN (QueenslandMinister for Trade and Customs). On behalf of all honorable senators I extend the heartiest congratulations to our colleague, Senator George Rankin, on his appointment to the very important post of Chairman of Committees. Senator George Rankin has long been known to many of us, and those who do not know him personally have known him by repute. Many years of his life have been dedicated to the service of his country both in war and in peace. He has been a, familiar and highly respected member of the Commonwealth Parliament, having served for many years in the House of Representatives. In addition, he has served with distinction on many joint committees of the two houses of the Parliament. I am sure that under his able chairmanship much good will result from the legislation that will be brought before him in the committee stages. We can look forward to perhaps strict, but always fair and reasonable, conduct of the business of the committees while he is in charge. I have much pleasure in offering to the honorable senator my congratulations and, I am sure, those of other members of the Senate.","N/A","CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Opposition most cordially congratulates the honorable senator upon his election and wishes him well in the discharge of his office. Like you. Mr. President, he, too, commences his duties, as far as the Opposition is concerned, with an entirely clean sheet and I believe that he will justify what the Leader of the Government has said by finishing his task still enjoying the high reputation which he now bears. He may rely upon the friendly cooperation of the Opposition in assisting him to carry out his very important duties. What shots the Opposition is likely to fire in the coming months are not likely to be directed at him. Honorable senators on this side of the Senate look to a very friendly association with him down the period that lies ahead.
