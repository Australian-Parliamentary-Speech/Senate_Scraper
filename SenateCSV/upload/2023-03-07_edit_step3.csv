"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I rise to speak on the Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment (Medical Device and Human Tissue Product List and Cost Recovery) Bill 2022, the Private Health Insurance (Prostheses Application and Listing Fees) Amendment (Cost Recovery) Bill 2022 and the Private Health Insurance (National Joint Replacement Register Levy) Amendment (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022. These three bills before the Senate relate to the Prostheses List and private health insurance. This is the first step in the legislative process. These are the most comprehensive reforms to the Prostheses List that have ever been undertaken. These reforms come after more than four years of detailed work and collaboration by a number of people in the medical technology community with the former department and the former government. Stakeholders—MTAA, the Australian Medical Association, the Australian Private Hospitals Association, Catholic Health Australia and the Consumer Health Forum—have all been engaged in this yearslong process to get us where we are today to ensure that this reform package both helps private health insurers remain sustainable and protects patient access and doctor choice to this very important part of our medical sector—that is, the Prostheses List. Getting these reforms right is really important. Thats why I make a particular point of thanking all of those people who have been involved in getting this debate to where it is to enable the start of the legislative process.  We know that medical devices and medical technology have had a major impact across the health sector. There has been a 30 per cent decline in annual mortality rates in the last 20 years, an overall increase in life expectancy of 4.1 years, and a 56 per cent reduction in the number of hospital days per capita. This is extraordinary. These statistics are not just numbers; they actually relate to fathers, husbands, wives, children, friends and loved ones. Its really important that we pass this legislation as the process has been undertaken in great faith. These bills present the first tranche of the legislative changes required to actually implement a coalition 202122 budget measure—modernising and improving the private health insurance Prostheses List. It has been hard fought. The coalition are absolutely happy to support the process and the progression of these bills because they do some very important things. In saying that, I note that, whilst the importance of this legislation cannot be overstated, there are some real concerns about the fact that so much of the information that is needed to underpin the moving forward of this initiative is completely absent and nobody has any line of sight whatsoever. This sector has no line of sight, this Senate has no line of sight, certainly the opposition has no line of sight and, in a funny way, Im actually quite concerned that those opposite dont have any line of sight, because we have no information whatsoever. However, these three bills seek to do some reasonably sensible things. They ensure the ability to better define products that will be eligible to be on the list, they define the register levy and allow it to be implemented, and they better define the cost recovery framework that sits here. The coalition are really pleased to be able to stand here today and talk about these bills, because I think our track record demonstrates that we have a really strong record when it comes to strengthening private health insurance in this country. We believe that it is a fundamental part of Australias health system. When we left government, private health insurance membership was at an alltime high, with more than 14 million Australians being covered. Our reforms included the 2022 premium charge, which was the lowest increase in premiums in more than 21 years and the eighth successive decline in premium charges since the last year that Labor was in government in 2013. We also increased investment in the patient rebate for private health insurance from $5.4 billion in 201213 to $6.9 billion in 202223. We also implemented the new easytounderstand gold, silver, bronze and basics classifications for private health, standard clinical definitions and better access to mental health services which, sadly, weve seen this government start to unwind. We know intrinsically that Labor governments are not great supporters of the private health insurance sector in this country, but I would encourage you to make sure that, when voting on these bills, we actually support a very strong private health insurance sector because that is what makes our overall health sector so strong in Australia. We are the envy of the world because weve got the right balance between the private sector and the public sector so that we are able to offer that choice and control to Australian consumers when they are patients so that they can access the broadest range of choice in health care of just about anywhere in the world. But, as I mentioned a minute ago, the greatest problem with this legislation is the lack of transparency around the detail that sits behind it. There are certain key elements which arent enabled by these bills and which we have no information on. Once again, we have a Labor government coming in here and rushing in legislation when they havent actually done the work that sits behind it. The question has to be: is this government incompetent or is it trying to hide something from Australian consumers by refusing to provide the information that would set the minds of most of us at rest, if we knew what was sitting behind this? There are a number of key areas of great concern that I particularly want to raise here today and put on the record. First of all, the cost recovery framework regulations and rules havent even been out for consultation yet, and yet we are seeking to put in place the mechanism for cost recovery with this legislation. Another example is the definition of a medical device. In terms of the guidelines, we need to know what will be included in future on the Prostheses List. We know that this legislation enables the process by which, going forward, many items that are currently on the Prostheses List will be removed, so we need to know what will be included in the future. As an example, an insulin pump would not necessarily be categorised as an implantable device, but obviously its a very important device for those people with diabetes. So we need to know where that product will be going in the future. Another area of great concern is that in relation to all of the items that have been removed from the Prostheses List by this streamlining—often described as nonimplantables—the minister has made a verbal statement that he is going to mandate the requirement for those items to be included in general use to enable them to continue to be part of the refunding from the private health insurers. We have a promise of inclusion, but at this stage we still do not know what that is going to look like. IHACPA, the pricing authority, is out consulting as we speak. It hasnt reported yet; it doesnt have to report until after the likely passing of this legislation today. So we dont know how that bundling is going to occur. I think weve got a reasonable idea that the Department of Health and Aged Care and IHACPA have a preferred model for care, for this bundling. It appears they have a preference for bundling by facility type, but we know that the sector knows that it is a much more targeted way to make sure that we have got the correct kind of refunding and cost mechanisms in place for bundling if they are done through a procedurebundling exercise instead of facility type. The minister said hes going to mandate the requirement for the cost inclusion of these items in general use for two years. The question then is: what happens after two years? Is the expectation that were just going to set everybody against each other while they go and fight it out as to who is going to pay for these items that have been removed from the Prostheses List by this legislative framework? But one of the greatest concerns before us at the moment is about the time lines of the requirement for this bundling to come into effect. Industry have been categorical in saying they do not believe they will be in a position to implement these changes on 1 July 2023, which is the intention of this government. Once again, we have seen the rushing of a piece of legislation, to tick and flick something they said they were going to do, with no regard to the implications of those time frames for the people required to implement them. Most particularly, I dont think there has been any regard taken for the implications for patients, and the outcomes for patients and our overall health system, of the intention to push forward with this on 1 July. We now know that the minister intends to speak to the IT vendors, who are the ones who will have to put this in place sometime between now and 1 July. Surely, Minister, government and health department, you should have had these things worked out before you came in here and asked this parliament to vote on something with no detail whatsoever and with huge concerns being raised by the sector that these details need to be known so they can understand whether they can meet the requirements that some of this legislation intends to mandate. Weve seen it before. We saw it with the agedcare bills, and now were seeing it here with these healthcare bills. As I said, most particularly, we want to make sure that the implementation of this time frame does not have the catastrophic impacts on patients that it could potentially have if its forced through without any regard for what happens on the ground, what happens in the hospital and what happens to the patients. Ill be asking some of these questions because I believe the Greens intend to take these bills into committee. There are some questions the government needs to answer here. First of all, the government needs to guarantee that with the mechanisms we dont know about yet—the detail that sits behind this legislation that is only going to be under an instrument that cant even be disallowed—there will be no changes to surgeries that different hospitals are able to afford to deliver to their patients. Can it assure this chamber these changes are not going to have negative impacts on the current ability for a hospital to provide a particular process or procedure? I will ask the government a specific question, and Id really like an answer to this: can you guarantee, as an example, that bariatric procedures will remain a costeffective procedure for private hospitals to continue to provide to their patients, following the changes in terms of the implementation and the categorisation of both the cost framework and the bundling procedures? Will we just see many of the procedures that are currently being undertaken in public hospitals and private hospitals shoved into the public system because private hospitals will no longer be able to afford to provide these procedures? These are questions we need to have answered. We should have had these questions answered before we were asked to come in here and vote on these bills. Despite the fact that so many people in the sector have put so much time and effort into this reform process, we stand here today with so many unanswered questions that you should have been able to answer. You should have put the work in in relation to these uncertainties that the industry and the wider private health sector continue to raise about this proposed legislation. As I said, the industry have particular concerns that the enabling legislation will proceed without the critical details that they need to know to make sure that this is in the best interests of the patients that they serve. The legislation is currently to be undertaken between March and May. Were standing here at the beginning of March trying to push this through this place. Why are you rushing this legislation through, when you could have waited and allowed it to go through in a timely manner to ensure that no unintended consequences fall out of this rushed process? Why is it that you as a government continue to refuse to give us any oversight of the subordinate legislation that sits underneath this really important legislation? It might all be fine, but how would we know when, once again, your idea of transparency is not to tell us anything and your idea of consultation is to tell us what youre going to do? I would say to those opposite: the simplest approach to enable these concerns to be allayed across the broader sector would be to delay any further debate on these bills until May or June, after your consultation process has finished and we have confirmed details about the subordinate legislation. Right now, as were standing here today, it looks as if we are going to make sure that good governance gets put to the bottom of the list, for legislative expediency. I dont think thats a very good way for us to be managing what is an extraordinarily important part of the Australian culture, something that Australians are so very proud of, our worldclass health system. Sure, its got some challenges at the moment, but those challenges will only be made worse by this government refusing to give any detail of what their intention is with the details of this sort of legislation. It has become a habit of this place, a habit of this government. It was elected on a platform of transparency, and I can say to you that, in my experience as the shadow minister for health and aged care, this government has been anything but transparent since its been here. I have never seen such an opaque government in my entire life.  I want to start by indicating that the Australian Greens will be supporting the Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment (Medical Device and Human Tissue Product List and Cost Recovery) Bill 2022, the Private Health Insurance (Prostheses Application and Listing Fees) Amendment (Cost Recovery) Bill 2022 and the Private Health Insurance (National Joint Replacement Register Levy) Amendment (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022. We do so while recognising that private health insurance is out of reach for too many people in Australia, and we acknowledge that the subsidy that this government provides to private health insurance corporations would be better spent and would better achieve health outcomes if we invested that money into the public healthcare system. As stated in the second reading amendment that I will be moving on behalf of the Australian Greens, those in our Australian community who can afford private health insurance, which is increasing in cost again this year, are experiencing a system which is expensive but which ultimately delivers them faster access to health care. The inherent and growing inequality at the centre of this equation is astounding. We are creeping ever closer to an American style healthcare system, and the Australian value of getting health care for free when you need it is getting further and further out of reach for so many. Weve got to ask ourselves a fundamental question in this debate: why? I have learnt, in this space, that, when something seems out of place or out of step in this political building, in the decisionmaking processes of this place—when the government, whether its the Liberal government or the Labor government, is making a decision that is fundamentally out of step with the needs of the community or what is in the communitys best interests—there is often corporate money involved. And, lo and behold, the decision to not adequately resource our public hospitals, the decision to support an increase in private health insurance fees and the decision not to take immediate action to expand mental healthcare services to bring them under Medicare could, I believe, be firmly put down to the over $2 million of income the major parties received from private health insurers and pharmaceutical companies in the 202122 financial year. In this current costofliving crisis, we need to see more from this government—more in relation to the expansion of public healthcare systems. We need to see changes to the way that our public health system works to meet the community expectation and the community need. What I hear from people across WA is that, instead of their private health insurance fees increasing, they want to see mental and dental health under Medicare. Lets take a deep dive for a moment into the reality of the current dental health crisis. Only 42 per cent of people between the ages of 25 and 34 have been able to go to the dentist in the last year. We know that people are delaying addressing ongoing dental issues because, instead, they need to do things like pay their rents as they increase, and they simply cannot afford to go to the dentist to get that urgent dental work done. Of those who can afford to make it to the dentist, nearly a quarter are not able to afford to fully treat the problem. In 2019, there were 70,000 hospitalisations from dental conditions that could have been avoided. They could have been avoided. These are people that ended up in hospital when there would have been no reason for them to be there if they had simply been able to receive dental treatment earlier. Nearly 9,000 of those cases were in my state of Western Australia. On average, an Australian will spend $326 in outofpocket dental costs per year, nearly seven times what the government pays on average, per capita, in subsidies to dental health care. These stats are a snapshot of why I dearly wish that the parliament were working on a bill to pass dental care into Medicare today. As for mental health care, we have, again, a familiar story. People are unable to get the mental health supports that they need right now. Services are not available locally. There are very long waiting lists, or there are simply closed books. And, if you can get onto somebodys books and get in to see someone, cost is then an additional barrier. What does Labor do in response to this reality, the crisis of mental health care in this country, particularly in the aftermath of one of the worst periods of crisis in this country that we have seen in many years in relation to the healthcare system? It has pushed incredible weight upon peoples mental health. The reality is that, for young people in Australia, there is an absolute and total mental health care crisis in this country. It is unparalleled in its history. So what does Labor do in response to this absolute reality? They have stopped the 20 subsidies in the Better Access healthcare scheme, and they have wound them back to 10. Let me say that again. In the face of a mental health care crisis overwhelmingly falling on the shoulders of young people, this Labor government has decided to wind back the 20session subsidy under the Better Access scheme to 10 sessions. It is absolutely unbelievable. The reason theyve given for this disgraceful decision is some mumblings about capacity in the system. Theyve referenced reports and reviews, even though those reports and reviews do not, in fact, recommend rolling back the 20 sessions; they recommended the augmentation of the system. So, in the face of these reports and realities and endless submissions from mentalhealthcare peak groups, this government rolled back those subsidies and blamed it on capacity. And, when anyone calls them out on the absolute nonsense of that—the disconnected, illogical nature of looking at massive unmet need in the system and responding by constraining access—this government looks you in the face and says, Well, weve got to balance the budget; weve got to make sure the books add up, while, at the same time, it gives a quarter of a trillion dollars to some of the richest people in this country, in the form of the stage 3 tax cuts. Its absolutely disgusting. In no other area of Australian public policy would it be acceptable to respond to an increase in need by constraining access and then claiming that youre doing the right thing by the community that is demonstrating that increased need. Addressing the costofliving barriers is exactly what this government should be doing, by expanding the system so that people can get what they need, when they need it, where they are, without that being determined by them having to choose—having the luxury of choosing!—between health care or mental health care and paying their rent. These are basic expectations of the Australian community. Australians should not have to rely on private health insurance to get timely access to health care. It is time to prioritise public health care and to get dental and mental health into Medicare, where they have always belonged. And it is time to get this done now. This is what Australia needs. This is what the Greens will continue to work on, until people are able to access this relief and until these goals are achieved. In closing, I move the second reading amendment standing on the Notice Paper in my name: At the end of the motion, add , but the Senate: (a) notes that: (i) the Australian Government has announced that, on average, private health insurance premiums will increase in April 2023 by 2.9%, (ii) the Australian community is relying on private health insurance policies to avoid delays in the public system, which is underfunded and in crisis, (iii) the major parties received nearly $2 million from private health insurers and pharmaceutical companies in their party annual returns for the 202122 financial year, (iv) the community perceives a link between donations to political parties and their policy priorities; and (b) is of the opinion that the Australian community should not have to rely on private health insurance to access health care in a timely manner.  Before I deal with some of the details of the Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment (Medical Device and Human Tissue Product List and Cost Recovery) Bill 2022, I would like to counter some of the remarks of Senator SteeleJohn. I know that, when he comes into this place, he is always sincere and passionate and he believes everything he says in this place—there can be no doubt about that. But let me say this. The best strength of our healthcare system in Australia, and what makes us different from other countries, is the strength of both our private health system and our public health system. Each buttresses the other. If this country were ever to undermine the strength of our private health system, it would be a disaster—an absolute disaster for those who need to access the public health system. Let me give you one example from my home state of Queensland which I think summarises the position extremely well. In 2012, on dental health lists in the public system in Queensland there were 62,513 people. There were more than 62,000 Queenslanders whod tried to access dental health care in Queensland under the previous Labor government, before the LNP government was elected in 2012. Thats 62,513 Queenslanders. Some had been on that waiting list for up to 10 years. In 10 years, they couldnt access the public health system. The LNP government was elected in 2012. Within two years, how many people were on the public health system waiting list for dental health care? Remember: it was over 62,000. Was it 20,000? No; fewer. Was it 10,000? No; fewer. Was it 500? No; fewer. There were none—none. In two years, that waiting list had been taken from 62,513 to zero. How? By leveraging the private health system—by the government giving people vouchers so they could go and see a privatesector dentist and get their teeth fixed. Within two years noone was on that dental healthcare waiting list—not a single person. That is the power of having a system which mobilises the private health system. Those who can afford it, such as I, get private health insurance, and if we dont get it were punished under our tax system. And thats the way it should be, to make sure that our public health system is there and available for those who are most vulnerable. In my home state of Queensland, there are 2,354,000 Queenslanders with private health insurance. I say to each and every one of those Queenslanders: it would be a disaster, an absolute disaster, if this country adopted the Greens policy. This was their policy, and Ive got it here: the Greens policy from the last federal election was to abolish the private health insurance rebate. That was the Greens policy. It would be a disaster. We would see waiting lists far in excess of that 62,513 if we abolished that healthcare rebate. We all know, and the people in the gallery will know, for friends and family its nearly their No. 1 priority to make sure they have got their private health insurance coverage. Many pensioners, many people on retirement incomes, scrimp and save to make sure they have that private health insurance, and they deserve a rebate. They deserve to be rewarded by that insurance rebate, and those of us in higher income brackets deserve to be punished if we dont have private health insurance. That is how we get the best outcomes in our healthcare system—the public system working together with the private system. It will be a disaster for the people of this country if we ever change that system and rely simply on a public healthcare system, which is what the Greens are advocating. It will be a disaster for the most vulnerable of Australians, and I will certainly make sure, up to the next election, that people who voted Green at the last federal election in my home state of Queensland—in the seats of Ryan, Brisbane and Griffith—know that the Greens policy is to abolish the amount you get back for getting private health insurance coverage. I will make sure that every one of those voters knows that the Greens are coming after their private health insurance rebate. The Greens dont believe in the private health system. Theyre coming after your private health insurance rebate. I will make sure I remind those Queenslanders every day between now and the next federal election that the Greens are coming after their private health insurance rebate, because I think it would be a disaster for the health system in this country if the Greens were successful in what is clearly, patently, an ideological obsession against private providers of anything. Its an ideological obsession which would be a disaster for the most vulnerable in our community. Having made those introductory comments, Ill move now to some of the particulars of the legislation in this case. The coalition, of course, supports this legislation. It reflects much of the work that was done by the coalition government. This is an example of an orderly transition in our democratic government, with policies which were introduced by a prior government being continued under the next government where theyre in the best interests of the Australian people. It is something we should acknowledge. There are concerns, however, with respect to the lack of detail in the legislation. As senators know, I have a particular concern, wherever it applies, when there isnt sufficient detail in the legislation to understand how a system is going to work in practice. On this occasion, there are a number of areas where the legislation is lacking, and we havent seen all the regulations and delegated legislation which actually put the meat on the bones of a lot of this legislation and how it will operate in practice. There are some significant issues which are going to be dealt with in regulations that we havent seen yet, and, as we all know, the devil is often in the detail. These are some of the issues: eligibility criteria with respect to the crucial health items that fall within this legislation, listing pathways, specifications for the calculations of cost recovery, regrouping and payments for removal items et cetera. Bear in mind that, with respect to this legislation, those who are providing private health insurance, private health coverage and these sorts of services and items in the Australian community were given less than one week to consider the draft legislation—less than one week. We need to do better than that, surely. The concern I have is that when legislation is introduced in a rush there are always unintended consequences. The devil is always in the detail. There are fundamental concerns about the process with respect to this legislation and how its made its way into the Senate. The bills provide little detail about the extent or specificity of the powers to be implemented through unsighted subordinate legislative instruments and mechanisms. We just dont know the powers that underlie this legislation. Whos going to exercise those powers? What are going to be the ramifications of those powers? Its also done in regulation, which means this chamber has less opportunity to oversee that legislation and to assert our will and our concerns through disallowance procedures. Our opposition shadow minister, Senator the Hon. Anne Ruston, raised specific concerns and asked a particular question. Ill put that particular question here again today: are there going to be any changes to the ability of private health hospitals or other private institutions to provide particular surgeries and undertake particular procedures? Let me put it this way: will a private hospital undertaking a type of surgery today be able to do it tomorrow, once the regulations come into effect? Now, thats a pretty basic question. What is going to be the impact of the regulations on private hospitals in terms of the surgery they can undertake? Are they going to be prevented tomorrow, through the operation of the regulations, from doing a procedure that they can do today? Thats the sort of detail we should have as were discussing this legislation. But, because so much of the detail—and this happens again and again in this place—is going to be buried in regulations, senators from all jurisdictions, all the states and the territories, arent going to have the ability, transparency and visibility to identify particular concerns for their constituents. The system shouldnt work that way. We should have that visibility and transparency so we can raise legitimate concerns with respect to how this legislation is going to work in practice. But at the moment we just dont have that visibility, and I think the government should reflect on that. It is simply not good enough. It is not good enough for draft legislation to be released by the government of the day—I dont care of which political persuasion—and for key stakeholders to only have one week to actually give feedback on that draft legislation. If there are unintended consequences, as invariably there are—noones perfect—then the only way we can introduce in this place legislation which is effective and efficient and protects the interests of all Australians is to have a genuine consultation process with respect to the draft legislation so that we can get the views of those who know the most about how legislation like this applies in practice. This chamber and the Australian people have been denied this opportunity because this legislation has been so rushed. In this legislation, we can also see one of my key bugbears in this place. We have subordinate legislation which is going to be introduced, potentially, and there are questions over whether or not that subordinate legislation is going to be subject to disallowance. This is, again, unacceptable from my perspective. Any subordinate legislation and any regulations which are going to impact rights, liberties, freedoms and opportunities, or which are going to have any negative impact on Australians and their interests, should be subject to disallowance in this place. They should be subject to any of us as senators introducing a vote, saying, This isnt good enough, and prosecuting our arguments on the floor of this chamber and trying to persuade a majority of our colleagues to our view. We should have the opportunity to have that debate with respect to regulations that can have such a serious impact on the lives of Australians. With that, I certainly do support the intent behind this legislation. I do have material concerns with respect to how that intent is going to be translated into the regulations, because those regulations could have a material impact on Australians seeking particular surgery in the private health sphere. We need to have detail with respect to that. In conclusion, the strength of our health system is built on two foundations: the strength of our private health system and the strength of our public health system. We get the best health outcomes for all Australians when we have both a strong private health system and a strong public health system. I say to those Queenslanders who voted Green at the last federal election: we will be reminding you, between now and the next election, that the Greens are coming after your private health insurance rebate. That will be a disaster for many thousands of people. Over two million Queenslanders have private health insurance. In my view it will also be a disaster for our public health system because a successful Australian health system depends on a strong private system and a strong public system.  I rise to offer a brief contribution on the Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment (Medical Device and Human Tissue Product List and Cost Recovery) Bill 2022, the Private Health Insurance (Prostheses Application and Listing Fees) Amendment (Cost Recovery) Bill 2022 and the Private Health Insurance (National Joint Replacement Register Levy) Amendment (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022 and on the topic of private health insurance more generally. As Senator Scarr has pointed out, we do have a health system that is a mix of public and private health care. Our tax system actively incentivises many Australians to hold private health insurance. In fact, from the most recent statistics that I can see, well over half of us now have private health insurance. That number has been growing since the pandemic. People obviously value their health and they are taking up private health insurance. Given these incentives and the potential extra tax for not having private health insurance, I feel that we as a parliament have a duty to ensure that the system is working efficiently and is delivering the care that Australians need. The system clearly has its challenges. A range of commentators have expressed various views, but its really important that we remember this is affecting the lives of Australians. People feel the effects when the system, whether it is private or public, doesnt work for them. This is something I hear a lot about from my community here in the ACT. People are frustrated with what they see at times as a lack of value. Ill give you one example. I recently heard from a gentleman living in the south of Canberra. He had been to have a treatment at a prosthodontist. It cost him $1,500. He was reimbursed just $57 by his fund, despite having paid, he estimates, around $47,000 in premiums over the last 15 years. I dont claim to know the specifics of this case and the level of coverage he had, but its hard to see that this gentleman received value for his investment in this specific interaction. Over the last 15 years he has paid over $3,000 and he is out of pocket $1,400 for a procedure. Each year the ACCC delivers to the Senate a report highlighting some of the key trends in private health insurance. I thought I would highlight some of the figures that stood out to me in their 202021 report. The average gap expense for hospital treatment increased by 9.5 per cent on the previous year. It has increased by 23 per cent over the last five years. Private health insurance management costs have increased by eight per cent, or about $200 million. Thats an extra $200 million in salaries, management costs and bonuses. At the same time, the number of exclusionary policies grew by 150,000 or around 4.6 per cent. According to the ACCC, this is part of a longterm trend which has seen the number of policies with exclusions grow from 28.7 per cent in 2012 to 61.3 per cent today, which is likely a function of people cancelling top cover and opting for lowcost, basic policies to avoid the added tax expenses. However, in some good news, the industry appears to be making good on their promise not to profit from the pandemic and has reported returning a total of $2.1 billion to consumers up to 30 June last year. Its also worth noting that premium increases have generally been lower over the past couple of years—certainly lower than inflation. However, the cost of living is really hurting Australians at the moment, and every percentage point matters. From the insights delivered by the ACCC, its clear that the system is just not working as hard as it can for patients. It can work harder. That brings me to these prostheses benefits that are the topic of the bills before us today. Ive spent a number of weeks delving into this legislation and some of the complexities. I can report that it is, indeed, a complex area of policy. Its a system that seems to be quite precariously balancing a number of interests. Last year, the government entered into a fouryear agreement with the medical technology industry to drive savings on prostheses benefits. Prostheses benefits will now reduce over the next four years and will be aligned with public sector prices. However, the prices wont be able to fall below a seven per cent floor; they will have to be seven per cent higher than in the public system. It should be noted that the ACCC has raised some concerns with these arrangements in its report: While the ACCC welcomes efforts to reduce the underlying cost of prostheses, the ACCC notes that the MoUs floor on prostheses benefit reductions is likely to have some distortionary impacts on prices for medical devices in private healthcare. I understand this is a complex system and there are many different factors to take into account. In some instances, its very hard to compare whats happening in the public system with the private system. But, putting that aside, these savings that have been committed to—around $900 million, almost a billion dollars of savings on the table over the next four years from the medical technology industry—should be delivered to consumers. I have drafted an amendment that would mean that there is an update to the longstanding OPD where the ACCC reports into private health. It would simply look at how much of these savings is being realised from this agreement and how much of them is being passed on to consumers, which is something that I think this parliament has a duty to do. When these sorts of savings are put on the table for consumers, we can put processes in place that actually check on them and make sure that they are flowing. We cant have a system where large deals are agreed to by government and then have no scrutiny. There really is no point in having this generous offer of almost a billion dollars over four years and it not flowing to consumers. People who are paying their premiums every month for themselves, their partner or their whole family deserve to see a share of that almost $1 billion in savings. I have circulated an amendment. I believe it is a very minor one; it is simply adding a little bit more scrutiny. I would hope that the Senate will support it. I do not see a good reason not to support transparency measures, given this generous deal that weve seen that is going to deliver these savings. Id also like, just finally, to raise some concerns about the lack of visibility of the delegated legislation. Senator Scarr has also raised this. As a new parliamentarian, Ive been pretty shocked, frankly, at how much is done by delegated legislation from ministers. I understand thats how its done, but there should be scrutiny of that. Ideally wed have the ability to debate it and potentially amend it here in the Senate, but, if there are bills that simply allow delegated legislation, I really believe that there should be visibility over that delegated legislation so we can have a look at it and have the debate in this context, rather than having to try and use what is the very blunt instrument of disallowance. For me, the first option is certainly preferable. Being on the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Delegated Legislation, I really would echo Senator Scarrs concerns around nondisallowable instruments. Parliamentarians are elected by their electorate, or by their state or territory, to scrutinise legislation, and to have a system where there are a whole range of things that are nondisallowable doesnt make sense to me. To me, it doesnt pass the pub test when it comes to politicians being elected to represent the people that vote for them. I support this legislation. I foreshadow that I will be moving a second reading amendment, which I commend to the Senate. I really believe that it would add a layer of scrutiny without slowing up or affecting what is proposed at all.  I thank the senators for their contributions to the debate on the Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment (Medical Device and Human Tissue Product List and Cost Recovery) Bill 2022, the Private Health Insurance (Prostheses Application and Listing Fees) Amendment (Cost Recovery) Bill 2022 and the Private Health Insurance (National Joint Replacement Register Levy) Amendment (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022. This package of bills supports the implementation of a 202122 budget measure, modernising and improving the private health insurance Prostheses List. As other senators have observed, it arises after an extended period of consideration and reform. These bills represent the first tranche of legislative change required to fully implement measures that will support modernising and improving the private health insurance Prostheses List. The first bill is the Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment (Medical Device and Human Tissue Product List and Cost Recovery) Bill 2022. This bill inserts definitions of medical devices and human tissue products into the legislation, which will better define the kinds of products that, along with additional criteria contained in the legislative instrument, will be considered eligible for set benefits from private health insurers. The bill also provides for the renamed Private Health Insurance (Medical Devices and Human Tissue Products) Rules. This new name is reflective of the modernised and amended scope of the legislation. The bill also updates the cost recovery arrangements to support predictable and sustainable feeforservice arrangements. The second bill is the Private Health Insurance (Prostheses Application and Listing Fees) Amendment (Cost Recovery) Bill 2022. This bill provides for levies payable by medical technology sponsors for the listing of medical devices and human tissue products. These levies are essential as they allow the department to administer the listings in a financially sustainable and appropriate manner. The third bill is the Private Health Insurance (National Joint Replacement Register Levy) Amendment (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022, which is machinery in nature only and does not change any current requirements or obligations. These bills will modernise and improve administrative processes and cost recovery arrangements. They are longawaited improvements that will assist in keeping downward pressure on private health insurance premiums by reducing the costs associated with medical devices and human tissue products. I note the report from the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, and the government has circulated an amendment for the committee stage which goes to that. We would expect to speak to that in the committee stage. I note, too, the second reading amendments that have been moved and foreshadowed during the course of the debate. The government is not supportive of these amendments. I want to particularly speak to the second reading amendment on sheet 1826. We are aware that some stakeholders report practices between hospitals and sponsors that may constitute anticompetitive behaviour. These are usually investigated by the ACCC, supported by a body of evidence that can support the claims. The ACCC establishes an annual program of work, and any inquiry into the Prostheses List would be subject to the priorities of the ACCC. Given that such an inquiry would take some time to establish and report following a reference from the Treasurer, the government is committed to shorterterm reforms that will make a significant impact. A key component of the Prostheses List reform is the development of a new compliance framework. This will include standard regulatory regime provisions for effective monitoring, investigation, referral and enforcement. Essential to the compliance framework is the ability to gather information from stakeholders and to share information with relevant regulators on matters of noncompliance, and the ACCC and the TGA are key regulators for referring matters of noncompliance. The government is working to introduce legislation in the spring sittings to establish the compliance framework for safeguarding the Prostheses List. In the meantime, a number of existing laws continue to apply to Prostheses List stakeholders. These include: the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, which regulates the supply and advertising of therapeutic goods, including medical devices; the Australian Consumer Law, which deals with misleading or deceptive conduct in trade and commerce; and the Criminal Code, which deals with providing false or misleading information to Commonwealth entities. We consider these mechanisms appropriate while the broader reforms are being rolled out. In relation to the amendment circulated and moved by Senator SteeleJohn: all Australians deserve access to affordable treatment and medical devices to stay healthy and to live full and productive lives. Private health insurance works with our public healthcare system to offer Australians more choice in health services and encourages those Australians who can afford to do so to contribute to the cost of their own health care, taking some of the pressure off public hospital systems and waiting lists. More than half the Australian population—about 14½ million people—have private health insurance. Australians, it seems, want to exercise choice about their health care. Private health insurers must ensure their members are getting value for money. When costs rise, they want to know higher premiums are contributing to systemwide improvements like higher wages for nurses and other health workers. As I indicated, all Australians deserve access to affordable treatment and the devices they need to stay healthy and to live full and productive lives. In closing, I again thank senators for their contributions and for the courteous spirit in which the debate took place. I commend the bill to the Senate.

I would like to get a better idea of the time frames for the additional information on the time frame in which the new bundling arrangements are to come into place. Could the minister advise when we expect to have an idea of the mechanism of the bundling and the timing of that bundling?  Im advised that two weeks ago we initiated consultation on these questions. Its expected that that consultation will run for another six weeks. Sometime after that the government will be in a position to make public the relevant information. The bills commence on 1 July.  Im wondering if the minister could advise whether the substantive minister has had any issues raised by the sector as to the ability to make the IT changes that are going to be necessary to enable the change in the bundling application by 1 July. Im wondering whether youve had any concerns raised by the sector about your ability to meet those time frames.  Senator Ruston, thanks again for the question and apologies for taking time to consult officials. I am advised that the bundling issues that you refer to are not in fact contained in these bills but that they are being dealt with through a separate process.  Could you give us an idea about the time frame of the requirements in relation to bundling? Is it 1 July or is it not until September?  I am advised that the relevant time period is the second half of this year, of course, after 1 July.  In relation to the changes that are going to take effect as a result of this legislation, in relation to the levy and, obviously, the changes to the cost recovery framework—I suppose theyre the two main components—what requirements does the government believe that industry will have to put in place by 1 July?

Im wondering whether thats correct or not.   The advice I have is that that is not correct.  Im seeking an explanation from the government as to why you dont want the ACCC to report on whether these savings are going to be passed on to consumers. Theres $900 million on the table from the medtech industry. My amendment didnt touch this bill at all; all it said was: Heres some transparency around what happens to that $900 million.  Thanks for the question, Senator Pocock. I did step through that in my second reading remarks, but I am happy to touch on it in brief terms again. I think, for a number of reasons, we didnt support the Senate making a direction of this kind. The first reason is that, essentially, this power exists with the ACCC. The Treasurer has a capacity to require an inquiry of this kind, but, in the end, the ACCC has a capacity for investigation, and they establish their priorities according to their resources and the issues before them. I think the second one was really about time frames. There is a new compliance framework being developed. It includes the ability to gather information from stakeholders and share information with relevant regulators on matters of noncompliance. There is a framework which is being brought forward. In the meantime, as I indicated in the second reading remarks, there are a number of existing powers which apply to participants in this market.  To follow on from that, I understand that there is a longstanding OPD for the ACCC to report to the Senate on a number of things regarding private health insurance. Given theres a new agreement, with $900 million on the table and people keen to ensure theyre getting value for money with their premiums, why cant we at least know if that money is being passed on, given the ACCC is looking at this anyway?  Thank you for the question, Senator Pocock. Im advised that the issues that you are raising interact in complicated ways with the health portfolio because, of course, the ACCC is a Treasury agency. The public sector advisers who are here to provide advice today in the Senate are drawn from the health department. However, I think Minister Gallagher would be happy to have a further discussion with you about this, but we would need some time to obtain the necessary advice.  In relation to the decision to take a number of items off the Prostheses List and put them into generaluse bundling, the Clinical Implementation Reference Group went through a process to make a decision on these particular items. Im wondering if theres any brief summary you can give us on the determination of those items. There must have been some sort of clinical definition as to why they were removed, and Im wondering whether its possible to get the meeting papers in relation to the removal of those items.  Thanks very much, Senator Ruston. If I may, Ill take the question about the papers on notice. We will review them and see what may be appropriately provided.  On that basis, does the CIRG have an ongoing role—either in the short term or in the longer term—in relation to not just what is currently included or not included on the Prostheses List but what happens into the future in terms of exclusions and inclusions?  Thanks, Senator Ruston. Im advised that they only have a role for the duration of the reforms, which will end in 2025.  We could take up more time if we keep doing this! Im wondering if you could provide an update as to where this current situation is in relation to the alternative funding arrangements and mechanisms in relation to these items that are now going to go into general use.  Senator Ruston, I understand from your question that youre referring to the bundling. I refer to my earlier answer, which indicated that theres a consultation process on foot at the moment, which I understand will extend for approximately six weeks.  Is there any truth in the view that the departments preferred mechanism for bundling is by facility type?  Im advised that the consultation paper makes reference to three options. It indicates a preferred option, and that is the option that you have referred to just now.  Could you advise whether your early consultations have provided a result that would indicate that, more broadly, the industry and the sector are seeking for bundling to be done by procedure, not by facility type?  The consultation process, as Ive indicated, has just begun. We intend to let that take its course before drawing any conclusions about the preferences of stakeholders.  Thats interesting: you have the preference of the department already out there and trying to lead the consultation, yet you havent sought to find out the preferred mechanism of your stakeholders, the very people who are required to actually implement these changes. So that is disappointing. The minister announced in December that the alternative payment structure, whatever it happens to be, would be mandated. Can you advise how long it will be mandated for?","Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment (Medical Device and Human Tissue Product List and Cost Recovery) Bill 2022, Private Health Insurance (Prostheses Application and Listing Fees) Amendment (Cost Recovery) Bill 2022, Private Health Insurance (National Joint Replacement Register Levy) Amendment (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[2]/speech[10]/talk.text/body/p","Senator RUSTON (South Australia—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) ","(13:17):"

In December, when questioned in relation to the removing of these particular items into the general use bucket, the minister said, in response to their funding, that the payment of them by the insurers would be mandated. Im just keen to understand the intended length of time for that mandate.   Senator, I think we need to take that question on notice, and well see what we can find for you.  Thank you, Minister. You may need to take this on notice as well: Im just keen to understand what the legislative or regulatory process would be to implement the mandate that Ive asked you to find out about.  Thank you. In similar terms, well take that on notice and see what information we can provide you, Senator Ruston.  Thank you. Im wondering whether the department has assessed the impact on specific procedures as a result of these removals.  Thank you, Senator Ruston. The questions youre asking go to matters that are really beyond the scope of the bill before us. I accept that they are related and associated with the ongoing reform process. In this question, again, we may need to come back to you and assess what may be appropriately provided.  Thank you. I accept that youve taken it on notice, but I think what Im trying to get to is the very nature of the fact that we have before us this bill that actually provides a whole series of enabling capabilities for the government to do things, not the least of which is the removal from the Prostheses List of in excess of 400 items that now have to be dealt with by an alternative funding model. Obviously, this is of significant concern more broadly because it could potentially have very significant impacts on the delivery of services. I accept that youre not the minister—youre a representing minister—and I appreciate you want to take these on notice, but, given that this bill is going to come back a little bit later this afternoon or maybe tomorrow, Id really appreciate being able to understand whether youve actually assessed the impacts of how you might proceed in dealing with the funding or the payment of these particular items as it impacts on actual procedures. As an example, I asked in my speech in the second reading debate: can you guarantee that bariatric procedures, which use a significant number of the items that will be transferred off the Prostheses List into this new general use area, will remain costeffective for delivery by private hospitals through this insurance mechanism following the changes? The thing that I think everybody wants to find out about whats going on here is whether the procedures that are currently being undertaken are not going to be detrimentally impacted by the changes.

This is an annual event that sees thousands of Australians get out and about in their communities to clean up, fix up and conserve our environment. Its the good oldfashioned power of people. Its a recreational fishing group removing marine debris. Its school students keeping their neighbourhood clean and tidy. Its treeplanting groups removing litter from a local reserve.  Its no different in my neck of the woods in Far North Queensland, where we are lucky enough to have both the wet tropics rainforests and the Great Barrier Reef on our doorstep. Just this weekend the Hekili Outrigger Canoe Club, based out of Yorkeys Knob, held their own cleanup event, and it was very well attended. We know the challenge of cleaning up at these events is a positive, practical action that makes a difference to the health of our planet, but that challenge goes far beyond one day. I also know that there are individuals, groups and businesses right across this country that are doing their bit day in, day out to help. As Special Envoy for the Great Barrier Reef, I see this commitment every single day in our communities, with groups like the Tangaroa Blue foundation, who I was fortunate enough to join forces with recently to host a community beach clean, alongside the Dawul Wuru rural rangers and local residents. We removed over 33 kilograms of rubbish from a local beach and waterway that feeds directly into the Great Barrier Reef. I am incredibly proud of these groups and the work that they do. Im also proud that as a Labor government weve got straight to work to restore our environmental credibility, to recognise the value of our natural environment and to take real action on climate change. We couldnt do it without the community on the ground. We will back their commitment with real action, and were seeing that already. Just a few months ago, Australia signed a strong determination to end plastic pollution around the world.

The people on the lawns were angry. They felt powerless, and they felt that noone cared about or was listening to them. They were people who have sought asylum here in Australia, risking their lives to free themselves from oppressive regimes in places such as Afghanistan, Iran, Syria. Most had been locked up here in Australia or offshore for many years just for exercising their right to seek refuge. Many have had fasttracked visa applications rejected unfairly, and now they exist on temporary or bridging visas, with children not permitted to attend university. Some are not able to access Medicare, and they are not able to bring their ageing parents to join them here.  Karima from Melbourne said to me that she and her family had been in limbo for the past 11 years and have never felt settled in this country that they wish to call home. They feel betrayed by the government. Some shared photos theyd taken with a smiling Andrew Giles soon after the election. Despite some changes promised by the government, 10 months on thousands of people are continuing to live in so much pain. I promised them that I would continue to speak out on their behalf, for speedy processing of their visas and for their rights to study, to work, to health care and to bring their ageing parents here to be with them. Above all I call on the government to listen to the families I met this morning and to treat them with care and humanity as fellow human beings, rather than political problems. To Karima, Hayder, Hussein, Rocyia, Zainab, Ibrahim and everyone I met this morning I say: I care, the Greens care, and we will keep fighting for you until justice is achieved for you.","Asylum Seekers","STATEMENTS BY SENATORS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[3]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Sena tor RICE (Victoria) ","(13:34):"

Australians are forced to sit through these rituals everywhere from the commencement of parliament to school assemblies. Theyre now more common than singing our national anthem, and, far from being an ancient practice, these rituals began to be used by progressive activists in the early 2000s. The practice suggests that Australians whose families have lived here for generations, possibly since settlement, are not welcome. The welcome to country is nothing more than something wealthy city people love to do to make themselves feel good.  All Australians have the right to call this country home, but the activists and bureaucratic classes want division as it perpetuates the victimhood mindset that they use to manipulate people. By the way, when is reconciliation actually going to be achieved? What does it look practically? Will it be achieved when we have a treaty, when Australians are paying some sort of rent tax, or perhaps when there is a new Indigenous nation that will further divide Australians? The answer is that activists will never be happy, and we all know it because bitterness and resentment are their bread and butter. So, next time youre asked to participate in one of the ceremonies remember that, despite what they say, refusing doesnt make you a racist. Heres my memo to the grievance industry: thanks for the virtue theatre, but, like most Australians, Im sick and tired of being welcomed to my own country.","Welcome to Country Ceremonies","STATEMENTS BY SENATORS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[4]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator ANTIC (South Australia) ","(13:36):"

Already 45 people have died in truck crashes this year, including 10 truck drivers. Last week we saw the collapse of one of the largest cold chain logistics companies in Australia, Scotts Refrigerated Logistics. Scotts had revenues last year of half a billion dollars, but their margins were so razor thin that they were not able to survive. John Waltis, a driver at Scotts, said: Myself and 1,500 others just lost our jobs at Scotts because of the squeeze on transport contracts from the top. One of my mates had just had a baby and now hes lost his job. Retailers like Aldi are responsible for this.  Economic pressure from Audi, Amazon and others like them have squeezed margins and drivers quite literally to their deaths to meet another trucking cost. Many drivers are forced to overwork, speed and delay maintenance just to make ends meet—45 deaths, 1,500 jobs lost, countless families ripped apart. However, Coles and Woolworths have committed to safe and sustainable supplychain practices, and I commend them for turning around and taking those steps. But Aldi and Amazon are standing by their deadly practices. The Transport Workers Union has called on Aldi, Amazon and 38 others to join Coles and Woolworths in committing to safe and fair supply chain practices. This government is committed to reform in this space. Blood is on the hands of Aldi, Amazon and other companies at the top of the supply chain operating like them.","Trucking Industry","STATEMENTS BY SENATORS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[5]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator SHELDON (New South Wales) ","(13:38):"

The National Assistance Card is an initiative of the Brain Injury Association of Tasmania and it has been made possible thanks to the Australian governments Information, Linkages and Capacity Building grants, its ILC grants.  The National Assistance Card is a personalised card that explains the cardholders unique areas of difficulty and how you can assist them. A QR code on the card links to more detailed information and the cardholder can also upload a short video. One situation where the card is particularly useful is when the cardholders behaviour is misunderstood by others and the cardholder, due to their disability or stress or anxiety, has difficulty explaining their disability and the assistance they need. A great example of this is when Hobart woman Cate Curwood, who has an acquired brain injury, was experiencing sensory overload in a store and inadvertently walked out without paying. With the help of her National Assistance Card she was able to explain her situation to store security. The National Assistance Card is currently available to anyone throughout Australia with an acquired brain injury and is currently being trialled in Tasmania for people with autism. In fact, one of my staff has one for his sixyearold autistic son. While there is a small fee for the card, the cost per cardholder would be unaffordable without government funding for the project. It has the strong support of many agencies, including police services, throughout Australia. I hope that this project can not only continue but expand to cover people with any kind of disability or severe health condition. I congratulate everyone involved in this project, including the Brain Injury Association of Tasmania, Autism Tasmania, Business Software Tasmania and the Department of Social Services.","National Assistance Card","STATEMENTS BY SENATORS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[6]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator BILYK (Tasmania) ","(13:40):"

They have a test, from the Australian people, as to how they handle the costofliving crisis that is ravaging Australian families. Small businesses, individuals and families, in particular, are under extraordinary pressure. You do have to wonder, given the answers weve heard in this place and the other place, whether this government has any clue as to what to do to the costofliving pressures that families are under.  Senator Gallagher, the Minister for Finance, has been asked on numerous occasions—probably more numerous than shed like to count in this place—what the government is doing to alleviate costofliving pressures. The only things she can name are policies that the Labor Party announced prior to the last election, prior to the record and rapid rises in interest rates that weve seen over the past 10 months. In fact, most of those policies that she cites as alleviating costofliving pressures were announced in 2021—before we saw rises in interest rates, before we saw the rampant inflation that is present in this country. It was at a time when the Labor Party were still promising people real wage increases, which they havent delivered.

Theyve refused to sign up to safety and fairness when committing: … to being accountable for safe and fair outcomes for transport workers throughout our supply chains, from the top to bottom. Theyve refused to sign up to transparency: To ensure no worker falls through the cracks we commit to ensuring our transport contracts are transparent about the nature of the work, the working conditions and who performs this work. Aldi and Amazon have refused to sign up to Collective Voice, which will: … empower workers to collectively stand up and speak out on pay and safety in such a dangerous industry. Aldi and Amazon have also refused to sign up to education and consultation. The others have said: We will ensure ongoing systematic worker and management education and training, and supply chain consultation with the TWU to improve safety and sustainability. This pair of corporate insults—I wont say the word that Im really thinking!—has also refused to sign up to lifting industry standards, which: … commit to working with the TWU to pursue industry initiatives that will improve work practices and seek to eliminate arrangements that provide financial incentives or pressures to engage in unsafe practices— as Senator Sheldon touched on.

Codeswitching and whiteadjusting to adapt their behaviour closer to whiteness are a sad reality for culturally and racially marginalised women.  Eightythree per cent of women reported experiencing pressure to act, look and sound like existing leaders—who are often white men. Seventyfive per cent of women reported that others assumed they worked in a lowerstatus job and treated them as such. Eightyfive per cent of women felt that they had to work twice as hard to get the same treatment. Sixtyone per cent of women reported experiencing racism at work in the past two years, while 48 per cent experienced sexism at work over the same period. I can relate to many of these intersectional experiences. When racism and sexism intersect it is visceral, and it is damaging. Yet it is denied and ignored, and women of colour keep being marginalised in workplaces. Australia has a blind spot where racism is concerned. The Diversity Council notes that for many in Australia, particularly those experiencing racism, the current language of culturally and linguistically diverse is outdated and problematic. The council found that many women prefer the term CARM—culturally and racially marginalised—over CALD as it is more accurately capturing their experiences. Terms like CALD have had their day. They bunch together people whose experiences are very different under the same label. They might sound nice but can make invisible the people who face racism on a daily basis and the harm that it causes. To have a meaningful conversation about building an antiracist Australia, we have to tell it like it is: race and racism are used to marginalise people, and their impacts on women are compounded.

At worst, were hearing stories of subbies going bankrupt or otherwise going into financial difficulty. In some tragic cases, subcontractors have committed suicide after a number of projects fell over and they didnt get paid for work they had already done. Tradies have the right to be paid for work that they complete on a building site. We have this report. We have ways of making this happen. What we need is the political will.

FermenTasmania was granted $17.5 million by the coalition governments Building Better Regions Fund in 2021, and the hub is expected to open next year.  The 1,800squaremetre facility provides space to test and develop fermented beverages and food; nutraceuticals, which are products derived from foods that have health benefits or medical foods; and green energy on a small scale, with a view to scaling up. With producers and fermentation mentors working together, these new products can be perfected before being launched. This means innovations in wine, cheese, spirits, chocolate, miso, condiments, yoghurt, sourdough and products we havent even dreamed of yet. These will be researched and developed in Tasmania for a wider market. Aspiring fermentedproduct developers are now submitting expressions of interest to be part of the hubs starter culture. They include applicants from agribusiness, agritourism, education, the food and beverage sector and hospitality. Entry to the hubs starterculture cohort includes space, access to equipment and expertise, training opportunities, advice on scaling up for commercial production, diversifying product offerings and more. The Fermentation Hub team will also help producers with commercial focused research, with support from industry experts at the University of Tasmania, TasTAFE and the Institute of Brewing and Distilling.

Julia Gillard slapped a kneejerk ban on live cattle exports over a heavily biased ABC report about slaughtering practices in another country, thousands of miles from Canberra. Under GreensLabor climate policies, farmers, energy, fuel and fertiliser costs have all skyrocketed. Its said you shouldnt bite the hand that—quite literally—feeds you, but Labor is doing it all over again with its clear intention to destroy the live sheep export industry in Western Australia. This industry supports thousands of jobs and hundreds of businesses along the supply chain and is a mainstay of regional economies. Labor does not have a mandate to destroy sheep farming in this country, but Labor, of course, does not care about jobs in the bush or regional communities and the money sheep farming brings into the country.  Mark my words: this is just the beginning of a strategic attack on all livestock industries in Australia. Unfairly demonising livestock producers as climate polluters, the ultimate aim of Labor and the Greens is to force us all to become vegetarians. Their first step is to ban live exports. Then they will take away the rest of the water needed to irrigate pastures and water stock—weve already seen them abandon dams in Queensland. After that, they will force crippling emissions reduction targets on producers. By then, meat and fresh milk will be in such short supply that most Australians wont be able to afford them.

Her passing, at the age of 69, reminds me of just how much one person who believes in something bigger than herself can achieve when she stands together with people who feel the same. Lorraine was a leader in the campaign for school cleaners to win back good jobs after 4,000 public school cleaners were sacked and then asked to reapply for their jobs, on less money and hours, as contractors. In the years that followed, Victorian schools were awash with wage theft, flybynight contractors and dirty classrooms.  Lorraine and her husband, Ian, also a school cleaner, stood up and spoke out. In the beginning it was Ian who led the charge, but, when he died, Lorraine told me it was her time to step out and speak out. Lorraine was only small in stature, but I can tell you she had a big heart, a big smile and an even bigger voice. Her determination pushed the Victorian government to finally end decades of insecure contracts in 2018, and her legacy lives on in the working lives of thousands of school cleaners. Lorraine and Ian epitomised what union really means. It means family—a family of people standing together for the betterment of all—and it means dignity and real respect for hard work.

We on this side understand that one of the major pressures on our economy is disrupted supply chains. As the Reserve Bank has said, supply chain issues are responsible for up to twothirds of inflationary pressures in the economy. To relieve this pressure we need to be a country that can make things here and stand on our own two feet. That is what the National Reconstruction Fund is about. It is a fund that represents one of the biggest ever investments in Australian manufacturing capacity, revitalising Australian manufacturing, creating secure Australian jobs, making things here, investing in new industries like critical industries and seizing opportunities for renewable energy. The National Reconstruction Fund is good for jobs, good for manufacturing and good for the economy.  I suppose it makes sense that that is why those opposite would oppose it, because these are the parties that neglected our supply chains and failed Australian workers, but they are very good at saying no, just as they said no last year to providing families and businesses with relief from energy prices.

We are making investments in those types of areas against a background of a budget that was riddled with waste and porkbarrelling and a failure to deal with the pressures.

As senators in this place would know, under prudential requirements all superannuation funds are required to consider diversification and liquidity when making investments, and, if funds are doing this, they should have some liquid assets to meet any tax liabilities. There are a range of cashflow requirements within an SMSF, not just tax liabilities, which trustees must consider. These include, for example, accounting administration costs, investment fees and the costs associated with maintaining real assets, such as property. For SMSFs with balances in the retirement phase, liquidity is also required for the purpose of meeting pension payments, including on those minimum drawdown requirements. Individuals can also hold their assets in super and elect to pay the tax or any tax liabilities they have by using savings outside of superannuation to avoid paying from their business assets.  So we have been clear on what this change is about. It is for those with highbalance accounts—over $3 million. We know there are accounts with hundreds of millions of dollars in them. Superannuation is primarily about having a dignified retirement and being able to have savings available to you during your retirement years. What we are doing is making a very modest change to the concessional arrangements that remain concessional for those with balances over $3 million.

"0","1","0","0","1","Watt, Sen Murray","245759","Queensland","ALP","N/A","490"," Thank you, Senator Ciccone, someone who I know has a very deep and longstanding interest in the agriculture industry in our country. Well, today, Senator Ciccone, I have good news for Australian farmers, farm workers and all in the agriculture supply chain. Todays latest release of data from ABARES shows that the agriculture industry is well on its way towards its goal of exceeding $100 billion farmgate output by 2030. In the last financial year, the agriculture industry reached the $90 billion mark—an alltime record—and I congratulate every farmer, every processor, every worker and supply chain member for this achievement.  This was done off the back of what were, with some exceptions, great seasonal conditions, which have meant record farm cash incomes for broadacre and dairy farms over the past two years. But, of course, the context to this is that input costs for farm businesses are rising, impacting farm profits. Years of failed energy policies and chronic underinvestment in skills development have come home to roost. As a result of this and global factors, agriculture input costs have risen sharply since mid2021, particularly the price of fertiliser, which has more than doubled, putting intense strain on farming businesses to balance the books. Thats why the National Reconstruction Fund is so important. We need a future made in Australia, and that applies to agriculture just as much as every other industry. We should be valueadding, and we should be making more things here. The ability to make things here is vital to not only reduce input costs but also increase the value of the final product that our agriculture industry rolls out. And thats exactly what the National Reconstruction Fund will do, coinvesting with industry, including agriculture, to grow our primary industries and turn raw products into even highervalue ones. The Albanese Labor government wants Australia to be a country that makes things again, and we are backing our agricultural manufacturing industry to ensure that that happens.","Agriculture Industry","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[9]/answer[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator WATT (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister for Emergency Management) ","(14:53):"

Once established, that money will be available to coinvest in more food processing, in bringing down energy costs and more valueadding.  A great example of something that could potentially fit in that category, that we should be making here, is fertiliser. We have the raw materials here in Australia that we export to other countries, so why shouldnt we be making more fertiliser here in Australia and why shouldnt the government support industry to get it started?

"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I move:  That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today. What we saw in question time today was a Labor Party who have fundamentally failed to understand that theyve broken their trust with the Australian people. Weve seen them break one promise, and we know theyre going to break more promises. If theyre going to go after people with $3 million in their super account, whats to stop them going after people with $250,000 in their super account? That is what this is all about. It is about the fundamental breach of trust between a political party elected into office and those who voted for them. The Labor Party are forgetting the main principle of super. Its not the Labor Partys money. Its not the governments money. Its not Canberras money. Its your money. Its money that youve put away. Its money that your employer has put away on your behalf so you can have a safe retirement. Over the last few weeks, the Labor Party, who went to the last election promising one thing, have now swooped in like a bunch of angry magpies, wanting to steal peoples money from them. Thats what this debate is about. It is about the Labor Party taking your money from you. Before the election, the now Prime Minister specifically ruled out any changes to the super system; that is what the Prime Minister said. Treasurer Chalmers said the same thing: There are not going to be any changes to taxes; there will be no tax rises. But they are doubling the tax on peoples super accounts. Treasurer Chalmers has inherited an eccentric economic legacy. He is a child of Paul Keating. Treasurer Chalmers did his PhD on Paul Keating, who most famously broke a promise. Before an election, Keating said that tax cuts would be law law tax cuts, and then he broke that promise. Treasurer Chalmers then went on to great heights and worked for that other great Labor Treasurer, Wayne Swan. He was his deputy chief of staff and then chief of staff. This is the person who is now in charge of Australias finances. Treasurer Chalmers is the love child of Paul Keating and Wayne Swan. If that doesnt scare you, then the full realisation that Labor are coming after your super accounts should scare you. What a Labor minister has said in relation to your super accounts is that its honey—just think about that. Im a big fan of WinniethePooh, and WinniethePooh is a great fan of honey, but thats WinniethePoohs honey. How dare the Labor Party treat your money—the money that youve worked so hard for—as their money, their honey, to be given away, to be put where they want it? Leave peoples money alone. I dont know anyone who has millions of dollars in their super account, but—guess what—good on them. Theyve worked so hard for it. Its not as if they won Gold Lotto and went: Yippee! Ive got $3 million in my bank account. These people worked for it. What the Labor government is saying to these Australians is, Were taking that money off you. What should concern you even more—and Ill repeat myself here because certain people in this building are hard of hearing; theyve probably come from the shallow end of the gene pool and dont understand basic economics—is that, if theyre going to come for super accounts with $3 million, theyre going to come for super accounts with $250,000 or $300,000. Once they break a promise, theyll break other promises. The strongest message that has come out of todays question time is that Labor have no shame whatsoever about breaking promises and they have no shame about taking your money—money that you and your family have worked so hard for. But the mob over there, the mob on the Left side of politics, dont understand that, because theyve never had a real job. These are the people whove never worked on a farm or in a business. These people have worked in the Public Service—and by the way, good on people who work in the Public Service, except when you end up on that side, being that bunch of economic vandals who are destroying Australians retirements.

It is an absolute disgrace. This is the hill they want to die on—but sure. There are some sensible questions coming from over here, but over there is absolutely ludicrous. We know what side theyve chosen, and it is not the side of the Australian people.  We know that the tax changes they made to superannuation will affect one in three people. It is four per cent of the population now, but they will affect one in three people in 30 years time. But sure: have a crack at us. They dont want to support things that will actually ease costofliving pressures for Australians, like cheaper child care, cheaper medicine, skills, housing. Theyre focused on 0.5 per cent of the population. The people theyre advocating for wouldnt necessarily care a whole lot about these things. They dont care about secure jobs. They dont care about Australian manufacturing.

It wasnt just Labor who inherited $1 trillion of debt from the absolutely derelict management of the budget. Its the Australian people who inherited that debt. Australian taxpayers are having to pay for the trillion dollars of debt they left them. So I just want to make sure that we understand the problem that we are facing as a country and that Australian taxpayers are having to pay the bill for. It is an absolute neglect of responsibility on their side. Whats been really clear over the past couple of weeks is whose side they are really on. Theyre on the side of 17 people who have over $100 million of super. Thats whose side theyre on—not the side of the average Australian person. And theyre on the side of the one person who has $400 million of super. But they want to absolutely try to deny a $1anhour wage increase for our lowestpaid workers. One dollar an hour is all those workers were asking for. Those opposite want to absolutely say that thats off the table, but they want to go in hard and die on a hill for people who have over $3 million in super balances. What an absolute disgrace. They want to be on the side of 0.5 per cent of the population. Its worth saying that Labor built super. We will always protect it. We know that those opposite have a whole lot of things that they want to say no to: secure jobs, Australian manufacturing, affordable housing, power bill relief and wage increases. But what they want to say yes to is borrowing billions of dollars to give 0.5 per cent of Australians a tax break. This measure will give the budget $2 billion in its first year. Those opposite have no solutions, no ideas and no alternatives—just no. Their idea for trying to repair some of the damage done to the budget is to go after some of our most vulnerable Australians. Of course Im talking about robodebt. Alan Tudge said: Well find you, well track you down, you will have to repay those debts and you may end up in prison. They try to track down some of our most vulnerable Australians but they advocate hard for those with over $3 million in their superannuation.","Answers to Questions","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[7]","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","1","Lines, Sen Sue (The PRESIDENT)","112096","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I rise to make some remarks in relation to Senator Gallaghers answers during question time today. The current government made a number of promises before the election about not wanting to touch super. Several statements were made on the record. Further to that, statements were made about not wanting to touch franking credits. This week weve seen legislation introduced to change franking credits, to destroy the franking system, and a new policy to introduce a new tax on super. All of these ideas may have been developed in the Treasury department. The government are facilitating these ideas because they do not want to restrain spending, which is what they should be doing. Theyre spending $45 billion on offbalancesheet items, which is fuelling inflation. And weve seen another interest rate rise today, thanks to the Labor Party. The government could also be looking to bank their gains from commodity price increases, but rather than do that theyve decided to introduce this new tax.  So far, the government have had two policies on super. The first policy has been to funnel more money to the unions and the second policy has been to put in place a new tax. If theyre not locking it up and taxing it, theyre locking it up and shipping it off to the union. Those are the two policies the Labor government has on super. This particular taxation measure introduces a very novel, very strange concept of unrealised gains. If youre a company, you dont pay tax on revenue and you dont pay tax on sales; you pay tax on profit. You deduct your expenses from your revenue and that is your profit, and you pay tax on that profit. The same thing goes for the super funds today. They pay tax on earnings, which recognises that its very hard to pay a tax if you havent actually got some money in your hand to pay the taxman. But the government want to pursue this very strange idea of unrealised gains, which will result in superannuants having to sell lumpy assets in their funds in order to pay the taxman. That is a foreign concept in Australian taxation law. It remains to be seen how that will happen. Perhaps the most important point, though, is the judgement call not to index this measure. For the party that say super is their favourite thing, this is the thing that is going to wreck the system, because why would anyone want to put money into a system for 30 or 40 years when they know theres going to be a great big tax at the end of it? If you are 30 years old, you are going to be in the cohort that will have the greatest tax disincentive because of the time value of money. If the measure is not indexed, why on earth would people put money into a super scheme? If I wanted to wreck the system—and I personally think its a very bad system because it doesnt work very well for workers or for the taxpayer—I would do what the Labor government is doing, which is to not index the scheme. Increasingly, Australians will look at other ways of saving for retirement. One of the great differences between us in this chamber is that we believe in the individual. We believe that Australians are smart enough to make their own judgements. The Labor Party believe in paternalism, and they think people are too stupid to save for themselves, so they have introduced—","Answers to Questions","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator BRAGG (New South Wales) ","(15:15):"

But I did enjoy seeing her having fun making her contribution here today, and I acknowledge her contribution.  There are two fundamental issues we have in relation to this issue of the superannuation changes. The first is the legitimate expectation of the Australian people that people who are elected in this place, especially if theyre from the governing parties, will say before an election what they plan to do and then actually do it and also will say before an election what theyre not going to do and then not do it. Thats the first issue we have. Lets go through it chronologically. This is all on the public record. Prime Minister Albanese said on 31 January 2022: We have not planned for any changes on superannuation. Barely one year later, promise broken. Our Treasurer, the Hon. Jim Chalmers, member for Rankin, said: Look, weve said about superannuation that we would maintain the system. Our Treasurer said that on ABC Insiders on 27 March 2022, less than 12 months ago—promise broken. And then our Prime Minister again: Weve said we have no intention to make any super changes. Thats our now Prime Minister, speaking on 2 May 2022—promise broken. That is the fundamental issue in this debate: broken promises from the now Labor government. They said in opposition that they wouldnt do certain things. They get into government. Less than 12 months later, they do exactly what they promised not to do, and that will quite legitimately shake the Australian peoples belief in the integrity of this new government. They have said one thing before an election to get elected and then done the opposite thing after an election. To be frank, it impacts all of us. It impacts all politicians, because we all suffer a bit when someone makes a promise before an election and doesnt carry it through. Thats the fundamental problem we have here: the government saying one thing in opposition and doing the opposite when they get elected. The second issue we have here is the notion that you should tax unrealised capital gains. I dont know where this concept came from, but it doesnt make any sense. In superannuation, you want to keep your investments stable over the longer term. You shouldnt be forced to sell them in order to meet a tax liability. It doesnt make any sense. I dont know where the government got this advice from. My colleague Senator McKenzie asked a very legitimate question of the finance minister with respect to the position of farming families who hold the family farm in a selfmanaged super fund. Its quite reasonable that tax is paid on the rent thats paid by the individuals to the selfmanaged super fund which owns the farm. Noones going to quibble with that. We wouldnt cavil with that at all. The problem under the laws as proposed is that, if the price of the farm fluctuates upwards because of high rainfall, good markets et cetera, it could create a tax liability which would require the liquidation of the farm in order to meet the liability. That is the fundamental issue. And it isnt just me saying this; it is the National Farmers Federation. These are not the words of a politician, but the words of the peak body representing farmers. It said: Australias peak farming body has warned that superannuation changes announced by Treasurer Jim Chalmers could cool investment in agriculture, unless the detail is worked through with farmers. … … … Yesterdays announcement throws up significant uncertainty for family farms—with scant detail on things like grandfathering, treatment of revaluations, or how this might impact lending in a climate of rising costs and interest rates … These are not my words. They are not the words of a politician but those of the peak body representing farmers. The farmers in my home state of Queensland deserve to get answers from the Minster for Finance in relation to those questions.

"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I move:  That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Gallagher) to a question without notice I asked today relating to interest rates. As I stand here to make this speech, the RBA has just raised interest rates again. This is the first time in Australias history that there have been 10 consecutive interest rate rises. The RBA itself has found that the current inflation spike is being driven primarily by supplyside shocks and corporate profiteering. The RBA itself has admitted that its models are not well suited for supply shocks and also that there is very little that monetary policy can do to offset supply shocks. The RBA said today that the monthly CPI indicator suggests that inflation has peaked. Yet here we find ourselves, colleagues, with 10 consecutive interest rate rises. The RBA is responding to a problem it admits its models cant understand with a solution that it admits is the wrong tool for the job. This is a form of institutional madness. The central bank is out of control, and it needs to be reined in. This is where the government should act. Specifically, Treasurer Jim Chalmers needs to wake up from his slumber and take action to save the renters and mortgage holders of Australia from being smashed by the RBAs relentless and dogmatic interest rate rises. The Treasurer has the power under the RBA Act currently, and he should exercise that power rather than sit idly by while the RBA risks tanking the economy and smashing renters and mortgage holders. Instead of sitting on his hands, he should intervene in the RBA. What he should also do is introduce a corporate superprofits tax. Lets all be clear about where we find ourselves at the moment. Real wages are declining at the fastest rate on record in Australia. Yet corporate profits are going through the roof. We are through the looking glass here, colleagues. This is the dead end of neoliberal economics. People are starving while the corporations announce mega profits, and the government does nothing about it because it is blinkered by its neoliberal orthodoxy. The opposition is the same. This is where we find ourselves. The Treasury told the Senate estimates committee that the risk of a wageprice spiral remains low, but here we are with renters and mortgage holders getting smashed by interest rate rises in a circumstance where the RBA itself has found that the majority of the inflation spike is being driven by supplyside shocks and corporate profiteering. The government seems to believe that 10 consecutive interest rate rises smashing people, renters and mortgage holders, into poverty is the right response to a nonexistent wageprice spiral. Figures out today show that the volume in retail sales is in decline. People are buying less because they cant afford to buy stuff. The poorest Australians, those who can least afford to be made worse off, are being left behind while the wealthiest Australians continue to make out like bandits. Yet all the government can do is offer some ashenfaced commentary while people are being smashed into poverty and while the banks, the fossil fuel corporations and the supermarkets announce mega profits. We need to tax corporate superprofits, tax the wealthy, freeze rents, put dental and mental health into Medicare and raise income supports. We could do it all tomorrow if the government would work with the Greens.

"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," At the request of Senators Bilyk and Van, I move:  That the Senate, observing one year since Russias 24 February 2022 invasion of Ukraine: (a) deplores the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which continues a pattern of illegal and immoral aggression against Ukraines sovereignty and territorial integrity, which has resulted in a toll of destruction, many thousands of human casualties, and the displacement of over 14 million Ukrainians; (b) condemns: (i) acts by Russia aimed at destroying the national, cultural, religious and democratic institutions of the Ukrainian people and Ukraines sovereignty and territorial integrity, and (ii) Russia for violating international law noting the clear evidence of war crimes being committed against the Ukrainian people; (c) notes Australia continues to stand with Ukraine against Russian aggression and has provided Ukraine with military and humanitarian support, as well as refuge for displaced people and will continue to do so; and (d) reaffirms the eleventh emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly, which also condemned, deplored and expressed grave concern over attacks on civilian populations and infrastructure and reiterates its demand that Russia withdraw from Ukraines recognised sovereign territory. It is with sorrow and resolve that I move this motion marking one year since Russias illegal and immoral fullscale invasion of Ukraine—sorrow for lives lost, futures disrupted, civilians recklessly targeted by Russian missiles, and the hunger and hardship deliberately inflicted on the vulnerable of the world by a criminal Russian regime through the deliberate damage it has wrought on global markets for grain and energy. But the courageous people of Ukraine can do little with our sorrow, so I also move this notion to demonstrate our governments and our nations resolve. As Olena Zelenska, Ukraines first lady, has said, we are not commemorating a year of war. We are celebrating a year of resistance, a year of courage, a year of solidarity, and a year of Australia and our partners doing what we can to support the people of Ukraine. We have imposed travel bans and targeted financial sanctions on more than 1,000 individuals and entities in response to Russias fullscale invasion of Ukraine. Weve committed more than $500 million in military assistance to Ukraine, including, most recently, $33 million for additional uncrewed aerial systems. In late January I had the privilege of visiting the training grounds where ADF personnel are training members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine as part of a UKled multinational training program. We do many things in this job which are moving, but that was amongst the most moving of engagements Ive had. I was deeply moved by interactions with the new Ukrainian soldiers, who only a year ago were teachers, farmers, professionals and more, now standing ready to fight against Russian aggression. Mr Putin and Russia have underestimated the courage of Ukrainians like these soldiers, and they underestimated the resolve of the global community. As I said in the UN last year, Russia is to be condemned for its illegal and immoral invasion. It should be condemned as an attack on all smaller countries. What it represents, fundamentally, is the assertion that a larger country is entitled to subjugate a smaller neighbour. On 24 February, Australia was one of 141 UN member states that again rejected this assertion—141 countries voted in support of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine; only seven voted against. Russias illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine has prompted many of us to look back at our history, at the horrors in Europe and Asia that led humanity—that led the global community—to establish the Charter of the United Nations. For many living through those times, it must have seemed that power and lies would succeed. In 1942, George Orwell published his reflections on the competing propaganda that swirled around the Spanish civil war. He saw competing propaganda and lies—what we would now call disinformation. He wrote of his fear that the very concept of objective truth was fading out of the world, but we know now that he was wrong. The truth, at great cost, eventually won out. I say this to Russia and to its apologists and cronies: your crimes and your lies will not stand. In fact, you have only strengthened our collective resolve. You see, we have reflected anew on the type of world order we treasure—the lives lived to potential, the dreams and ambitions fulfilled and the common aspiration around this world that our children prosper in peace and live better lives than our own. Russia has reminded us again that these treasures, important to so many people around this world, are born of a system of rules and order respected by all. One year on, let us commit anew to these rules and laws and, in doing so, commit anew, one year on, to stand with the people of Ukraine.  Ira Lyubarskaya is a young woman, a young university student with dreams and hopes. But Ira is from Mariupol. Ira is one of so many human faces with human stories that have been told as part of the bloody war that has struck Ukraine. Ira has buried her friends parents, helped her disabled father to flee, seen her mother trapped in Russian territory and lived on stinking mattresses in the basement of her former building. In Iras words: We lived in Building No. 7; there is no building left … I went to the Mariupol State University; there is no university left. There is no city left. … … … Putin liberated us from our home, from our studies, our work, our future. We, in Australia, thousands of kilometres away, care about the war in Ukraine because there are important principles at stake. We condemn the barbaric, illegal and immoral actions of Vladimir Putin and the Russian government he leads. To do otherwise would be to imperil us all by tacitly condoning the actions of violent autocrats. But, amidst our important principles and our strong condemnation, we should remember Ira and the countless other stories of unnecessary loss and suffering. UNICEF analysis suggests that 80 per cent of Ukrainian children are now living in poverty. These children are not just facing the obvious physical risks of war from shelling, firing and combat. Such children are not just facing the mental health scars that will stay with them throughout their lives. Their lives and longterm health are imperilled in other ways. The destruction by Russia of more than 800 Ukrainian health facilities means children are missing out on vital vaccines that would otherwise shield them from future disease. Then there are the horrific instances of war crimes committed by Russia. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has identified mass graves, massacres and torture chambers. In one of its reports, the OSCE spoke of the mutilated bodies of murdered men, women and children discovered in a basement. Some had their ears cut off, while others had their teeth pulled out. Amid such horrors and crimes, it would be easy to be despondent. But, if there is one thing Ukraine has shown itself to be the antithesis of, it is despondency. Ukraine has come to be defined by defiance, stoicism, bravery, resolve and triumph. Putin expected a quick victory, but Vladimir Putin was as wrong in his military strategy as he is in his moral compass. This war was unprovoked, unjust and unacceptable. Thirtyone years ago, after the fall of the Iron Curtain, proud Ukrainians rose up and seized their national identity to once again recreate their nation. Using their rights under international law, Ukrainians embraced their sovereignty, celebrated their nationality and built their nation. Although imperfect, like all of us, Ukraine has much to be proud of and much to defend. Ukraine and Ukrainians can be especially proud of their defence of their nation. They and much of the world have been inspired by the acts of courage and bravery. Inspirations have come in many forms, most visibly in the leadership of President Zelenskyy. As President Zelenskyy said, Ukrainians made a choice on 24 February last year—not of a white flag but of a blue and yellow flag. He has spoken in defence not only of territory or people but of principles—the right to selfdetermination, to security and to live without being threatened. These principles form the basis of our call to arms, Australias call to arms, even from the other side of the world. No small or midsized nation should tolerate seeing another invaded by or made subservient to a bigger or more powerful regional neighbour. In helping to defend Ukraine, we defend the principles, the norms and the international laws that help to defend Australia. The previous coalition government proudly stepped forward with $225 million of defence military equipment, $65 million in humanitarian assistance, thermal coal to support energy supplies and humanitarian visas for Ukrainians forced to flee. We applied financial sanctions against hundreds of Russian individuals and entities as part of coordinated action with likeminded partners. The Labor government has built upon this foundation with more support and more sanctions, and our bipartisan support for these actions is emphatic. We will continue to encourage and welcome further actions and encourage further humanitarian assistance for people like Ira and others, as well as encouraging the reopening of Australias embassy in Kiev. If democracies have suffered from selfdoubt in recent times, the Ukrainian spirit reminds us to have confidence in ourselves, confidence in the enduring nature of our values, confidence to speak truthfully about threats to freedom and confidence to show resolve in confronting evil wherever it lurks. As we acknowledge this first anniversary of Russias invasion of Ukraine we say confidently: Slava Ukraini. Glory to Ukraine.  On 24 February this year the Ukrainian community throughout not just Australia but the world joined with supporters to commemorate one year since Russias illegal and immoral fullscale invasion of Ukraine. I was honoured to be invited to speak at the Hobart rally and vigil. We couldnt bring on this motion that day because parliament was not sitting; however, bringing it on today ties in well with this evenings launch of the AustraliaUkraine parliamentary friendship group, which I understand is now the largest friendship group in the parliament. As chair of the group, I would like to thank those members and senators who have joined and to encourage anyone who hasnt joined to join. I would also like to thank Senator Van for serving as deputy chair. Im looking forward to the launch tonight and to catching up again with the ambassador of Ukraine, His Excellency Vasyl Myroshnychenko, with whom I have developed a great working relationship. Id also like to acknowledge two members of the Ukrainian community in the gallery here today. There are other members already in the building, off having meetings with various ministers and other people. I thank you for being in the chamber and thank you for coming to the parliament. Please be assured that you have very, very good friends in this place. It gives me a great sense of pride that Australia is one of the largest nonNATO contributors to Ukraine. Weve provided $65 million in emergency humanitarian assistance and over half a billion dollars in military assistance, with our most recent support including sending ADF personnel to the United Kingdom to train Ukrainian soldiers and contributing $33 million in drone technology. Our significant assistance to Ukraine is complemented by actions to impose costs on Russia, including sanctions targeted against more than 1,000 organisations and individuals and import and export sanctions against a number of commodities, including Russian oil, refined petroleum products, coal and gas. Our assistance to Ukraine has been maintained through the transition from a coalition to a Labor government, and it has continued to have bipartisan support through both. In fact, I understand it has the unanimous support of the parliament—at least I havent heard any dissent. There is no better demonstration of parliaments support to Ukraine than when both houses gathered for a group photo with the ambassador, in which the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition stood shoulder to shoulder with the ambassador. That was a historic moment. The Australian parliament has never done that before. But parliament doesnt stand alone in its support for Ukraine. Our stance is a reflection of the overwhelming support of the Australian public. Australians understand that, even though we are almost on the other side of the world, Australia needs to be in this fight with Ukraine—not just for Ukraines sake but for our own national interests. Russias actions threaten the stability of the rules based order that governs international relations. Australians understand that Russias actions are a threat to every country and the rules based order that maintains global stability. I am certain the assistance given to Ukraine and costs imposed on Russia by Australia and our allies have been instrumental in ensuring that Russias invasion has been a monumental failure, but international solidarity with Ukraine is not the only thing holding Russia back from achieving its objectives. What is also standing in its way is the patriotism, resilience and fighting spirit of the Ukrainian people. I am in no doubt that Russia underestimated the Ukrainian people and that they expected to be in a much better position than they are now. While 24 February marks one year since the fullscale invasion of Ukraine, it is the culmination of over 30 years of Russias attacks on Ukraines sovereignty and territorial integrity. Since Ukraine gained its independence in 1991, Russia has interfered in the domestic politics of Ukraine, illegally annexed Crimea and backed separatist militias in the Donbas region—the very militias who were responsible for downing Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, murdering 298 people, including 38 Australians. A lot of people know that my interest in this conflict, like our nations, is motivated by an aspiration for global stability and security, but my interest is also very personal. My surname is Ukrainian. I have family ties with Ukraine by marriage, and my husband, Robert, who is of Ukrainian descent, still has a strong connection to his Ukrainian heritage. We are both involved in the Ukrainian community in Tasmania and have been for many, many years. So we see and hear how Ukrainians are suffering, and it affects us deeply. So, given that this is personal, I have the following message for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mr Putin, the blood that has been spilt—Ukrainian and Russian—in this illegal and unprovoked invasion is on your hands. You have failed to appreciate that Ukrainians are a proud people with their own language, their own culture and their own identity, who have embraced democracy and want to determine their own future. For this reason, your invasion will fail. That is inevitable. The important question for you is how much more blood has to be spilt before that happens. I commend the motion.  I would like to thank Senator Bilyk for being chair with me on the Parliamentary Friends of Ukraine since I came into this place in 2019. We have worked very well together on this issue, and I thank her for her hard efforts. While we are celebrating the anniversary of the fullscale invasion of Ukraine, 24 February 2022, it cant be lost on any of us that this war has been running since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea. We have learnt lessons from that, as have the Ukrainian army. We are now seeing a complete rout of the Russian troops. They have effectively lost this war. They have certainly lost the war that they set out to fight, and that is to decapitate the Zelenskyy administration in Kyiv and then go over and take over the country. That is never going to happen. Why isnt it going to happen? Because likeminded nations have stood side by side with Ukraine and given them the arms, material and financial aid that they deserve. They deserve it richly, because, as weve seen, theyve fought these fights. Weve seen these Russian tactics before, whether in Aleppo in Syria or in Grozny in Chechnya. Weve since seen how they fight a war of attrition, in Mariupol and now in Bakhmut. These arent new tactics for the Russian army, but they are tactics that are bound to fail as long as the West keeps on arming Ukraine and as long as the West keeps on giving Ukraine the weapons they need to fight the war. Ive been saying for close to a year that the West needs to supply the main battle tanks and fighter jets. Thankfully, weve seen those main battle tanks promised and some delivered. What we need to do now is convince likeminded countries to send in those fighter jets, which are so desperately needed for air defence and ground strikes, to hit those dugin trenches where the Russians are hiding away through this winter. As most of you will know, particularly our foreign minister, I visited Ukraine in August last year. It wasnt unauthorised; I was invited by the Ukrainian government. It was an incredibly eyeopening trip. I went for two reasons. The first was to go there—I did a lot of interviews with media there—to tell Ukrainians that we havent forgotten about them and that even a country as far away as Australia remembers what theyre going through and is there to support them. The second was to be able to come home and say to Australians, We need to stand with Ukraine. Ive seen the damage that this Russian army has done in Ukraine. Its not pretty. I wouldnt suggest that anyone go there just for sightseeing purposes. I went there and I saw the Bushmasters that we donated, which are being used in this battle incredibly well. I met with the troops that are using them. Sadly, now some of those troops are no longer with us. Theyve been lost in this war. It reminds me every day that we in Australia, and all our likeminded countries, need to do more. We need to do far more. Yes, we have promised $475 million in military aid. Sadly, not all of that has made its way into the country yet, and I encourage this government to speed up those deliveries. On my first morning in Kyiv, I went for my morning run and I ran past our embassy. We share a building with the Canadian embassy. You can see the Canadian flag flying there. The Australian flag is not there, because our ambassador is not there. The most important thing I learnt while I was there was the resilience of the Ukrainian people. Every person I met was waiting to be called up. Whether they were a taxi driver or a barista making a coffee—anyone you met in the street—everyone was saying: Im up for this fight, and Im dying to go. Every person I spoke to—and, I think, every person in that country—will fight to defeat Russia. We need to be doing our bit to support them, and we must.  War is a most terrible thing. Those socalled leaders who would pursue wars of aggression, to dominate, to subjugate and to profit from their neighbours for political purposes are committing, in that act, one of the highest legal and moral crimes possible in the human community. In their illegal and unjustified invasion of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin and his regime have joined a dark pantheon of despots, dictators and sometimes democratically elected officials who have committed such vile crimes. In speaking to this motion today, I once again extend the solidarity of the Australian Greens movement to the people of Ukraine in their struggle to retain and reassert their sovereignty and to face down this vicious dictator and his brutal regime. In doing so, I also reiterate the calls of the Australian Greens for all nations that are party to the United Nations Charter to work collectively in accordance with the Uniting for Peace resolution, No. 377 A, to deliver coordinated international support to the people of Ukraine. It is absolutely incumbent upon Australia to work as part of the international community to ensure that the words of solidarity that are so often and so easily spoken in political chambers throughout the world are translated into material action. One of the ways in which those words must be translated into that material action is to now begin organising an international program of debt relief for Ukraine to support them in the urgent work that will need to be done for the rebuilding of their communities. Right now, as we sit here, the Ukrainian army is engaged in a great battle with Russian forces over the city of Bakhmut. Much has been said in relation to the military strategic value of this engagement and this location. But we must not forget that this is a town which before the war hosted 70,000 people. Seventy thousand people called Bakhmut home, and it is now little more than rubble. Should the Ukrainian army and their allies achieve their strategic objectives, should tomorrow the Russian forces be thrown back over the border, should Crimea be liberated, the very next day the residents of Bakhmut will have no more home to return to than they do right now. There is a profound moment of danger for the people of Ukraine in that moment if, in the aftermath of victory on the field, the international community declares mission accomplished and moves on. We cannot let that happen. We must ensure that the Ukrainian government are provided with that plan of debt relief so that they can invest in the rebuilding of their communities and the reknitting together of those communities, to be able to once again have the services and supports that people need to ensure that a state is able to function in a time of peace, and to do more than simply deliver ammunition, materiel and troops to a battlefront. If we fail in that moment—if we turn away and say, Youve got your battle tanks, but its a very hard conversation for us to have with the IMF or the ECB or global moneylenders in relation to your national debt—then in that moment we will condemn Ukraine to struggle to reestablish itself as a sovereign nation and a functioning, peaceful nation. We will continue this work. We will continue to advocate alongside the Ukrainian community for these actions. In closing, I say simply this: Slava Ukraini. Glory to Ukraine.  On behalf of the National Party, I rise to support the motion and honour the bravery and strength of the people of Ukraine, who continue to courageously fight a war not of their making—a war which President Putin expected to last just three days but which has now passed the oneyear mark in duration. This illegal, unprovoked and unjust conflict has resulted in the deaths of thousands of Ukrainians at the hands of Russian forces, according to the UNHCR, with more than 7,000 civilians killed and 11,000 injured, including 177 girls and 221 young boys. The UNHCR reported in September last year that 12.3 million people had fled the Ukraine, while seven million had been displaced internally. Thats 19 million Ukrainians that have left their homes. Many thousands more have been forcibly deported to Russia. Historic cities that have taken hundreds of years to build now lie in ruins. Ukraine estimates that Russia has caused US$1 trillion worth of damage since the start of the fullscale invasion last February, and that it is not even allowing for the costs in Crimea and parts of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were invaded in 2014. The Ukraine government has estimated that 150,000 residential buildings, 1,500 schools and 20,000 kilometres of roads have been destroyed. And Russia, in its indiscriminate attacks, has targeted hospitals, schools and energy supplies. Russias blockade of the Black Sea ports is equal to economic blackmail, with some of the worlds poorest people now paying higher prices for food, energy and the very means to survive. In the areas liberated from Russian forces, Ukrainians have uncovered mass graves as well as evidence of rape and torture on an unimaginable scale. It is President Putin who is responsible for this. He could stop it at once by withdrawing his forces from Ukrainian land, but he continues with his delusions of imperial grandeur and expansion. He blundered into a war that he cannot and will not win. Ukrainians were always going to resist a hostile attack aimed at wiping out their country. Russia was warned that if it instigated the conflict Ukrainians would defend their homeland ferociously, and they have. Today, Ukrainians are more unified, proud and determined than ever, and the overreach of Russia has united the world in the common purpose of peace and to defend the principles of the UN Charter. All Australians remain united and resolute in our support for Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity. Today, to be in the chamber and to hear the Labor government, the Liberal and National parties in coalition, the Greens and the Independent senators stand as one, united in our support for Ukraine, is a demonstration of what is occurring. This is a microcosm of whats occurred, particularly in Western democracies around the world. We, as a nation, are doing our part in helping Ukraine fight this illegal war and abate the global economic impacts Russia has caused. It is the former coalition government that stood with Ukraine 12 months ago, offering substantial humanitarian, economic and social support, and that has been continued by todays Labor government, and we thank them for that. We played a major role in food supply and fuel for Europe and the wider economic community. Weve donated 70,000 tons of thermal coal to support Ukraines energy security. Weve banned the import of Russian oil, petroleum, coal and gas, banned the export of alumina, bauxite and luxury goods to Russia, and introduced an additional tariff of 35 per cent on imports from Russia and Belarus. We will continue to provide bipartisan support to the Australian government to ensure we provide more military and humanitarian assistance. Our former coalition government committed $285 million of defence military assistance, including 40 Bushmasters from my home state in Victoria, produced in Bendigo, and $65 million of humanitarian assistance in Ukraines fight for freedom. Im proud to say that Bendigo Bushmasters have played a central role in Australias military assistance. This is a David and Goliath battle. As a middle power in the global order, Australia stood strong at the start, and I think it was particularly due to our efforts at the beginning of this war—I dont think it was an assured assumption that everyone was going to come to the table 12 months ago— that we stand as united as the Western democracies in particular have been against the aggression of this illegal war. So, practically and philosophically, this nation stands with Ukraine. We stand for peace, but its not peace at any price. The sovereignty of this nation matters, and we wont stop supporting them until they can be sovereign again and Vladimir Putin and the Russian forces are behind their own borders.  I thank the Senate for this opportunity and I thank my fellow senators for their contributions. Weve watched on for over a year now at the horrors of the war in Ukraine, a country being invaded, a people fighting bravely and against all odds for their families and for their country. The world has rightly grappled with what to do with such an immoral, illegal and unjust invasion. I believe we can learn much from the words of a moral giant, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German Lutheran pastor who grappled with this question in the face of Hitler and what to do in that situation. He left some wisdom for us: Silence in the face of evil is itself evil: God will not hold us guiltless. Not to speak is to speak. Not to act is to act. The global community has made clear the condemnation of Putins actions. We must call for an end to this war and we must call for peace. We must stand alongside the Ukrainian people. I am really proud to represent so many people here in the ACT who have been protesting, fundraising and looking after Ukrainian refugees. Many of them have put their lives on hold to focus on this. Id really like to take this opportunity to read out some of the words of a few of them. The first one is Canberran Marusya Jacyshyn. She said: My parents were forced to leave their beloved homeland, Ukraine, due to the twin horrors of Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. They were never to return to their families. Our family arrived in Australia in July 1949. Australia provided a safe haven and hope to rebuild their shattered lies. My late parents worked tirelessly for Ukraines freedom, sovereignty and independence. This was passed on to their children and grandchildren. The Ukrainian community in the Canberra region, with their loyal friends and supporters from many countries of origin, have protested for over 12 months, every Saturday, outside the Russian embassy—not just in support of Ukraines fight for selfdetermination, freedom and democracy but for that of the free world. I urge the Australian parliament to continue to provide bipartisan support for Ukraine with humanitarian aid, military aid and economic aid. This fullscale war waged on Ukraine by the Russian Federation impacts on all of us. Thank you, Australia. Slava Ukraini. The next one is from Andrew Liszczynsky. He said: Were 12 months into this war, Russias war of aggression in Ukraine, and the Ukrainian community here is still outraged about the invasion. Ukraine is a sovereign nation and is grimly defending that sovereignty. The Ukrainian community here and all over Australia, and the rest of the world, continue to protest this Russian aggression and will continue to do so whilst Russian forces are in Ukraine. Lets make no mistake, Putin is trying to destroy everything Ukrainian—identity, language, culture, religion and cultural icons. But he will not win, because Ukraine, led by President Zelenskyy, is strong in its resolve. Ukraine is determined to defend all things Ukrainian, and the world is showing massive support because this is simply wrong. Putin will lose and Ukraine will prevail. Lastly, I have a contribution from Dimitri Kun. He said: Thank you, Australia, for supporting Ukraine. We must continue the support. Russias disregard for international norms and laws must be stopped by Ukrainians now or else we may find that other dictators, inspired by Putin, start territorial conflicts and wars. That is not a good prospect. We stand with Ukraine and we call for an end to this war. Slava Ukraini. Clearly, this is an issue that we need to continue to speak up about. I thank the major parties for their support of Ukraine, at this time, and the many thousands of Australian people who, in their own way, have protested or shown their support to people in Ukraine.  On 24 February 2022, after months of Western intelligence agency warnings and Russian denials, the armed forces of Russia invaded the land of Ukraine. We saw on TV live pictures of helicopter landings in Hostomel Airport, armoured columns advancing on suburbs and cities and the Ukrainian population filling bottles to make Molotov cocktails, sending children away from their homes and arming themselves in response. In what was meant to be a threeday easy victory, as we heard, we are now on day 377, and Russia retains control of a very small portion of Ukrainian sovereign territory. We have seen war crimes. We have seen targeting of civilians. We have seen and been reminded of the horrors of war over and over again, in Bucha, in Mariupol and now in Bakhmut. Even overnight there was a video of a Ukrainian prisoner of war being executed on camera. His last words were, Glory to Ukraine. But we have also seen the best of humanity, people coming together in unity of purpose, helping each other, protecting their country, their way of life, working to survive. Across the globe there has been humanitarian military aid in response to the needs of Ukrainians and their government. Just hours after the invasion, President Zelenskyy was quoted as saying: The fight is here. I need ammunition, not a ride. The world has heard that, and it has answered. The people of Ukraine, inspired by its armed forces and political leadership, turned the tables and drove the invaders completely out of western Ukraine, with the famous tractor corps of Ukraine claiming hundreds of pieces of military equipment that could be repaired and then reused against the invaders. The world is not fuelling Ukraines ability to fight. Ukraines ability to fight is fuelling the worlds appetite to stand up for what is right and what is wrong. I searched for better words than those of the German foreign minister, but I couldnt find them. She said: If Russia stops fighting, the war stops. If Ukraine stops fighting, there is no more Ukraine. It is that simple. But this is not going to be a defeat of Russia. It is a defeat of decency, it is a defeat of diplomacy and it is a defeat of humanity. We must do better. Russia has a right to its own security and to feel safe within its own borders. It does not, however, have any right to act with such hostility across and within the borders of another sovereign country. That is not the way to achieve this. To Russia I say: tell the world what security you need to pull all of your forces and all of your arms back to the borders of 91. What can the world do to stop sending the sons of the Rodina to their deaths? What can the world do to halt your illegal, immoral and corrupt slaughter of the innocent and the destruction of such beautiful, historical and productive lands? Its not just the future of Ukraine you hold in your hands; it is the future potential of Russia. Noone wants to see a generation of young men taken away from their families, their homes and their jobs. These men that Russia is sending to their slaughter deserve so much better than that. The Stalinist phrase quantity has a quality all of its own should not be measured in body bags. This war must end because noone will win it. The war must end with guaranteed safety of Ukraine and Russia within their own borders, and in Australia weve done our bit. We have sent our aid, we have sent our arms, we are sending our training and we have sent our love and support to Ukraine. Respected independent open source intelligence like Oryx has observed the loss of six of our Bushmasters and three of our M113 APCs. It is likely that more has been lost, but we have seen these put to action and the crime is that people have died while they were in them. We must continue to seek opportunities to assist the Ukrainians, we must continue to seek opportunities to support peace and when all of this madness ends we must seek opportunities to support reconstruction and reconciliation, for the absence of armed conflict does not in itself represent peace. But the war rages on. People are dying today, they will die tomorrow and the risk is we will all become so used to it that we become desensitised to it, we stop caring and we stop helping. I say to Ukraine: I will not stop caring, Australia will not stop helping. We must do whatever it takes to deliver peace to your country and your people, and please, until that day, stay safe, fight hard, and we salute you.  Before making my remarks, I want to pay tribute to my good friend Senator Bilyk and to Senator Van. The way they have come together in order to provide leadership to the friends of Ukraine is just an outstanding example of what this place does at its best. Thank you very much. On 25 February 2023, I attended a rally in King George Square in my home state of Brisbane. In that place, the Ukrainian spirit was there for all to see and feel. It was there in King George Square: the spirit of freedom, democracy, sovereignty—a spirit that has survived the horrors of the Stalinist Soviet Union, which survived World War II and which now, against all odds, is surviving. Also in that square, with our Ukrainian brothers and sisters, were brothers and sisters from Iran, representing the Iranian community. There were representatives from our wonderful Vietnamese community, our African community and our Indian community. The very, very best of Australia was in that square in Brisbane on Saturday 25 February 2023. There were also leaders from all major parties. Graham Perrett MP, my local member, was there. I was there, representing the coalition. Cameron Dick was there, representing the state Labor government. David Crisafulli MP, the state opposition leader, was there. The Deputy Mayor of Brisbane was there. There was a unity of purpose in that square on that day. It was the very, very best of Australia. I say to the Ukrainian people: please know that we are standing with you, shoulder to shoulder, on this journey. In doing so, we are standing shoulder to shoulder with everyone in the world who believes in freedom, in democracy and in a rules based international order. We are there for the long term for this journey, until it comes to an end and peace and sovereignty once more reign in Ukraine.

"0","0","0","1","1","MemberContinuation","112096","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","The PRESIDENT: I understand that informal arrangements have been made to allocate specific times to each of the speakers in todays debate. With the concurrence of the Senate, I ask the clerks to set the clock accordingly.   I move: That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency: That the Safeguard Mechanism reform must be effective in bringing Australia into line with holding global warming to 1.5°C. The design must be based on an emissions reduction hierarchy that delivers genuine emissions reductions while also ensuring a future for essential industries. Australians elected the 47th Parliament with a mandate for real and ambitious climate action. The government may have their mandate of 43 per cent, but there are many MPs and senators with a mandate for action more in line with the science. Scientists have spent decades telling us that we need to act now to hold global warming to 1.5 degrees if we are to avoid the worst impacts of climate change—effects that we are already seeing and that communities across the country are experiencing. The costs are mounting. Were seeing natural disaster after natural disaster, but were not seeing the kind of action from politicians that we need. The safeguard mechanism presents an opportunity for us to show the children who come through here and watch Senate proceedings, children across the country and children who have taken the government to court to say, You have a duty of care to look after us. And weve seen the Australian government challenge that, and say, We dont have a duty of care to young people and to future generations. We have an opportunity, with the safeguard mechanism, to begin to bring our climate action in line with the science. The safeguard mechanism has to work. It has to actually reduce emissions, and this means ensuring that emissions reductions are real and not just on paper. Under the proposed reform, Australia will join Kazakhstan as one of only two countries in the world that allow unfettered access to offsets, and its obviously no good. There is a huge amount of evidence and agreement on the need for an emissions reduction hierarchy. Companies must first avoid and then reduce their own emissions. Offsets can only be used as a last resort. To quote the former Chief Scientist Professor Ian Chubb: Offsets cant be a device which big emitters use not to change their behaviour, not to do something about reducing emissions. I have no doubt that coalition senators will stand up and speak about how the safeguard mechanism will put industries at risk and push up prices. What theyre missing is the opportunity for industry in a lowcarbon economy. What they are missing is the moral obligation to act on the biggest challenge humans have ever faced. Were blessed with an incredible wealth of resources in this country. We hear a lot about resources, and resources will be a big part of our future, but not fossil fuel resources. We need to focus on the resources of the future and stop allowing politicians to conflate the two and present people who want a livable future and a transition away from fossil fuels as people who are against resources. Our major trading partners are decarbonising and starting to give preferential treatment to lowcarbon imports. That is a massive opportunity for Australia, with our incredible mineral wealth. From the government, we will likely hear that finally something is being done and put in place for real climate policy. But we dont have time for incremental changes. We cant just say were heading in the right direction. The fires and floods of the last few years should be a wakeup call for all of us. We owe it to those communities. We owe it to Australians. We owe it to Australians who havent been born yet to deal with this now, and we have an opportunity with this legislation. We will likely hear that a hierarchy of mitigation is assumed in the legislation, but there is nothing explicit to ensure that we are avoiding emissions, reducing emissions and then, as a last resort, using the land sector to offset. So I commend this to the Senate. This is a really important policy, but we have to get it right and we have to ensure that it reduces emissions in this country.","Climate Change","MATTERS OF URGENCY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[6]","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","1","MemberContinuation","112096","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I thank Senator Pocock for the opportunity to speak on his urgency motion relating to the safeguard mechanism reform, which of course is a live issue in this parliament and something that theres been much deliberation upon. I note that, in the matter of urgency that Senator Pocock put before the chamber, he references global warming and keeping it to 1.5 degrees and goes on to talk about the design needing to be based on an emissions reduction hierarchy—which weve just heard him speak about—that delivers genuine emissions reductions while also ensuring a future for essential industries. I think its important to focus on a couple of points in that as I provide a response from the coalition on this issue.  The issue of climate change is, as this motion points out, a global one. Its one where there is a global responsibility. So it is right for us to do what we can here in this country. I think it is imperative that a country that can should show responsibility and do what it can to minimise its impact on the environment, including when it comes to carbon emissions. But the problem with the matter were dealing with, when it comes to the safeguard mechanism that is the subject of consideration here, is that there is a difference of opinion in this place about exactly how best, under what is being proposed, we can achieve what we seek to achieve: minimising human impact on the environment and, in this case, minimising carbon emissions, without having an undue and damaging impact on the economy. Its something Ive talked about a couple of times here. For what its worth, the coalitions view is that the proposal that is referenced in broad terms in the motion is one whose environmental impact we havent seen properly assessed. We actually dont know what impact it will have on emissions reduction. There are some projections. Weve just dealt with a motion on some of the modelling that the government refuses to reveal to us. We dont know what the impact will be—what reliance on carbon credits. Similarly, we dont know what impact such a proposition will have on the economy. It is something weve flagged as needing more serious consideration and more thought put into it. The second part of Senator Pococks matter of urgency, particularly at the tail end—delivering genuine emissions reductions while also ensuring a future for essential industries—is, I think, absolutely important. Part of the concern the coalition has about what is currently before us is the idea that we will see industries that cannot meet the emission reductions mandated under this legislation and under matching regulation and that cannot access carbon credits, either through the safeguard mechanism credits or through ACCUs, faced with this increased cost of doing business here. Despite promises that there will be a scheme whereby these trade exposed industries like cement manufacturing and aluminium production, will be protected through a formula, were not convinced that that is the case. The proposal doesnt ensure a future for essential industries, and that is as important as making sure we get right what we need to when it comes to reducing emissions. If we dont get both of those things right, then were failing on both counts, and noone is better off. Indeed, when you dont protect these trade exposed industries and try to bring them on the journey with you—try to work with them to invest in innovation and technology and to work with academic and educational institutions to provide better technology to minimise the impact on the environment—then those businesses, because of this penalty of $275 per tonne of carbon above the baseline, will either reduce production here, in the best case, or simply shut up shop and go offshore. Then those emissions, which we could otherwise be working with them to minimise, will be generated offshore, somewhere else. To go back to that original point: its a global responsibility; its a global problem. We cant simply offshore our problems and make someone else try to deal with them, because we will still have the issues Senator Pocock talked about before. Thats why it is right to expect the information needed to understand the governments proposal and to ensure that were getting it right in what were putting in place to reduce emissions but also to minimise the impact on the environment for our future generations.","Climate Change","MATTERS OF URGENCY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator DUNIAM (Tasmania—Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) ","(16:43):"
"0","0","0","1","1","MemberContinuation","112096","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," Thank you, Senator Pocock, for bringing forward this afternoons urgency debate. Action on safeguards is urgent. That is something we can both agree on. It is exactly why the government has legislation before the parliament right now that alters the safeguard mechanism so that facilities covered by the mechanism must reduce their direct emissions in the future. We can also agree, I think, that reforms to the safeguard mechanism must ensure that Australias biggest emitters do their fair share when it comes to emissions reduction. On that basis, were happy to support the motion and have this conversation here in the Senate. But we think it is important to be clear about the safeguard mechanism reforms that we propose and what we are doing, because we dont agree with the whole of the senators contention in the motion.  Our government is unapologetically focused on transforming Australias domestic economy to a lowcarbon economy. It is the most important thing we can do to support the ambitious international action that is necessary to contain global warming to 1½ degrees. Its why one of our first acts in government was to legislate an ambitious but achievable emissions reduction target of 43 per cent by 2030—a floor, not a ceiling—and our safeguard reforms have been carefully designed to support that and to support Australias biggest emitters to remain competitive in a decarbonising global economy whilst reducing their emissions. A fitforpurpose safeguard mechanism does provide the policy certainty for businesses to invest in decarbonisation and seize the opportunities from global energy transformation. The mechanism we propose will progressively lower baselines, consistent with our legislated target. We estimate it will deliver 205 million tonnes of abatement by 2030. With respect to Senator Pocock, this is not trivial and this is not, as characterised, incremental. These reforms are significant, and they are designed so that all facilities, whether they are existing or new, reduce their emissions. The proposal creates strong incentives for facilities to reduce those emissions on site and for the industrial sector to decarbonise. Of course, facilities who may reduce emissions below their baseline will have the opportunity to create and sell safeguard mechanism credits. It is part of arrangements for flexibility that secure both our economic capacity and our emissions reduction. We want to ensure not only that these facilities meet their obligations but also that they can grow. We know that many safeguard facilities are in hardtoabate sectors, like cement and steel, where technologies have not yet been demonstrated or arent yet commercially available. The access to flexible options is incredibly important for these sectors. ACCUs are part of this. The land sector is part of this. An ACCU represents a tonne of emissions avoided or sequestered. We are strengthening confidence in that scheme to ensure the continued integrity of that abatement. Weve done that through the Chubb recommendations, which found that the scheme is sound. Of course, Professor Chubb made recommendations for reform, and were committed to implementing those. But lets be real about this. These ACCUs contribute to our legislated targets, and they are not a free pass. Facilities that choose to use ACCUs will have to buy them on the open market, and many businesses will choose to permanently reduce emissions in their own facilities on site. Of course, as indicated just now and in recent weeks, those opposite have made themselves irrelevant to this process by opposing a policy that they themselves proposed to implement when they were last in government. The former government had grand plans for safeguard crediting. In fact, it was their policy right up to election day, included in their election document Our Plan for Resources. Yet here we are, with coalition senators repeating the same old lines. After a decade of delay, denial and dysfunction, all that there is on offer is halfbaked scare campaigns that are made up from the same old talking points. But, for the first time in a decade, we have a parliament comprising members and senators who are willing to deliver what the Australian people have been crying out for for a decade: action on climate. They called for action loudly at the election, and now they have a government that is willing to deliver. But we cannot do this on our own. We require a majority in this place, and, when the legislation comes before senators, it will be a choice of real significance. We can seize or squander the only chance before us to get down emissions from our largest industrial emitters. I thank senators for their constructive engagement with Minister Bowen and with the government, and I look forward to the debate proper when it commences in this place.","Climate Change","MATTERS OF URGENCY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator McALLISTER (New South Wales—Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy) ","(16:48):"
"0","0","0","1","1","MemberContinuation","112096","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," To have any chance of getting the climate crisis under control and meeting even this governments weak emissions target, there can be no new coal and gas projects—not one. The inquiry into Labors safeguard mechanism heard from expert scientists and economists. The conclusion was clear: under the safeguard mechanism as it is currently proposed, actual pollution from coal and gas goes up. Were not talking about incremental progress that the Greens just dont think goes far enough; we are talking about a flawed scheme that will actually make the climate crisis worse. Surely the measure of a good climate policy is whether it makes pollution go down. On that measure alone, the safeguard mechanism fails to deliver.  Throughout the inquiry, the government was asked repeatedly to show evidence that the safeguard mechanism would bring down pollution from coal and gas. They made no such commitment. The department offered no evidence. Their own projections confirm that emissions from gas will increase. The emissions from the first five years of the Scarborough gas project alone will wipe out the entire claimed benefit of the safeguard mechanism. It is difficult to have any confidence that the scheme will do anything to curb businessasusual behaviour from coal and gas companies. Its no wonder that it has the support of Woodside, of Shell, of Rio Tinto and of Origin. The safeguard mechanism targets only scope 1 emissions, and only 4.9 per cent of coal and gas entities covered by the scheme will face a price signal. Any cost impacts imposed on this fraction of a fraction of overall emissions can be completely offset, with facilities able to buy their way out of the scheme at a very low price for a very long time. Alreadycontracted ACCUs—Australian carbon credit units—account for nearly 70 per cent of the total abatement goal. So not only can coal and gas pollution continue to rise as long as enough offsets are bought but also more than twothirds of the modest ambitions of this scheme will have been achieved without a single dollar of new investment. Lax exit arrangement for government contracts will see 84 million land based offsets from the Mr Angus Taylor era flooding the private market, to be scooped up by coal and gas companies that are planning new projects. This could push out exposed industries that actually need assistance to abate their emissions. The Greens want genuine Australian industry and manufacturing to thrive. Aluminium, steel, bricks, fertilisers, glass and cement all have a future in the clean economy, but coal and gas dont. We should be supporting genuine Australian industry to transition, not asking them to make room in a finite carbon budget for more coal and gas. We must limit the use of offsets and ensure that offsets have integrity. The scheme allows entities to keep going on, as long as they buy enough dodgy offsets. Its a clever accounting trick, but it wont fool the planet. The Greens have made an offer to support the safeguard bill if the government commits to no new coal and gas. But weve also said that were open to other ways of achieving that end, including through a climate trigger. This nation has squandered the last critical decade for climate action under a climatedenying government. We need this government to design a scheme that makes pollution from coal and gas go down, not up.","Climate Change","MATTERS OF URGENCY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator WATERS (Queensland—Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate) ","(16:53):"
"0","0","0","1","1","MemberContinuation","112096","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," The government will be supporting this urgency motion today. However, we do not support all of the substance of Senator Pococks motion. Let me be clear. The Albanese government does agree that action on safeguards is urgent. We agree with Senator Pocock on that point. That urgency is exactly why the government has legislation before the parliament right now that will alter the safeguard mechanism to ensure that Australias biggest emitters do their fair share when it comes to emissions reduction.  I was with the energy minister, Chris Bowen, in Gladstone at the start of the year when he announced this policy and set out the details of the consultation process that we will go through. We have proposed a fitforpurpose safeguard mechanism that will provide policy certainty for businesses and the regional communities they support and will deliver genuine emission reductions. The safeguard legislation will be a test for senators in this place. For the first time in a decade we have a parliament of senators and members who are willing to deliver what the Australian people have been crying out for: real action on climate. At the last election, Australians voted for an end to the division, the climate wars that have plagued government policy for a decade. Now they have an Albanese government that is ready to deliver and wants to deliver. Were getting on with the job and taking action on climate, just as Australians expect us to do. But we cannot do that on our own. We require majority support in this Senate. So I ask Senator Pocock and other senators: what will you do when the safeguard legislation comes before the Senate? There is going to be a clear choice that will need to be made. Senator Pocock can join with the government and take decisive action to get emissions down, to take 205 million tonnes of emissions out of the system to 2030—the equivalent of taking twothirds of Australian cars off the road—or it can choose to join the obstructors. And lets be clear. They have been obstructing action on climate change in this chamber for decades, both in government and in opposition. That is their record. He can sit alongside the climate wreckers and climate deniers on the opposition benches and block action on climate. That is the choice senators will be facing. We know what happened when the Greens faced that same choice in 2009 and 2010. Instead of voting for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, they sat with the Liberals and Nationals of Tony Abbott and blocked climate action. The reality is that their choice derailed climate action for a decade. I say to Senator Pocock and other senators thinking of standing in the way of safeguards: do not let history repeat. There are goodfaith discussions happening between the government, the Greens and other senators, including Senator Pocock. I thank these senators for their engagement, which stands in stark contrast to those opposite, who, under the Leader of the Opposition, are determined to oppose everything and take no responsibility for cleaning up the mess that they created. The Albanese government will continue to work constructively with those who are willing to be constructive and important partners on this task as we look to reduce emissions. But this is an opportunity too important and too urgent to miss. Thats why we agree that this is a matter of urgency today, and we will be acting on this issue as a matter of urgency in coming weeks. But if Senator Pocock really believes this is a matter of urgency and wants to keep faith with the people of the Australian Capital Territory, who have been national leaders when it comes to climate action, he will back our legislation when it comes to the Senate later this month. As I mentioned, I was with Minister Bowen in Gladstone when he announced our proposals around the safeguard mechanism. The important point about that is that we want to work with industry to ensure that they can lower their emissions, because a lot of these industries are very important not only to our national supply chains but to the task that we face in rebuilding manufacturing in this country. Unlike the Greens, who operate in a silo on these issues, we know how important it is to work constructively with industry, who want to bring down their emissions, and we want to provide the government leadership to enable that to happen. Thats what we want to do through the safeguard mechanisms. Thats what Minister Bowen announced when we were in Gladstone in January. Thats what the government intends to deliver on over the coming weeks in this chamber. I call on all senators to engage in constructive discussion to ensure that we can pass this safeguard mechanism, because it is of vital importance for Australias future. It also of vital importance for Australias industries that they can continue to operate and deliver the employment that so many regional families rely on. Thats what we want to deliver.","Climate Change","MATTERS OF URGENCY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator CHISHOLM (Queensland—Assistant Minister for Education, Assistant Minister for Regional Development and Deputy Manager of Government Business in the Senate) ","(16:57):"

They have indeed been identified as an ecosystem of particular risk due to the increasingly drying climate, which is a reality of climate change. It is places like this that I want to see protected. It is places like this and the contribution that they make to our planet and our community that call on us, among so many other things, to pass climate laws which take on corporations and actually tackle the climate crisis.  Corporations such as Alcoa have gotten away with far too much for far too long. Not only have they been clearing our forests; just last month it was revealed that they have built a pipeline carrying toxic waste across Western Australia, right over the top of a key water supply dam. Toxic waste is flying over the top of a drinking water reserve! This toxic waste contains forever chemicals, known to cause serious adverse health issues, including cancer and impacts on reproductive health. This wasnt an unforeseen accident. This wasnt an unfortunate whoopsie. Alcoa made an application to build this pipeline. The application was under assessment, and Alcoa went ahead and built the thing anyway. Youd rightfully assume that such wilful disregard for human health and the law would result in harsh penalties. Significant fines and criminal charges strike me as appropriate. So what happened? Alcoa was forced to purge the pipeline and—nothing. Thats it. Thats all they were required to do. This is, again, not something that went unforeseen. Alcoa knew that this was exactly how it would play out, just as Rio Tinto knew when they misplaced a radioactive capsule somewhere in the Pilbara, and the worst they faced was a $1,000 fine. In WA, mining companies know that it is better for business to ask forgiveness than permission.

Its been only 10 months since the election, and I have a list of 10 broken promises from this government, one for each month in government. Theyre not little promises, either; theyre not small ones, but they were all sweet nothings that the Labor Party whispered to the Australian people over a year ago, during the election campaign, to reassure them that it would deliver for them. Instead, the Australian people have been completely dudded and these promises have been completely broken.  At the top of the list is the oftrepeated promise to cut peoples power bills by $275 a year. In fact, the now Prime Minister made that promise 97 times before the election. Ninetyseven times Anthony Albanese said to the Australian people that he would cut power bills by $275. Guess how many times hes repeated that promise since the election: zero, nada, zilch. He doesnt mention it anymore. It was a sweet nothing said before the Australian people walked down the aisle with the Australian Labor Party. Once the vows were said and the ring was on the finger, he completely forgot about it, as if hed never said it before. Anyone whos opened up a power bill in recent months knows that they certainly havent gone down by $275. My power bill hasnt. Its skyrocketed up, in the opposite direction, and now the Labor Party wont even give an inch of support to the fact that they made this promise. The Labor Party also said there will be no changes to superannuation. The Prime Minister said that on radio many times. He said he had no plans. He said on 31 January last year, We have not planned for changes on superannuation. In the last two weeks weve seen a doubling of superannuation tax rates for—we now know, thanks only to the Senate yesterday—10 per cent of Australians. The now Prime Minister also said that he would increase real wages for the Australian people. In fact, a couple of weeks ago it was confirmed that weve had the biggest reduction in real wages in recorded history—another broken promise from this Prime Minister. We had a promise that there would be no increase in the tax burden. As I said, that has already been breached by the superannuation promise. Weve also had the Treasurer out there in the last couple of weeks saying that he might tax the family home, too. He hasnt ruled that out of contention.","Albanese Government","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator CANAVAN (Queensland) ","(17:17):"

Who could trust what you say here today, when youre definitely not keeping up with what you said last year?  The Australian Labor Party also promised that peoples franking credits wouldnt be touched. Remember that? They wouldnt be touched. We learnt this week that theyre back on the agenda to be taxed. When the Australian people elected the Labor Party last year, they thought they were getting Anthony Albanese as Prime Minister. Theyre actually getting Bill Shorten. All of these policies are what Bill Shorten took to the 2019 election. The Labor Party tried to drop and hide for the 2022 election, but Bill Shorten is back. He is back with his agenda of taxing superannuation and taxing franking credits, and, we expect, probably taxing the family home and investment properties in the future as well, like the Labor Party wanted to do in 2019, which was rejected. The Labor Party also said there would be no return to industrywide bargaining. That was removed late last year—another promise broken just before Christmas. They promised wage rises for agedcare workers. Like the rest of us, theyre seeing their real wages go down. Mr Albanese promised that he would deliver cheaper mortgages for the Australian people. He promised cheaper mortgages, and then today, just in the last couple of hours, we saw the tenth increase in interest rates—nine on this governments watch. Weve seen nine interest rate increases in the space of 10 months from this government, after promises of cheaper mortgages. Finally, he promised that Australian families would be better off. Clearly, with rising interest rates, rising power prices and increasing taxes, Australian families are not better off under this government. Noone could make that claim. My opponents here will get up and say: There were all these problems. Weve had the Ukraine war and all these things. Guess when Ukraine was invaded: February last year, three months before the election. It happened then. Guess when inflation started peaking: about 18 months ago. He should have known that then. The Labor Party knew they were telling fibs to the Australian people a year ago. They tried to hide it. Its been exposed. Now they have a litany of broken promises that are going to be held around their necks until the next election, in two years, when the Australian people have their say on how they think broken promises should be treated.","Albanese Government","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[5]","N/A","N/A"

The Australian people finally saw through the Liberal coalition under Scott Morrison for their rorts, dishonesty and lies. They made their judgement based on what they had experienced for over a decade.  The Liberal coalition were caught out, time and time again, for the lies, the corruption and the rorts of grants.

This gives me the opportunity to continue to talk about the trilliondollar debt that those opposite left the Australian government of today. Its not just a problem of the Australian government. Its actually Australian peoples debt that we have inherited from a lacklustre, dishonest, rorting government. Theyre the facts, so it doesnt matter how many times those opposite come into the chamber and want to rewrite history. They want to make everyone feel that they havent been looked after or the promises that we made at election time have not been fulfilled. They know that they have cheaper medicines. They know that they have affordable child care. They know that we will be addressing climate change. They also know that there are 180,000 feefree TAFE places. When those opposite were in government they were very proud of the fact that they were running down TAFEs, with their state colleagues in Tasmania, and did nothing about building Australias skills. They did nothing to protect manufacturing in this country—not a thing. Under the former government we saw manufacturer after manufacturer leaving this country and going overseas. Why? Because they were never on the job. Now they come in here and bleat about the 0.5 per cent of the population who have $3 million in their superannuation funds. Theyre crying crocodile tears for those people, but they dont give a damn about the average Australian who has $120,000 or less in superannuation. You never hear those opposite come in and defend Australian workers. We saw them do nothing to address the concerns about the crisis in aged care, where we cant get people to work. We didnt see them doing anything about legislating to bring more nurses back into aged care. We heard absolutely nothing. We heard nothing from them when it came to instilling the support of their government to skill up Australians. They did nothing for lowpaid workers, and they come in here now and try to rewrite history. The Australian people saw through them and they are still seeing them for what they were. I will guarantee one thing: history will actually hold Anthony Albanese, the Labor Prime Minister of this country, in much better esteem than history will ever show Scott Morrison and his government, with their rorting and dishonesty—and the fact that Scott Morrison had so much faith in his ministerial colleagues he took over responsibility for their portfolios!

This MPI quite fairly criticises the Albanese Labor government for their record of broken promises already, including a promise not to raise taxation and a promise not to change superannuation. The Prime Minister is now raising tax on unrealised earnings of large superannuation funds. Way to go! Labor are running a twoforone sale on broken promises, just in time for the New South Wales state election, where 5½ million voters are going to ask themselves: Do I trust Labor with government? Will they keep their promises?  To be fair, the Albanese government has not resorted to dividing promises into core and noncore promises—yet. But wait; its early days. Their promise to bring down the cost of living is already broken. Today, Brisbanes Courier Mail newspaper reported that an average household in Queensland now has to spend an additional $1,150 a month to pay their bills and keep a roof over their head. That is a hell of a lot of money for everyday Australians to find every month. The Labor government is wrongly trying to blame international pressures for gas price rises. Gas was already increasing rapidly before the Ukraine conflict. The gas price rise has nothing to do with war between countries and everything to do with the war on coal. As the government closes down energyintensive coal power and introduces more weather dependent solar and wind power, the grid needs more and more gas to firm the supply and maintain reliable power. Household gas is costing more as large electricity generators bid in the market for the gas they need to keep the electricity grid functioning. Increasing gas prices are demand inflation. Housing price rises are demand inflation. Four hundred thousand new Australians arrived in the last 12 months—400,000—all needing houses in which to live. Of course the price was going to rise. No wonder the Albanese government changed their election promise from cheaper power to power going up less quickly. Every coolroom in every farm and dairy, and every Coles store and every other supermarket is now more expensive to run. Every bakery, restaurant, butcher, store and shopping centre is passing on huge increases in power prices. Mortgage repayments are rising because the previous governments money printing caused increasing interest rates. Labor went right along with those measures and is equally to blame for the inflation that thats now caused. Last week, Treasurer Jim Chalmers recklessly, wrongly, uncaringly claimed the worst of inflation is over. Really? On what basis? New South Wales voters should not believe that for a moment. Inflation is a direct result of this governments core energy and spending policies. And this government is not going away until 2025.","Albanese Government","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator ROBERTS (Queensland) ","(17:28):"

Theyre parties that seem to think its okay to lie to the Australian people to maintain cabinetinconfidence, which weve just found out about in recent days.  I want to say to the Labor Party: if the safeguard mechanism that you are bringing to parliament is your plan for climate action, that will be a broken promise to the millions of Australians who gave you and the Greens and the crossbench a mandate for change in this parliament, at this really important and absolutely critical time in history. If the best were going to get is an exTony Abbott scheme, adopted from the Liberal Party and from Angus Taylor, Australians are going to be bitterly disappointed. They will see this as a broken promise when you campaigned on climate action. Thats okay, because the Greens are here to help. It might feel like a thin green line, some days, but we are here to hold that line for the millions of Australians who voted for climate action and make sure that we put our communities, our country and nature first, and make sure that we get an outcome on reducing emissions. The legislation that you are bringing to parliament and that weve had a good look at now does nothing to reduce emissions. It does nothing to act on our planet emergency. You cant fix a problem by making it worse. This is the greatest challenge of our time. Guess who said that? Yes, a former Labor prime minister. This is a chance to fix it.

"0","0","0","1","1","McGrath, Sen James (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)","217241","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," There are so many broken promises here to choose from but so little time to speak. It is very regrettable that there isnt more time. For the enjoyment of the chamber Ill focus on a couple that are known to me in some level of detail.  In the 2019 election there was a policy statement by the Labor Party that it would turn off refundable offsets and thereby, effectively, destroy franking credits for many retirees. This was an agenda put forward by Mr Bowen, now Minister Bowen. He said, famously, in a radio interview in Sydney that if people didnt like that policy they should vote for the coalition. Thats what people did in 2019. This time, theyve come back and tried to attack franking again. Franking is a policy that the Treasury probably doesnt like. Im sure Treasurys advice to the government is that they should try to damage franking, much to the chagrin of former prime minister Paul Keating. But rather than being upfront with the Australian people and saying, We want to stuff franking, the Labor Party said they wouldnt touch franking. The quotes are really quite good. On 4 March 2022 Mr Albanese said in Perth that they were not touching them, when referring to franking credits. Just two weeks later he said, Labor wont have any changes to the franking credits regime. The Treasurer, Jim Chalmers, told Queenslanders, when it came to tax: We wont be doing franking credits. We wont be doing them. I couldnt be clearer than that. Hes certainly doing them. Hes doing them over. What were seeing now is a very sneaky and underhanded way of taking on franking credits. Rather than remove the ability of the funds to receive them, theyre trying to turn them off from the corporate end and are thereby trapping $86 billion in credits that are on balance sheets today. The explanatory memorandum is very interesting. It says that if any entity has never previously made a distribution, then the entity will not have a practice of making distributions. That is the key test in this bill—that it will effectively stuff franking by removing the ability of a company to pay a franked dividend when it has raised capital—at any point in the past, possibly. The link between a company raising equity and then paying a distribution is going to be there in the bill. Therefore, the whole franking system is, frankly, at risk. This will have very serious consequences for Australia as a competitive jurisdiction. People will be less likely to invest in Australian companies. It will be harder for Australian companies to raise equity, and Australian companies will be more reliant on debt as a result of this change. The political point here is that the government should have been upfront and said, We are going to change franking. Instead, they wrapped themselves in these promises. Its very disappointing. The other, broader promise they made was not to touch super. Hilariously, theres a gentleman in the House named Mr Stephen Jones. Hes the Assistant Treasurer. He gave an address to the SMSF Association. He said: Anthony Albanese wanted me to deliver a particular message to everyone in the sector today. And its about stability and certainty. … … … We want you to have peace of mind in your retirement. We want to make the case that your nest egg, your retirement savings are always going to be safer under Labor … There you go. You couldnt make it up. Thats a good quote, isnt it? All the government has done since the election is move the goal posts. Clearly, there has been an agenda to try and feather the nests of their favourite rentseekers, but this substantial tax change is really going to be a significant change to the system over the long term, because over the long term its going to be younger Australians who will pay a much higher level of tax. Yesterday we heard in this chamber that 10 per cent of people will be hit by the tax over the long term, and that in the short term it will be about 100,000 people. The point is that, if youve gone to an election saying you wont change the tax settings on super and your promises last less than a year, it shows breaking promises is part of your DNA. Whether its in this policy area or on climate or on a range of other things across the board, the government has shown itself to be very unreliable when it comes to making promises and keeping them.","Albanese Government","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator BRAGG (New South Wales) ","(17:33):"

Four point seven billion dollars in funding to universities was cut, hundreds of jobs at the ABC and SBS were lost, and the former government scrapped the last two years of the Gonski reforms, and those were just the warmups. It just got worse and worse and worse. There were billions and billions in entrenched cuts that devastated the services that everyday Australians rely on, including the tearing up of $56 billion in funding under the National Health Partnership Agreement. Ask any Australian how hard it now is to get in to a doctor. Those were the kinds of broken promises that we saw day after day, year after year, during nine wasted years in Australias history when we could have been really advancing on so many fronts. Mr Morrison was the PM with so many portfolios that he failed to do his day job and failed to fulfil his promises. He promised a religious discrimination bill, but his own party revolted against it. He promised a national integrity commission. He didnt even get up to bringing it into the parliament. He didnt even introduce it in the House. I dont have enough time to list the litany of pretences from the former government. So Im absolutely not going to take any notice of the crocodile tears from those opposite when they come in here and talk about broken promises.  Its a joke to see the coalition going in to bat for the richest superannuation holders in Australia at the very same time that the scandalous robodebt program that they instituted is unfolding before the eyes of Australians in the royal commission. Minister after minister, day after day, has been admitting to covering up systemic theft, with debts being illegally raised against their own people. And they dare to come in here and have a go at a government thats actually making a positive difference in the lives of Australians. Let me tell you: when Im out there, people are saying to me, Im so relieved to wake up in the morning and not feel as if theres a disaster landing on my head. That was the characteristic of the former government. People know that the former government were happy to send illegal debt notices out to hundreds of thousands of Australians, hound them with debt collectors and then systematically lie and bully their way out of accountability for this tragedy. It was supposedly to improve the budget bottom line, yet theyve left Australian taxpayers with a trillion dollars in debt. Thats their record in economic realities. Labor, instead, is undertaking a responsible, orderly, predictable cabinet style government such as has not been seen in generations. We are making sure that we bring Australians along with us in facing the challenges that we face. The world changes, and our world needs a careful response from a government that pays attention to the detail. We know that fair and sensible measures need to be undertaken to restore our nations finances. Those opposite think its just fine for those people with millions and millions of dollars in super to actually pay a smaller marginal tax rate than a payasyougo earner on a $44,000ayear salary, and they think its fine to borrow billions of dollars to keep in place those tax arrangements in super for people who have balances over $3 million. Now, I love the endeavour of people to get into business, create jobs and get the benefits of business. If youve got $3 million in super, good on you. But, if youve got more than $3 million in super, I dont think you should be getting more of a tax break than is being applied with this option, at 30c in the dollar. I think there are people in your committee who probably need to be able to see a doctor. I think people need services from this government. People need services a lot more than somebody with $3 million needs the protection of those opposite, who are standing up for 0.5 per cent of Australians who are clearly not doing it that tough. Were going to continue on with our plan to support workers, families and small businesses with cheaper medicines, cheaper child care, wage growth and more paid parental leave—gamechanging reforms that are real and will make a difference to the bottom line of families across Australia.

"0","0","0","1","1","ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The","10000","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was elected to government in no small part because he insisted that his government would be one of integrity. In February 2021 Mr Albanese told the nation it was time to bring integrity back into politics. Well, it has been almost a year now and were still waiting. Where is the integrity? Should we expect integrity anytime soon? Will Mr Albanese bring it back this year or perhaps next year? Perhaps in 2024 is when we will see the integrity. Now, dont tell us that the war in Ukraine means that the government cant do integrity anymore, because we have used that as an excuse in this place for absolutely everything else. Or is integrity something that he needs crossbench support to deliver? Well, good luck getting the teals to agree to that one.  Do you know whats funny? The only thing that Mr Albanese talked about more than integrity preelection was $275 off your power bill. Almost a year in we are still waiting to see a sign of integrity, and the cuts to power bills are nowhere to be seen. Perhaps when the PM promised integrity what he actually meant was dishonesty, like when he promised the $275 cut to power bills. He made that promise, might I remind everyone here, 97 times. Maybe he actually meant rises in power bills, not cuts—kind of like when he promised no changes to super. Thats what he promised, but maybe what he meant was changes to super. Much like when he promised that Labor had a plan—a clear plan—for cheaper mortgages. Maybe he meant that the Labor Party would preside over 10 consecutive interest rate rises to now. Less than 12 months into the Albanese government we are actually seeing quite a clear pattern: the government promises one thing, and the government goes and does something else. How is that for integrity? They say this, but they go and do that. The Prime Minister says you can absolutely, most definitely rule out changes to capital gains tax on the family home, just like he said you can rule out changes to superannuation, and then he goes and announces changes to superannuation and he doubles the tax rate. Why would you believe a word that this government says? Meanwhile, the Deputy Prime Minister was so confused by the constant changes to super policy—a policy that, of course, we were assured before the election wouldnt happen—that he couldnt answer basic questions when he was on Sky News recently with Peter Stefanovic. No wonder the Deputy PM was confused: he has no more faith in his government and their policies than the rest of us do. It takes a special kind of dishonesty to promise integrity and then break so many promises to the people that believe the claims of integrity. Mr Albanese can sure walk across the harbour bridge in a pride march, but do you know what he cant do? He cant walk in a straight line; thats what he cant do. The Treasurer, super Jim Chalmers, can write 6,000 words on remaking capitalism—thats what he did—but hed be hard pressed to write 60 words on what it means to operate with integrity. Its time that we bring integrity back to politics, Mr Albanese—its time. Were all waiting for it. Were waiting for integrity from your government, just as Mr Chris Bowen is patiently waiting for his taxpayer funded Tesla—thats what hes waiting for. Were waiting for integrity from this government in the exact same way that Tanya Plibersek is patiently waiting for her chance to assume the top job. Actually, the way this government is going there is far more chance of seeing that than of seeing any integrity. Mr Albanese started with so much promise. What a pity he has not kept any of his promises. Does Mr Albanese not understand that democratic nations run on trust? The citizenry grant permission to government to exercise authority in exchange for a governments commitment to act honestly and to act fairly. Thats the deal, and Mr Albanese has trashed that deal in less than 12 months. The litany of broken promises shows all of us that. Next election, vote differently.","Albanese Government","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator BABET (Victoria—United Australia Party Whip) ","(17:44):"

"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I present the 183rd report of the Committee of Privileges regarding a possible obstruction of the work of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement. I move:  That the Senate adopt the conclusion at paragraph 1.31 of the report that no contempt be found in relation to the matters referred. The report relates to the committees inquiry into whether Senator Thorpes—and I acknowledge Senator Thorpes presence in the chamber—failure to declare a relationship with Mr Dean Martin to the joint committee amounted to an improper interference with the committees work. More specifically, the Senate required the Privileges Committee to consider: … whether Senator Thorpes failure to declare the relationship: (a) obstructed the work of the Joint Committee … (b) if so, whether this amounted to an improper interference with the work of the committee; and (c) whether any contempt was committed in this regard. The media reports which prompted this inquiry suggested Mr Martin is a former member of an outlaw motorcycle gang and that the joint committee was conducting an inquiry or held briefings which examined matters relating to such gangs. In considering whether Senator Thorpes failure to declare the relationship obstructed the work of the joint committee, the Privileges Committee examined not just the specific impact of her failure to declare the personal relationship but also whether there was a wider impact on the operation of the joint committee. The committee sought and considered submissions from Senator Thorpe and the joint committee. This matter relates to alleged conduct which, if proven, could only be addressed by the Senate exercising its power to determine and punish contempts. Media coverage of this matter was clearly intended to suggest that Senator Thorpe had utilised her membership of the joint committee to further the interests of an outlaw motorcycle gang. A senator using his or her position on a committee to access sensitive information from law enforcement agencies in order to further the interests of a criminal organisation would, of course, be amongst the most serious possible contempts. To the extent that it was conduct forming part of the proceedings of parliament, it could only be sanctioned by the Senate. However, the evidence to the Privileges Committee demonstrates that the media coverage of this matter was inaccurate in some important respects. In particular, the implication that Senator Thorpe used her position inappropriately or even had access to information of the type speculated about in the media coverage is not borne out. The joint committee advised that it had no evidence that Senator Thorpe had declared a possible conflict of interest in relation to a personal relationship. Senator Thorpe accepted in her submission that she should have declared this possible conflict. The committee agrees that Senator Thorpe should have declared her relationship as a potential conflict of interest with her work on the joint committee. It was possible that she would receive sensitive material of interest to outlaw motorcycle gangs through her work on the committee; however, on the basis of evidence it has received, the committee is satisfied that no disclosure of such material has occurred and that the operations of the joint committee have not been impeded. The committee therefore concludes that a contempt should not be found in relation to the matters referred to. The committee also wishes to make some recommendations concerning the strengthening of the process for declaring conflicts of interest. The committee urges all senators to exercise caution in relation to possible conflicts of interest as well as the perception that their personal relationships may conflict with their official duties. All senators should take a scrupulous approach to such matters. Where there is any doubt, they should seek the advice of colleagues or of the Clerk. Senators must be aware of their responsibilities to perform their roles in the public interest, to declare any possible conflicts, and to comply with the standing orders by not sitting on a committee where they have a conflict of interest. Transparency in relation to such matters serves to resolve most issues and is critical to maintaining the confidence of submitters and witnesses in the integrity of committee proceedings. To support a more consistent approach on these matters, the committee has recommended that declarations of any conflict of interest should be a standard agenda item at all private meetings of all committees. I would like to thank my colleagues on the committee for their considered approach to this matter. I commend the report to the Senate, and I do wish to say that the manner in which the Privileges Committee has dealt with this has been very much in the interests of the Senate as a whole. It is not just a bipartisan committee; it is actually a nonpartisan committee. Certainly Senator ONeill as the deputy chair—I know she has made this reflection on a previous chair, Senator Abetz—has said that the operation of this committee for a long time has been nonpartisan. I certainly hope, and it is my intention as chair, that it will stay that way. Once again, I commend the report to the Senate.  Thank you, Senator Brockman, for reading out the findings of the Privileges Committee. Over months and months, my family and my children have had to wait with bated breath about the process, the outcome and the transparency in this whole situation. I was basically mauled by the media in that time. I had no relationship with that person. I was given legal advice by the Greens lawyer that I had to say that I dated this person. I got a call from that person, who said, Did we date? We kissed once at a rally. We kissed once at a rally on 26 January. I had no idea who this person was, or his background. My legal advice was to say I dated this person. I got mauled by all of you. I got mauled by the media.

I move:  That the report be adopted. This report forms part of a series of reports recommending that a right of reply be afforded to persons who claim to have been adversely affected by being referred to in the Senate, either by name or in such a way as to be readily identified. On 15 December 2022, the President received a submission from Mr Jason Riley relating to a speech made by Senator McMahon in the Senate on 30 March 2022. The President referred the submission to the committee under privilege resolution 5. The committee has considered the submission and recommends that Mr Rileys response be incorporated into Hansard. The committee reminds the Senate that in matters of this nature it does not judge the truth or otherwise of the statements made by senators or the persons referred to. Rather, it ensures that these persons submissions, and ultimately the responses it recommends, accord with the criteria set out in privilege resolution 5. I commend the motion to the Senate. Question agreed to. Response as recommended by the committee incorporated accordingly— Appendix 1 Mr. Jason Riley Pursuant to Resolution 5(7)(b) of the Senate of 25 February 1988 Reply to comments by Senator Sam McMahon (30 March 2022) 1. In the lead up to the Federal election of 2022 I became aware of statements Sam McMahon made in her valedictorian speech to Parliament, in which she identified me by name in connection to a number of issues she said she experienced during her time as a Parliamentarian. 2. The first comment made by Sam McMahon reflected upon her decision to resign from her Party, as extracted from the relevant Hansard, My reason to resign was driven entirely by my former staff member, Jason Riley—who did abuse and terrorise my office, including myself Any and all suggestions I did abuse and terrorise former Senator Sam McMahons office, or Sam McMahon, herself, are completely false, defamatory and without foundation. Available to her throughout the period I was employed by her, and since, were numerous avenues to address issues of staff exhibiting such conduct, including immediate dismissal. Sam McMahon did not avail herself of those remediations. 3. Sam McMahon went on to say, …and the partys decision to place him into a position on their central council… At the time Sam McMahon alleges this decision was taken, she herself was a member of both the CLP Management Committee and Central Council, however, the Country Liberal Party made no such decision. Furthermore, I neither sought, nor was appointed, any position on the Central Council. In its entirety, the abovementioned statement by Sam McMahon is a prevarication. 4. The final part of the comment Sam McMahon made was, To have to sit in meetings with such a person was a very stressful experience…. The only meeting I participated in with Sam McMahon at that point was the Country Liberal Party Central Council meeting, attended by approximately 70 people. I did not participate in any meetings with her subsequent to that event. Prior to that event, I had not participated in a meeting with Sam McMahon for more than two and a half years. In the context of the paragraph from which this comment is extracted, Sam McMahons words are once again a mix of mistruths and fabrications. 5. Sam McMahons false statements in her speech have had a direct impact on my wellbeing and future employment opportunities, a condition that continues to today. 6. Immediately following Sam McMahon making these comments about me, she embarked on a media campaign, spanning multiple radio and television stations, to discuss her comments made under Parliamentary privilege, with particular focus on the comments she made about me. That practice was detrimental to my character and reputation. Again, I will draw your attention to the fact Sam McMahon had access to a wide range of remediation options and services to deal with the issues she alleges, over an extended period of time, yet she failed to employ any, preferring instead to make her statements under Parliamentary privilege. 7. I formally request my remarks contained herein are entered into Hansard to form a response to the false and misleading statements Sam McMahon made about me. While employed by Sam McMahon I did not, in any way or at any time, conduct myself in a manner that could be characterized to abuse and terrorise either her or other staff. I am in no way responsible for Sam McMahons demise with her Party, nor her decision to resign from her Party. Should the members of the Privileges Committee require, I stand ready to provide details of witnesses who have agreed to speak on the matters raised by Sam McMahon in her speech to Parliament and to verify my statements made herein. In each instance, those people can offer first hand, direct evidence.

I wish to make some comments in relation to that report.  The coalition strongly believes that any discussion or consideration of constitutional change should be—in itself—considered, measured and balanced. The changes proposed in this bill will set a precedent for future referenda and should not be considered as temporary or be adopted lightly. The governments decision to rush this inquiry over the Christmas and summer holiday period is disappointing because it has limited the ability of JSCEM members to effectively scrutinise witnesses and the proposed legislation. While there are a number of sensible and constructive changes included in the bill, it is clear that the government has put forward other changes that are not in the interest of an informed and robust process for conducting a referendum. We are pleased to note that the government has agreed to our recommendation that there should be the publication and communication of an official pamphlet. However, coalition members are very disappointed that there will not be a designation of official campaign entities in addition to the adequate and equal funding of yes and no campaigns. In particular, we believe that our recommendations negate recommendation 2 of the chairs report, and we are concerned that the governments report puts at risk a successful referendum process with integrity and appropriate protections against misinformation. The coalition, along with numerous stakeholders and submitters, remain greatly dissatisfied at the governments decision not to create and fund official yes and no organisations. We believe, regardless of your view on the Voice, that the cases for and against should be dealt with in an appropriate and adult manner across the community and that the referendum should be managed in a manner that is most similar to how a federal election has been run, considering that a referendum has not been conducted in this country for over 20 years. It is for that reason that the coalition do not support the passing of the bill. Further comments will be made when the bill comes before the Senate chamber later this week. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I present the governments response to the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security on its inquiry into national security risks affecting the Australian higher education and research sector. I seek leave to have the document incorporated in Hansard.  Leave granted. The document rea d as follows— Australian Government response to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security report: National security risks affecting the Australian higher education and research sector FEBRUARY 2023 Introduction On 28 October 2020, the then Minister for Home Affairs, referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security (the PJCIS) a general inquiry to report on national security risks affecting the higher education and research sector (the sector). On 25 March 2022, the Committee delivered its final report, National security risks affecting the Australian higher education and research sector (the Report) which made 27 recommendations. The Report considered the broad national security risks present in the sector, with a particular focus on the prevalence, characteristics and significance of foreign interference, undisclosed foreign interference, data theft and espionage and associated risks to Australias national security in the sector. The Government welcomes and broadly supports the majority of the recommendations. It also welcomes the acknowledgement throughout the report of the substantial work undertaken or underway by the sector and the Commonwealth agencies through the University Foreign Interference Taskforce (UFIT) and other key lines of effort in order to raise awareness and increase resilience to foreign interference. The Government will continue to support and collaborate with universities in policy development, capability building, guidelines implementation, information sharing and an overall positive partnership to deepen universities  resilience against foreign interference Recommendations Recommendation 1: The Committee recommends the Australian higher education and research sector, via the University Foreign Interference Taskforce, undertake a campaign of active transparency in relation to the national security risks. The Committee recommends that the University Foreign Interference Taskforce have oversight of this c ampaign and report to the Australian Government on progress. Response: Supported The University Foreign Interference Taskforce will continue its efforts to build the sectors understanding of the risk and context of foreign interference and appropriate responses. The University Foreign Interference Taskforce will continue to update Ministers on the sector s progress in implementing the UFIT Guidelines. Recommendation 2: The Committee welcomes the revised UFIT Guidelines and further recommends adherence to those guidelines be reported annually to the PJCIS in writing, accompanied by a classified briefing. This briefing should include an explanation of the capabilities developed to monitor and evaluate compliance with the guidelines. The Government should fur ther consider the UFIT terms of reference and update relevant guidance material to ensure the body remains fit for purpose. Response: Supported in Principle The Government is working with the sector to define reporting arrangements on the implementation of the revised UFIT Guidelines and will share with the PJCIS the findings of any report. Agencies will be available to provide a classified briefing to the PJCIS. The University Foreign Interference Taskforce will keep its terms of reference under review and update, on a regular basis, guidance material as appropriate. Recommendation 3: The Committee recommends University Foreign Interference Taskforce assist universities to introduce, maintain and develop relevant training on national security issues for sta ff and students. Universities should employ an accountable authority who is responsible for managing foreign interference risks at their institution. This position should be based upon the framework set out in part 1.2 of the updated UFIT Guidelines. Respo nse: Supported The University Foreign Interference Taskforce has established a Training Working Group to complement the sectors existing work in order to ensure the availability of appropriate training materials for staff and students to counter foreign interference. Officials from Home Affairs and ASIO will continue a program of outreach activities with the sector to support implementation of the UFIT Guidelines. The UFIT Guidelines encourage universities to have accountable authorities responsible for managing foreign interference risk. Recommendation 4: The Committee recommends the University Foreign Interference Taskforce establish a working group to address the issue of oncampus intimidation, reporting on fellow students or staff to foreign embassies, and intimidation on campuses related to the national security risks and make recommendations to the Australian Government and the sector. This group, as a matter of urgency, should provide clear guidance to universities on implementing penalties for forei gn interference activities on campus, including reporting on fellow students to foreign governments. These should be clearly defined in university codes of conduct and communicated to students. Response: Supported The UFIT Guidelines encourage universities to have communication plans and education programs that raise awareness and support mitigation of their foreign interference risks, including instances of intimidation and harassment (UFIT Guideline 2.1). The University Foreign Interference Taskforce Training Working Group will consider behavioural issues on campus as part of its remit. Recommendation 5: The Committee recommends the Department of Education, Skills and Training should, in concert with the University Foreign Interference Taskforce, annually publish a report that documents incidents of harassment, intimidation and censorship that occur as a result of foreign interference activities on Australian university campuses. This report should include the steps and responses, if any, taken by the unive rsity. Response: Noted If clandestine, it can be difficult to establish foreign interference as the motivating factor for harassment, intimidation and censorship. The Government is working with the sector to define reporting arrangements on the implementation of the revised UFIT Guidelines. Recommendation 6: The Committee recommends the Department of Education, Skills and Training and the Department of Home Affairs work to develop a secure mechanism that allows individual students to anonymously report inci dents of intimidation, retaliation, harassment, or censorship on campus where a student believes those behaviours are associated with foreign interference. Response: Supported Individual students are able to anonymously report instances of foreign interference on campus through the National Security Hotline. Through ongoing outreach efforts, Home Affairs and ASIO will continue to promote the National Security Hotline and NITRO (Notifiable Incidents, Threats and Reportable Observations) as reporting mechanisms for suspected instances of foreign interference. Recommendation 7: The Committee recommends that Universities who elect to host a Confucius Institute should disclose and make public details of those agreements and funding arrangements, and that at a minimum, Universities have a final say about the appointment of staff, curriculum content and that robust academic freedom and free speech clauses be included in any agreement. The Committee supports the Foreign Minister using her existing veto powers und er the Foreign Relations Act to make determinations in the national interest, including in relation to Confucius Institutes. Response: Noted In accordance with the UFIT Guidelines, universities will continue to apply a comprehensive approach to their due diligence in assessing foreign interference risks and reflect that in the terms of any agreement to host a Confucius Institute. Arrangements between Australian public universities and Chinese government entities and/or universities relating to Confucius Institutes are required to be notified to the Minister for Foreign Affairs under the Australia s Foreign Relations (State and Territory Arrangements) Act 2020 (the Act). Fiftysix such arrangements have been notified and confirmed to be subject to the Act to date. Under the Act, details of these arrangements are published on the Public Register .(www.foreignarrangements.gov.au) unless subject to requests for exclusion from publication. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) reviews Confucius Institute arrangements notified under the Act in consultation with Government agencies and provides advice to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Minister may exercise powers with respect to individual foreign arrangements within scope of the Act where the arrangement is, or is likely to be, inconsistent with Australias foreign policy or adverse to Australias foreign relations. Separate from their powers under the Act, the Minister may also direct DFAT to pursue mitigations to manage foreign policy risks, where identified. DFAT, in consultation with other agencies, has assessed all Confucius Institute arrangements notified and within scope of the Act. The Governments resilience measures, including UFIT and the Foreign Arrangements Scheme (as established by the Act), are an effective mechanism for engaging with the university sector to ensure universities are informed about and are managing risk associated with foreign engagement, including with respect to Confucius Institutes. DFAT will keep these arrangements under review. DFAT is actively engaging with universities directly and through UFIT to convey the Governments expectations, and advice on negotiating arrangements that protect Australia s interests and mitigate risks. Recommendation 8: The Committee r ecommends the Foreign Minister exercise her power under the Foreign Relations Act to make a determination in the national interest relating to the agreement between Monash University and COMAC. Response: Noted The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Home Affairs are engaging closely with Monash University about its relationship with COMAC. Monash University has advised that all currently active research projects between Monash and COMAC will conclude in the first half of 2023, and no further activity is planned. Government agencies will maintain regular contact with Monash University and keep this cooperation under review. Recommendation 9: The Committee recommends the higher education sector take note of the Blueprint for Critica l Technologies released by the Critical Technologies Policy Coordination Office within the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet on 17 November 2021 as a reference for areas of research sensitive to the national interest and exercise greater caution wi th international research partnerships, PhD students and cybersecurity. However, the Committee urges the sector not to consider this list exhaustive and to also use their own judgement about technologies which might subsequently emerge. In these sensitive research cases, universities should be required to provide additional security assurances regarding research personnel to Commonwealth funding agencies. Response: Supported The University Foreign Interference Taskforce has established a Critical Technology Working Group to identify critical technologies that require heightened due diligence when considering international research partnerships, PhD students and cybersecurity. Commonwealth funding agencies such as the Australian Research Council and National Health and Medical Research Council reference the UFIT Guidelines in the consideration of grant applications. Recommendation 10: The Committee recommends ASIO, in their annual report to parliament, provide information on threats to the Australian higher education and research sector as a routine part of their broader threat assessment. Response: Not supported ASIO does not consider it appropriate to highlight a single sector in its Annual Report when multiple sectors are being targeted by our adversaries. It could be misleading and, in some circumstances, give Australias adversaries actionable information about ASIO investigations. It is also important to note that ASIO uses multiple mechanisms for providing threat information. Apart from the Annual Report, the DirectorGeneral delivers an Annual Threat Assessment and appears before Senate Committees. ASIO regularly briefs the higher education sector on the security environment, and also prepares and disseminates outreach reports on threats to specific sectors, including higher education. It would be preferable for ASIO to have maximum flexibility in how it delivers information about threats to higher education, tailored to the specific circumstances at the time. Recommendation 11: The Committee recommends the University Foreign Interference Taskforce establish clear policies on what constitutes acceptable dual appointments of foreign diplomats at Australian tertiary institutions. Universities should also make thei r own judgements about whether appointments are consistent with the values they seek to uphold. Additionally, the Committee recommends the AttorneyGenerals Department and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade consider whether appointments of foreign di plomats to Australian tertiary institutions are adequately addressed via existing legislative frameworks. Response: Noted Risks associated with the appointment of foreign diplomats to Australian tertiary institutions are addressed via existing legislative and policy frameworks. Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961, foreign diplomats are prevented from undertaking professional or commercial activity for personal gain; however this does not prevent a foreign diplomat from accepting an unpaid honorary position at a university. In accordance with the UFIT Guidelines, universities will continue to apply a comprehensive approach to their due diligence in assessing foreign interference risks. Recommendation 12: The Committee recommends the Unive rsity Foreign Interference Taskforce provide guidance to support universities allowing for anonymous assignment submission. Response: Supported The University Foreign Interference Taskforce Training Working Group will consider anonymous assignment submission as part of its remit. Recommendation 13: The Committee recommends the AttorneyGenerals Department should clearly communicate Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme requirements to foreign student associations operating at Australian universities and in vestigate possible cases of noncompliance. Response: Supported The AttorneyGenerals Department (AGD) will engage with the university sector, through the University Foreign Interference Taskforce, about how to most effectively communicate the requirements of the scheme and investigation processes to student associations. Recommendation 14: The Committee recommends the Australian Government provide deeper and timelier security advice to assist the sector in their risk identification and manageme nt processes. Response: Supported ASIO, Home Affairs and the Australian Cyber Security Centre work closely with the higher education and research sector, and will continue to provide regular briefings on the threat of espionage and foreign interference. Re commendation 15: The Committee recommends the Department of Defence deny Defence Industry Security Program accreditation to institutions with exposure to talent recruitment programs that is assessed to be a security issue. Response: Supported in Principle The Government will adjust the Defence Industry Security Program (DISP) membership application and assurance processes to require a declaration from institutions in regards to their exposure to talent recruitment programs. The declaration will inform risk assessments and ratings. Recommendation 16: The Committee recommends more timely and relevant advice be provided by the Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in support of the defence export control and autonomous sanctions schemes. Response: Supported in Principle Australian export control legislation requires each export application to be assessed against twelve legislative criteria broadly addressing foreign policy, human rights, national security, regional security and international obligations. The Department of Defence continues to monitor processing times and implement process improvements to reduce those processing times as far as possible. Certain export applications require specialist advice from other government departments and agencies, which can extend processing times. The Department of Defence provides outreach to the Australian university and research sector to support awareness of, and compliance with, Australian export controls legislation. DFAT provides detailed information about Australian sanctions laws at www.dfat.gov.au/sanctions. This provides access to the Consolidated List of all persons and entities listed for targeted financial sanctions and travel bans under Australian sanctions laws and access to Pax, the online sanctions portal, which can be used to contact the Australian Sanctions Office (ASO) in DFAT with specific queries. It is also possible to use the website to subscribe to updates from the ASO, which are provided by email whenever there is a change to Australian sanctions laws, including changes to the Consolidated List. DFAT also conducts regular seminars on Australian sanctions laws for the community, including universities. Universities can use Pax to request a seminar. Recommendation 17: T he Committee recommends employees of government departments and agencies be prohibited from participation in talentrecruitment programs. Response: Supported in Principle Under the APS Code of Conduct, legislated under the Public Service Act 1999, an APS employee must take reasonable steps to avoid any conflict of interest in connection with their APS employment and disclose details of any material personal interest in connection with their APS employment. Under the Protective Security Policy Framework, security clearance holders are required to report, amongst other things, suspicious, persistent, unusual or ongoing contact with foreign nationals, involvement or association with any group, society or organisation, visits to foreign countries and financial circumstances. The national security risks that may arise from participation in talentrecruitment programs can be assessed through these processes. Recommendation 18: The Committee recommends the AttorneyGenerals Department and Department of Foreign Affa irs and Trade assess whether existing legislative tools are sufficient for addressing membership in talent programs that are against the national interest. Response: Supported in Principle The Guidelines to Counter Foreign Interference in the Australian University Sector provides guidance to universities on the conduct of due diligence on partners and personnel to inform decisionmakers of foreign interference risks. The Criminal Code includes offences for espionage and foreign interference. Agencies keep this legislation under active review. The Foreign Arrangements Scheme may consider some arrangements involving talent programs where arrangements involve an Australian university and a foreign government. Recommendation 19: The Committee recommends the Depa rtment of Education, Skills and Employment commission a riskbased audit which samples Australian Research Council grants over the past decade to determine exposure associated with participation in talent recruitment programs noting the thousand talents pr ogram is one amongst many. The audit should investigate whether grant rules have been adhered to regarding intellectual property. The Committee also recommends the Government investigate the adequacy of existing penalties for research institutions who are failing to detect or respond to any breaches to ARC grant rules identified in the audit. Response: Supported in Principle The Department of Education will engage with the Australian Research Council (ARC) to review active/current ARC grants in the context of consideration of foreign interference risks since the launch of the original UFIT Guidelines. The Government considers existing penalties appropriate for breaches of ARC grant rules. ARC compliance arrangements include penalties such as the termination of grants, full recovery of funds, and banning of applicants from applying in future grant rounds. Recommendation 20: The Committee recommends the University Foreign Interference Taskforce work with universities to develop best practice audit requirements regarding senior research staff members foreign interests, including participation in talent programs. These foreign interests should then be provided to UFIT and universityspecific but individually anonymised information on foreign interests made public ly available via UFITs website. This should include transparency on measures taken to address incidences of security concern and conflicts. Response: Supported in Principle The UFIT Guidelines encourage universities to have approval, audit and continuous evaluation of due diligence processes (Guideline 3.4). The Government is working with the sector to define reporting arrangements on the implementation of the revised UFIT Guidelines. Reporting on implementation of the revised UFIT Guidelines will provide an opportunity for universities to identify in an aggregated form their implementation of due diligence processes. Recommendation 21: The Committee recommends the Departments of Education, Skills and Employment and Foreign Affairs and Trade assi st the sector in diversifying international student populations. Response: Supported Steps have been taken to assist the sector to diversify the international student cohort to improve sector resilience and enhance student experience. The Australian Strategy for International Education 20212030 led by the Department of Education identifies diversification of Australias international education sector as one of four priority areas for the next decade. The Department of Education will work with relevant stakeholders, including Austrade and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in implementation of the strategy. Recommendation 22: The Committee recommends the Government direct the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency to initiate a regular aud it of national security issues and responses in the sector by establishing a National Research Integrity Office within the Agency. The findings of this audit should be publicly reported. Response: Noted Government agencies will continue to update Ministers on the sectors progress in implementation of the UFIT Guidelines. TEQSAs establishing framework does not extend to the required legislative remit, capacity or expertise to deliver on addressing this recommendation. However, the Government acknowledges that work in considering national security issues and sector responses is being pursued under existing consultation and reporting approaches. The Government has some concern with publicly reporting this information due to the possibility of unintended and undue reputational impacts. Recommendation 23: The Committee recommends representation from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade be included in the University Foreign Interference Taskforce Response: Supported The University Foreign Interference Taskforce has extended its membership to include the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Recommendation 24: The Committee recommends University Foreign Interference Taskforce assist universities to introduce, maintain and develop relevant training on nati onal security issues for staff and students. Response: Supported See response to PJCIS recommendation 3. Recommendation 25: The Committee recommends the University Foreign Interference Taskforce develop a national security legislation implementation workin g group to assist universities in actioning national security legislation and related policies. This working group should develop understanding within the sector as to the relationship between various pieces of national security legislation. Response: Supported in Principle Relevant Government agencies will consult with the University Foreign Interference Taskforce to ensure that guidance material on the application of national security legislation and policies is made available to the sector. Recommendatio n 26: The Committee recommends the Australian Research Council clearly communicate to the sector via the University Foreign Interference Taskforce the serious consequences of grant fraud to increase awareness of disclosure requirements. All Commonwealth fu nding organisations should consider the adequacy of existing compliance and accountability policies with regard to the provision of grant funding. In addition the Committee recommends the Australian Research Council toughen penalties against grant fraud an d inadequate or incomplete disclosure and prioritise investigation and enforcement of them. Tenders issued by all government agencies providing grants to research institutions should include a standard clause requiring compliance with existing countering f oreign interference policies. Response: Supported in Principle The ARC will continue to work with the Department of Education, the University Foreign Interference Taskforce and other stakeholders to continue to raise awareness of disclosure requirements and the serious consequences of grant fraud. Recommendation 27: The Committee recommends a review of the ARCs performance in assessing foreign interference and national security risks in the context of grant decisions. A copy of the review should be made av ailable to the PJCIS. Response: Supported The Government has commenced a review of the ARCs performance in assessing foreign interference and national security risks in the context of grant decisions, with a report of review findings to the Minister for Education, with a copy made available to the PJCIS.  I move: That the Senate take note of the document. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," In respect of the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs on its inquiry into community safety support services and job opportunities in the Northern Territory, I move:  That the Senate take note of the report. As chair of the committee, I tabled the report out of session last week. I want to first thank those who engaged in this inquiry—specifically the community members, Aboriginal organisations and frontline service providers who gave evidence. Unfortunately, it was not possible to get across all communities in the Northern Territory, due to the time frames. However, we did visit Darwin and Alice Springs, and we had a delegation of Maningrida community members come to Canberra to put their concerns to us. We held virtual hearings with community members, peak organisations, Commonwealth and Northern Territory government departments, the alcohol industry and leading researchers. We also received submissions and private briefings as part of the inquiry. It was important to hear from all of these witnesses because they brought a breadth of perspective forward. There was not one witness who denied the social or economic difficulties being experienced by Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory. However, almost all the witnesses came with practical, holistic and strength based solutions. Im so grateful for their time, patience and generosity. We were asked by this chamber to undertake an inquiry with particular reference to the preparation for the sunsetting of the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Act, community safety and alcohol management, job opportunities and community development program reform, justice reinvestment community services and any related matters. This was important because these policy areas are all so interconnected. We heard consistent themes about the need for locally led initiatives, for more data sharing and for outcome focused efforts and investment. We heard that the status quo has not worked and change is required. As a committee, we made findings across each of these areas and made nine consensus recommendations to the Commonwealth and Northern Territory governments. Many of these are about the importance of local, place based initiatives. They recognise that past attempts by governments through the Northern Territory National Emergency Response and the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Act were ineffective. We commented that, in fact, the Intervention and the Stronger Futures legislative packages: … systemically disempowered communities—in their delivery, implementation and transition—causing immense trauma that now requires concerted effort by all levels of government to enable and invest in the reempowerment of these communities. In relation to alcohol management, under these past regimes, the Commonwealth government overrides the Northern Territory by exercising powers to legislate alcohol restrictions. The committee considers it is the appropriate role of the Northern Territory, rather than the Commonwealth, to make such legislative decisions. We also heard extensively about the ineffectiveness of focusing solely on reducing supply of alcohol and not properly supporting people at risk. Witnesses such as the Alice Springs Hospital personnel told us that, instead of focusing only on alcohol: We really need to go back to looking at the social determinants of health. We really need to start looking at housing, meaningful employment, education, hope and despair. That is why its so important that the Commonwealth is supporting the Northern Territory government, by committing to a $250 million package under the title A Better, Safer Future for Central Australia, which intends to address service, community and infrastructure needs. We also heard far too regularly about the failures and, in many cases, the entire lack of service accessibility in remote communities. Where you live should not determine the services or basic amenities you receive, and yet it does for people living in remote communities. As a committee, we all agreed that investment in services and support programs in remote communities is fundamental. We also considered that there needs to be a greater focus on the following: working with communities to determine that service investment; opportunities to enhance place based models of funding and support collaboration amongst local organisations; embedding holistic health approaches to service provision that focus on social, emotional and cultural wellbeing; and sharing realtime data with local communities as necessary. We know that governments need to transfer both power and resources to communities to improve the outcomes. In terms of economic development, we heard a breadth of advice about the potential of a reformed CDP. We know that currently the CDP does not adequately consider what real job opportunities there are in remote communities. We also heard about the innovation in some organisations as part of a trial underway to give greater flexibility in the CDP. The report also makes recommendations to the government to consider how to stimulate economic activity outside of CDP. In relation to justice reinvestment, weve heard about the benefits of justice reinvestment models and alternatives to custody initiatives. Many witnesses talked about their experiences and their hopes for this. The committee recommended that both Alice Springs and Katherine be sites as part of the Commonwealth governments landmark $81 million commitment to community led justice reinvestment programs. It is clear that the Intervention and the Stronger Futures legislation failed to improve conditions for Aboriginal people living in remote Aboriginal communities. These acts did not work. In fact they did the opposite. Children born in 2007 and 2008, at the height of the Intervention, are the children at risk of causing harm today. Im grateful to those young people who spoke with us in private briefings, because it is critical that their voices are central to this discussion. Too often they are talked about instead of engaged with in the solutions. Overall, Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory are incredibly resilient, but they have been let down enormously by governments of all stripes. Yet they continue to show up with solutions and preparedness to work with governments in good faith. This is despite their right to selfdetermination being entirely denied. In response to that resilience, this report makes recommendations that seek to address the disempowering legacy from the topdown approaches of the past 15 years. There are additional comments to this report added by Senator Thorpe and Senator Liddle. I commend this report to the Senate.  I too would like to comment on the inquiry into community safety, support services and job opportunities in the Northern Territory. During this inquiry we heard from First Nations people across the Territory—families, communities, young people and some services, including community leaders—about the devastating impacts of the Northern Territory Intervention and, later, the Stronger Futures legislation on communities. The Intervention represents one of the darkest eras of First Nations policy this country has seen. Implemented by John Howard and then continued by subsequent Liberal and Labor governments, the Intervention was racist and paternalistic and undermined First Nations rights to selfdetermination. The Intervention is evidence of the violent colonisation in this country and its oppressive regime. Our people have never ceded sovereignty over these lands, waters and skies, which we have cared for since time immemorial. As the oldest living culture on this planet, we know very well how to care for one another, how to look after our old people, how to teach and look after our young people and how to care for country, because thats what weve always done. This knowledge, passed down through generations, remains as strong as our culture and our sovereignty that always was and always will be ours. The Stronger Futures legislation packages disempowered our communities and added to the trauma caused by colonisation that has impacted our people across generations. Alcohol consumption is a symptom of the impact that trauma has on our communities—trauma that is complex and is only compounded by racist policies that lack proper consultation and certainly lack consent. They undermine our right to selfdetermination, as we saw with the Intervention and Stronger Futures. This shows the importance of finally ensuring our laws comply with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and of UNDRIP being enacted in this country. While Australia officially adopted the UNDRIP in 2009, this country has no regard for human rights, let alone the rights of First Nations people. The principle of free, prior and informed consent of First Nations people, one of the core principles of the UNDRIP, is of particular importance to ensure First Nations selfdetermination as well as best outcomes for First Nations people, culture and country. This government refuses to acknowledge that First Nations people are sovereign nations and refuses to go out into communities and sit down and talk with our elders and leaders, who know what is best for their people. Consultation is not consent. I welcome the committees acknowledgement of the ways in which these policies disempowered First Nations communities and the inadequate consultation and planning for the sunsetting of Stronger Futures. Despite knowing years in advance that this legislation would be ending, the government failed to properly consult with communities about what should come next. I fully support the committees acknowledgement of the importance of local community led solutions and initiatives. As a country, we have a long way to go to make this a reality. Our people, especially our elders, hold the solutions to the challenges we face. This is why we need a treaty with First Nations people. Treaty is a longoverdue end to the war that was declared on First Nations people at the invasion of these lands. It would acknowledge that First Nations sovereignty was never ceded and would provide a pathway for us to move forward. A treaty would enable us to address the underlying oppression and injustices our society was built on. Treaty can create true systemic change to allow much needed healing. Treaty is what First Nations people in this country have been calling for ever since invasion. It will be negotiated sovereign to sovereign and allow clans and nations to determine their own destiny. And it is the way to create jointly a brighter future in this country. I will continue advocating for a treaty and for the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and the Bringing them home report to be implemented, because these are what my people across the country have been calling for, and they would actually have a real impact on peoples lives. Bringing those messages into parliament is an act of sovereignty. I look forward to bringing all peoples across this country along the journey of this movement towards justice and towards peace.

I was wondering, Minister: when will the removal of the 400plus items from the Prostheses List take place from?   This is the list of items that was decided under your government. My advice is on 1 July.  This morning in questioning I asked the representing minister if there were going to be any IT requirements to enable hospital vendors, or anybody who is impacted by the changes to this, to be ready. The minister said that there were none. Im wondering whether thats still your opinion.  My understanding is the changes to the Prostheses List were announced a couple of years ago, and therefore I presume many of the hospitals would have made adjustments based on that. There is nothing further I can add. Its not about the bill; its about the administration of the list by the hospitals.  Which part of this package of bills seeks to set up—the framework in terms of the operation going forward. Im just wondering: has the government received any concerns from the hospital sector in relation to their ability to implement the bundling of these new items that will now be considered outside of the Prostheses List under general use items? Has the government received any correspondence or any representations raising concerns from private hospitals about their ability to undertake the changes that will need to occur on 1 July for these 400plus items to be included no longer under that mechanism of funding but under a new mechanism of funding?  My advice is that, yes, concerns or issues have been raised, and thats why the Department of Health and Aged Care is working through these issues with the vendors.  Is the minister intending to meet with the IT vendors in relation to this issue?  I think these are normally matters that are dealt with at departmental level. Im not sure, but I will check to see whether the ministers had an approach for his diary and whether hes meeting with people. I know he meets with stakeholders extensively, as there are so many in the health sector. But I think the process is normally administratively done through the department.  Thank you, Minister. I think that goes to the very point that I was trying to make: that so little detail has been provided—and here we are, in March—in relation to so many of the issues that we should have had more information on but dont. Were trying to seek that information. Just for the record, you have corrected the advice that I received this morning from the minister in relation to there being no issues in relation to IT. Clearly that was not necessarily accurate.  I dont believe I said specifically—have any concerns been raised: that was your question to me.","Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment (Medical Device and Human Tissue Product List and Cost Recovery) Bill 2022, Private Health Insurance (Prostheses Application and Listing Fees) Amendment (Cost Recovery) Bill 2022, Private Health Insurance (National Joint Replacement Register Levy) Amendment (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p","Senator RUSTON (South Australia—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) ","(18:26):"

"0","0","0","1","1","Senator Ruston ","ING","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," Okay. So can I ask whether any concerns have been raised either with the minister or with the department in relation to the capacity of the IT changes that are going to be necessary in order for the changes to take place on 1 July? Have concerns been raised or not?   I wasnt here for Senator McAllisters session this morning. My understanding is that there has been a range of implementation issues raised by vendors. If I can get more information for you, I will.  Thank you, Minister. This bill provides for the imposition of a costrecovery levy on each kind of medical device and human tissue product on the list, and the amount of the levy will be set by regulations. Is that correct?  Yes.  From looking at these bills and the explanatory memorandum, there appears to be a significant lack of detail and any other subsequent advice out there in the wider community, which makes it impossible to determine whether the proposed arrangements are going to be consistent with the charging framework. So, first of all, can you guarantee that they will be consistent with the charging framework?  Yes.  On that basis, when will the government be providing the necessary details on those arrangements?  Im advised that the consultation paper will be going out in two weeks.  When will that consultation paper be returning from its consultation?  The consultation will be for six weeks.  Okay. So when will these costrecovery arrangements come into play?  On 1 July.  So they will be returned in the middle of May. How long after the advice, or the consultation information, is returned will we see the detail of those costrecovery arrangements?  My advice is: in June.  In what way is the government intending to ensure that this framework and the way its applied or administered or developed doesnt add additional barriers to patients accessing innovative lifesaving or lifechanging technologies? What is the mechanism of protection to ensure that patient priority is maximised?  My advice is there is no impact on patients from these changes.  Thank you very much. To confirm, have you just advised the Senate that there will be no impact on patients for the changes only in the costrecovery framework or that therell be no impact on patients of these changes?  Of the changes.  My understanding is that there are some quite significant increases to the costrecovery fees in the next financial year through the TGA. Is that correct?

"0","0","0","1","1","Gallagher, Sen Katy","ING","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," Im trying to understand. Youre going to changes by the TGA, which are not part of these bills. Its not clear to me what youre after in relation to these bills. Whats the question thats around the charging framework?   These bills, as part of a package of reforms, seek to change the levies and costrecovery framework around prostheses and the Prostheses List. I put the TGA in there as an example. The TGA changes have a significant impact on the costs of the implementation to the private health sector. Im asking more broadly, in terms of the increased costs to the sector from the changes in this package of bills and the overall reform package thats here, if any concerns have been raised. Has the department raised any concerns about increasing costs that may be associated with the limitation of innovation and time to market of products that sit within implantable devices?  In terms of your question around concerns, well see if we can come back to you with anything useful on that. I am aware that, before the new fees and levies are permitted, stakeholders will be able to contribute through the consultation mechanism, through the usual costrecovery implementation statement process, so there is a process around it as well. Ill see if theres anything further we can provide.  Thank you, Minister. I really appreciate that because, to be fair, all I have heard in the last few months leading to this package of legislation, which was listed a few weeks ago and now has been relisted, is that there has been a lack of consultation and a lack of information. There has been a propensity to say, Dont worry about what youve got here, the outline; well give you the details later. Were standing here today at the start of March. We have started consultation on one part of it that is ongoing. We havent even started the consultation on another part of the really important detail in regulations and requirements that sit behind the overall operation of the changes that are due to come in on 1 July. Then you tell me that people will have the opportunity for consultation. I have to say that my feedback so far has been quite significantly that people feel like they havent been consulted. People feel like they have been railroaded. An example that I used this morning is that the mechanism by which the bundling funding is likely to be delivered appears to have been predetermined by the consultation paper thats gone out, which has three possible scenarios through which the new funding model for the bundling might occur. Clearly, the department has drawn a line underneath it and decided that it wants to do it by facility, despite the fact that the sector has been really clear that it believes that it should be done by procedure. To that end, if the department is so hellbent on the bundling funding model being decided by facility, has the department done any work to understand how that is likely to affect rural, regional and remote Australia? Medical health facilities in those communities are often challenged by circumstances that are quite different from those of larger city hospitals. We know that a lot of private health is delivered in rural and regional areas by necessity. You have said that this consultation process is going to enable the sector to have significant input into the cost recovery framework. Is the department open to consideration of a model that would be based on the procedure that is being undertaken instead of the facility in which it is being undertaken, or has the department already made up its mind about that? Maybe the department can answer through you, Minister. It does strike me that the departments going out with a preferred recommendation doesnt sound very much to me as though the department is prepared to listen to the sector about what they believe, as the people closest to the coalface, is going to be in the best interest of their ability to deliver for their patients.","Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment (Medical Device and Human Tissue Product List and Cost Recovery) Bill 2022, Private Health Insurance (Prostheses Application and Listing Fees) Amendment (Cost Recovery) Bill 2022, Private Health Insurance (National Joint Replacement Register Levy) Amendment (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[32]/talk.text/body/p","Senator GALLAGHER (Australian Capital Territory—Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Finance, Minister for Women, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and VicePresident of the Executive Council) ","(18:37):"

I can ensure you that these stakeholders have been seeking to speak to the Department of Health and Aged Care and the minister. I have to tell you that many of them are extremely disappointed at the lack of access that they have been able to have to both the ministers office and the department, so Im surprised that you would stand there and say that when clearly these people would love to have the opportunity to get access to the department and to the minister. Its something that is just not happening.  I also would say this isnt a contested space. This is not a contested space. The opposition, when in government, was very clear. There was a lot of work that went into getting this reform package together. It was not easy. There were a lot of stakeholders with different requirements, and to try and get this to where it is is a credit to the good faith with which the sector has negotiated with the previous government. It is a situation that obviously was inherited by the new government, who has been in the position to bring this legislation forward. I am merely saying that we have framework legislation that has got no substance to it at all. This is something that is completely consistent with the track record of this government— coming in here and expecting the Senate to vote on something when they dont know the details. Its a bit like: Nothing to see here. Trust us. It will all be okay on the day. You refer to legislative instruments. There are many legislative instruments that, from what I can gather in my discussions, do not even have to come back into this place in relation to regulations that sit under many of the subordinate pieces of activity that sit under this legislation. I think, if youd bothered to wait for a little bit longer and had actually done the work on the cost recovery arrangements and the funding model for those items that were no longer going to be on the list and are going to be contained in general use, and if you had bothered to go and do all this consultation and then brought this piece of legislation back into this place, knowing that the sector had had the opportunity to speak and to provide information more broadly to other members of this chamber—because I know there are many other members of the Senate who would have been very keen to understand what the stakeholders, who are the private hospitals, the suppliers, the private health insurers, the patients and the clinicians, think of the details that sit underneath these changes—it would have given us a great deal more confidence that we actually had got this right. We have got no idea whatsoever whether what sits under this is going to be acceptable to the broader sector. Most particularly, we do not know, because we have no detail, whether it is going to be something that is of overall benefit to patients and whether its going to be something that is more broadly accepted. As an example, I ask you: can you guarantee to us, without any information here about what is included and how the funding model is going to work and the like, that there will be no changes to surgeries in hospitals because they are no longer able to afford to deliver a particular type of surgery because the funding mechanism for the bundling means that the hospital decides that its no longer going to undertake that procedure? Can you give us the guarantee?","Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment (Medical Device and Human Tissue Product List and Cost Recovery) Bill 2022, Private Health Insurance (Prostheses Application and Listing Fees) Amendment (Cost Recovery) Bill 2022, Private Health Insurance (National Joint Replacement Register Levy) Amendment (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[37]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator RUSTON (South Australia—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) ","(18:44):"
"0","0","0","1","1","Ruston, Sen Anne","243273","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," Im going to start repeating myself, because, as Senator Ruston knows, this is a framework bill, so the detail cant be finalised until the framework bill passes, because thats what sets up the legislative framework for the instruments that will then be finalised following consultation, which are all disallowable. In terms of whether or not surgeries can change or wont change or whatever, private hospitals make those decisions all the time based on a range of factors, so I dont think any person in this place could ever say that no surgeries would change at a private hospital, because they change all the time based on a whole range of factors.   Whilst I absolutely agree with you that you need the framework legislation in place before the legislative instruments can be put in place, that doesnt stop you having to find the details of those particular instruments. It doesnt stop you from having undertaken the consultation so the clarity of what will be contained in those instruments and the detail about what will actually happen on the ground is known before the framework is put in place. So, whilst I appreciate the lecture on how legislation works, I dont think I was suggesting for a minute that we put legislative instruments into this place before we had the enacting framework in terms of legislation. I was simply saying that it would have been an entirely respectful thing to finish your consultation with the sector on the details of some very significant implications from changes that have been four years in the making. For four years the sector has been working together to try and come up with this reform package to make sure that Australians are getting cheaper access to implantable devices, that the Prostheses List is streamlined and fit for purpose and that we continue to be able to provide, through the private health system, access to these lifesaving, lifechanging procedures. It would have been respectful to finish the consultation. In some instances, this government hasnt even started the consultation for something that is going to have to be in place by 1 July. It seems like it is rushed. Im sure youre going to move your amendment in a minute. Once again, it seems like weve rushed the legislation in an attempt to tick and flick and say: Weve got this legislation done and out of the way. Dont worry about providing any detail; we can fix it all up later. I really do hope that your categorical commitment that this is not going to have any impact holds true in due course.

I think it will be finalised as soon as possible following the feedback from the consultation.  Will the guide specify details about eligibility for listings under part A, part B, part C—Im not sure if thats the correct terminology, but the different categories or listing levels?  The eligibility criteria will be moved into another legislative instrument, which will also be consulted on.  Can I get a bit of an idea of the time frame? The consultation will come back sometime in the middle of May, and that will be turned into an instrument. Will that instrument list the categories of whats eligible?  My understanding is that the eligibility will be in a separate instrument and that will be consulted on as well, I presume, as part of the whole package.

"0","0","0","1","1","Sterle, Sen Glenn (The TEMPORARY CHAIR)","e68","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," The reason I want to speak to this amendment, which relates to the exercising of the powers by the minister, is that I think it once again speaks absolutely to the fact that we have a piece of legislation that clearly has been rushed in being put together. It hasnt been well thought through. It hasnt been broadly consulted on. So what we find ourselves with here—and this is out of your own explanatory memorandum—is an amendment seeking to require the minister to have regard to matters when proposing to remove a listing from the rules or proposing not to carry out activities in relation to a debtor if there are unpaid fees and levies—because one of the bills that are sitting here actually provides the capacity for somebody who hasnt been paying their levies to have their devices or instruments removed from being eligible for reimbursement. It was very much a blanket requirement in this bill for that to be the case. Nobody had actually sat down and thought about what the implications may well be for the patients.  So what weve seen here is that today, at the eleventh hour, this amendment is being rushed in here. It was rushed in 20 minutes before it might well have been voted on had it not been that there were so many issues that I wanted to seek clarification on. This amendment now requires the minister, in exercising his powers to make a determination where somebody is going to be removed because they have not paid their fees or levies, to have regard to whether the exercise of that power would be detrimental to the interests of insured persons—that is, the patient. So we have this piece of legislation that would allow the minister, without any regard whatsoever for the potential implications fora patient, to remove a particular supplier because of unpaid fees or levies. We know that, in many instances with implantable devices, there are often ongoing requirements for the supplier to continue to provide support et cetera. So here we are. We have a situation where noone actually bothered to think about the impact on the patient. It also requires the minister to determine whether the exercise of these powers will significantly limit the professional freedom of medical practitioners to identify and provide appropriate treatments. So we have not bothered to worry about what the doctors might have thought. So here we are, with this piece of legislation being put through here, with no notice. Id also point out that there was no discussion with us either, clearly with the understanding that we have quite a strong interest in this particular suite of bills. Nobody bothered to tell us. It just arrived here 20 minutes before it could have been voted on, which significantly points out that one of the bills in this package of legislation completely and utterly disregarded the impact it potentially could have on patients and on doctors. Theres a lack of detail. Its policy on the run. Its a bit akin to building a plane while youre trying to fly it. It doesnt always end up terribly well. This government should consider attending to the detail in the first place and making sure that its legislation has been thoroughly consulted on, taking into account all of the implications, not just the implications of the topline stakeholders but looking at who is the most important stakeholder in our health sector, and that is the patient. The government clearly forgot to bother about that here. As weve seen in the discussion Ive been having with the minister, we have no detail whatsoever. It is expected that we are just going to wave this through. I said earlier that the opposition would be supporting this suite of bills because we believe that it has been a long time coming. We must say, though, that we are hugely disappointed, on behalf of the sector, patients, clinicians and doctors, hospitals, private health insurers and device manufacturers, that we have got so little detail here. Once again, we have created a massive level of uncertainty that we have also seen in the agedcare sector. Right now, we have agedcare facilities out there that dont know whether theyre going to be closed down because of their inability to meet the mandated requirements of the legislation that has been pushed through this place, which were impossible to deliver. Everybody knew at the time the legislation went through here that it would not be possible to deliver the mandated requirements because of the workforce shortages. Once again, we dont want to stand in the way of policy reform. We absolutely dont, and we wont. I have to say, putting the government on notice, Im getting sick and tired of coming in here and being expected to ask my team—and Im sure many of the other frontbenchers on this side are sick to death of coming in here and being told, We want you to vote for a piece of legislation. Then they ask you a question about that legislation, because one of their constituents has raised a particular issue, and we have our hand on our heart and say, I dont know what the governments going to do, because theyre not going to tell us what theyre going to do; theyre just expecting us to take this in good faith. As I said, we will be supporting this amendment because the amendment is a good amendment. Im really pleased that the government has actually seen that this is a good amendment. But I just really, really hope that this wasnt the only mistake that was made in the legislation. If there are more mistakes like this one in this legislative package, then we will be in a world of pain. The consequences wont be felt by the government, the opposition or the Greens, or anybody else in this place; the consequences will be felt by the patients of Australia who need medical procedures. Unfortunately, we have a situation with the requirement of the government to push through its legislation and get it off its legislative agenda. Sadly, we are in a situation where the needs and the wants—and, I think, the obligation—that we have in this place, to pass fully informed, good legislation that is in the best interests of the Australian public, have been denied to us because of the lack of clarity and the lack of consultation that has been provided.

Coming here and lecturing us about actually going through a proper process, proper consultation, is not right either. Maybe its the end of a long day, but, Senator Ruston, I think you know the record on this, which was a secret agreement between you and the industry. You signed an MOU, didnt consult with anyone, went out two years ago and didnt implement it. Now were finishing the work and were putting in place appropriate consultation mechanisms through this bill.","Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment (Medical Device and Human Tissue Product List and Cost Recovery) Bill 2022, Private Health Insurance (Prostheses Application and Listing Fees) Amendment (Cost Recovery) Bill 2022, Private Health Insurance (National Joint Replacement Register Levy) Amendment (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[58]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator GALLAGHER (Australian Capital Territory—Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Finance, Minister for Women, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and VicePresident of the Executive Council) ","(19:05):"

I take the point that the finance minister has shared with the Senate this evening that the amendment is in response to the recommendation of the committee. Governments should respond to scrutiny committee reports. I would say, though, that that functions in this place as a failsafe, a last bastion of defence against the unintended consequences of badly drafted legislation. It cant be relied upon, by either side of this place when theyre in government, to pick this stuff up, let alone to ensure that it is actually done. There is a reason, I would hope, that each side of politics strives to get into government. One reason, surely, is to have the resources of governmental departments at its disposal. You would think those departments would be able to pick this stuff up before a parliamentary scrutiny committee would be able to pick it up. While it is true that the government is responding to a report, as it should, the very fact that weve come to this space is quite concerning to the Australian Greens. I would join with the minister in their criticism of the former governments seemingly systemic inability to effectively consult with relevant affected communities. Being in the disability space, Ive experienced a lot of that. However, thats a very low standard against which to judge yourself. I should hope we can raise it just a little bit higher and we can do just a little bit better. In relation to health policy more broadly, we will have the opportunity, either this evening or tomorrow, to really have the rubber hit the road in relation to consultation. We all know that coming up tomorrow is a bill in relation to the Therapeutic Goods Administration. We all know that right now this place is in the middle of negotiations over the implementation of a longfoughtfor recommendation resulting from the Senate inquiry that considered, among other things, the impact of the transvaginal mesh scandal upon women. The No. 1 recommendation of that report was to have a mandatory framework for reporting of faulty medical devices by medical practitioners. It was supported at the time by the AMA, the RACGP and the Consumers Health Forum. We will have an opportunity tomorrow to consider an amendment by the Greens to put that recommendation into effect as a product of consultation with the affected community. We will have an opportunity in that moment to see just where the governments—and indeed the oppositions—priorities lie. Do they lie with ensuring that Australians are never again subjected to the humiliation and pain of a faulty medical device inserted into them, used upon them, and yet never reported to the relevant authorities, or will we see this government say: That sounds like itll be a bit too much to ask of medical professionals. Even with a oneyear leadin, I think thatll be a bit too much. I think we might just have to wait, even though it has been however many years since that inquiry reported. I am well aware that there are individuals in the AMA who are lobbying this evening against the proposed Greens amendment in this space. I say to them: shame on you. You submitted in support of such a proposal when the inquiry took evidence. To the others in other parts of the health sector who are holding the line tonight: thank you. To those in this chamber keeping an open mind to this amendment: thank you. We keep alive tonight the possibility that this place might put in the work. It might require government departments to do their job and to not just reflectively accept the moaning of peak bodies who dont like having something sprung on them even though this has been waiting in the wings for years. I agree with the minister. The coalition government was absolutely abysmal when it comes to consulting with community, particularly in health. This is your opportunity to do a bit better.

"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," Im pleased to be able to stand today to make a contribution in relation to the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2022 Measures No. 1) Bill 2022. This bill amends the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 to implement a number of measures that seek to ensure continued access to critical prescription medicines. We will be supporting this bill in recognition that it continues the work of the coalition and our very strong commitment to ensuring affordable medicines for all Australians and strengthening our worldclass health system, of which Australians are rightly very, very proud. This bill will also support the safe use of therapeutic goods by strengthening postmarket monitoring and compliance.  The need to safeguard patient safety and ensure the early detection of adverse events related to medical devices was emphasised as long ago as during the 2017 Senate inquiry. It is absolutely imperative that, whenever we put legislation through this place, first and foremost, we put the safety of patients at the forefront of all of our decisionmaking. In 2017, the Senate inquiry followed an investigation of medical devices that were developed in the late 1990s which had later reported widespread complications with patients. We heard Senator SteeleJohn before refer to a particular incident and inquiry in relation to the adverse impacts of a particular device that had absolutely devastating and quite widespread consequences for the women who were implanted with that device. But, from that inquiry, recommendation 1 noted that adverse event reporting plays a vital role in a postmarket surveillance and proposed a scheme of mandatory reporting by health practitioners to prioritise health safety. It is obviously very important that we continue that work. Consequently, this bill introduces a framework for mandatory reporting requirements for hospitals to report adverse event information, supporting improved monitoring, early detection and timely action to safeguard patients from harm. There were a number of other recommendations that were included in that report, many of which I hope that the government will have a look at implementing over time. As I said, were very happy to support this important piece of reform legislation, which is absolutely putting patient safety at the centre of its intention. The bill will also make a number of amendments to improve requirements, codify current practices and remove certain provisions from the legislation. The bill will also introduce a dedicated marketing approval pathway for export only biologicals to support the important export market for Australians. I dont know that many Australians actually realise how huge the export market is or the kind of respect that Australian biologicals have in the international marketplace. This bill will ensure that we have a system that allows our fantastic Australian based manufacturers to be able to get easy access to a world market so that they can continue to provide worlds best practice when it comes to these particular products. It will also enable the Department of Health and Aged Care to approve the importation of overseas prescription medicines that are substitutes for medicines which have previously been approved in Australia, assisting to relieve supply shortages. Sadly, at the moment, we have significant supply shortages, particularly for medicines, so this seeks to remedy against that. The coalition absolutely supports the intention of this bill to ensure continued access to potentially lifesaving and lifechanging and lifeimproving medicines for Australian patients. However, more can and must be done to safeguard accessibility to critical health care for Australian households currently facing significant costofliving pressures. Recently, it was reported that the outofpocket costs for general practice consultations have risen to $60 for some practices, and the cost to fill a prescription has also risen quite significantly, at the same time as weve seen increases in things like energy bills and mortgage payments, and everybody knows that when you go to the supermarket the bill at the checkout is significantly higher than it was. Action to ensure continued access to critical health care must include a plan to relieve these significant cost pressures of living, which are only continuing to rise as we stand here today. This is why the coalition has been so concerned by recent notification of the governments decision in relation to a lifechanging medicine, Fiasp, which is currently on the pharmaceutical benefits list—this particular drug is an insulin product. Its a new and innovative product that was listed in 2019, I believe. Over 15,000 Australians who have access to this particular product rely on it to manage their diabetes and their symptoms and alleviate the conditions and consequences of this. The former coalition government listed this product on the PBS in 2019. That ensured affordable access to this fastacting insulin for diabetic patients. But now it appears as if access to this product will no longer be available in Australia. That means those 15,000plus people who have been relying on this innovative product will no longer be able to get access to these scripts. This puts extraordinary costofliving pressure on them because, if they are no longer able to meet those requirements or get access to it, the costs of other product options are significantly higher. Its not only important that we look at ways in which the government can continue to supply critical medicines for Australians that rely on them. They must also make sure that those medicines are affordable and Australians can continue to have access to them, because the reliance on those medicines in this healthcare system is so important. The coalition were really pleased to have listed over 2,900 new or amended medicines on the PBS during the time that we were in government. This came on top of a 2012 admission by the previous Labor government that theyd had to stop listing medicines because they couldnt afford to list them. I hope the decision in relation to Fiasp is not one that will signal the return to new medicines not being listed and existing medicines coming off the PBS because they cant afford to continue to list them. I absolutely want to reiterate that the coalition supports the necessary intention of this bill, and that is to strengthen the safe use of therapeutic goods and to support continued access to critical medicines. We do have concerns with some elements involved with this legislation, and we are particularly concerned by the way schedule 10 of this bill removes the natural justice hearing rule regarding publication of certain product information by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Product sponsors currently have access to natural justice prior to the proposed publication of information by the TGA, providing them with an important opportunity to respond to potentially damaging allegations made by the TGA in relation to their products. Removing this provision would deprive product sponsors of access to that natural justice before the product information is published, which could have potentially serious implications for these providers. It is also absolutely an underlying principle of this nation that natural justice is something that should be afforded to everybody. For this bill to seek to deny that natural justice to an organisation without the appropriate recourse that should rightly be afforded to them is a significant oversight. Obviously, we are particularly concerned about that, and we are hopeful that the government intend to rectify that. By removing this provision we deprive the product sponsors of access to natural justice. While we support the need for the TGA to be able to urgently publish information relating to critical safety issues that significantly affect public health, this bill, in its current form, also allows the TGA to publish efficacy and quality related information where there is no corresponding urgency. For these reasons we are keen for the government to amend this particular bill and to make changes to schedule 10 to only relate to the release of information on issues that relate to safety. On behalf of the coalition, I am more than happy to say that we will be happy to support this bill, although obviously were very keen to make sure that the amendment to schedule 10 is moved.  The Greens are broadly supportive of this bill; however, I flag here that we will be moving a number of amendments as circulated to the Senate. The Greens particularly welcome that the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2022 Measures No. 1) Bill 2022 has come from recommendations as a result of many people across the country sharing their really horrific experiences with the Senate community affairs inquiry into transvaginal mesh implants and related matters. Before I get to the end of my allocated time tonight and get cut off, I want to acknowledge the energy that it takes to share your lived experience with a Senate committee. And I want to thank the committee—including the then chair, former Greens senator Rachel Siewert—for their work in developing the recommendations that have led us to this point. The impact of transvaginal mesh for women was devastating—absolutely devastating. As quoted in the inquirys final report: [W]e believe this is a catastrophic failure of the health system to protect women and ensure they have access to safe health care. We feel that women have been let down by their doctors, by the manufacturers of mesh and by the TGA as the regulator. Those are the keywords I want to keep in peoples minds—a catastrophic failure of the health system to protect women and we feel that women have been let down by their doctors, by the manufacturers and by the TGA. Now, the decision that will come before this Senate tomorrow will be whether we answer those calls with action—actually implementing the recommendations of the inquiry. So many gave their time and energy to generate those recommendations for a full mandatory reporting framework, not the halfbaked halfmeasure the government is putting forward this evening in the form of its definition of what healthcare facilities should or should not have to report. Let me state this clearly: the report really did not mince its words. All medical practitioners, as defined in the act, should report. They should report to keep people safe. The Greens will be putting forward an amendment tomorrow to give effect to that recommendation.

"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," In 1977 a group of French leftist intellectuals signed a petition for children to be able to legally give sexual consent. Now, there are some sections of society that have wanted to lower the age of consent for decades, seeking to characterise it as legitimate sexual orientation. Today, these same people argue for the use of the term minorattracted person to replace the term paedophile. Why? Because the term paedophile, they say, carries with it too much stigma.  We cannot allow this movement to gather steam. We have to close the loop on this now, and on those who seek to normalise this behaviour. But unfortunately the filthy underbelly of leftist academia has other ideas, with one academic from Columbia University writing: If paedophiles are no longer forced to live underground and to be secretive about their relationships, but instead their desires are recognized as legitimate, and they are guided towards a responsible expression of their desires, we might prevent some cases of genuine sexual abuse. This recognition is cloaked under the pretence of preventing abuse. But anyone with common sense knows that the realworld impact of recognising these desires as legitimate will actually be the opposite. Its a trojan horse. Many dismiss the concept of the slippery slope, yet it gets proven true time and time again. Weve seen it with euthanasia, COVID restrictions, climate alarmism and so on. The patterns predictable. People like me express concern and get ridiculed—and a short period of time later, those predictions come true. A recent SBS article described a dragqueen storytime event in Sydney that was protested. Counterprotesters chanted, Love is love. Now, what does love is love have to do with grown men dressed in womens clothes reading to children? Why the focus on a childrens event? Can anyone explain that? Can anyone explain why a Mardi Gras mural in Sydney featured a man in a BDSM outfit wearing a teddy bear mask? How about the Balenciaga photographs featuring children with stuffed animals in bondage? Rest assured, something is deeply wrong with our culture. In the United States, babies and toddlers are being exposed to grown men dancing in Gstrings in strip showstyle performances, and it wont be long before that behaviour makes it to our shores and we will be told its just a colourful bit of fun for the kids. I expect that sooner or later well be having discussions in this place and in state parliaments all around the country about lowering the age of consent, and those who oppose it will be called all sorts of colourful names—prudes, bigots, reactionaries. Well be mocked for being discriminatory against minorattracted persons and not sensitive to their feelings. Then, again, well be saying, I told you so, while the Left celebrate their socalled progress. We live in a society thats attacking the innocence of children and the sanctity of the family, which is the foundation of our society. Without strong families with a loving mother and father, society falls apart. Today children are bombarded with sexual concepts from all sides, and parents are often illequipped to deal with it. Our children deserve to be protected. Yet the political class and the passive apologists of this nation are failing them. Australia, be warned: you are witnessing the precursor attacks designed to lower the age of consent and normalise the sexualisation of children. I, for one, will fight it with every fibre of my body, and I suspect that millions of Australians feel the same away. To those who are listening out there, I say: rejecting this behaviour is the right thing to do. It doesnt make you a transphobe; it doesnt make you a homophobe. If men want to dress in womens clothing, thats their business. But stop trying to sexualise the children. Leave the kids alone.","Age of Consent","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[1]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator ANTIC (South Australia) ","(19:30):"
"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I rise to speak about a recent visit to Hillwood Berries farms, at Hillwood in northern Tasmania. Hillwood Berries is a national supplier of strawberries, raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. You will often see these wonderful Tasmaniangrown products in Coles and Woolworths across the country. The Dornauf family are proud Tasmanian farmers who have built a strong business that plays an essential role in agriculture and farming across Tasmania. I visited their farm gate with the Minister for International Development and the Pacific, the Hon. Pat Conroy, to announce reforms to make skills training more accessible, flexible and affordable for Pacific Labour Mobility—PALM—scheme workers and their Australian employers.  Hillwood Berries employs over 550 workers from the AsiaPacific, mostly Tonga and Samoa, as part of this scheme, and they continue to return to Tasmania annually, strengthening ties between our nation and the region, improving their familys opportunities and social mobility at home. Hillwood Berries is a great employer. It has a 70 per cent return rate of workers. Once they work at Hillwood Berries, so many islander workers return again and again. The efficiency and success of this workforce is also building fulltime equivalent positions within the business. Consequently, Hillwood Berries is going from strength to strength, with their Bundaberg operation growing to the point where they can now supply berries nationwide all year round. I spoke to many of the workers at Hillwood, and they all have inspiring stories. Rufina represents just one of those special stories. When she picks berries, she counts the number of punnets she picks to know how many bricks she will be able to purchase that day to build her house back home in TimorLeste. Every two hours of work at Hillwood translates into one stone to build her familys new house. Such stories are a great example of what this scheme is all about. Labour mobility is a powerful way of supporting economic development in the Pacific. Onethird of Pacific islanders live on less than $1,000 per year. In contrast, the government estimates that the average PALM scheme worker in Australia sends home between $1,000 and $1,300 every month theyre working here in Australia. We have 4,200 PALM scheme workers in my home state of Tasmania right now, making a valuable contribution to their home economies and filling critical work shortages in Tasmania. Across Australia there are more than 35,000 PALM scheme workers filling workforce shortages in regional Australia and sending valuable earnings to the Pacific and TimorLeste. In a region where more than onethird of people live on less than $1,000 per year, longterm PALM workers send home on average $15,000 each, boosting Pacific economies and lifting families out of poverty. I note the comments of Hillwood Berries General Manager Simon Dornauf: PALM scheme workers are critical for businesses such as ours but they are also a long way from home and its vital that we support their development and look after them as best we can. Workers are making such a valuable contribution both here and at home and they bring so much to this business and community in our part of Tasmania. We regularly receive photos of houses the workers are building at home and the improvements they are making to their lives. Pacific workers are making such a valuable contribution both here and back in their own communities at home. Theyre putting food on the table of Australian families and they are the backbone of agriculture in Tasmania right now. They should be celebrated. We thank them for their work. We thank them for enriching our communities. And we thank them for what theyre able to contribute back in their home communities to help raise the living standard of their community members. This is a great scheme. Its one that has been improved by the Albanese Labor government. I want to again place on the record my appreciation for Minister Conroy making that visit and allowing me to join and have the opportunity to not only meet many of these workers but hear them sing and dance for us. It was very moving. I want to thank the Dornauf family for what theyre doing in helping to build relationships between the Pacific islands and Australia, as this Labor government is doing.","Tasmania: Hillwood Berries","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator POLLEY (Tasmania) ","(19:34):"

I wondered how many senators today in this chamber were also aware that in just two weeks time, on 20 March, we have the 20th anniversary of another illegal, immoral and unethical invasion of another country, which our nation shamefully participated in: the invasion of Iraq.  I said in my first speech to the Senate that, one way or another, that event was a major part of my journey to being in the Senate that night. Id never been so angry about anything in my life as I was when our nation participated in that war of aggression. And I wasnt alone. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in Australia. Millions took to the streets around the world. It was the biggest protest seen in Rome at the time and, indeed, in London. There were half a million people in Hyde Park in Sydney, where Simon Crean, the Labor leader at the time, spoke out against this war. But, nevertheless, even though there was this groundswell of foreboding and fear and anxiety that we were going to get dragged into a war that didnt need to happen, it happened. The people were ignored. And we were right. We were right about our fears and our concerns, because this conflict is still being felt today, nearly 20 years after it was initiated by the socalled coalition of the willing. Hundreds of thousands of people were directly killed, many of them innocents, in this war of aggression. There was instability across the entire region for over a decade, including the Syrian civil war. The invasion of Iraq and the insurgency gave direct rise to Islamic Sate and more global terrorism and, ultimately, to a wave of millions of refugees, a wave of human misery, across Europe following this conflict. And what did we achieve from it? More importantly, what have we learned from it? On Saturday 18 March and on Sunday 19 March, there will be two rallies for peace in this country: a big one in Melbourne on Saturday the 18th, which I will be attending, at the State Library at 1 pm, and one on Hobart Parliament Lawns on Sunday the 19th. I know there were many Australians that participated in protesting this war who must feel very strongly about this. I also know there are a lot of young Australians who dont remember the Iraq War or the leadup to the Iraq War, but one of the reasons we have to remember is that the media played a really big role in taking us to that war. And I do want to say I was horrified at the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age this morning: Australia must prepare for the threat of a China war. And it clearly just wasnt me who was horrified. Former Prime Minister Paul Keating said today that this article represents: the most egregious and provocative news presentation of any newspaper I have witnessed in over 50 years of active public life. … … … the extent of the bias and news abuse is, I believe, unparalleled in modern Australian journalism. He goes to explain why this is so dangerous and that our media are either complicit or actively beating the drums for war. Recently the UN SecretaryGeneral said we are not sleepwalking into another global conflict, given whats happening around Ukraine and with NATO and the threats and tensions in our region involving China, we are eyes wide open walking into another global conflict. This is the last thing we need. What we need to do is remember that, while the media may have largely failed us, one media outlet didnt, and that was WikiLeaks. The only truth teller of the Iraq War, Julian Assange, is sitting in a maximum security prison. Noone else has been brought to justice because of this illegal war, and its time we came together on the 20th anniversary, in two weeks time, to remember and remember why this must never happen again.

"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," If you were to assign a symbol that would recognise human ingenuity and encapsulate the technological advancement of our society, what would it be? A plane or a car? Perhaps a computer, or something that might appeal to our younger generation? A smart phone? I want to make the case tonight for something a little bit humbler, a bit more traditional but, nonetheless, remarkable, the windmill. Whether its for milling grain, pumping water, milling timber or generating power for our cars, computers and smart phones, windmills have many uses.  When you think about windmills, you would be forgiven for thinking that theyre better known as an icon of Holland, but hear me out. My home state of Tasmania also has a strong connection to windmills, and one in particular. When you travel around Tasmania there are many landmarks you can see. If you are travelling to Hobart on one of our major highways, theres one landmark that might just stand out a tiny bit more than the rest: Callington Mill at Oatlands. This mill is the oldest operating Georgian mill in the Southern Hemisphere. It was built in 1837 and has been an integral part of the villages history. Callington Mill has had a turbulent past. Its ups and downs have been inextricably tied to the ups and downs of the Oatlands economy itself. Five years ago it was reported that Oatlands was not riding the wave of success that other regional towns across Tasmania were. Despite the mill having undergone a refurbishment of over $2 million, tourists were not stopping. The supermarket, shops and other tourism businesses were at a standstill. They were losing money, and some had even closed their doors. But, in the fashion that has become exemplary of Tasmanians, Oatlands has been quietly undergoing a transformation thanks to the dedication of its community leaders. This transformation is in no small part thanks to the revitalisation of Callington Mill. A nod to the villages history, the mill has become a thriving tourist hotspot, complete with distillery, restaurant and playground. The site also offers heritage tours to ensure history will never be forgotten. It was a site that had been lost to the relentless march of time, but what owner John Ibrahim and his team have done is to create a new vision and future for the mill without erasing its historical significance. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate them on this remarkable achievement. However, while what has been achieved at Callington Mill is incredible, its only one small part of the villages transformation. Along with the Callington Mill development, Oatlands has also recently opened a $10 million aquatic centre, and the Southern Midlands Council is also working on a project to establish an $18 million boutique hotel. The proposal, from THN Hospitality, which currently operates the Old Woolstore Apartment Hotel in Hobart and Hadleys Orient Hotel in Hobart, would result in a 43bedroom hotel and associated retail infrastructure. This rebirth has been driven, in part, thanks to the ingenuity of businessmen and entrepreneurs and also by the Southern Midlands Council, who have reinvented the town for tourists and for its residents. That laser focus on the future has paid off in dividends for Oatlands. The village was recently announced as the Keep Australia Beautiful Tidy Towns state winner for 2022. Oatlands will compete against all the other state winners at the national awards to be held on King Island—another Tasmanian success story—later this year. Keep Australia Beautiful state judge Lona Turvey noted the number of initiatives to improving the financial and social wellbeing of the community and noted not only the financial developments but the enormous impact of the towns volunteering community. One example of that is the highly successful Heritage and Bullock Festival, which injects about $280,000 dollars back into the community. Ms Turvey also recognised the Callington Mill destination playground as a perfect example of how the council valued the opinions and needs of the community to help it grow. The playground was developed with the input of Oatlands District High School students and has opened to great fanfare and much pleasure from young people. The Callington Mill is the symbol of Oatlands. Its used in the towns wayfinding sign and branding, and its rebirth has heralded a new future for that quaint village to ensure any visitors who are travelling past will stop. This towns evolution deserves an accolade, and I want to take this opportunity to wish Oatlands well in the national Tidy Towns awards later this year. Congratulations to the Oatlands community. All of Tasmania is behind you when you represent our state on the national stage.","Tasmania: Oatlands","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[4]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator ASKEW (Tasmania—Chief Opposition Whip in the Senate) ","(19:44):"

Is it possible to really communicate what it feels like to someone whos never been through it? Ive spent the past few weeks talking to people up and down the chain of homelessness: people who are in the middle of it; people whove been there and come through the other side; people who run support services; and people who build crisis accommodation. Homelessness can happen to anyone. It could be you or me—people with a job; a family. If something happens—maybe theyve split up with a longterm partner and theres no family home anymore—they cant afford rent on their own. They think its just for one night, but that night turns into another and another. Where are they supposed to go? One night youre sleeping in your bed, the next youre out on your own—no bed, no shower, no food, no water, and no idea where youll sleep tonight—no idea where youll sleep tomorrow night either. Just last week, I was speaking to someone whos been there. She told me that you hear all the stories about homelessness and you think it will never happen to you until one day youre out in the cold. You sleep in your car with nothing but the clothes on your back. She told me that, until youve been there, you dont know what its like, so I tried it. Now I cant know exactly what it feels like, but I slept for one night in a park, and it was bloody awful. Im lucky, I had somewhere safe, sound and secure to go to the morning after. People in Tassie sleeping rough dont have that. It was 11 degrees the night I slept in my car, and thats pretty warm for Tassie. But my car is a Jeep. It doesnt have an insulated roof, and that makes it seem a lot colder than it is. I cant even imagine how brutal sleeping in your car in a Tassie winter would be. And what if you dont have a car? Temperatures in Tassie get really cold, and Im a bit of a softy when it comes to it—cold is cold. I made sure to park in an area with a lot of light so I could see who was coming and going in every direction. But that didnt stop me from jumping at noises. I tried sleeping in all the seats—front seats, back seats. The front seat was definitely better, I can tell you. I picked a car park where I thought there was an open bathroom. It turns out theyre locked from 5 pm to 5 am. There is only one 24/7 public toilet in Launceston. The experience reaffirmed what I already knew: nobody chooses to do this; nobody wants to be in this position. People do this because they dont have any other option. I spent the last 20 years of my life talking to people at different stages of homelessness: my employment services clients who couldnt afford to rent on their welfare payments and people who came to Jacquis office desperate and crying because they had nowhere else to go and they felt the system had let them down. A lot of the time I felt that I had let them down. Id call Housing Tas for them, I could tell them where to get food vouchers and groceries and I could give them the numbers for some crisis accommodation. But I couldnt put a stable roof over their heads. Thats why Im standing here asking the government to guarantee a minimum of 1,200 homes for Tasmania from the Housing Australia Future Fund. But 1,200 is not enough. Twelve hundred homes will barely scrape the sides. There are 4½ thousand people on the housing waiting list in Tasmania at the moment. Were putting a bandaid over a gaping wound that needs stitches. But its a start, and without this guarantee well only get about 600 homes. That means well be going backwards. The Housing Australia Future Fund will build 30,000 homes. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2022 housing assistance report says Tassie has four per cent of the countrys population with the greatest need for housing. We have four per cent of the need and we are asking for four per cent of the homes. Ill say this: if the fund doesnt build houses where theyre needed, whats the point of the fund? If the minister will not guarantee that the fund will build homes where homes are most needed, what the hell are we doing here? The housing minister is a Tasmanian. Julie Collins is in the other place because the people of Tasmania elected her to represent them. She knows just how bad things are in Tasmania right now. Shes seen it firsthand. Is she really going to stand up and say Tasmania shouldnt have these homes? Twelve hundred homes of 30,000 homes is a pretty reasonable ask. Its our fair share based on the governments own statistics, and the balls in the governments court right now. Its up to them to decide if theyll help staunch the bleeding or rip the wound open, so thats my message to the government. If you need my vote—if you need our vote—Tasmania needs homes.","Homelessness","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[5]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator TYRRELL (Tasmania—Jacqui Lambie Network Whip) ","(19:48):"

Providing the conditions for safety and prosperity should be No. 1, but we know thats not the case for this Labor government.  Its been nearly two weeks since a senator from South Australia, my colleague Kerrynne Liddle, who was born in Alice Springs, highlighted the plight of an Aboriginal family living on a concrete slab in town. The family left the Utopia community, northwest of Alice Springs, and made the 300kilometre journey to Alice Springs, seeking health care and support for a 30yearold woman with thirdstage kidney failure. These are good people. Theyre not drinkers. Theyre not gamblers. They dont cause problems. They send their kids to school. They try to set a good example and they try to do the right thing, but theyre still living on an open concrete slab with nothing but a tarp for protection in the harsh Alice Springs weather. It got up to 38 degrees over the weekend and down to just 14 degrees at night, but in winter it can get below zero at night. Theyve had nothing but a tarp. It should be considered a national shame that in this country we have families left to live unsheltered on a concrete slab, but, as far as this government is concerned, out of sight equals out of mind. Two weeks they have known about this and nothing has been done to help the family. I ask: why arent they a priority for the Labor government? Why arent they a priority for the member for Lingiari? Why? Its because the member for Lingiari is more focused on Labors Voice. Thats Labors priority, but I assure you its not a priority for the members of the family or anyone like them in the Northern Territory. Ignoring the voices of her own constituents crying out for help, the member for Lingiari and her Labor colleagues claim to want to correct a system that she believes discriminates against Aboriginal Australians. Whats more discriminatory than neglecting the urgent needs of Australians right now so you can use their plight for political gain while campaigning for your own selfinterest? Whats more discriminatory than ignoring Indigenous Australians while telling the rest of the country that they have no voice? Where are the government funded service providers? Theyre there to help people in need, but they dont seem to notice the problems. How sad is it that when service providers like Congress and Purple House drop patients off at a concrete slab it seems completely normal? How sad is it that they dont advocate for better housing for these patients? When Tangentyere Council were asked about the situation, they didnt even know who they were talking about. Why are they taking millions of dollars of taxpayer money if they dont even understand the makeup of town camps? Referring to them as rough sleepers is outright dismissive and disrespectful. This is a family living together, doing the right thing, sending their children to school. Australia doesnt need a voice. We just need people to do their jobs. We need the local members to do their jobs. We need the bureaucrats to do their jobs. We need the taxpayer funded service providers to do their jobs. Two hundred and fifty million dollars was promised by this Labor government to Central Australia, to Alice Springs. They can make a promise of funding, throwing cash about, but they cant address the immediate issues, the crisis right now on their doorstep. Do we know where this $250 million is going to go? Do we know how its going to be spent? The Territory government have demonstrated for some time that they do not spend wisely. They spend everything in Darwin. They spend where they want to support their supporters, not on vulnerable people like this. We need the government, democratically elected, to stop looking the other way, to stop passing the buck and to actually get on with the job.","Northern Territory: Housing","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[6]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator NAMPIJ INPA PRICE (Northern Territory) ","(19:54):"
"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," Sometimes the happenings of New South Wales politics are so deeply dystopian it seems like it couldnt really be that bad. Surely, youd think, no serious adults could behave like that, but then the curse of Macquarie Street strikes and everybody in New South Wales says: Please, not again; let it stop!  A classic case of the Macquarie Street curse is the Design and Place State Environmental Planning Policy. This started as a good news story, announced by then planning minister Rob Stokes in December 2021. It was that superrare New South Wales case of a proposed planning law done well, one that recognised the importance of climate resilience for new homes. It wasnt revolutionary, but it proposed a few environmentally sustainable reforms that would have done supersensible things, like preventing blacktiled heatsoaking roofs on new developments in Western Sydney, requiring new builds to be more energy efficient to reduce energy costs, and putting a few eaves on buildings so that houses are kept cooler in summer. Its simple, positive stuff thats good for the planet and good for anyone moving into a new house. Then along comes the curse. In 2021, Premier Perrottet put the notoriously antienvironment Anthony Roberts in as the new planning minister. The rest, as they say, is history. A few days after the fateful appointment, billionaire developer Harry Triguboff, the owner of Meriton Group, wrote to the New South Wales government complaining about the Design and Place SEPP. The developers lobby, who cemented themselves together as the Urban Taskforce, were also unhappy. They said it might be good for new homeowners and the planet, but it would impact their profits. Coincidentally, their property industry and Meriton are big donors to the Liberal and National parties. In 2022, the Liberal and National parties took $3.2 million in donations from developers. In New South Wales, Meriton gave the Liberal and National parties at least 200 grand in political donations in 2021 alone. They all just love democracy, it seems. When developers pay and come knocking on government doors, meetings are made available and policy change is on the table. Roberts met with the Urban Taskforce on 15 February and the Property Council on 2 March. It turns out that he had another critical meeting in April. The Greens used the powers of the New South Wales parliament to force the release of documents about what happened to the SEPP, and the findings were grim. The property industry undermined the government architect, undermined good policy and pushed the right buttons. Then, on 5 April 2022, this one bit of decent law reform was scrapped by Minister Roberts. Heres the kicker: it turns out that on that exact same day, the planning minister, Minister Roberts, met with Meriton Group to discuss planning matters, according to his now public ministerial diary. So whos the real planning minister in New South Wales? Its not Anthony Roberts. Hes the tool of the developer industry. Lets acknowledge that the one calling the shots is Harry Triguboff, not his mortgaged puppets sitting in Macquarie Street. Of course, this isnt the only threat to good planning that Mr Triguboff poses. He now has his sights set on beautiful Little Bay in Randwick City Council, planning to override the master plan for that community using the Liberals appalling Rezoning Pathways program. If his Lane Cove puppet is still planning minister after 25 March, then heaven help Little Bay. Good governments are not afraid to give people information. Good governments should not be afraid of FOI, because they know that transparency fosters democracy and public engagement and drives good decisionmaking. Its not a surprise that the former coalition government systematically eroded the FOI scheme, creating a damaging culture of secrecy and coverup. It certainly wasnt a good government. They did this through systematically starving the agencies, whose job it was to make FOI work, including the Information Commissioner, of the funds they needed. The Abbott government was particularly blatant about this, when, in its first budget, it abolished both the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and the Freedom of Information Commissionera position that was vacant for seven years. Roll forward to 2023, well into the first year of the new Albanese government, and the FOI Commissioner has quit just one year into a fiveyear term. The resignation comes as a result of years of whittling away at information access schemes and his office being starved of the funding needed to do its job. This was a statement of exhaustion and frustration delivered to the new Labor government, and it should trouble anyone who cares about open government. Its a public indictment of the current system, highlighting the urgent need for an immediate funding injection to deal with the problems allowed to build up under the former coalition government. This is a test for the Albanese governmentfund FOI, support transparency, support good government.","New South Wales Government","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[7]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator SHOEBRIDGE (New South Wales) ","(19:59):"
"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," Last week, I did something that the Prime Minister of Australia still hasnt bothered to do. I visited the Western Australian northern Goldfields towns of Laverton and Leonora. The people of these towns are crying out for our help. They are crying out for their voices to be listened to.  There are many contrasts on display in these places. In Laverton, I could hear the unmistakable joy emanating from the community swimming pool as kids played after school in the cooling water. Its without a doubt a sound that warms your heart and brings an instant smile to your face as youre walking past. Sadly, that joy stands in stark contrast to the very different screams locals told me they hear as night begins to fall. It is a more confronting chorus that greets them time and time again. You can hear the screaming and the wailing, and you know whats going on; its horrible, one local, new to the town, told me. I heard a series of devastating stories about life in Laverton and Leonora. There is clear evidence in both towns that the Albanese governments abolition of the cashless debit card has been a disastrous policy failure. In Laverton the present situation of a dramatic increase in alcohol consumption, assaults, domestic violence and general antisocial behaviour was described to me by one Indigenous leader as being like a speeding car going backwards. The locals can pinpoint the descent as having started in November of last year, directly after the cashless debit card was abolished in October. The local shopkeeper has the evidence in his sales figures. The sales of meat and vegetables have dropped significantly, and his biggest selling items are now noodles and coke. The kids are no longer being fed properly, if at all. People who were previously on the cashless debit card now withdraw up to $2,000 directly from the ATM in one hit to spend mostly on booze. Laverton shire president Patrick Hill told me how, as well as cartons of beer, locals are now buying bottles or even cartons of spirits and drinking it like coke. He showed me a picture of a woman who had been brutally bashed and kicked by her partner on the street for over an hour outside the shire chamber. It was sickening. The night before I was in town another woman was stabbed by her partner, and the police were running an operation to locate the alleged offender. Emergency respondents say they are continually seeing women who have been bashed because of alcohol fuelled violence. Police in both towns do a brilliant job but are run ragged dealing with the violence and antisocial behaviour. Well over 90 per cent of all their work can be directly attributed to the abuse of alcohol. They are dealing with people addicted to alcohol on just about every job they attend. A worker at the Leonora Community Resource Centre listed a catalogue of issues that have arisen since the cashless debit card was abolished, including people presenting as drunk or stoned and saying that theyre hungry and adult children hacking into their parents accounts, draining the cash and leaving them destitute. With all funds now available as cash, they now spend it quickly with nothing left for food and other necessities later on. Designated carers and single mothers whose payments used to go into the cashless debit card are now spending most of their money on drinking and then looking for food handouts. The clear message from both towns is that the cashless debit card was not perfect and didnt solve all the problems but it made a big difference. Now that it has been abolished, things have gone back to how they were before it was introduced. One Laverton local said to me, Anyone who thinks it didnt work has rocks in their heads. Leonora shire president Peter Craig said: As well as quarantining 80 per cent of their money that could not be spent on alcohol, the card also helped teach those on it a better understanding of money, how to budget and how to pay bills. Some of that knowledge was being passed on from the women to the young people in the community. Much of those gains have now been lost as family members use cash to buy booze, and its all gone before the bills can be paid. Many of the kids, who are dealing yet again with the consequences of drunken adults and unsafe environments at home, are no longer going to school or are attending much less frequently than in the past. There is a fear in both towns that suicide will again become an issue in the district, as it was before the cashless debit card was introduced. Indigenous leaders that I met with in Laverton are very clear that alcohol is the scourge of their community and they need help in dealing with it. They all agree that alcohol is not culture. They have strong views about the sale of alcohol and the controls that could be put in place but reluctantly accept it is a legal product being sold by legitimate businesses. Their biggest concern is for their people, who they say are dying at an alarming rate. They all know others who are on dialysis because of the damage done by their alcohol addiction. It is well known that the publican in Laverton has, at the request of police, imposed his own restrictions on sales when things have gotten dangerously out of hand, which they have on a number of occasions. Minister Rishworth yesterday in the other place blamed an increase in the issues in these towns on an increase in the number of people travelling to these towns from the NG Lands and spending miningroyalty money. I can say to the minister: if you go and visit there, the locals will tell you that this is only part of the problem—and part of the problem that has always been an issue. The biggest change, however, has been the Albanese governments ending of the cashless debit card. The presidents of both shires have written to the Prime Minister setting out a way forward and pleading for his assistance. They want the assistance to enhance the welfare of Indigenous people in both towns and also the transient population coming into their communities from the NG Lands, an area that makes up about three per cent of mainland Australia. The plan they set out in their letter covers improved community safety and cohesion by expanding youth engagement and diversion programs, job creation, better services, addressing the issues caused by alcohol, investment in families, and oncountry learning and education. They have specific ideas in each of these six categories and have worked on costing each idea. They are requesting a total investment of $81 million across both towns over five years, which could be split between the federal government and the Western Australian state government. So far their letter, written on 20 February, has not even been acknowledged by Prime Minister Albanese. Most of all, when I was there, their message was that they just want the Albanese government to listen to them and to hear their voices. They think the Prime Minister should visit their towns and see firsthand what is going on and what they are going through. Thats what the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, did; thats what local federal member Rick Wilson did; and thats what I did. The Albanese government should immediately restore the cashless debit card in these towns. Thats what these towns themselves—the voices on the ground, the people who can directly see the impact of the withdrawal of the card—are pleading for the Albanese government to do. Just because it was an election promise to get rid of the card doesnt mean the government should persist with a policy that, on any analysis, is a complete failure. Further to that, the Albanese government and the McGowan state government need to listen to the voices of the people in these towns. These are the people who know, every day, as the afternoon sets in, that thats when the trouble starts. These are the people who every day, just before the bottle shop opens, see the queues in the streets. Look at what these people are asking for. Theyve written it. Theyve put it in black and white to you, Prime Minister. Do something to stop what is without a doubt a catastrophe playing out in these remote towns. I know, just as the Leader of the Opposition, Peter Dutton, knows and just as the local member there, the member for OConnor, Rick Wilson, knows, that we want to be able to return to Laverton and Leonora in years to come hear the joy of kids playing in the streets and see the kids being properly fed, not wandering the streets and wondering where their next meal will come from because their parents have withdrawn the cash, as they can now do, and have literally spent it on booze and consumed it. My fear, though, is that the Albanese government is just not listening and that there wont be many left, and all the joy in future years will be gone.","Pensions and Benefits","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[8]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator CASH (Western Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) ","(20:04):"
"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," In 2015 the residents of Footscray, in the western suburbs of Melbourne, secured a curfew on heavy trucks from the Andrews Labor government. Footscray is my home, so I know what a huge win this was for the local community. It was a triumph for grassroots and community campaigns. Massive trucks powering down our residential streets have caused massive problems of diesel pollution and noise through their sheer bulk dominating the streets. And they endanger peoples lives. Yet, eight years later, the Andrews government has failed to adequately enforce and monitor the curfew, and Footscray residents continue to be appallingly impacted by the continuous presence of heavy trucks and road trains. The massive problems of these massive trucks continue.  About 25 road trains use Footscrays Moore Street every day to deliver material to the West Gate Tunnel project, as well as around 2,000 other trucks. Despite a statement in 2018 by the Premier that material for this project would be delivered by rail freight, Footscrays streets have become a major thoroughfare for road trains and other heavy vehicles delivering material to the West Gate Tunnel project. Disappointingly, a growing number of these trucks have exemptions from the government to access residential streets in the area. These trucks have a huge negative impact on the wellbeing and health of this community. Constantly breathing in diesel pollution from dirty vehicles is bad for peoples health. A recent study by the University of Melbourne found that air and traffic pollution likely claims more than 11,000 Australian lives every year. And I have heard countless stories from residents who have been woken in the night by the loud noise of trucks turning or accelerating through their streets. Many people have told me how difficult its been to get the children to sleep through the night, and others have shared how theyve begun to experience ongoing sleep deprivation. Even more alarmingly, not only are these heavy vehicles disturbing the sleep and hearing of residents of Footscray but they are endangering the lives of pedestrians and cyclists. Just a month ago, a 22yearold cyclist, Angus Collins, was tragically killed by a truck on Footscray Road at an intersection that was made incredibly dangerous by the construction of the West Gate Tunnel. My heart goes out to his family and friends. I recently heard from Elizabeth, a local resident, who was nearly run over by a truck while walking to school with her son. She told me that, while turning left from Moore Street in Footscray, the truck mounted the kerb and came so close to her and her son that she could have touched it with her hands. Elizabeth told me that the experience left her feeling angry and disempowered—angry that her son cant walk to school safely and disempowered by the broken promises of the Andrews government to the Footscray community. I am also angry. I was elected to the Maribyrnong City Council 20 years ago this month, and a big part of my council election platform was campaigning about trucks. The community has seen little to no change regarding heavy vehicles in the decades since. It is so wrong that cyclists are still being killed by trucks and that Elizabeth is worried about the safety of her kids walking to school on the very same intersection on which I was worried about my kids walking to school 20 years ago. The community have been stonewalled and stymied, with minimal action being taken by the state government in that time. The Footscray community fought hard for the truck curfew in 2015, and it should be upheld. I call upon the Andrews government to adequately enforce the truck curfew, to immediately end all exemptions given to heavy trucks and road trains during the curfew hours in Footscray and to fulfil their commitment to transport material for the West Gate Tunnel project by rail. I also call upon the federal government to pressure their Labor colleagues to take these actions, to introduce tough new federal pollution standards for heavy vehicles and to put in place measures to rapidly shift freight transport to rail and to hydrogen and electric trucks to help my fellow residents of the inner west of Melbourne and, indeed, people across the country to live safe and healthy lives. As Ive done many times in this place, I would like to talk about the crucial need to raise income support, particularly after hearing evidence from our latest poverty inquiry hearing. Being forced to live in your car or in a tent while your government delivers tax cuts to those on over $200,000 a year is not okay, but this is the reality for those hit hardest by the Lismore floods. I recently visited Lismore to chair the fifth hearing of the yearlong Senate inquiry into the extent and nature of poverty in Australia. Over 3,000 homes in the Lismore area were impacted by the 2022 floods, and more than one year on our inquiry heard harrowing reports of locals still camping in tents in their backyards, couchsurfing, or living in cars or in pod villages. We heard about the kindness and the care of strangers and community organisations who selflessly uplift those in need in the absence of government support. The resounding issue that has been raised in these inquiry hearings is meagre income support payments. The inquiry heard from Nimbin resident Chibo, who shared his experience over the last few years: I must say, Ive never felt so mentally tortured as when I was unemployed, starting with Centrelink treating you like youre the last dirt from the street. Just coming into the whole situation … really impacts on your lifestyle, on your nutrition level, on anything. As soon as something goes pop which wasnt being calculated for, like if you have a car and you have one tyre problem or something, thats $50 to $150 … That just throws you out while you were maybe saving up for getting the fridge repaired or something. It is such a stressful state. On Centrelink payments he added: We are really making people sick—thats my opinion—by having them on such a small amount of money. Sadly, we heard the same thing in Lismore as weve being hearing at every poverty inquiry hearing to date. People are struggling to keep a roof over their heads and they need help to make it through this costofliving crisis. To those who are still doing it tough: please know that we hear you and well continue to fight for you inside and outside the parliament. Between low wages, having no affordable housing, and starvation payments of around $47 a day for people on JobSeeker, communities across the country are facing dire financial circumstances. That is why the Greens are pushing Labor to invest $5 billion a year in public and affordable housing and to raise the rate of all income support payments to $88 a day in the May budget. We need action, not words. Poverty is a political choice—a choice that continues to be made by this Labor government. These people in our community have been punished by 10 years of a callous coalition government. As we saw in the budget last year, they will continue to be chastised by a Labor government who profess to speak for the people. I am calling on Minister Rishworth, Treasurer Chalmers and the Labor government to financially support people who have been forced into poverty—forced into something that is out of their control. The government has the power and the ability to lift the rate of income support above the poverty line. Finally, I want to note, in the time remaining, that Friday marks Tibetan Uprising Day, which commemorates the 1959 Tibetan uprising that ultimately resulted in a violent crackdown on Tibetan independence movements and in the flight of the Dalai Lama into exile. The Chinese government have continued their attacks on Tibetan people and culture to this day. Peaceful protests in Tibet have resulted in people being arrested, including monks. We have a broader pattern by the Chinese government of oppressive actions against Tibetan organisations and people. Ive consistently noted my concerns about the disappearance of the Panchen Lama. I will continue to push, here in the Australian context, that we recognise only a Dalai Lama appointed by Tibetan Buddhist traditions and practices, without interference by the Chinese government. To the people of Tibet and to Tibetans around the world: we are in solidarity with you and with everyone facing injustice and human rights violations. We urgently urge the Chinese government to immediately cease its violations of human rights in Tibet, and we call upon the Australian government to advocate at the highest level for human rights in Tibet and around the world.","Victoria: Heavy Vehicles, Pensions and Benefits, Tibetan Uprising Day","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[9]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator RICE (Victoria) ","(20:14):"
"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," I rise to speak this evening in relation to the Labor governments review of religious educational institutions and antidiscrimination laws, which, to be frank, has become an absolute car smash—an absolute train wreck. The evidence that was presented before the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee during estimates was absolutely gobsmacking.  Before I provide some particular comments in relation to the state the Labor government has gotten itself into with respect to this review, I first want to talk about the importance of freedom of religion. Freedom of religion is one of the key individual freedoms: freedom of speech, freedom of association and freedom of religion. Its a freedom that isnt just exercised by an individual. Its a freedom that is exercised in community, and it is well and truly accepted as a matter of international human rights law that people have a right, in community, to practise their religious faith freely. That includes religious schools. In the last parliament, I participated in the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committees review of the proposed legislation from the Morrison government. During that process, my door was open, and it will always remain open to everyone who has views with respect to this issue. That committee conducted itself, in my opinion, in a very balanced and reasonable way, in obtaining the viewpoints of all stakeholders, as it should. Hence, it is extraordinarily disappointing to see the feedback that has been provided from people of faith in relation to the consultation paper issued by the Australian Law Reform Commission entitled Religious educational institutions and antidiscrimination laws, released in January 2023. I first want to refer to a media release issued by the National Catholic Education Commission. It should be noted that the National Catholic Education Commissions executive director, Jacinta Collins, served in this place for some 21 years. Whilst Jacinta Collins served on the other side of the aisle, I deeply respect her contribution to this place. One would reasonably expect that a person with that experience, when they go to print on matters like this, would do so having carefully considered the issues. The media release of 31 January 2023 is entitled: Proposed reforms to discrimination legislation would make it impossible for Catholic schools to be Catholic. Thats a media release from one of the largest providers of religious faith based schools in Australia. To quote further: At the National Catholic Education Commission meeting today, our educational leaders across Australia were very concerned by the narrow approach taken in the ALRC paper. The proposed reforms fail to provide real protections for religious schools to effectively operate and teach according to their religious beliefs and ethos … Ms Collins said the review has been limited to exemptions in the Sex Discrimination, Fair Work and other Acts and does not address the need for protections for religious rights in Australia. Changes to antidiscrimination laws … must go handinhand with proactive legislation to protect religious freedom. International law recognises protections to establish religious educational institutions and the right of parents to choose a school for their children that is in line with their religious values and beliefs. In a pluralist society, Catholic schools should be free to be Catholic, Ms Collins said. I agree wholeheartedly with that proposition, that Catholic schools should be free to be Catholic, just as Anglican schools should be free to be Anglican, Muslim schools should be free to be Muslim and Jewish schools should be free to be Jewish. That should be a fundamental, important basis for a pluralist society, bearing in mind that many people of many different faiths have come to this country. Theyve come to this country from lands where they couldnt practise their religious faith, whether individually or in communion. I again quote from the media release of the National Catholic Education Commission: This is an important tipping point for faithbased schools in Australia … We need to find a fair and reasonable balance to ensure staff and students are not discriminated against on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital or relationship status or pregnancy, while enabling faithbased educational institutions to continue to express their faith identity, ethos and values. That is a very measured and balanced view with respect to this topic, the right of Catholic schools to be Catholic. Subsequently, another letter was received. This letter was sent to the Hon. Mark Dreyfus, our AttorneyGeneral, from a range of faith leaders—again, with respect to the consultation paper. It was sent by the Right Reverend Dr Michael Stead, Anglican Bishop of South Sydney. It was cosigned by leaders of many faiths—the Catholic faith, the Anglican faith, the Greek Orthodox Church, Muslim schools, Presbyterians, Adventists, Australian Christian Churches. There were pages of signatories. This is what they say: The Paper proposes that the right of religious schools to preference people of their faith in the selection of staff be strictly limited only to those teaching roles where the teaching, observance, or practice of the religion is a genuine requirement of the role, having regard to the nature and ethos of the institution. Thats what the ALRC consultation paper proposes. They then say: For every other teaching role, it would be become unlawful for the school to give preference to employing teachers who share or are willing to commit to supporting the religious beliefs of the school. And they go on: Faithbased schools in Australia have long been free to give preference to employing staff who share or who are willing to support the faith and beliefs according to which the school is conducted. They do not seek the right to discriminate on the basis of a protected attribute, but simply to be able to employ staff who share or are willing to uphold the religious beliefs of the school. Whats unreasonable about that? Thats balance, from my perspective. What has brought these faith leaders, education leaders, to write in these terms? Its the fact that they consider the Australian Law Reform Commission paper, which was released in January 2023, is not a balanced document. Its not a balanced document, and it stands, in my view, in stark contrast to the religious freedom review that was the report of a panel of five experts—not one expert but five experts—including the current president of the Human Rights Commission. During Senate estimates I was told: Senator Scarr, its a consultation paper. Were getting feedback on the consultation. Isnt that how its meant to work? The problem is that, when you start from this point, the religious faith leaders, important stakeholders in our community, now have absolutely no confidence in the process. It has become a train wreck. They have no confidence in the process. This is the starting point. It appears like a fait accompli, and so theyve lost faith in the process. The letter from the religious faith leaders dated 13 February 2023 to the Hon. Mark Dreyfus MP said: Having carefully considered the proposals in the Consultation Paper we are doubtful that the ALRC process can reach any balanced outcomes, as contemplated by the terms of reference, by starting with these proposals. We agree with the comments from the National Catholic Education Commission that the proposed reforms fail to provide real protections for religious schools to effectively operate and teach according to their religious beliefs and ethos, and that if the proposed reforms were adopted it would be a major blow to authentic faithbased education in Australia. Thats the situation were now in because the Labor Party embarked on a consultation process which was a farce. They started with a fait accompli and the consultation—I call it consultation; it has been very direct consultation—process has failed. This will be an albatross around the neck of the AttorneyGeneral, Mark Dreyfus.","Freedom of Religion","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[10]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Senator SCARR (Queensland—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) ","(20:23):"
"0","0","0","1","1","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A"," In my capacity serving the people of Queensland and Australia, I note that during the last Senate estimate hearings, Adjunct Professor John Skerritt, Deputy Secretary, Health Products Regulation Group within the Department of Health and Aged Care, with responsibility for the TGA, commented with clarity previously lacking in three years of health officials testimony—finally the truth. The Therapeutic Goods Administration, our TGA, did not check patientlevel clinical trial data for the mRNA vaccines. Instead, it used documents that Pfizer supplied and modified after the United States Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, requested it. Its now very relevant to ask: how diligent was Americas Food and Drug Administration, the FDA—thats Americas equivalent of our TGA—in overseeing drug approvals?  On 2 November 2021 the British Medical Journal, BMJ, published an article titled Covid19: Researcher blows the whistle on data integrity issues in Pfizers vaccine trial. Ill quote from this article about whistleblower Brook Jackson reporting on the Texas trial sites: A regional director who was employed at the research organisation Ventavia Research Group has told The BMJ that the company falsified data, unblinded patients, employed inadequately trained vaccinators, and was slow to follow up on adverse events reported in Pfizers pivotal phase III trial. Staff who conducted quality control checks were overwhelmed by the volume of problems they were finding. After repeatedly notifying Ventavia of these problems, the regional director, Brook Jackson, emailed a complaint to the US Food and Drug Administration. Ventavia fired her later the same day. Jackson has provided The BMJ with dozens of internal company documents, photos, audio recordings, and emails. These were provided to substantiate her allegations. Brook Jackson used FDA whistleblower provisions—and a lot of good that did her, because the FDA dobbed her in to Pfizer anyway. She was fired, and her complaint was ignored—start of coverup. Minister, on 16 November 2022 the British Medical Journal published an article titled FDA oversight of clinical trials is grossly inadequate, say experts. In recent months a court ordered release of documents surrounding the FDAs approval of Pfizers vaccine confirmed Pfizers malfeasance. The documents are known as the Pfizer papers, the FDA contested their release to the public. It wanted this information kept secret for 75 years. The Pfizer papers show the FDA knew or reasonably should have known at the time of approval that the clinical trials were incapable of supporting an approval. Let me say that again: the Pfizer papers show the FDA knew or reasonably should have known at the time of approval that the clinical trials were incapable of supporting an approval. Pfizer then did this: their USA and European trial sites were getting so many adverse reactions that Pfizer had to cheat and at the last moment added 26 new trial sites in Argentina, recruiting 467 doctors almost overnight to create 44,000 new glowing patient records, overwhelming the legitimate bad data. In Argentina some sites and many patients do not appear to exist. Adverse events were hidden, and patients who were harmed or killed were removed from the data. Thats what the United States Food and Drug Administration rubberstamped, and thats exactly what the TGA rubberstamped. And now every day Australians are dying. I know people are tired of this whole thing. One Nation is as well, yet there is a far larger issue that has gone without comment, that is too monstrous to simply let go. It relates to why the TGA refused to have anything to do with an Australian developed conventional attenuated virus vaccine that would have been safe to use. Queensland university discontinued their conventional vaccines on spurious grounds with real conflicts of interest. This opened the door for an entirely new class of drugs and supposed vaccines, mRNA, medicine by gene editing. This was not about Australian patient health; it was about patents. Over the last 15 years 47 marketleading drugs have aged out of patent, costing pharmaceutical companies $30 billion a year in lost sales, including drugs that made up to 42 per cent of Pfizers drug revenue and 62 per cent of AstraZenecas drug revenue. This patent cliff is set to get worse, with another 15 drugs—nine of the worlds 20 topselling drugs—due to expire this decade. Pfizer will face losing another $15 billion in annual sales. The only way to replace so much revenue is with a whole new class of drug: mRNA. Four hundred mRNA drugs are currently in development. The manufacturing plants in Australia are already under construction, before the drugs have been tested. The problem for big pharma was how to get these radical geneediting drugs accepted. Coincidentally, along came COVID—a miraculous opportunity to use the new, untested mRNA gene editing. The heavens aligned to wave mRNA technology through for humans and animals, untested, with no debate or scrutiny. We now have an explosion of patient death reports and patient harm reports on the database of adverse events notifications, including 940 deaths before doctors gave in to Ahpras blackmail and stopped reporting vaccine or injection deaths. The actual deaths from COVID19 injections are known to be grossly underreported due to Ahpras threats to doctors and nurses. In 2022 there were 22,000 more Australian deaths than usual, and our health bureaucrats cant tell us why. Half are unexplained, and the other half are supposedly people for whom the mRNA vaccines did nothing—but led to their death. Yet the pharmaceutical industrys future is now secure for a generation. That, Minister, is a crime this government refuses to investigate. Health bureaucrats lies and government deceit directly and indirectly killed thousands of people. Thousands of Australians are dead. Bureaucrats lies destroyed millions of lives and livelihoods. Unless the Albanese government takes prompt action it will be complicit with the Morrison governments crime. One Nation calls on the government to immediately enact a Senate select committee inquiry to identify the scope and terms of reference for a royal commission into state and federal governments gross mismanagement of COVID.  If theres one thing Ive learnt in my 3½ years of being a senator its that, if anyone thinks that this country is being run by the people in this chamber or in the other place, they are kidding themselves. It is run by the bureaucrats. Lets be honest: thats much too nice a term; theyre really autocrats. These people are accountable to noone. Weve been fooled with this Orwellian language that theyre an independent statutory authority and, because theyre independent, theyre going to be pure as driven snow. I dont think Ive been to a set of estimates yet in the last 3½ years where Ive ever had a bureaucrat actually come out and give me a straight answer. Quite frankly, Im sick and tired of it, so tonights all about the last set of estimates and the number of lies that were told by Dr John Skerritt. Im going to go through those lies bit by bit, right now. The first one is a real doozy. When asked by Senator Roberts whether or not he would apologise to the people who died from the vaccine, Dr Skerritt said that since the beginning of the COVID pandemic more than 10 times as many people had died from paracetamol or Panadol as from adverse events due to COVID vaccines.

"0","0","0","1","1","MemberContinuation","283596","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Senator RENNICK: I will continue. As Ive just quoted, Professor Skerritt said there were 10 times as many deaths from paracetamol and Panadol as there were from the COVID vaccines. So, upon returning to my electorate office, I thought Id check this particular quote out. It turns out there were only 52 deaths on the DAEN, the Database of Adverse Event Notifications, website since 1 January 2021, which is the same period that the COVID vaccines have been available. Twentyfour of those vaccine deaths were as a result of selfharm and nearly all of the remaining vaccines were in concurrence with other drugs. Given that there have been 975 reported deaths—and that varies between 975 and 978—according to Professor Skerritt there should have been 9,000 or so reported deaths from paracetamol. I note that Professor Skerritt is more than happy to take every reported death from paracetamol as an alleged death but not do the same for COVID vaccines, so hes also applying double standards. Whichever way you look at it its an egregious statement.  The second thing I wanted to pick him up on is a statement that I dispute or on a figure that was misleading was that, when I asked why he made a statement at a press conference that Moderna would provide 100 per cent protection from death, he insisted that he was quoting a study. Ive gone back and Ive looked again at the transcript from when he gave that press conference and this is exactly with what he said—he was referring to the release of the Moderna vaccine: Its highly efficacious. And of course, we can build on widespread global experience. So in the US alone, there has been over 140 million doses of Moderna used. The other really encouraging thing about Moderna is even after six months, its proving to be 93 per cent efficacious against any infection, 98 per cent against severe disease and 100 per cent against death. And thats really exciting. Hes quoted from 140 million doses administered in the US. He was not quoting from a trial. So, again, I will say that he was definitely misleading. I would consider that, given Ive raised this with him in questions on notice, he knew exactly what he was saying, and he shouldnt have said what he said. The other thing that was particularly disturbing was that, when I asked why he didnt put a warning label on the vaccines to warn people who had antiphospholipid syndrome and advise them that the vaccines hadnt been tested for people with autoimmune diseases, he quoted a study from Rheumatology magazine that effectively said that vaccines were safe for people with antiphospholipid syndrome. So I went and looked up that study in the Rheumatology magazine, and it turns out that that study was conducted on the Sinopharm vaccine—a Chinese vaccine—which is a protein vaccine. So thats completely different. Protein vaccines are completely different to mRNA vaccines. An important distinction is the fact that the mRNA vaccines are encased in a lipid nanoparticle, in which there are four lipids—an ionisable lipid, PEG, cholesterol and a phospholipid. Given that there are phospholipids in the vaccine and because the lipids actually cross the cell membrane—biochemistry students will know from Biochemistry 101 that the cell is a membrane made up of a lipid layer of phospholipids—the phospholipids around your cells are also impacted by this vaccine, because of the pathway it uses. So his quoting a study that relied on the Sinopharm protein vaccine and not the mRNA vaccine is again very misleading. Another question that was posed to him earlier in the afternoon was about whether or not cardiac arrests were a side effect of the vaccine. That was a question because Professor Skerritt admitted that you could have myocarditis from the vaccine, and it turns out that, in some cases, myocarditis can lead to cardiac arrests. It can cause a lot of lifetime pain. I was on the phone yesterday for 40 minutes to a doctor who was saying its actually a subclinical condition. I had never heard that term before. What he said was its like an iceberg. He said a lot of people dont experience any pain with myocarditis and then theyll suddenly pass away if theyre not aware of the condition that theyve got. That is unlike pericarditis, which is a heart muscle issue but actually has external pain, so you can feel it, and thats often the reason why people are going to the hospital—because they can feel that pain. Myocarditis can actually be subclinical, and you cant always feel it. To put a long story short, yet again, he has tried to downplay the risks of the vaccine by not acknowledging that cardiac arrests are a side effect of the vaccine; you cant say that myocarditis is but cardiac arrests arent. The other one Id like to refer to is a statement that he made about 12 months ago, but I think its worth raising again. He said that the lipids in the vaccine are like the lipids that you eat in the sausages that you have for breakfast. It turns out that, in December last year, a very diligent and persistent lady managed to get an unredacted copy of the Pfizer nonclinical report, and we were fortunate enough to get pages 17, 18 and 19 unredacted. Theres some interesting stuff in here. Youve really got to ask yourself why it was redacted in the first place, given that it was particularly pertinent to the risks that this new vaccine had. What is interesting is that, at the bottom of page 17 of the unredacted statement—and you wont see this on the website at TGA FOI 23896, because the unredacted version hasnt been put up yet, even though it should be—the Pfizer Nonclinical evaluation report actually says that novel excipients are used in the vaccine. Novel means new. So for Professor Skerritt to claim that the lipids used in the vaccine are the same as the sausages that you eat for breakfast is completely misleading, again. As his own document, submitted by Pfizer to the TGA, said, two lipids out of the four lipids in the vaccine—this is quite a complex biochemistry chemical arrangement here—are brandnew. So, yet again, why has he misled us about this? There was another statement that I asked about as well. This wasnt just Professor Skerritt; a number of people have said this. They said that the vaccine stays in the tops of your arms. If you go to page 44 of this particular document again, the Pfizer Nonclinical evaluation report, you will see that the concentration of lipids in just about all body organs was still increasing after day 2, before they stopped the trials. It doubled in the ovaries. The concentration of lipids in the ovaries doubled from day 1 to day 2. That in itself should have been a red flag, because women are born with one set of ovaries and they have one set of eggs in there. Theyre called oocytes. They stay with women throughout their lifetime. So, if it gets into the oocytes, thats going to cause problems down the track, I can assure you. Professor Skerritt replied that the concentration of lipids decreased in the body. But that wasnt the question that I asked. I asked why the concentration of lipids increased in various body organs. Yet again, he has deliberately misled. This matters because it comes back to the whole point about the 978 reported deaths, of which the TGA claim only 14 have been a result of the vaccine. Professor Skerritt is trying to override these reports of deaths, of which approximately 70 per cent come from medical professionals and 50 per cent come from state governments. Given that Professor Skerritt and the TGA havent examined the patients—havent examined the body—and that in many cases autopsies havent been done, why is he overriding the expert opinion of people who have actually examined the patient or the body before they passed away? If he cant tell the truth about all these other things, how do we know hes telling the truth about deaths reported to the TGA?
