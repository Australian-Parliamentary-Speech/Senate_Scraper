I know that the Minister is deeply interested in it. I know also that it is causing him a lot of worry, and that no one will be more pleased than himself if he can at last arrive at a solution of the many problems which have vexed, not only himself, but also the public of Australia, in connexion with this institute: I should like to know if he has any information to give to the Senate?

Senator Kingsmill was quite . correct in saying that the Institute of Science and Industry has caused me some worry and anxiety. For some time the Government, realizing the great importance that science must play in the development of Australia, has had on foot various inquiries into the operations of the institute. Incidentally, I may say that I have received a great deal of valuable assistance and many useful suggestions from Senator Kingsmill. A special subcommittee of Cabinet has been appointed to see whether or not a good workable basis can be arrived at. We have been fortunate in having the services of Sir Frank Heath, who has been travelling throughout Australia investigating very carefully, for the guidance of Cabinet, the problems confronting various States. His preliminary report came to hand a few days ago, and Ministers are now awaiting his full report covering the whole of the Commonwealth. But the Government does not intend to delay action until that is received. It is already taking steps to reconstruct the institute, and place it on, as Senator Kingsmill suggests, a proper workable basis. In the course of a few weeks Sir George Knibbs will complete his term of appointment as director of the institute. I am sure that every one appreciates the work he has done; but the Government is anxious to enlarge tha scope of the operations of the institute. I trust that honorable senators will remain patient a little while longer. In the course of a few days 1 hope to be in a position to submit to the Senate an outline of a workable basis for the institute, which Ministers believe will prove of advantage to the country.

I think the Government ought to be censured for its extravagance on several of the items of expenditure covered by this vote. For instance, I notice that the Institute of Science and Industry has been very lavish in its expenditure in connexion with the hop industry. It has spent £1 on it. I hope that that will not occur again.  I trust that the institute will be more careful, and that it will not indulge in lavish expenditure of this description.  There are many industries in Australia into which the institute could make further research. No one who has watched the operations of the institute has been very satisfied with the amount of work hitherto accomplished. As an honorable senator suggested yesterday, it might very well have proceeded with investigations into the shale oil and fishing industries. Australia imports millions of gallons of petrol every year, although we have in this country potential supplies of oil that might supply the whole of our requirements if proper methods of utilizing thom were ascertained. Better work could be done in that direction than by wasting our efforts in straining to give a kind of fictitious encouragement to industries already established. We have a Tariff Board at work, but the only thing that it can prescribe is continuously higher and higher duties. On the other hand, if we applied a little more scientific research to many of the problems associated with our primary potentialities we should make far greater progress. With Senator Kingsmill, I hope that the institute will be given a. little more impetus in the direction of making further researches into the problems confronting us. I was pleased to hear what the Minister (Senator Sir Victor Wilson) had to say in that connexion. So far I do not think we have obtained value for the money spent. At any rate, I hope that the institute will not continue spending such exorbitant amounts as it spent last year on the hop industry. Senator Sir VICTOR WILSON (South Australia Minister for Markets and Migration) [11.13]. I remind Senator Ogden that, according to their own statements, the difficulties of the hopgrowers of Tasmania are not capable of being handled by the Institute of Science and Industry. Their chief difficulty is to market their produce. I have been told by deputation after deputation that Tasmania can grow hops equal to any in the world, and that they are doing it. Therefore, there is no need for us to provide any sum of money for the Institute of Science and Industry to investigate the hop industry. There are, however, certain features in connexion with the industry in which the Department of Markets and Migration is playing a very important part. Quite recently it divided £22,000 among the hopgrowers of Tasmania, and it has made an advance of about £20,000 on Tasmanian hops now in England. I can assure Senator Ogden that my department is as anxious as he is that the very best should be done for the producers of his State.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL 192526","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Institute of Science and Industry has been making investigations in different directions for a long time, with a view to helping established industries and assisting in the launching of new industries. If there is one commerical activity that should be encouraged by the Government and the Parliament it is the newsprint industry. The institute has been making inquiries into the possibility of successfully launching this industry, and it has been demonstrated beyond doubt that newsprint can be manufactured here, from Australian material, equal to any that can be produced in any other part of the world. All doubts on that point were removed by those associated with the Amalgamated Zinc Company, which, having secured options over big timber areas in Tasmania, had the wood tested abroad by experts, and proved that the newsprint could be commercially produced in Australia. The institute, in a measure, having helped those associated with the proposal, and the money of the shareholders having been expended in that direction, one would have thought that the Commonwealth Government would give some substantial measure of assistance to an industry which, according to the prospectus, and according to those who were closely associated with the proposal, would give employment to 5,000 persons. The Government, however, merely offered a bounty, which was not worthy of the name of a bounty, and there was also a binding, stipulation that the dividends in connexion with the industry should not exceed 10 per cent. Are such conditions imposed in connexion with the establishment of any other industries in this country?

What is to be said of a Government or of newspaper proprietors who profess to believe that high protection means prosperity to the Commonwealth, but who, because they want cheap paper,, oppose the establishment of an industry  that would prove one of the most important in this country? The request of the newspaper proprietors was, apparently, acceded to. The paper used in wrapping parcels every little bag in which children buy lollies if not made in Australia, carries a duty of 40 per cent. And so with practically all paper other than newsprint. But, according to this socalled protectionist Government, a duty on newsprint would be unwarranted. What is the use of fooling with the peoples money, and asking the Institute of Science and Industry to make inquiries into the possibility of establishing new industries when the Government is indisposed to give assistance where it is deserved? The statements I have made should be seriously considered;, and no opportunity should be lost for the establishment of the newsprint industry. I hope that the Tasmanian senators will speak today.

It is essential that our electoral legislation should be . fully and completely reviewed, to obviate, as far as possible, a similar experience in the future.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","THOMAS, Josiah","K8L","NEW SOUTH WALES","NAT","N/A","306",". I am glad the question of the informal votes case at the last election has been raised. Between 70,000 and 80,000 electors in New South Wales voted informally. I have previously suggested that the returning officers should be asked to state the reasons why votes were declared informal. I have no fault to find with the returning officers of New South Wales. When  returning thanks after my reelection, I said I was satisfied with the way the people had voted, with the work of the returning officers, and with the way the Labour party had conducted its campaign. I am inclined to think that returning officers would stretch a point to make a vote formal rather than informal, so I am not, therefore, blaming them for the large number of informal votes. With 70,000 informal votes in New South Wales, there would probably be 3,000 in each constituency. It would be easy to examine the papers and to lot the people know why the votes were informal, so that candidates at the next election would be able to explain where electors had erred. In some places in New South Wales cards were issued by the National party asking the electors to vote 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 for the National candidates, but not advising them how to vote for the remaining candidates. Some electors voted, ai advised, for the National candidates, but left the rest of the card blank. If the reason for the informal votes is made known it will be possible at the next elections to obviate a repetition of some of the mistakes made last time. I am not very keen on the appointment of the proposed committee, although I raise no objection to it. I am satisfied with the existing system. Either minorities or majorities must rule, and I believe in majorities ruling. The great objection that I have to the present system is that it requires 500,000 votes to return a senator for New South Wales, while in Tasmania 25,000 or 30,000 votes will, return one.

The last statement of the Minister (Senator Pearce) indicates that I was somewhat premature in the conclusion I formed regarding the scope of the proposed select committee. I understood the right, honorable gentleman to mean that the committee would inquire into not only the conduct of the recent election, but also an alternative method of electing the Senate. The Minister now tells us that it is a matter for the Senate itself, and not for a joint committee of both Houses, to propose any alteration of the law in respect to the election of the Senate, and I, therefore, ask him if the method of electing the Senate will be reviewed by the Government or by the Senate itself prior to the next election with a view to seeing whether or not an alteration should be made.

T am sorry to hear the Minister say that (he proposed inquiry into the electoral system will not include an investigation into the method of electing the Senate. It seems to me that there is not very much wrong with the system of electing members of the House of Representatives, but that there is something very seriously wrong with one which gives no representation in this chamber to a party that may poll 45 per cent, of the total votes throughout the Commonwealth. In 1910 no Nationalist was elected to the Senate.. During the war the reverse happened. With one exception all the senators elected belonged to the Nationalist party. Again at the recent election, although 45 per cent, of the people voted for the Labour party, not a single candidate of that party was elected to the Senate. I can say quite frankly that it does not matter to me whether there is in the Senate a Labour or a Nationalist majority, so long as we get the best men who will carry out the real intentions of the Constitution, and not sacrifice this chamber to the needs of party organization and party propaganda. There is something decidedly wrong with an electoral system which denies to a section of the community polling nearly 50 per cent, of the votes any representation in the Senate. It tends towards discrediting this chamber. Of course, that might suit the wishes of some honorable senators, who sometimes say, although certainly in a very low tone of voice,  The Senate ought to be abolished. I suppose they are all hoping it will not be abolished until their term expires. I am a believer in the proportional system. I think the Senate ought to be elected on a proportional basis, and later on in the session I think I shall submit a motion to ascertain the views of honorable senators as to whether or not some such system should not be applied to the election of senators. The present method cannot be defended except on the ground of party advantage and party interest. It was designed by the present Minister for Home and Territories expressly for the purpose of enabling parties to run any number of candidates without prejudicing the chance of a party victory. It is based on the old unfair, and inequitable system of  first past the post. The present New South Wales Labour Government cannot claim to be democratic, because it is proposing to go back to the dark ages and adopt the  first past the post  method. An electoral system should be designed to give the electors the best and freest opportunity to elect the most suitable men, irrespective of party, but our present system is designed to secure advantage to the party, which is just what Mr. Lang is doing in New South Wales by proposing to revert to the old block vote. It is a reflection on our democratic institutions, and on this National Parliament that we still retain the block vote for electing senators. I ask the Minister (Senator Pearce) whether, even at this hour, it may not be arranged to have the method of electing the Senate considered, and whether we could not have a joint committee of both Houses dealing with the whole problem.

I am not blaming Senator Ogden, because I was almost tempted to voice my humble opinion on the matter he raised, but I refrained even from good words. On page 280 of the schedule. Division 110,  Under control of Home and Territories Department, an item of £3,000 is provided for forestry research. It is a significant fact to me that so important an item as this finds such a humble place in the Estimates. I had hoped that it would have a special division to itself. However, I rise first of all to congratulate the Government on what is being done, and, secondly, to ask if the Leader of the Government in the Senate is in a position to give us any idea of what will be the future forestry programme. We know that a good deal of work has already been done by the Commonwealth in this direction, and I am pleased that it should be so. Senator Sir Henry Barwell, when speaking, referred to the tendency there is for the finances of the States to become more difficult, and those of the Commonwealth to become more easy. The outcome of this is that in many of these subjects, such as forestry and others, following the example found necessary in the other great federations of the United States of America and Canada, the money necessary for research which might have been spent by the States will be spent by the Commonwealth. Some time ago the Commonwealth Government appointed an extremely able officer to take charge of its forestry research, and I think it has every reason to be satisfied with the work he has done, but it is time that our operations were a little more amplified. I take it that it will first be necessary to pass a Forestry Bill, in order to define in the case of the Commonwealth, as in the case of the States, the duties, responsibilities, and, above all, the qualifications of the officers whom it is necessary to employ. There are plenty of forestry operations which need to be carried out by the Commonwealth. The Territories are increasing in number and importance and in their demands for proper development. The subject of a forests school at once jumps to ones mind. The necessity for having such a school is exemplified by the fact that when we look round the various forestry departments in Australia we find that out of six State departments four are controlled by men who have had no forestry training. This renders the position a little more difficult. Nearly all the trained experts in forestry, strange to say, are now situated in the Commonwealth Forestry Department or in the Forestry Department of Western Australia, whose legislation precludes the employment of any one in a responsible position in the Forestry Department who is not trained in forestry. I hope that when the federal bill is. brought in it will form a feature of the Commonwealth legislation. Of course it need not be brought in unless the Commonwealth Government desires, as I hope it does, to give some degree of permanency to this department. I know that the Minister for Home and Territories (Senator Pearce), who is in charge of this department, and the Prime Minister (Mr. Bruce) himself, take a lively interest in the subject. It would be their wish, I am sure, to see this proposal as fully developed under federal control as is possible without infringing upon the prerogatives of the States. The forestry school is a subject that the Commonwealth authorities can very well take in hand, since it would be absurd to have more than one such school in Australia. The local jealousies and the State bickerings about where the school should be situated would be overcome if it were erected and managed under federal control. I hope that will be done, and done soon.  But there is another matter, and that is the actual forestry work to be done in the Federal Capital Territory, the Northern Territory, the Mandated Territories, and Papua, and even little Norfolk Island must come in for its share of attention. I presume that the school will be established at Canberra.

This test took place in Western Australia. I hope that the great bulk of the areas of those States which contain large tracts of mountainous country, which is practically useless for anything else, will be used, within the next twenty years, for growing crops of young hardwood trees for the purpose of manufacture into paper pulp. The Electrolytic Zinc Company proposed to use hardwoods for the manufacture of paper, and it was proved that this timber, particularly when used in an immature condition, yielded paper of a better quality than that produced from softwood. I lay stress on the point that the wood is best used in an immature condition in order to bring home to honorable senators the fact that it does not take many years for the grower to get his crop off the* ground.

Even in parts of the Northern Territory and I suppose some folk wonder at the term  forestry  being applied to that territory and in the corresponding portions of Western Australia and Queensland there is one of the best tanning materials in the world, in the form of the ridge gum Eucalyptus alba. It is much superior to any other tanning material in Australia, both by reason of quantity and the resultant leather. This timber occurs practically all over the Northern Territory wherever there is rising land.  Then, again, the possibility of planting teak in portions of the Mandated Territories and Papua has to be considered. When I visited Java some time ago the Forestry Department there had just finished planting some 500,000 acres with teak, although it was realized that it would be 80 or 100 years before an axe could be put into it. Java was looking ahead, as all countries must do, realizing that the benefits resulting from afforestation are derived by subsequent generations. Even in Norfolk Island I understand that the lack of a pOlicy of reafforestation threatens the destruction of the pines there, which are very useful for the purposes for which softwoods are required. There is plenty of work for this department, and I hope that next year it will be given a more conspicuous and definite position than it now occupies. With regard to forestry research, I hope that the Forest Products Laboratory, which is a very important part of any forestry scheme, will be reestablished. If it must be reestablished under even a reorganized council of the Institute) of Science and Industry, I hope that its direct management will not be taken away from the gentleman who now presides over the Forestry Department, because I am satisfied that we. have in him the best and most independentminded forester available, and one with perhaps more forestry ideals than any of the foresters who have come to Australia. It will be necessary in future for the Commonwealth, with its probably abounding revenues, to give some assistance to the States in the matter of forestry problems which cannot be dealt with by the State Forestry Departments. .

I am glad that Senator Kingsmill occasionally raises his voice on this subject, and I hope he will continue to do so, even at the risk of exhausting his time limit. I feel, with him, that we are not doing enough iri the direction to which he has referred. A Minister cannot do what he would like to do unless he is supported by parliamentary opinion. If, therefore, Senator Kingsmill, or any other honorable senator, expresses favorable opinions with regard to afforestation, a healthy parliamentary opinion will be created, and it will be much easier than it has hitherto been for a Ministry that wishes to do something to assist the movement. I am not complaining that nothing has been done. We are doing the necessary preliminary work. First of all we have obtained the services of Mr. Lane Poole, which are very valuable to the Commonwealth in fact, I do not think the people quite realize how valuable they are. This officer is a safe guide in these matters, and his services could be made more useful if there were a definite plan of action. Although forestry research is a modest title, it covers a multitude of activities that have been commenced. I agree with Senator Kingsmill that if we are to go on with the policy there should be a proper forestry act, and there should be a forestry bureau. It will be noticed that reference is made in the GovernorGenerals Speech to the intention of the Government to establish a forestry bureau. The reason that no immediate action has been taken is, as my colleague, Senator Sir Victor Wilson, told the committee this morning, that a subcommittee of the Cabinet is considering the question of the reorganization of the Institute of Science; and Industry. One of the questions that come up for consideration is what is to be done in regard to forestry and forestry research. There are two avenues in which the Commonwealth can give practical assistance: one is the* encouragement of forestry and afforestation, including the education of foresters, and the other is forestry research. The proposal put forward by Mr. Lane Poole is that these two activities should be to some extent separated, that the administrative side should be under a Minister and the Forestry Bureau, and that the research side could be mora properly placed under the control of the reorganized Institute of Science and Industry. That suggestion is receiving consideration. Realizing the lack of trained foresters in Australia to guide the several State Governments in their forestry policy, the Commonwealth Government is establishing a central forestry school at Canberra..

In addition to students who may enter the central school at Canberra from the State Universities, provision will also be made for the training of men already on the staffs of the Forestry Departments of the different States. Certain of the States propose to send some members of their staff for instructional purposes. In addition to the amounts on the Estimates now before the committee, there is provision in the Estimates for the Federal Capital Commission of between £12,000 and £15,000 for the erection of the school at Canberra. So that no time may be lost in forwarding the project, the Government has obtained the services of Professor Jolly, of the Adelaide University, for the training of foresters in the school at Adelaide. Students will take the course at the Adelaide University under Professor Jolly until the buildings at Canberra are ready, which will be in about twelve months time. We have also had interesting reports from Mr. Lane Poole as to what can be done in Papua and the Territory of Kew Guinea. These reports are in the hands of the printer, and will shortly be circulated amongst honorable senators. We hope soon to make a commencement there on the lines of his recommendations. Mr. Lane Poole has also furnished reports on a forestry policy for the Federal Capital and at Jervis Bay. The Federal Capital Commission is this year spending from £18,000 to £20,000 in those two territories, so that substantial progress will be made during the present financial year in addition to what has already been done by Mr. Weston. Mr. Lane Poole has not yet reported on. the Northern Territory. He is doing a certain amount of work for two of the States which have asked for his services, and when he has finished he will visit the Northern Territory and submit a recommendation to the Government as to what should be done there. It is gratifying to know that the State Governments are anxious to get the advice of one who is regarded as the foremost expert in forestry in the southern hemisphere.

I should like the Government to appoint a royal commission to inquire into the administration of the electoral law. I believe in simplicity. The present system is too complicated. Very few people understand the precise value of votes given to the different candidates, and I regret very much that there was such a large number of informal votes at the last election. Senator Thomas has just told us that there were no less than 70,000 or 80,000 informal votes in his own State. That is most unsatisfactory, because sometimes 70,000 or 80,000 votes may be sufficient to affect the result of an election. The Ministers statement that 9 per cent, of the votes at the last election were informal is rather staggering. According to some honorable senators opposite, the present method of voting is on allfours with the first past the post system. If it is, why not revert to the old method of voting by placing crosses, instead of numbers, opposite the names of candidates.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","PAYNE, Herbert","K09","Tasmania","N/A","N/A","313",". The time is opportune to express my gratification at the fact that, in recent years, the PostmasterGenerals Department has performed a duty to the people of Australia which previously was neglected. I believe that it is now giving the public a service commensurate with the revenue that it receives from the public. During the recent election campaign a great deal of criticism was levelled at the Government by the leaders of the Labour party, who charged it with having failed in its duty because the Postal Department was not showing a profit. To the rightthinking people of Australia that is an indication that for the first time the department is giving the people the service to which they are entitled. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton), whilst in Tasmania, stressed this point in his desire to belittle the administration. He quite ignored the fact that during the last year or two the people have had the benefit of reduced postal charges, no greater sum being taken from them than is necessary to carry on this important department.  There are one or two matters of administration, however, that call for criticism. Some time ago it was decided that there should be a review of the stamps licences issued to business people. The result has been that many of the real conveniences which the public hitherto enjoyed were removed. I understand that the policy of the Government is not to issue licences to persons who use the stamps in the conduct of their businesses, but to confine them to those who supply the demands of the public at a time when stamps cannot be purchased at a post office. In quite a number of instances persons who had a very small turnover in the sale of stamps were denied licences, and considerable inconvenience was thus caused to the people. When I mentioned one or two cases to the PostmasterGeneral, he stated that the reason for declining to issue the licences was that only a small amount of business was done. That is in opposition to the declared policy of the department. The fact that only a small amount of business is being done is a proof that a benefit is being conferred upon the people. The declared policy of the department under the administration of the Hon. A. Poynton some years ago was to give the outback settler every convenience possible in the matter of telephonic communication. About twelve months ago the department decided upon an increased fee for the opening of unofficial post offices after trading hours, and a decrease in the fee charged by official post offices. Very few official post offices are used by outback settlers for the transmission of telephonic messages. There is a large group of official offices spread along the northwest coast of Tasmania which have a continuous service, and at which an opening fee is charged. They are utilized in conjunction with the unofficial offices in the backblocks to enable the settlers to communicate with the large centres of population. Those settlers who hitherto were charged an opening fee of ls. are now called upon to pay ls. 6d. Telephones in outback settlements are used mainly after office hours, because the average land worker is unable to get to a telephone earlier. Therefore, he is now penalized to the extent of an extra. 50 per cent. That is a discouragement to him.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL 192526","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[18]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

A great deal of work has been done in that direction, and no honorable senator will object, I am sure, to any vote, however large, being passed for that purpose. It is maintained by every one who knows anything, about the Territory that its future depends very largely upon conserving the health of the native races. I am sorry to find that the words used to describe the grant have been altered, and that, although the money will be spent in: the interests of the native races, it will not be spent exclusively to provide medical services.

I am of opinion that the expenditure is more necessary than ever, and I would vote, if necessary, for the increase of the amount by £5,000. It is penny wise and pound foolish, after valuable work has already been done, to curtail expenditure. Bacteriological research has been carried out, a hospital has been established, medical officers have been appointed, and native medical assistants, who have been taught to render first aid, have been sent back to their tribes where they will be able tc save thousands of lives annually.

I do so because everything said in connexion with the Mandated Territory is closely scrutinized, including the debates in Parliament, and any statements made without proper backing are used against us at the League of Nations. I acquit Senator Payne of any intention of prejudicing Australia in the eyes of the League of Nations, because he has always shown a great interest in the Mandated Territory, and has done all he can to arouse interest in the subject in Australia. I interjected because I was quite sure that he did not think the statement he was making and he made it under a misapprehension would be quoted against us as the authoritative statement of a senator speaking on the floor of the Senate. The facts are all the other way. This is merely an alteration of the designation of this grant, and, to understand the effect of it, one must review the history of the grant. In the earlier years the medical services of the Territory were somewhat neglected, and when that was brought to the notice of the Government and the Parliament of the day, more energetic action was taken to bring those services up to date. Tor that purpose it was found necessary last year to make a special grant of £10,000, part of which was expended in catching up the arrears. In the mean time we have appointed as Director of Health in the Mandated Territory probably the foremost Australian specialist in tropical diseases, Dr. Cilento. He has been there for some time, and every step taken to improve the health of the natives is taken on his advice. The item referred to by Senator Payne does not represent the total amount we are spending on medical services and the health of the natives. This is a special grant not merely for the health of the natives, but also for their general improvement. We feel that it is not sufficient that we should merely look after their health, and so we have undertaken the task of raising them in the 2nane of civilization. Part of this grant of Commonwealth revenue will be used to train the natives as agriculturists. An attempt is being made to induce them to take up agriculture in their villages, in the hope of encouraging village and communal life. The native is not naturally an agriculturist, and although he lives largely on native fruits he does very little cultivation. Under this vote the Government is sending out to the villages trained men to instruct the natives and to try to inculcate in them a love of agriculture. We hope in this way to raise them in the scale of civilization. In order that their health shall not be lost sight of, part of this grant will be spent for that purpose. In addition, out of loan money and this is where the honorable senator has fallen into error a sum of £5,000 will be provided for the erection of a Lock hospital, to enable proper steps to be taken to treat venereal diseases. In addition to that, there are the local estimates. The greater part of the expenditure does not appear on the Commonwealth estimates. The estimates for local government have been increased, so that actually more is being spent this financial year on health and medical services than was spent last year, notwithstanding that £10,000 was earmarked last year for these purposes. I want it to be known that we are spending more than hitherto on public health in the territories than was spent last year. Furthermore, we have the typewritten statement, signed by Dr. Cilento, that the steps which are being taken are ample for the purpose of safeguarding the health of the natives, and are all that is practicable under present conditions.

I am pleased that the Minister (Senator Pearce) has made the statement he has today, and if I said anything that Was likely to create in the League of Nations an impression inimical to the administration of the Mandated Territories by the Commonwealth, I am sorry indeed. I do not know, however, that I have said anything that would create such an impression. When I was in New Guinea, I was closely observant. I knew that the work, with which, I hope, the lock hospital will successfully cope, had partially ceased, and I was afraid that this cessation was brought about by a lack of funds. Therefore, noticing an alteration in the wording of the item in the schedule I thought I was justified in making the statement I did. I welcome the Ministers remarks, because I heard for the first time today of the proposal to establish a lock hospital. It will do .splendid work, and is very much needed. I am quite aware that every effort has been made to belittle the Governments administration in New Guinea, and to criticize the department which controls territorial affairs, and since my visit to New Guinea I have never lost an opportunity on the platform to deprecate these efforts, and put people right. My blood has boiled at statements in the newspapers indicating that things are happening in New Guinea which have never happened. Therefore, I welcome the statement by the Minister.

In resuming the debate on this very important measure, it is not my intention to occupy much time, for the reason that I addressed myself very comprehensively to the second reading of the bill when it wag before us last year. I listened with interest yesterday to the speech of the right honorable the Leader of the Senate, and I venture to say that I could have anticipated almost every word he uttered, because he practically said, in a condensed form, what he said when moving the second reading last year. There was, however, one exception, and that was his admission that previous Governments had failed to administer properly that vast tract of country which has been committed to our care. Yesterday the Minister made a public confession of failure, so far as the present Government and its predecessors are concerned, regarding the administration of the Territory. He stated that no matter how good the intentions of the Minister for Home and Territories might be, the other members of the Cabinet were too concerned about other schemes to pay any attention to the development of the rich and vast tracts of country in central and north Australia. I congratulate the Minister upon this admission of failure. Then he proceeded to explain that, it was pro posed under the bill to bring about a new state of affairs in the Territory. A comprehensive discussion on the whole subject took place last session, and the principle contained in the measure was not opposed from this side of the Chamber. It is true that members of the Opposition made certain suggestions with a view to improving the bill, but they were not accepted. I take it that the Ministers speech on the reintroduction of the bill was delivered principally for the purpose of acquainting honorable senators who have just been elected with his ideas upon the experiment now proposed. One of the reasons why Governments have not been successful in developing this rich country is that persons have been allowed to occupy large areas without putting them to their proper use. For instance, four lessees in the Northern Territory hold areas equal in size, to Austria, Portugal, and Scotland. I shall welcome the bill if it will have the result of preventing large tracts of country from being held out of use.

I repeat what I said last session, that the measure will not prevent the delays that have occurred in the past. If the appointment of a provisional government is decided upon, I suggest that the people in the Northern Territory itself should be given a voice in determining its personnel . The Minister said that the Best men available would be appointed to the commission.

It is not my intention to make a lengthy speech on this bill, because at the end of last session I took the opportunity of making my opinions on the subject known. . I desire, however, to congratulate the Minister for Home and Territories (Senator Pearce) on the manner in which he is administering his department, and making himself acquainted with the requirements of the Northern Territory. Undoubtedly, since this country was handed over by South Australia to the Commonwealth, it has been a sort of Cinderella, in whom nobody has taken an interest. Generally speaking, the Territory has suffered because little or no interest has been taken in it either by Ministers or members. It is refreshing, therefore, to residents of the Territory to know that the present Minister in charge of the department, irrespective of whether or not they see eye to eye with him in regard to administrative methods, is anxious to do something to develop the country. I was particularly impressed by his remark that the Territory must at the present time be regarded as a pastoral proposition. I agree  with him that we should not make expensive experiments such as those conducted by recent administrators, which resulted in the waste of much public money. I am satisfied that Dr. Gilruth honestly endeavoured to do his best for the Territory, but that he was many years before his time. Had there been no experiments in agriculture and sheep raising at the Mataranka and Batchelor farms, the Northern Territory would not have had such a bad advertisement. We all deplore, also, the experience of Messrs. Vestey Brothers, who, after spending upwards of £2,000,000 on their huge works at Darwin and their cattle stations, have received practically no return. Many factors have been responsible for the nonsuccess of their venture. Labour difficulties played their part, but perhaps were not wholly responsible for the failure. The high cost of production and the decline in the price of meat were contributing causes, but I believe that, they consider that, had their request for alterations to the wharf at Darwin and certain railway concessions been acceded to more promptly, they might have been able to carry on for a longer period. I hope it is not too late even now for the works to be reopened with greater prospects of success. I do not know whether the Minister has any information as to when the works are likely to be started again. All I cm say is that it was most unfortunate that such an establishment as theirs, located where it is most needed, should have proved such a bad advertisement for the Northern Territory up to the present. The administration, and, in particular, the Minister for Home and Territories, is endeavouring to improve the present state of affairs, and it is to be hoped that in the near future sufficient inducement will be held out. to other people to undertake business enterprises in that portion of Australia. When speaking on this measure in the last Parliament, I expressed the opinion that the proposal to appoint three administrators, or commissioners, in the place of one would overload it; but, after carefully considering the arguments advanced in its favour, I have come to the conclusion that perhaps after all it would not be so undesirable, provided, of course, the right type of men can bc obtained. If it is not possible to get the right men, it would be better not to go on with the scheme, because we have had sufficient experience in recent years in some of the larger departments of the Commonwealth to know that cheap men frequently prove very expensive in the end. I trust that the Minister, if he cannot get the right type of man in Australia, will not hesitate to go outside the Commonwealth to secure the services of men with a sound knowledge of developmental proposals in tropical countries.

The Minister, quoting from a rainfall map, showed that there is an abundant rainfall over the greater portion of the Territory. We have, however, to judge a country, not by the quantity of rain which falls upon it, but by what is growing upon land where the rain falls. That portion of the Territory, the coastal belt, where the rainfall is heaviest, is almost unsuitable for settlement. The cane grass grows so frankly that at certain periods of the year it is impossible to ride through it on horseback. Newcastle Waters is almost in. the centre of an immense area of rich land, extending for hundreds of miles, east and west. There are the rich plains of the Barkly Tablelands on the one side, and the Victoria River Downs and Wave Hill country on the other. This portion of Australia should some day carry an immense population. The Government would be well advised to make special provision for the construction of a railway from east to west to open up this splendid and fertile country. Every one who knows it declares that there is no finer grazing country in the world. The rainfall is about 20 inches in the year. Most of it falls during the first three months, and the season is very regular. A drought is practically unknown. It is similar to the western plains country in Queensland, where the finest merino wool in the world, is grown. A railway line from Camooweal across the Barkly Tablelands to Newcastle Waters, and eventually to Victoria River Downs, and thence through the Kimberly ranges, to one of the Western Australian ports should, prove a splendid proposition, because it would open up the finest country in Northern Australia. Instead of wasting money by building a railway line through light cattlecarrying country, such as that through which the projected railway from the south will run, the Government should consider opening up the Barkly Tablelands and Victoria River Downs country in the way I suggest. I am satisfied that if we had a railway there, people would be induced to stock the country with sheep, and if they were able to get wirenetting to keep the dogs out, and had improved facilities for boring, the development would be so rapid and satisfactory that the profits earned by the first section of the railway would be sufficient to pay for an extension at some future date. As I understand that this vexed question of railway construction will come before the Senate for consideration at a later date, I shall not deal further with the subject this afternoon. No stronger argument in favour of opening up the Barkly Tablelands country has ever been employed in this chamber than that contained in the speech by the Minister when moving the second reading of this bill. I believe that the majority of honorable members in this Parliament have sufficient common sense to authorize the construction of railways where they are needed, and where they will be beneficial to Australia. It was pleasing to me to hear the Minister (Senator Pearce) stress the value of the sheep country in the Northern Territory that will be tapped if the line is taken over this route. It is far more necessary for a railway to be built in sheep country than in cattle country.  Cattle men do not suffer a great deal of inconvenience if they are many miles from the railhead. When I was in Oodnadatta a few years ago I found that thousands of cattle from the Northern Territory were travelled past the railhead and along the route of the railway, and they arrived in the market in better condition than if they had been trucked.
