A ceiling was imposed on prices as at the 13th April, 1943, and stabilization was to be achieved by the aid of government subsidies. It was found impossible to adjust all increased costs in the first quarter of the plan, and as the index for June quarter showed an increase over March quarter, consequential adjustments were made to the basic wage. In August, 1943, government assistance running into several millions of pounds was provided by subsidies on tea and potatoes, and reduction of sales tax on clothing from 12½ per cent. to 7½ per cent. As a result of these and other subsidies the cost of living index for the six capitals forDecember quarter, 1943, was the same as existed for March quarter, 1943, but there has been some variation in the index movements in some of the States. 2.The basic wage and the method of its adjustment is determined by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court and by State industrial tribunals. It is not proposed to interfere with the power reposed in the Arbitration Courts in this regard. It is the function of the courts to hear and determine any application that may be made by representatives of unions or employers in respect of the basic wage.","BASIC WAGE","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[8]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As my amendment means that persons who come to Australia from Allied countries would have to remain five years before they could enjoy the benefits of this legislation, I should not object if the period were reduced to three years. The reason for the amendment is that, as the clause stands, foreigners who came to this country would immediately be eligible for the benefits provided by this legislation, whereas, in my opinion, they should not have any advantage over a British subject who would have to reside here for twelve months before he could benefit from it.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","WILSON, Keith Cameron","KBH","South Australia","N/A","N/A","399",". I support the amendment. The people whom we should encourage to come to this country are those who wish to make Australia their home and to adopt an Australian nationality. We do not want those who come here intending to stay only for a short period, during which they are determined to get as much from this country as they can, and then to return to their national home. I saw the danger of that kind oi thing when I was in Palestine. That country was flooded with refugees who had fled from European countries in order to escape from persecution. In conversation with many of them, I found that only a limited number intended to make their permanent home in Palestine. They freely admitted that it was their intention to return to Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, or other countries from which they had been driven, as soon as it was possible to do so. Although I am of the opinion that we should extend to those who are prepared to make Australia their home the same benefits as are enjoyed by our own citizens, I do not think that these other people should receive similar treatment. Senator Gibsons amendment would enable any British subject, or any naturalized British subject, to get the benefits of this legislation after a years residence in Australia. If a migrant is not prepared to apply for naturalization, he should not, in my opinion, be eligible for the benefits conferred by this legislation. I urge the Government to accept the amendment.  Senator MclEAY (South AustraliaLeader of the Opposition) [3.19]. This matter was referred to during the secondreading debate, but I do not remember the Minister for Social Services (Senator Fraser) saying whether or not it had been considered by the Government when the bill was being prepared. As the clause now stands, a person who has resided in Australia for twelve months and becomes ill before he has obtained work will be entitled to sickness benefits. I should also like the Minister to explain the position. I support Senator Gibsons amendment, and trust that the Government will accede to the request of the Opposition to amend the bill in the direction suggested. Obviously, we shall head for disaster if the Government persists in its intention to charge the cost of the scheme to general revenue, particularly when the Government is unable to supply anything like an accurate estimate of the cost.","N/A","UNEMPLOYMENT AND SICKNESS BENEFITS BILL 1944","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

All honorable senators will admit that we cannot hope to confine our migration policy to people of British stock. We must encourage newcomers from nonBritish countries; and once such people come here and accept Australian citizenship, they are entitled to the benefits of that citizenship. With respect to sickness benefits, I point out that all foreigners must be passed as medically fit before they are admitted to this country.

I do not think that the Minister for Social Services (Senator Fraser) has answered the question asked by Senator McLeay. I can understand the point for which the Minister is contending, namely, that any persons who choose to remain in Australia should enjoy the benefits of Australian laws, whether they be naturalized or not. However, the real issue is that they have only to reside in Australia for one year when they will become entitled to these benefits.  It is unwise to allow these passersfay, such as Senator Wilson has referred to, the benefits of this legislation, when they have no intention of making their permanent home in Australia. I ask the Minister to extend the qualifying residential period sufficiently to ensure that these people really want to become part and parcel of the Australian nation. I realize the importance of this class of legislation as an encouragement of migration, but a provision of this kind raises the question as to whether we are not opening the door too wide.","N/A","UNEMPLOYMENT AND SICKNESS BENEFITS BILL 1944","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If it could be said that Senator Gibsons amendment would encourage aliens to become naturalized British subjects, it would have some merit. However, from my experience with aliens, I believe that the unemployment and sickness benefits provided under this legislation will not be a very great inducement to aliens to become British subjects. If that is what Senator Gibsonhas in mind, I do not think that his amendment will help us. I also disagree with the view that Senator Gibsons amendment will materially reduce the cost of benefits by excluding numbers of aliens. We shall not stand idly .by, and allow aliens in our midst to be reduced to needy circumstances, or to a condition of sickness, without coming to their aid. What Senator Gibson suggests is that the people of Australia would ignore such sick or needy people, but I am sure that he does not mean that. However, that is what could happen if his amendment were carried. The unemployed or sick alien, if not a charge on this fund, would, if the amendment were carried, become a charge on some welfare fund of th.. State in which he resided.

I propose to test his sincerity in relation to paragraph a which provides that every person who  . . . . has attained the age of sixteen years, but has not attained the age of 65 years or in the case of a female 60 years . . . shall be qualified to receive unemployment benefit. What is the position of a man who comes to this country at 50 years of age? He cannot get the oldage pension until he is 70, and his benefits under this measure cease at 65, so that for a period of five years he is not entitled to any help whatever. If the Minister is sincere, he will make provision for that man for the intervening five years. The objections raised by Senator Allan MacDonald are also weak. The people to whom I refer have resided in Australia for a year or two, are working on farms, pay no taxes, and, immediately this measure comes into operation, receive its benefits. Why should they receive benefits when a British subject must reside here for twelve months before he can receive them? The bill is most inconsistent. I hope that the Minister will answer my criticism of paragraph a more fully than he has answered the case for my amendment.

In speaking on the second reading I asked a question regarding paragraph c, which provides that ... every person who satisfies the DirectorGeneral that he is unemployed, and that his unemployment is not due to his being a direct participant in a strike . . . shall be qualified to receive unemployment benefit . What does the Government mean by  a direct participant in a strike  ? If a strike occurs, is any one refusing to work in the industry in which it occurs a direct participant? If members of another union decided not to work, would they be direct participants in a strike? If some men were absent on sick pay and returned to work after the strike had begun and then refused to work, would they be direct participants in a strike? A great deal of clarification of this paragraph is needed. A man may claim not to be a direct participant in the strike because he was not there on the day on which the strike started. I can forsee much misunderstanding occurring with the members of other unions who stop work and claim that the stoppage is not a strike because they are only acting in sympathy with the men who are striking. Will they be direct participants in a strike? Although I am in sympathy with the object which the Government seems to aim at, I am sure that it will be necessary to make the meaning of the clause clearer to prevent all sorts of legal quibbles and objections. I presume that this paragraph does not apply to sickness benefits, and that if a man who is on strike becomes ill, the intention is that he shall receive them. It is further provided that ... every person who . . . satisfies the DirectorGeneral that he is capable of undertaking and is willing to undertake work which in the opinion of the DirectorGeneral is suitable to:be undertaken by that person . . . shall be qualified to receive unemployment benefit . When I referred to this provision during the secondreading debate, the Leader of the Senate (Senator Keane) interjected that a man was entitled to get work at his own trade. I instanced the case of a coal miner able to work and who was offered work in some other industry. According to the interpretation given by the Leader of the Senate, that man would be able to say,  Oh no, I must have work at my own particular trade. The Minister surely sees at once that if the test as to whether a man is unemployed or not is that everyman must be employed at his own particular trade, the provision becomes ridiculous. Must a carpenter get work at the carpentering trade, although he is quite able to work at some other trade, and does the same thing apply to a stonemason or a slaughterman ?

I have experienced considerable difficulty in following the points that have been raised by Senator Leckie. I shall deal first with the question of strikes : It is most undesirable that in the event of a strike in, say, a colliery or perhaps in the Sydney transport system, such as that which occurred recently, the gun should be held at the head of an unemployed person to force him to accept work in that industry, merely because the regular employees are on strike. We do not want this legislation to be used to compel men to  scab  on their fellow workers. In regard to the second part of the honorable senators remarks, it is not the intention under this measure to compel men to be kept strictly to their own trades in the event of unemployment. I remind honorable senators that during the depression years carpenters, butchers and, in fact, tradesmen of all classes were only too pleased to accept jobs of any kind. Obviously, this measure would not be used to compel a municipal employee in a southern State to accept employment as a wharf lumper at Darwin, merely because there was a job there for him. However, he might be offered work as a wharf lumper in a southern State. Conversely, should a wharf lumper be unable to obtain a job at his own trade, as many were during the depression, he could be employed on municipal work. The bill does not provide that a man must work at his own trade, or be paid unemployment benefit.

Very often strikes are caused by noisy minorities, and agreed to perhaps by the very barest of majorities. Sometimes workers are forced to go on strike, as was the case in the recent transport strike in Sydney, when many employees were anxious to work, particularly in view of the fact that lack of transport facilities meant that large numbers of munitions workers could not reach their places of employment, with a consequent loss of production. I realize that a majority of members of the union concerned in the transport holdup voted for the strike, but there are many cases in which the decision to cease work is made by a comparatively small majority. It also happens on occasions that men are called out on strike without a vote being taken. Also, there are certain unions in which officials reign supreme. For instance, I understand that the officials of the Ironworkers Union do not have to publish balancesheets. The secretary of that union is known as  Balancesheet  Thornton.

It should be a simple matter for the DirectorGeneral to decide whether or not a person were entitled to the benefit of this legislation. If there were work waiting for him that is suitable work in which he could be employed and he refused to accept that work, then he would be acting illegally and should not be entitled to benefits. I should think that the word  direct  will provide a field of argument for lawyers for many years. What is a direct participant? For instance, somebody moves a resolution that certain tram waymen go out on strike. Somebody seconds that motion, and it may be said that the mover and seconder are direct participants in the strike, but how can we say that anybody else is a direct participant? We do not know who voted for the motion and who voted against it. What would be the position of a man who goes on strike contrary to the advice of his trade union and against an award of the Arbitration Court? Take the clearest case one could have of an illegal strike that regarding which the Prime Minister (Mr. Curtin) has made strong statements urging the men who are striking illegally to return to work. A person may claim the benefit and the DirectorGeneral may say, No, you are on strike . The man may reply,  But I am not a direct participant. I did not move the motion in favour of the strike. I did not second it, and did not even vote for it. The man may even contend that he did not wish to go on strike. The Government means either that every striker automatically deprives himself of the benefit of the bill, or that a person can both be illegally on strike and get the benefit of the bill. I ask the Minister to eliminate the word  direct which causes all the confusion. Both the Government and the Opposition are in agreement that persons illegally on strike should not get the benefit of the bill. Therefore, I contend that the amendment should be accepted.

If he is a participant, the intention of the Government is that he should be excluded from the benefit of the bill at the discretion of the DirectorGeneral. What point is given to the clause by the inclusion of the word  direct  other than to create a difficulty for the DirectorGeneral in determining whether or not a person is a participant in a strike? The word  direct  is liable to lead to a great deal of confusion. In some instances unionists go on strike in sympathy with their fellow unionists in another industry. In such circumstances could they be correctly described as direct participants? Perhaps the Minister in charge of the bill (Senator Fraser) could throw a little light on the matter. I do not desire to agree to an alteration which would leave the clause too vague without a direction to the DirectorGeneral, upon whom a great responsibility will be cast.

Moreover, the inclusion of so many brackets adds to its complicated nature. Its meaning becomes clearer if we, for the moment, disregard the words within the brackets, so that the clause would read :  Where any payment is made by a person to any other person who acts as his substitute during any period of incapacity, the DirectorGeneral may . . . regard the first mentioned person as having suffered a loss of income equal to the amount of that payment . Clause 16 enables certain persons, whose qualifications are set out in the clause, to obtain certain sickness benefits. Are we to superimpose a further liability to reimburse such a person for payments made by him to some other person who has worked for him during a certain period? I cannot see the reason for the insertion of this provision in clause 16 unless it is to link it up with something that has been passed by the Committee. But subclause 2 is foreign to the clauses that have been passed, because the benefit in respect of sickness or unemployment is a benefit bestowed by certain legislation. We are not here providing for the substitution of some one else for the person who is entitled to the benefit. I thought that the bill was aimed at making provision for a person who is unemployed, or is stricken by illness, and therefore subclause 2 appears to be foreign to the purpose of the bill. The numerous brackets may be necessary, but they certainly do not make the subclause more easily understood. I can imagine legislation of this nature causing difficulty in the event of litigation arising. The Minister may agree to postpone the consideration of this clause with a view to submitting a clear statement as to itsmeaning, and thereby shortening the timeof the discussion.

It is quite obvious that a number of honorable senators do not understand the meaning of this clause. The Minister himself has an impossible task in being asked to explain a bill which, because it is so badly drafted, is inexplicable. Take, for instance, subclause 2 of this clause.

I suggest that the bill be redrafted in ordinary English, which honorable senators and the general public can understand.

The necessity for this clause, as I said earlier, arises from the fact that we are endeavouring as far as possible to prevent collusion. Senator Tangney has instanced the case of a small shopkeeper. Suppose, for instance, that the husband wants to take a holiday, and in order to do so alleges that he is sick, his intention being to take a holiday at the expense of the Commonwealth.","N/A","UNEMPLOYMENT AND SICKNESS BENEFITS BILL 1944","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[29]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

One, alleging sickness, may decide to take a holiday on the understanding that his brother next door will look after his farm in his absence. Should the DirectorGeneral suspect the bona fides of an applicant who produces a medical certificate, he will have the right under this provision to demand that the applicant be examined by a special medical officer. Briefly, the effect of paragraph c is that it gives the DirectorGeneral the final word in determining eligibility for benefit.

The Minister for Social Services (Senator Fraser) clearly explained the purpose of this clause in his earlier remarks. Take the case of the small shopkeeper mentioned by Senator Tangney. In order to receive benefit, the shopkeeper must show a loss of income. If, for instance, a shopkeeper were making £6 a week profit from his business, and, during his absence owing to illness, had to pay another person £5 to carry on the business, his actual income would be £1 a week. The loss of income would be computed on that basis. ","N/A","UNEMPLOYMENT AND SICKNESS BENEFITS BILL 1944","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[30]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

So far as I can see the object of this subclause is to provide against very involved complications that may arise, and with that object in view the draftsman is endeavouring to limit and, at the same time, widen the functions of the DirectorGeneral. I point out that under clause 36, sufficient powers will be vested in the DirectorGeneral to determine cases of this kind. Subclause 2 seems to add complications to a provision that was tolerably clear. The administrative officers would be in a far stronger position if this subclause were omitted. All that an applicant is required to do, as set out in paragraph c, is to satisfy the DirectorGeneral that he is  temporarily incapacitated for work by reason of sickness or accident, and has thereby suffered a loss of salary, wages or other income , and the DirectorGeneral has sufficient discretionary power under clause 36 to determine the application. The retention of subclause 2 will only give severe headaches to the DirectorGeneral. It is a work of supererogation, and will only tend to complicate the administration of the scheme. I am certain that the draftsman would take no exception to the deletion of subclause 2.  Clause agreed to.

In respect of furniture, a man might have left simply a table and a ah air with a neighbour or friend, and might stay away for ten years, yet under the clause he would still be qualified to receive benefit. The same result would follow if he left grownup children in Australia. I suggest that paragraphs a and c cover all that is necessary. I would agree to leave out the words in the aggregate from paragraph a. The Minister must admit that the clause as it stands is open to a good deal of abuse, and might even allow a swindle to be perpetrated. Its draftsmanship also leaves a great deal to be desired.

Subject to this act, the rate of unemployment benefit and sickness benefit shall be  (a)in the case of an unmarried person who has not attained the age of eighteen years Fifteen shillings per week; (b)in the case of an unmarried person who has attained the age of eighteen years but has not attained the age of twentyone years One pound per week; and (c)in any other case One pound five shillings per week. Many young men and young women have been called up for the various services at the age of eighteen years, and they are now employed in the fighting forces or in the various other services. They are in receipt of the same rate of pay as that of persons 25 or 30 years of age or older. They are placed on the same footing as an adult. When their ration allowance is worked out their age is not taken into account, because a person eighteen years of age eats as much as does a person three years older. Moreover, a doctors certificate will cost the same, whether the person requiring it is 18 or 21 years of age; and should a male of eighteen years of age be out of employment his keep will cost as much as if he were 21 years old. In the light of these facts, I see no reason for paragraph b of subclause 1 and, therefore, I suggest that the Minister give consideration to its deletion from the bill. Not long ago legislation was introduced to give the franchise to all persons of eighteen years of age engaged in war service. In my opinion, all persons who have attained the age of eighteen years should be entitled to an unemployment benefit of £1 5s. a week. Clause agreed to. Clause 21 agreed to. Clause 22 (3.)

The effect of my amendment, if adopted, would be that payments by friendly societies in excess of £1 a week would not be taken into consideration in calculating a mans income in order to decide his eligibility to receive the benefits provided by this legislation. Acceptance of the amendment would not involve any considerable sum, but it would be a recognition of the valuable work which friendly societies have performed. It would also establish the principle that people who contribute to the benefits which they receive are entitled to those benefits as a right. I trust that the Minister will accept the amendment, thereby showing his appreciation of the splendid work of the friendly societies of this country.  Senator FRASER (Western AustraliaMinister for Health and Minister for agreed that the friendly societies of this country have rendered, and are rendering, valuable service to the community.

If the insurance authority offers to pay him £100 in a lump sum instead of by weekly instalments, what is the effect of that decision upon this legislation? Is it to be regarded as £1 a week for 100 weeks, or at the rate of his usual weekly wage until the £100 is absorbed? Say, for instance, a man is injured by a motor car and received damages from an insurance company under a third party risk policy. How is the amount which he receives to be computed for the purposes of this clause? The damages will be made up of three or four considerations, including compensa tion for pain and suffering, loss of wages and other factors. Obviously money which a man receives as compensation for pain and suffering cannot be regarded as income. If the amount were £100, surely the authorities administering this scheme could not say,  We shall regard this £100 as if you were receiving £1 a week for 100 weeks; therefore you cannot come within the provisions of this scheme for 100 weeks. Subclause 3 states (3.) The methods and conditions of ascertaining the equivalent weekly value shall be as determined by the DirectorGeneral.

I desire to know whether there will be a fixed charge for such certificates, and also what steps are contemplated to relieve doctors from the necessity of issuing hundreds of certificates each week. It is not unlikely that a medical practitioner in each district will set up as a  signer of certificates . If so, he should do well. Some provision should be made in this bill to fix the rate which a doctor may charge for a certificate. I do not like to envisage the application of this provision in an industrial suburb where, because of the volume of sickness, many doctors may be tempted to set up merely as signers of certificates . My object is to relieve the unfortunate person who is obliged to claim sickness benefit of possible heavy expenditure in respect of medical certificates. Senator Gibson mentioned the case of people who may be situated many miles from a doctor. In such cases, the doctor includes in his fee a travelling charge ona mileage basis. I imagine that such cases will come within the category of special circumstances. I have cited the industrial suburb because of the comparatively greater volume of sickness in such suburbs, and for this reason it would pay an unscrupulous doctor merely to set up an office in which he would do nothing but sign certificates without investigating cases very carefully. I do not think that the Government is quite fair to recipients of benefits under this measure unless it relieves them to some degree at least of the comparatively high expenditure which, in many cases, they will be obliged to incur in obtaining a doctors certificate. The Government should accept responsibility for the payment of part of the cost to an applicant where, owing to special circumstances, the doctors fee is comparatively high. It should also ensure that doctors who supply certificates are of the highest repute. I am not implying that doctors generally are dishonest. However, in exceptional circumstances of the kind which I have mentioned, a doctor is entitled to charge a comparatively high fee,and he should be paid at a fair rate for his valuable time. The Government, therefore, should accept responsibility for a part of the medical fee incurred by an applicant in such circumstances.

I apprehend that in extensive legislation of this kind the Governments approach to administrative problems will be to profit by experience, and that this will be the case in respect of the administration of medical benefits as well as other benefits.Clauses 25 and 26 appear to me to be drafted in broad outline, and the gaps will be filled in later as the administration gains experience. At the moment, I cannot discern where a mans right to obtain sickness benefits terminates. However, the medical certificate must be in such terms as the DirectorGeneral determines. . He will give his determination in the form of regulations, and in framing his determinations I have no doubt that he will be guided by the customs and practices of friendly societies. Clause 26 throws the mantle of protection around the Governments expenditure. It is true that under the clause as it stands some burden may be placed upon citizens in exceptional circumstances such as those mentioned by Senator Leckie. Up to date, the mind of the Government naturally has been to take account of circumstances existing in great industrial centres where doctors are close at hand. There may be recurrences of expenditure as Senator Leckie has said, but anomalies will gradually disappear as the administrative machinery runs itself in. I do not think that in respect of a small benefit the  Government would tolerate recurrence of expenditure on the part of any person by obliging him to obtain a medical certificate week after week. It is only proper that applicants be required in the first place to produce a medical certificate containing such information as the DirectorGeneral requires. Should the DirectorGeneral be in any doubt as to the continuance of benefit he has power under clause 26 to call for another certificate, or to insist that the applicant be examined by a special medical officer. I realize that applicants living in remote localities may be under some disability, but difficulties of that kind will gradually smooth themselves out. In extensive legislation of this character it is impossible to expect perfect working conditions immediately. However, whilst there is ground for the argument I do not think that we can remedy the difficulty at this stage. Clause agreed to. Clause 26 agreed to.

He may in his discretion grant assistance, or direct that it be granted, in all cases other than those specially dealt with in other clauses of the bill. His powers should be curtailed. The bill seems to have been prepared in order to cover all classes of sickness and unemployment, but this clause overrides all others. I do not know why this officer is styled the DirectorGeneral. It gives him a title resembling that of a GovernorGeneral. Why not designate him the Director! This is not the time to take exception to it, but it is a remarkable title to give an officer. There should be a director and a deputy director. The clause confers upon the DirectorGeneral power to deal at his discretion with all cases for which no specific provision has been made in the bill. To me that seems to be taking from Parliament and the Minister control of the administration of this measure. It is a  graball  clause, and I am sure that such a sweeping provision was never contemplated when this measure was being prepared. I should like the Minister to tell me whether or not my interpretation of the clause is correct, and if not, what limits are placed upon the authority of the DirectorGeneral.

The clause vests the general administration of this legislation in an individual independent of Parliament, hut apparently honorable senators opposite, who for so long have advocated freedom from political control, do not like it because they fear that the power may be abused. My view is that this clause is necessary. For instance, I know of a very worthy woman who is 59 years of age. She is unable to secure a widows pension because during the depression years she left her husband. She is an excellent citizen, and she has done fancywork all his life. She cannot see sufficiently well to continue in this vocation, but she is not eligible for an invalid pension. She is not old enough to receive the oldage pension. This clause confers upon the DirectorGeneral power to deal with such worthy cases.

I thought that all honorable senators were inundated with letters from individuals whose claims had been determined by the Repatriation Commission, and had been made the subject of an appeal to the higher tribunal. I realize the administrative difficulty with which the Government is confronted, but surely some method can be provided whereby the unfortunate individuals who will seek benefit under this legislation, will have a right of appeal should their claims be rejected initially. In civil matters, such fis police courts, there is always a right of appeal, even if it is only against a fine of £1. Here, a persons living or his welfare may be at stake. Unfortunately it frequently happens that persons who are failed upon to administer this type of legislation for many years, become largely influenced by the governmental viewpoint I do not suggest that there is any improper influence brought to bear by a Government. We find examples of that attitude in the inferior courts where magistrates, who for a long time have been dealing with certain classes, of individuals find it most difficult to see the other side of the picture. Only too often it is merely a matter of saying,  fined 10s.  without any further discussion. Whilst an administrator may be quite justified in taking that attitude in nine cases out of ten, we must have some consideration for that tenth case. As this legislation will soon be placed upon our statutebook no doubt it will be amended from time to time I think we should have these matters clarified. The administration of this measure will harden the DirectorGeneral, I fear, to a degree which I do not think either the Government or the Committee intends. We should consider whether any relief at all can be given to a person who is prima facie entitled to benefit, but is refused benefit hy the DirectorGeneral.

I again remind honorable senators opposite that this legislation is only a part of the Governments social security plan, all of which I hope will soon be implemented. This clause provides that as a condition of the payment of benefit a person shall undergo training or medical treatment, or perform any work required of him. The object of the provision is to give to the Administration the power to deal with chronic cases persons who are not prepared to do anything to improve their capabilities or state of health, or in which there is good reason to believe that training or medical treatment would bring about such improvement. It is really an extension of the provision on the statutebook enabling the department to continue the payment of an invalid pension for any period during which an invalid is undergoing a course of approved training or instruction, and to regard the trainee as an invalid while the training or instruction is in progress.

I have always held it to be a fundamental principle of democratic government that the Government through its Ministers should accept direct responsibility for all its legislation, and, therefore, should clothe Ministers with complete administrative powers. Any government which is not big enough to shoulder that responsibility should relinquish office. In this instance the issue is whether the Minister should have the final say in the launching of prosecutions. He should have that power and that responsibility, because he represents a Government elected by the people. We should combat any tendency to surrender such powers to administrative officials. They are not elected by the people and, therefore, should not be asked to shoulder such a responsibility. A government which surrenders powers of this kind to any official is no longer fit to govern. In this instance, the Minister should have sole power to authorize prosecutions. Should he fail to discharge that responsibility to the liking of the people, he will be answerable to them in due course. However, the DirectorGeneral, or any other official, is not elected as a representative of the people. He is a nominee of the Government, and must be made responsible to the Minister. I suggest that Senator Leckie, who has done the afternoon shift for the Opposition in delaying  this measure, spoke with his tongue in his cheek on this matter.

To me it connotes a recommital to the same committee which has already considered the bill. That being so, Standing Order No. 265 becomes operative. The Minister then moved for the reinsertion of clause 42, thus reversing a decision which the committee had already made. I contend that it is incompetent for the committee to consider that motion, having regard to the clear terms of Standing Order No. 265. The suspension of the Standing Orders cannot alter the position, because sessional Standing Orders are suspended for a special purpose, namely, to enable a measure to be passed through its remaining stages without delay. That is the normal procedure of the Senate, which should be protected in every way. In my opinion, the committee is not entitled to reverse its previous decision.

As there seems to have been some misapprehension as to war pensions, I point out that they are in three categories a special pension, a service pension, and what might be termed an ordinary pension. The total number of pensions granted to the 30th June last, according to the Repatriation Commissions report which was tabled on the 10th February, was 86,096. That number included sailors, soldiers and airmen of the last war and also of the present war, but excludes widows and dependants. Of that total, 4,621 or 5.3 per cent., are on a special pension because their war injuries prevent them from working. They do not come under the benefits of this bill. Nor do the service pensioners, who are bracketed with invalid and oldage pensioners, because they are unemployable. They number 8,417, or 9.5 per cent, of the total. The amendment moved by Senator Wilson related to the other 86 per cent, who draw pensions ranging from 2s. 6d. to £2 10s. a week. The rejection of that amendment means that the pensions of 73,048 exservicemen will be taken into account when assessing the benefits they are entitled to receive under this bill, should they become unemployed. Although it is true that a considerable percentage of those pensions may not be eligible, for various reasons, to receive any benefits, the fact remains that the majority of them, who are in receipt of wages or low salaries will forfeit all or portion of their pensions in order to come within the scope of the statutory income* limitation of £1 a week. The Government should reconsider this question and bring in amending legislation on the lines of Senator Wilsons amendment. By so doing, an injustice to men of this war and of the last war would be removed.  Question resolved in the affirmative.

This bill can be summed up briefly by saying that it proposes to provide increased prenatal and postnatal payments to mothers bearing twins or triplets. Under the present act a payment of 25s. a week is paid to the mother for a period of four weeks immediately prior to the birth of a child and for four weeks immediately following the birth. Under this bill it is proposed to increase the weekly payment from 25s. to 37s. 6d. in the case of twins, and to 50s. in respect of triplets. In other words, the mother of twins will receive an extra £5, whilst the mother of triplets will receive an additional £10.  The bill also provides for the raising of the age of  other children  from fourteen to sixteen years. At present, the mother of a child is paid £5 where there are no other children; she receives £6 where there are one or two other children, and £7 10s. where there are three or more other children. Under the act the age of  other children  is given as fourteen years. The proposal to substitute sixteen years for fourteen years will provide uniformity with other social legislation, and is therefore desirable. The extra cost of this provision is estimated at £15,000 per annum. The bill also provides for the inclusion in that section of the act dealing with payment of allowances to aboriginal natives of an extension of the term  aboriginal native  to include halfcastes, and, in certain cases, white persons living as aboriginal natives on government stations and reserves.
