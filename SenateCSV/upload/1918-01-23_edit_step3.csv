They were concerned about what they were pleased to call the laziness of the nigger, and in order to discover some satisfactory solution of the problem, the Commission was appointed on the suggestion of the Land Holders Association to inquire into the reasons for the shortage of labour. Honorable senators might be interested to know what Lord Delamere, the owner of 150,000 acres, had to say on this question.. I might add, in passing, that Lord Delamere never had any intention of doing work of any kind, in the way of production, himself. Evidently he does not believe in interfering with another mans job. There are some Lord Delameres in Australia, too, although they are not known by that name. This is what he had to say ;  If the policy was to be continued that every native was to be a landholder of a sufficient area on which to establish himself, then the question of obtaining a satisfactory labour supply would never be settled. Lord Delamere realized that if men were given the right to produce for themselves, naturally it would be difficult to get them to work for the Lord Delameres the Fairbairns, and people of that type, who must then either shift for themselves or starve.

The sooner the people of Australia realize that land monopoly is at the bottom of all our troubles the better for all of us. It is said by some that a tax on land values can be passed on. Lord Delamere and other large landowners do not share that view. They think that the tax cannot be passed on and that landowners themselves must bear it. That is why it is so easy to secure the imposition of Customs and Excise duties and all other indirect taxation as compared with the imposition of a land values tax.

Many a man will hold land if no expense is attached; but when it is taxed it becomes unprofitable, like the fat horse in the stable when the owner has no work for him. 3.If the tax on land values can be passed on, why do land monopolists in Upper Chambers desperately resist it? They will pass all other sorts of taxes, more or less willingly, but become desperate, even to the extent of flouting a newlyelected popular Chamber, when it is proposed to tax land values.

They know that while they hold the land values they are in a position to compel the rest of the community to remain, in effect, their industrial slaves. The article continues  4.All Customs taxes, stamp taxes, income taxes, war profits taxes, &c., are crowded on to the people occupying and using land. Vacant land is exempt. Now suppose we spread the tax evenly over all land in proportion to its value, and remit other taxes, is it not obvious that fullyused land pays less, and idle, or partly idle, land pays more? The latter clearly cannot pass it on, and the former have no occasion to try. That summarizes in a fairly effective manner the fact that a tax upon land values cannot be passed on, and hence the objection of large and small landowners alike to such an impost.

The Belgian and French farmers and landowners, instead of going to their own Governments and making claims, which would be settled with the British Government, personally came to the British adjutants, or other officers on the ground, and begin to haggle about the trench rents and rent for other occupied territory. So Australia pays its share to the British Government. The Belgian and French peasants are sometimes grasping, and show themselves in the worst lights.   Holman found a few things that made him wonder whether the organizing genius he had heard about wasnt a myth; but he reckons this method of settling the rent payable for a battlefield is well able to hold its own for foolishness.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 5) 191718","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[1]/quote[7]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

Senator Pearce, on that occasion, moved  That this congress, recognising the justice of land values taxation, recommends that action be taken to secure uniform taxation on that basis in every State. In submitting that motion Senator Pearce said that there were large tracts of land in one of the richest districts of Australia held by two or three people. The motion was seconded by Mr. Riley, the present member for South Sydney, and supported by Mr. W. T. McGrath, of Victoria, the latter of whom said that by imposing taxation on land values something might be done towards bringing back to the people some of the wealth which had gone into the pockets of the few. That motion was carried. Then at the conference of the Labour party held in Melbourne in 1905 Senator Pearce again moved That an unimproved land values tax without exemption be a plank of the Federal fighting platform. It. was to be a plank, not of the ordinary platform, but of the fighting platform. Senator Pearce said He believed that feeling was growing in this direction even with the farmers. This question was at the root of the social system. They should not merely he satisfied with Factory Acts and Arbitration Acts, but should do something that would find work for the unemployed. A great demand for labour would be created by the unlocking of lands which would follow. Mr. Frazer seconded the resolution. Mr. Grant was strongly in favour of the proposal, and believed in the system as above all others for raising revenue. Mr. OMalley, M.H.R., would favour the resolution if the words without exemption were knocked out. They did not want to touch the little bantams; it was the big gilded roosters of the brahmapootra order they wished to get at. It is recognised by all Labour men that the effect of imposing a tax on big estates is to reduce their selling value. Even Senator OKeefe recognises that. When there is a Â£5,000 exemption the poor man who seeks to buy a piece of land is compelled to pay the big owner the monopoly value of it, the owner is not prepared to give to the small man the concession he gives to the big man.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 5) 191718","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[3]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

At the present time they had a big fight to carry on in the cry of Socialism versus antiSocialism, and that would require all their energies. They had their socialistic objective to aim for, and whilst he was glad to be one to bear the burden of the fight, he trusted that the burden would not be too heavily increased at this juncture by such proposals. At that time he was opposed to the elimination of the Â£5,000 exemption; he was in the same boat as Senator OKeefe. Since then he has abandoned the idea of allowing a Â£5,000 exemption, and today stands for a straight out land tax with no exemption at all.

I said that I was personally against the graduated or the exemption idea, or anything in the nature of a mortgage clause. I pointed out that, in New South Wales, under the Local Government Act, big and little estates paid proportionately on the same basis, and no difficulty had been experienced. Mr. J. C. Watson had said that the progressive land tax was not primarily for revenue, but was intended for the bursting up of large estates. People held different ideas as to the object of the Federal land tax. Some people wanted it for the purpose of bursting up large estates; others wanted it for revenue purposes.; I wanted it for both purposes. At the Brisbane conference, Mr. Foster seconded my motion. He said that my suggestion that the Federal Labour party wished to raise the bulk of the revenue through the Customs House was utterly incorrect, for during the passage of the Tariff, the Labour party had knocked out purely revenue duties whenever it was possible. Yet we find that the same old source of revenue continues to produce over Â£13,000,000 per annum. Mr. Watson advocated leaving the plank the same; others took the same view. Finally Senator Lynch moved an amendment,  That the conference favours a progressive land tax with an exemption of Â£5,000. He pointed out that the rate could afterwards be determined, and asked that the principle be affirmed. Mr. Batchelor seconded the amendment, which was carried with but one dissentient. I have no doubt that I was the one dissentient.

The rates imposed under it are as follow :  The Act under which these rates are levied is the best measure that has been enacted at the instance of the Ryan Government. Unfortunately, an exemption of Â£300 is included in it. It provides that (a)In the case of an absentee or a company, the total sum of the unimproved value of each parcel of the land, if such total sum exceeds three hundred pounds; (6)In the case of an owner, not being an absentee or a company, the balance of the total sum of the unimproved value of each parcel of the land, after deducting the sum of three hundred pounds. It appears from that provision that every landowner is entitled to deduct Â£300 from each parcel of land which he owns, and to that extent he escapes taxation.

The imposition of the taxes that I have named has meant the growth of an ever increasing staff of experts to determine the taxation to be paid by the citizens, and we have men like the Commonwealth Statistician and Professor Carslaw, of the Sydney University, contradicting each other as to the effect of some of our measures of taxation. Under these circumstances, how can the ordinary citizen compute his taxation? There are very few members of this Parliament who are in a position to say what their income taxation will be. The easiest thing to do is to pay without question the. sum at which ones income is assessed. The municipal councils collect their revenue by a far better method. They assess the value of the properties within their borders, and strike a rate of so much in the Â£1, and each ratepayer knows at once whether he is being rightly charged in respect of his property. Compare the simplicity of the municipal rating with the complexity of the Commonwealth in, come tax. A business man has to employ an expert accountant to fill up his returns, and very frequently even the statements of accountants are not accepted by the taxation officers, and the case has to be fought out before the Commissioner. Taxation should be imposed in such a way that the people may know what they have to pay, and the least possible trouble may be caused to them, the loss of revenue to  the community being thus induced to the minimum. A flat rate on land would, no doubt, fall heavily on some of our land sharks, but I should not be too sympathetic with them. They have escaped too lightly hitherto, and I should not hestitate in asking them to pay a greatdeal more. The land of the Commonwealth belongs, not to the people of Australia, but to a limited number of them, and those who do not own land are obliged to plead with the landowners for permission to work. At one time, in Great Britain, if an employee left his employer, he was pursued, and, if caught, was compelled to serve a longer term. On a second occasion . of the kind, the letter V, standing for vagabond, was branded on his forehead. Today, however, when a man loses his job, his concern is to get another employer. Honorable senators have all been approached by men asking them to use their influence to get them employment in Government offices or with private individuals. It is very difficult to get land that . is worth having. Some time ago, when blocks were being balloted for near Brookong, in the Riverina district, there were more than 1,000 applications for a block.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 5) 191718","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[3]/continue[26]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It should be possible in this country for the working man to buy a quarter of an acre or half an acre of land in the suburbs, but any one who wishes, to build in one of the nearer suburbs of any of the capitals has to mortgage his earnings for life merely to buy enough land on which to build.

They might be able to circulate those fallacious statements broadcast in the newspapers, but, when made in this Senate, they can be nailed down at once, so that we should hear no more of them here. The honorable senators statement is quite incorrect. J. want to point out that what the Bol shevik have done in Russia, even if effective for the moment, will not result in a permanent reform.  It would be of no advantage to me to remove some landowner who has compelled me to pay rent for the privilege of living on his estate, if, after removing him, I allowed halfadozen other landlords to step into his position. And that is what will happen in Russia. In Ireland, also, the socalled settlement of the land question will be only of a temporary character, because it will result in the creation of a large number of landlords in places where, before, there was one big landlord. In Russia it appears that the Bolshevik have outed their landlords, and have put themselves in the position of the landowners; so it is probable that in a few years there will arise a large number of landowners, who will exercise just as | much rackTenting, and perhaps a little more, than the landlords of the big type. That is the position everywhere. I do not advocate the forcible removal of landlords in the WaY adopted by the Bolshevik , although I would never shed tears about their sudden removal, with the idea of instituting reforms. Permanent reforms can only be obtained by the taxation of unimproved land values, thus compelling the owners to pay into the public Treasury the full rental of lands in their possession.  I am aware that there are other matters which might well receive consideration during the discussion on the Bill before the Senate, and I should like to refer to the various State land taxes in operation in Tasmania, Western Australia, and right throughout the Commonwealth; but I presume that senators coming from the different States are fairly well acquainted with them. The States have failed to compel landowners to make the best possible use of their land, but the Commonwealth Parliament has power to bring about this very necessary reform, if it so desires. The statement made by Senator McDougall some years ago about the importance of this question is  as true today as it was on the day of its utterance ; and whatever may be the opinion of other honorable senators on this question, I am firmly convinced that no other subject is of more importance than that of securing land for the people who require to use it. I am aware, of course, that a number of people do not require, and have no desire, to use land; but, on the other hand, tens of thousands of people would he very pleased indeed if they could get sufficient land around their homes to make themselves comfortable. It is almost impossible for a man living in Melbourne or suburbs to secure enough land to grow even a few rose trees, let alone establish a vegetable garden.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 5) 191718","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[3]/continue[30]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He went on to say that under the Queensland Land Tax Act the highest rate paid was 6d. in the Â£1, or 2Â£ per cent, on the unimproved value. I would remind him that the land to which that tax applies was purchased from the Government in large areas, and that there has been no rise in its price. That being so the people of Queensland still practically own that land to the extent of 2^ per cent, of its unimproved value. When a man purchases land with the object of selling it again it is generally thought that he does pretty well if he makes 5 per cent, out of his freehold. That is the return one used to expect, but taxation is now becoming so heavy that one practically expects no return. According to Senator Grant the Queensland Government have taken back 2J per cent, by way of taxation on this land today, so that, in other words, the people of that State have taken back 2A_ per cent, of all the land sold in the greater part of its pastoral districts. The figures which the honorable senator has so industriously prepared and put before us need to be thoroughly analyzed and considered from points of view other than those from which he has discussed them.  While I agree with my honorable friend that in the slums of our big cities a great evil is growing up, I do not think the cure for that evil is to be found entirely in land taxation. The problem must be attacked in many different ways. Man is a gregarious animal. He likes to live in  mobs or communities, and it is most difficult to induce many men to live in rural districts. A friend of mine, who takes a great interest in the Melbourne Benevolent Asylum, told me an interesting story, which illustrates this point. Some time ago the asylum was removed from the congested city area, where it had long been established, to a magnificent building specially erected at Cheltenham for the accommodation of the old people. My friend assured me, however, that about 20 per cent: of these old people, who had been inmates of the asylum for many years, left it, refusing to go to Cheltenham, on the ground that it was  too far out of town. There seems to be something in human nature that makes life in congested areas attractive, and the congestion of population in all our big cities is certainly becoming a very serious problem. Land taxation does not solve it. Even if we applied the land tax to every little allotment in the congested areas of population, these people would not go out of town. My view is that we can best get rid of the slum evil by means of liberal . building regulations, under which allotments would have to be of reasonable size, and buildings unfit for human habitation would not be permitted. Although we have had a most spirited debate, so far absolutely no reference has been made to the question immediately before the Chair. Senator Gardiner said that we wanted to get back to the peace and quiet that formerly prevailed among political parties in Australia. I agree with him. On 28th October, 1916, we had the first conscription referendum. It was bitterly fought. On 5th May last we had a general election; subsequently we had the State elections in Victoria, and in December last we had a second conscription referendum. So much political strife was aroused by these campaigns that it became almost unsafe to visit what were erstwhile quiet country districts in Victoria. We all know what happened to Senator Barnes, and nearly happened to myself and others during the recent campaign. I was pelted, and I never saw the people worked up to such a state of political excitement as they were during the recent campaign. It behoves us to make an effort to bring back the people to a sane state of mind. Anything that will help in that direction ought to be cheerfully undertaken by us.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 5) 191718","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[4]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The fact that that pledge, made by the then leader of the Labour party has been broken that we have not sent the last man, and may not spend the last shilling to help the boys who have fought so nobly for us is going to do us infinitely more harm than is likely to attend the alleged breaking of the pledge given by Mr. Hughes. The breaking of the Fisher Government pledge means a loss of life and money. If, as honorable senators opposite say, the pledge given by Mr. Hughes has been broken, can they point to any harm that has thereby been occasioned ? Who has been hurt by it ? No one has been injured, and even Senator Grant cannot say that it has had any effect on land values.  Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.30 p.m. When we adjourned for lunch I was referring to some remarks made by Senator Gardiner, the Leader of the Opposition. That honorable gentleman pointed out how necessary it is for us to do away with that feeling of antagonism which is arising between the two parties. I am entirely in accord with the sentiment, and anything that our party can do in that direction ought to be done. When we think for a moment of the vast issues now before Australia; we realize that what we require more than anything else is discouragement of industrial turmoil. I was sorry to hear Senator Gardiner say that the National Governments, both Federal and State, in New South Wales had organized the late strike. I have been connected with industrial work on the employers side for some twentyseven years, and I ought to know something of the matter. I have no hesitation in denying once and for all that the employers or the National Governments, Federal or State, were in any way responsible for that terrible turmoil which arose very soon after the May elections. That was a dreadful strike, which impaired the efficiency of Australia, and jeopardized even the food and other supplies for the boys at the Front. Nothing could be further from the views or desires of the employers than any disruption of the kind. We have now to ask what was the cause of that strike. The cause asserted was an endeavour by the New South Wales Government to introduce a card system into their workshops.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 5) 191718","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[4]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The fear amongst the workers at the time was that the Taylor system would be introduced. The only account I have seen of the Taylor system was that given in the Age a few Saturdays ago, and it. was most interesting. I was surprised to see that, in the United States of America, the men, far from being agitated or displeased with the Taylor system, were working under it in a most harmonious way. I have no knowledge of the system other than that description in the Age, but I gather that it was introduced in order that each worker, by trained movements, might be able to do more efficient work, and do it at greater convenience to himself. It is not a pleasant outlook to a man that he must spend his whole life in one of our modern factories; but we have to do the best we can under the circumstances. In the old days, when we had cottage labour, and the bootmaker and the tailor performed every branch of work in his calling, a pride was taken in the work, and there was something, as it were, to live for. Under the modern system, however, a man becomes simply a cog in a machine; and the question is how we are to improve the conditions. The only way, in my opinion, is by increasing the efficiency of the workers; and to that end there must, in some way} be a card system introduced. But I think the worker is entitled to share in the returns from any increased efficiency that may result; and his share, in addition to any extra money that may be earned, ought to take the shape of lessened time employment. Speaking as a very old employer, I think that somehow or other we ought to make more bearable the lives of the men who work in our great industries. As I have already said, a man or woman who goes into one of our big factories knows perfectly well that they are there for life. We cannot change that system; but, by increasing efficiency, we can, I think, shorten the time that has to be worked. In addition, profitsharing would give the worker an interest in the output of his particular workshop, because, under that system, he becomes partly an employer, and regards the success of the factory as, to some extent, the result of his own personal work. In this direction, I think, lies the solution of this most complex problem.  From whom is the suggestion for cooperation to come ? The employers have continually offered, and, in some cases, actually introduced, cooperation; and in a great many cases the workers have turned down the idea. Under the circumstances, it is up to  honorable senators opposite, and those whom they represent, if they desire to have harmony amongst the classes, to suggest some scheme. We know that our friends opposite lead the employees ; and they ought to discuss the matter cordially with the employers, in order to discover whether there is not some scheme by which the prevailing friction may be abolished. The present system is theoretically wrong. We cannot, in my opinion, have peace under the wages system. We have, on the one hand, the inducement to the employer to get as much work as he can out of the employee, and to pay as little as possible. I do not say that employers act up to this theoretical view to any extent; individuals may, but, as a body, I do not think they do so. On the other hand, the theoretical position of the employee is that he must get as much wages as he can, and, if he carries the theory to its logical conclusion, give as little work as possible.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 5) 191718","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[4]/continue[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We must have our theory right, and the proper practice will follow; at present the theory is not right, and conflict must always go on if we continue our present system. If we could, in some such way as I have suggested, create in the employee a pride and personal interest in the manufactory iri which he is employed, and in the work which he performs if the results of his extra efficiency were paid to him, not only in money, but in lessened time he might still be only a cog in a great machine, but his position would be a very different one from what it is at present. As I said before, I feel sure that in this direction is the solution for that turmoil which every one of us deplores; at any rate, the proposition is worth thinking over. We know that we are only a handful in Australia ; but we desire our people to live lives such as civilized human beings ought to live, and in this direction we ought to set an example.

Nothing but harm to the Commonwealth comes out of these continual disputes; and it is perfectly obvious that the solution is not to be found in arbitration and wages boards. These are only palliatives, and we require something more. I am not afraid to make these suggestions; but I think the first applications of them should come from the men themselves, or their leaders. We have already tried to show the world an example in industrial legislation, but have merely succeeded in producing a blazed trail of strikes; and I think that the only course now left to us is such as I have indicated.  The preceding speakers have so consistently ignored the Supply Bill that I feel that I ought almost to apologize for referring to it . We are asked to vote another large sum of money, and we also have on our hands estimates for Â£37,000,000 of expenditure, apart from war expenditure. This week Parliament will probably adjourn until about the end of April, so that we shall have May and June for the consideration of the Estimates. That means that ten months of the financial year will have expired and tentwelfths of the expenditure will have been incurred. To me, as a business man, that seems an extraordinary procedure, but I know that it is usual. About the last thing Parliament thinks of is the expenditure of money, although a great man has said that finance is the foundation of ell government. At the present time we are living in a fools paradise so .far as the financial affairs of the States and the Commonwealth are concerned. We are actually spending Â£80,000,000 per annum on the war. That expenditure is unavoidable, but our ordinary disbursements are continually increasing. v Some attempt has been made by the present Government to curtail the outgoings, and they have succeeded to some extent. Economy in public finance is a matter to which we should all devote our attention, and our first step should be to allow Ministers more time for the management of their Departments. Ever since this Parliament was elected there has been almost constant political turmoil, and when Ministers are rushing about the country, first in connexion with an election, and afterwards in waging a referendum campaign, they have no time to devote to administration.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 5) 191718","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[4]/continue[17]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The people have definitely denied to the Government power to conscript human life, but on the 5th May the quiet, soberminded electors of the community, , who voted for the Nationalists, instructed them by a huge majority to carry on the government. It is the desire of those people that Australia shall be governed in a quiet, orderly fashion. That being so, it is obviously our duty to allow Ministers to attend to their Departments and give proper supervision to the expenditure of these millions of pounds. Ministers ought to be engaged in administrative work day after day instead of having to appear in Parliament.

The people have said plainly that they wanted this country governed by the Nationalists in the way best calculated to assist in winning the war.  A matter to which I hope the Government will give serious attention is the amalgamation of the taxation and electoral Departments of the States and Commonwealth. In this way an enormous amount of money might be saved directly and much effort saved to the people indirectly. I congratulate the Federal and State taxation officers on the report they have produced as the result of the conference held in Melbourne in March last. They thoroughly investigated the practicability of having uniform taxation machinery for the Commonwealth and the States, and formulated a Bill for submission to Parliament. There are in that draft many things which will require careful revision by Parliament in order to prevent injustice, but the results of the Conference, as a whole, exceed my expectations. We have been told that these Government officers are always looking after their own billets, but at that Conference they gave good advice to us parliamentarians as to what can be, and should be, done. The important question to be decided is whether the collection of taxes should be left to the Commonwealth or to the State authorities. It is contended that this is a State job, but although I have always been an advocate of State rights, I cannot indorse that contention. I feel sure that the exchange of seven different taxing machines for six, as would be the case if the States did the work, would not be thÂ© reform which the people expect. The people clearly desire one taxing medium for the whole of Australia, and, in my opinion, that medium must be the Commonwealth. If we had six different States doing the job, and collecting for the Commonwealth, we should not secure uniformity. There would be different decisions in different States, and the chaos would be as great as at present. But some reform in this direction must come. I assure honorable senators that the returns  for land tax, income tax, wartime profits, and so forth, are piling up to such an extent that it is impossible for a business man to get them compiled. I do not believe there are enough skilled accountants in the country to do this work much longer. The system must break down of its own weight. The compilation of these returns for taxation purposes cannot be intrusted to an ordinary man; the work is of an intricate character, and can be done only by an expert of considerable experience. 1 assure the Senate that business men are reaching the limit of their capacity to prepare returns for taxation purposes. We are continually urged to increase production, but how is it possible for a farmer, for instance, to increase his area under crop if half of his time is occupied in getting his land valued, and in making out returns for the State and Federal authorities? I urge Ministers to investigate this matter thoroughly, and endeavour to bring about an amalgamation of the taxation systems along the lines suggested by the conference of officers. The men who stand up for State rights are mostly to be found on the Government side, because the Labour party as a whole is opposed to the States.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 5) 191718","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[4]/continue[19]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If the advocates of State rights really desire to keep the States alive they will allow the Commonwealth to undertake all taxation work, for the States. For I repeat that there must be only one taxing medium, and only by the Commonwealth doing the work can we secure uniformity. Accountancy of the character that is practised in the State and Federal Taxation Departments could not last a day in any private business establishment.  If we could go behind the scenes in the Commonwealth Taxation Offices we should find a chaotic condition of affairs. I do not blame the officers, because they are overburdened with work, but the public, too, are overburdened, and if an improved state of affairs is not brought about they will rise in their wrath, and we shall have straightout Unification.

This system has saved an enormous number of young lives, and if. we had it in operation in Australia not only could we save a big sum of money to be applied in other directions, but we might reduce the deathrate amongst infants to the same extent as has been done in New .Zealand. The number of babies born in Australia in 1915 was 134,871, and of these 9,430 died during the first year of their life.

Though the States are hard up, and have no money to spend in any direction, they are very anxious to look after the health of children ; and I suggest that some of the money now spent upon the maternity allowance should be given to the States, on the distinct condition that they must spend it on the proper inspection of school, children. In that direction, we would be doing a great deal more good than by spending the money on a maternity allowance, when we know that a good deal of it is wasted, some of it going for the purchase of bangles, and some of it being spent on having a good spree to celebrate a birth. Those are not directions in which the taxpayers money should be spent. If the country has the money to spare and apparently it has we could use it to far greater advantage in having the health of school children thoroughly looked after.

When a Minister has to go from place to place on the business of the country, there is no doubt he is entitled to have a motor car. The whole of his time is at the disposal of the country and his time is most valuable and if he is expected to go to various places, be must reach them iD a very short time, because he has other work to do. Therefore, it is not unreasonable that he should be allowed to employ a motor car at the publics expense. The ordinary member, who has to get from one place to another, should do so in the ordinary way. As for Ministers, the point has to be decided with reference to whatever the custom in regard to such matters may be. The practice should be clearly laid down, so that Ministers may know exactly what they are expected to do. In looking through the various accounts, I find there is only one case of an item for a motor car, and that is in the figures relating to the Department for External Affairs.

No doubt, the disputes we have had will only serve to weld the party and make it a magnificent one capable of governing Australia for a long time to come. I do not wish to take up any further time, because we are anxious to get into recess as soon as possible in order to enable Ministers to settle down and do a little real administrative work. Of late they have been harassed and hunted about the country, and they have hardly had the opportunity of getting together in Cabinet and having those consultations which are so indispensable to the proper business management of the country. If we want to win the war, we must keep Australias finances straight. Ministers are mainly responsible for our finances, and it is only by allowing them time to devote themselves to the administration of the country? as we hope, to see it administered, that they can keep the finances straight. We are bolstered up at present by an expenditure of Â£ S0,000,000 on the war, of which amount Â£56,000,000 is being spent among a population of 5,000,000 in Australia. What will result when that expenditure ceases? The effect will be tremendous. If we are not very careful, and if the finances are not very ably handled, there will be enormous distress. Australia is a great producer of foodstuffs and wool, and will probably be enabled to weather the storm better than any other country if it is properly handled but we must give the Government the opportunity to do something in that direction. For that reason I will not take up any further time.  Senator NEEDHAM (Western Australia [3.11]. While there are many portions of the speech just delivered with which I cannot agree, there were one or two suggestions in it which are deserving of very serious consideration. For instance, the suggested amalgamation of the Federal and State Taxation Department is well worthy of consideration. Not only would a considerable expenditure be saved, but also a vast amount of irritation might be avoided. Senator Ferricks has interjected that there might also be an amalgamation of the Federal and State Electoral Departments, which would lead to a further saving in expenditure. Senator Farbairn might have gone further, and suggested the necessity for the abolition of the employment of temporary hands in the Taxation Departments, because the continuance of the employment of temporary men does not give to the taxpayer, and particularly to the trading concerns of Australia, that sense of security and protection which they should have regarding their business secrets. Men employed in these Departments have access to the innermost secrets of the business community. I make no allegation in regard to the matter, but simply say that if the men who are called upon to investigate such matters were placed on a permanent footing, it would give the public a greater feeling of security and of confidence. In dealing with the question of the maternity allowance, Senator. Fairbairn was a little bit off the track when he spoke of the cause of mortality .among infants. I venture to say that it was not because Parliament granted a maternity allowance of Â£5 to the mother of every child born in Australia that there has been a heavy infantile mortality. ,","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 5) 191718","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[4]/continue[28]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Whether an allowance is made or not? jubilation of that kind will always occur. I suggest to the honorable senator that the best method of preventing an increase in infantile mortality and of preserving the health of the nation would be to nationalize the Health Departments. Under existing conditions those who are possessed of sufficient means can secure the best medical attention for themselves,, their wives, and children; but those who are not overburdened with this worlds goods can secure the assistance of medical men only to the extent which they can pay for it. We know that at times serious operations are necessary for the preservation of health, and the wives of working men have been, and are today, suffering because their husbands cannot afford the big fees necessary to secure for them skilled medical attention for the performance of necessary operations. The matter is, in my opinion, within the purview of this Parliament, and it is time that it devoted its attention to the nationalization of the Health Departments of Australia, Federal and State, and brought the medical men of the Commonwealth under Federal control, in order that the best medical attention might be at the service of the poorest as well as of the richest in the land.

I was very much surprised at the action of the Leader of the Senate yesterday when he introduced the Supply Bill which we are now supposed to be discussing. As representative in this Chamber of the Limpet Ministry and I term them the Limpet Ministry advisedly, because of the way in which they cling to the rock of place and pay in spite of. the pledges they made Senator Millen formally moved that the Supply Bill be read a first time. He practically threw the Bill upon the table and told the Senate to take it or leave it. I remember the time when the honorable senator, as a member of previous Ministries, would not have dared to treat this Chamber with such contumely. What is the reason for the change in his conduct? It is because of his knowledge that he has now big battalions behind him. He probably feels that, that being the case, he can do practically what he likes. The time may come when he will repent of that kind of conduct. I shall not dwell for very long on the famous Bendigo pledge, or upon the individual or collective pledges of the newborn Ministry. During the debate, quotations have been read from newspapers to show that, from the Prime Minister downwards, members of the present Ministry gave their word of honour that they would not attempt to govern this country if the verdict of the people on the 20th December last went against them. They have not kept their word, individually or collectively. It is true that the last Hughes Ministry resigned. It is also true that the GovernorGeneral sent again for the honorable member for Bendigo, the Right Honorable William Morris Hughes, and commissioned him to form a new Ministry. It is also true that the Prime Minister in another place, and Senator Millen in the Senate, read a memorandum from the GovernorGeneral.

Yet, when this very sensible recommendation was made to the Ministry, no action was taken in respect of it. Then7 again, the Government might with advantage turn their attention to rackrenting landlords. I refer to the rackrenting landlords who have increased the rent of the home in which the soldier lived prior to leaving Australia, and from which, in some instances, his wife and children have since been evicted. These are some of the ways in which recruiting might be greatly stimulated. If the Government took the requisite action, we should get more than 7,000 recruits monthly. But when an eligible sees the treatment that is being meted out to our returned soldiers, he naturally exclaims,  I wonder what would happen to me if It enlisted, and if I were spared to come back to Australia. What will happen to my dependants while I am away? These things are a great deterrent to enlistment.

Now this reference to the Australian war loans brings under consideration a very important matter, which, in the opinion of this Board, must most seriously affect future taxation in Australia. Business people have been discussing whether the time has not arrived for a reconsideration of the interest terms of these loans, and, in view of what seems their very farcaching  results, we, your directors, deem it our duty to place before you our well considered opinion. . . . Including the present issue of Â£20,000.000, the Commonwealth war loans, apart from those issued in London, amount to Â£100.000,000, and we are told by the Treasurer that another Â£40,000,000 must be subscribed within the financial year, thus making a total of Â£140,000,000, all of which (if the present system is pursued for the remaining Â£40,000,000) will be capital removed from the area of Australian taxation. Whilst considering this question, there must also be remembered the State borrowings in Australia, the interest on which has a similar immunity from the obligation of contributing to the expenses of the Commonwealth. It is, of course, known generally, though not perhaps in detail, that the immunity thus afforded benefits chiefly the wealthy class, whose incomes, if derived from other invest ments, would be liable to be taxed on the higher scale, and that the wealthier the individual the greater the advantage gained by investments in the war loans, or in State Government loans. There is therefore this anomaly, the Commonwealth Government declares with one voice that graduated taxation (which means the wealthier the taxpayers the higher the tax) is equitable, and most people in these days of war and high prices, even those paying taxes on the higher rate, agree with these views, provided they are not carried to extremes, and that the lower incomes also pay a moderate amount of taxation. The other Government voice, speaking in regard to the war loan, virtually says: There shall be no graduated taxation in regard to this form of investment. This second decision makes the war loan at 44 per cent., with exemption from taxation, a splendid investment for the very rich investor, for, though he would be quite willing to be patriotic and to make sacrifices in such times as these in order to help his country, no sacrifices are asked from him. On the other hand, the investment is not equally good for those with only a modest amount of capital. It will make my remarks clearer if I go a little into detail and give the varying returns of respective income. A tabulated statement beside me shows that to persons residing in Victoria investments in the war loan, with exemption from taxation, compare with an investment on mortgage subject to both Federal and State taxation, as follows: To an investor with Â£500 per annum, the 4i per cent war loan is equal to Â£4 14s. 6d., or nearly 4| per cent, received from interest on mortgage. To an investor with Â£1,000 per annum the equivalent of Â£4 19s. 2d., or nearly 5 per cent. To an investor with Â£3,000 per annum, Â£5 10s. 5d., or just over 5i per cent. To an investor with Â£5,500 per annum, Â£6 0s. 8d., just over (J per cent. To an investor with Â£10,000 per annum, Â£6 0s. 9d., say, 6* per cent. And by the time we reach a man with Â£30,000 per annum, it is equivalent to Â£6 18s. 4d., or nearly 7 per cent. ^","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 5) 191718","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[5]/quote[2]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

We heard something about shirkers during the recent campaign, this term having been applied to the young manhood of Australia that had not enlisted. I admit there are shirkers in our community, but they are not to be found among the fighting manhood of Australia, and particularly among the manhood of Western Australia. They have to be looked for amongst the wealthy people of the Western and other States, as I intend to show presently by quoting some figures relating to the loan subscriptions. Last year, when the Treasurer (Sir John Forrest) floated his Liberty Loan, aeroplanes were flying over Melbourne dropping pamphlets asking the people to take up Liberty bonds, and I remind the Senate that when war broke out there was no need then for aeroplanes to fly over Melbourne or other places to urge the young men of Australia to go to the assistance of the Mother Country. They volunteered at once, and unconditionally. They did not ask what they were going to get in the way of pay, but it has been necessary to appeal in this way to the wealthy patriots of this country in order to get money to equip and feed these men and transport them overseas. The Liberty Loan was subscribed to in the different States as follows: Victoria, Â£8,401,010; New South Wales, Â£7,937,750; Queensland, Â£1,584,680; South Australia, Â£1,393,606; Tasmania, Â£394,270; Western Australia, Â£294,240.

If such a force was necessary, it should have been established on 27th October, 1916, when at Albany a band of about 1,500 New Zealand conscript soldiers was let loose and charged my humble self. Rotten eggs were thrown then, but we heard no talk of establishing a Commonwealth police force to protect a little chap like me. But because another little fellow, Mr. Hughes, while spending twenty minutes on the Warwick railway station, had a rotten egg thrown at him, this force was established. The creation of such a force is one of the greatest farces in modern history.

The Bill now before us is one to grant and apply out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund a certain sum for the services of the year ending 30th June next, and I understand that, in discussing such a measure, it is the privilege of honorable senators to wander from Dan to Beersheba. In other words, on the motion for the first reading of a Supply Bill, it is open to us to discuss anything under the sun. I have listened for some time to the criticism of . the Opposition as to what has occurred during the last three months. I recognise that, under our Constitution, it is the privilege of His Majestys Opposition to oppose. It is also the duty of His Majestys Opposition to criticise. But it seems to me that, in these perilous, parlous times, something more is required from supporters of the National Government on this side, and opponents of the National Government sitting on the other side. My honorable friend, Senator Needham, referred to the circumstances surrounding the recent reference of the principle of universal military .service to the people. I occupy a somewhat unique position in the Senate, inasmuch as owing to my absence from Australia I have been out of the turmoil of the last three months. I left Australia on the 24th October last with the full knowledge and acquiescence of my leader in the Senate and the Prime Minister. If honorable senators will throw back their memories they will admit that the war situation at that time appeared to be fairly and reasonably satisfactory. There did not seem to be on the horizon such a cloud as that which developed within the next few weeks. The pledge I gave as a Na tionalist to the electors of New South Wales was an indorsement of that given by the Prime Minister at Bendigo that neither by legislative enactment nor parliamentary procedure would conscription be brought in over the heads of the people, but that, should the position of the war become unsatisfactory, should we have an unexpectedly grave reverse, or should the position become very different from what it then was, the whole matter would have to be reconsidered. In the course of that reconsideration, it was said, it might be deemed reasonable and proper to again put the issue to the people. My honorable, friend quoted a speech made by Senator Pearce in Sydney on 31st October, in which he stated that the voluntary system was not up to that time unsatisfactory, and, by implication, gave the people to understand that the issue of conscription was not even on the horizon. I would remind Senator Needham that during the first week of November the whole position changed. A nervous people were waiting news of what eventually turned out to be a great Italian debacle. Closely following that, despite the hopes we had in Kerensky, Korniloff, and Kaledin, there was again revolution in Russia a revolution which most of us believed would mean ultimate chaos and a separate peace with Germany.  These, then, are the reasons why a reconsideration of the position was necessary. And unless the National Government had reconsidered the position in view of these changed circumstances they would not have kept the pledge which Mr. Hughes gave at Bendigo, and which I, together with every member of the National party, gave to the electors. In these circumstances, I think the Government were quite justified in again submitting the question to the arbitrament of the sovereign electors. But for the fact that two cables sent to me in Java went wrong, I should have returned to Australia and supported to the utmost of my ability the position the Government took up. I am, and have been for many years, a consistent believer in universal military service. I hail with a good deal of satisfaction the fact that, owing to the support of my honorable friends on the other side, and of my friends on this side, now members of the National party, we have on the statutebook today the principle of compulsory military service in Australia. It is the only fair service, the only fair course; and when the destinies of the nations are at stake I see nothing wrong in again asking the people to vote upon the question. I regret very much the result of that vote. I may say, however, that I have never been enthusiastic in regard to putting the question a second time. I hold the view and I was quite frank about it last session that the difference of a few thousand volunteers a month was not worth the risk of all the acrimony, turmoil, and dissension that, to my regret, arose last December. However, it is very easy to criticise after the event we are all wise then. I am sure that most honorable senators on both sides extremely regretted the acrimony and turmoil during the last referendum. But speaking as a member of the National party, so far as I am concerned any further attempt to conscript the people of Australia for service outside the Commonwealth will have my opposition. The matter should be regarded as settled; the fears of some people should be allayed, and a very clear and early pronouncement made by the Government that the last referendum is regarded as settling the question, so that the way may be opened towards some sort of national unity in the menace that we have to face. I am much interested in the enlistment figures that, were quoted by the Leader of the Opposition Senator Gardiner. Speaking from memory, those figures put the position, so far as the enlistment of single men in Australia is concerned, in a very favorable light. In this Senate, while quibbling over a good many irrelevant issues1, we have heard but little talk of what is going on in the world. We know that there is a war in progress, and that it has been going on for three and a half years; and we know that it is a war the like of which this world has never seen. It is not only a war of soldiers and sailors of munitions and military operations ; it is a war in the air, on the water, under the water, on the land, and under the land it is a war of organization, of industries, money, metals, and food. And, in spite of our inability to send many more soldiers to the fighting front, there yet remains power amongst the people left in Australia to help, and in some way fur ther the interests of the Empire and the cause of our Allies.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 5) 191718","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Britain is straining every nerve, not only to help our Allies, but to beat .back an impending assault from the combined German and Austrian armies that may yet change the destinies of the Empire. These are the thoughts that have been going through my mind in the course of my return to Australia in considering our position in connexion with the war. At the time the referendum was decided upon no day in the history of the war since the retreat from Mons had been blacker than that which saw the Italian debacle and the Russian counter revolution.  Something has been said about the percentages of manhood engaged in actual military and naval services. The figures show, approximately, that France has 15 per cent, of her manhood engaged, while Britain has 13 per cent. , and also millions of men and women making munitions for herself and her Allies. The Australian figures show, approximately, that we have enlisted 8 per cent, of our population for military and naval services, that 6^ per cent, of that 8 per cent, has gone overseas. I do not think it will be contradicted by any of the Allied nations engaged in the war that the quality of the men we have sent Home has not been exceeded in any regiment of any nation at any time. Our men have proved themselves, if at times bad soldiers, always good fighters. All these men have been equipped in Australia, from top to toe, in a way that is a credit to this country. We have transported these men 12,000 miles oversea, and I am sure that very few of us four years ago would have credited that Australia could have sent 300,000 soldiers to Europe an army that exceeded the British Army that was sent to South Africa some years ago and could have raised Â£150,000,000 for war purposes. In addition we have produced enormous quantities of wheat, wool, meat, and metals, all very necessary commodities in helping to carry on the war. I do not think there is a member of the Senate, or of another place, but who will willingly admit that Australia has done well.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 5) 191718","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[6]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","PRATTEN, Herbert","K1J","N/A","N/A","N/A","3386","Australia, as I say, has done a very fair proportion, but I do not think that! Australia, Canada, England, or any part of the Empire, or of the civilized world, can do too much in view of the menace before us. It would seem that, after three and a half years of conflict after the spur that war has given to science and invention, after the sufferings that the fighters and the workers have endured there is a very changed feeling running throughout the world with regard to war and matters pertaining to war. It is clear that, if we approach peace at all during the next few months, it will be a. peace by understanding, and that, if a peace by understanding is made, Australia may not retain German New Guinea. It is clear that shall I say? the jingoes, from a military or naval point of view, may not achieve all they would like, or all thÃ©v have laid down as desirable, and there is surging up through the Democracies of the whole world a feeling about the fatuity of the struggle. There is surging up, in the Democracies of Europe, as well as in the Democracies of AngloSaxondom, a feeling that, in view of the sacrifices and of the fatuity of the military operations, war should never again be possible. Once an honorable peace is achieved it will, I believe, usher in an era of better understanding and greater appreciation of the benefits of peace. All persons who value the preservation of civilization will be found prepared to do everything and anything at the present juncture to get rid of war for all time.  I appeal to honorable senators opposite to, if possible, bury the past. I know that the temptations of party criticism are very keen, and that it is their constitutional duty to oppose; but it seems to me, in the present parlous condition of the worlds affairs, that the time has come to sink all minor differences, and, at least for a season, try to so help the Empire in the war as to achieve a permanent peace. When we reflect that this country of ours contains 3,000,000 square miles, and is held by only 5,000,000 people, it must be clearly evident that we have other problems to consider. I have had the privilege and pleasure of visiting the East, or what is known as the East, a good many times. I know something about the various nationalities inhabitating the territories from Tokio to the littoral of the Red Sea. I know something about the 400,000,000 industrious Chinese who are being crowded in their country, and are still increasing. I know something of the 300,000,000 Indians within the Empire, and it was somewhat of a surprise to me to hear, a month or two ago, from very authentic sources, that whispers are circulating in the bazaars of the overpopulated East that there is a big, empty, desirable land to the south. This war is beginning to set up the principle that the nations who hold must use, and in this regard I have paid some attention to what has been called by newspaper writers  the shadow of a developing Asia. It may be news to honorable senators that, whilst we in Australia have been talking about shipbuilding, Chinese capital in Singapore has nearly completed two 3,000ton wooden vessels, which are being equipped with auxiliary motor engines, and in two or three months will be on the water earning dividends for their owners. It may be news to honorable senators that many Chinese, who ten years ago were hewers of wood and drawers of water, and were earning perhaps 9d. per day, have become today, by a short course of training, clever artificers, who are able to handle the most complicated electrical, steam, or hydraulic machinery. The knowledge of the East with regard to industrial matters is very rapidly advancing. Cotton mills, iron works, and very many of the larger and more important basic industries of civilization, are being developed there; and I remind the Senate that one of Australias many problems is how, in the face of the awakening Orient, we can preserve this great empty land for our own kith and kin. During the recess upon which we are about to enter, it will be the duty and responsibility of the National Government to endeavour to do something towards the solution of these problems. Senator Needham stated that the rich men of Western Australia have not contributed in fair proportion to the Liberty Loan. I hold that one of the most, if not the most, important question connected with the future of Australia is finance. Neither this Government, nor any Government that has been in office since the outbreak of the war, has grappled with this question as it should have done. Looming ahead of us is a war debt, of, probably, from Â£150,000,000 to Â£200,000,000 sterling. It may be heresy .to say so, but I believe the time is coming when we shall have to consider compulsion with regard to subscriptions to the war loan. If we wish to keep our financial sanity, we shall require to evolve a practical method of paying off our war debt within a reasonable time, instead of placing the whole of. the burden on the shoulders of posterity. I see no solution of the problem except a compulsory levy on wealth for the purpose of paying our war debt. It would be infinitely preferable to bravely realize what the financial future is to be, and to make provision for it, than to have always before us the spectre of additional and crushing taxation in order to pay interest and small sinking funds in connexion with our national debt. I believe that the bulk of the people who have money would much prefer a wealth levy spread over a number of years, and with proper restrictions and limitations on future Governments with regard to taxation. T noticed that recently Mr. Bonar Law stated that it might be necessary to do something of that sort in Great Britain. At all events, the financial problem must be faced, and I hope the Ministry will take it seriously into consideration during the coming recess. I am entirely in agreement with Senator Needham in regard to the present position of the war loans. Whatever might be said in the early stages of the war when we were faced with the unknown, and in our optimistic Australian way thought the crisis would soon be over, regarding the advisability of issuing war loans bearing 4^ per cent, interest, and free of State and Federal income tax, the time has gone by when we can continue that policy. Owing to the length of the war, and the enormous expenditure it has necessitated, these 4Â£ per cent, war loans, if continued, will be the best investment in the world for the rich man. The British Government has partly faced the problem by issuing a recent loan that carried interest at 4 per cent, free of income taxation, or 5 per cent, with income taxation. . I repeat that it is the duty of the Government to take into earnest consideration the whole financial position and outlook. I should like to say a few words in regard to the Northern Territory. I have placed on the noticepaper some questions which have not yet been answered, but I think the facts will show that, instead of the Northern Territory being the Cinderella of Australia, it has during the last six or seven years under Commonwealth administration gone from bad to worse. It seems to be an ulcer in the body politic. We are spending now, practically in interest and losses, nearly halfamillion pounds per annum, and the net result seems to have been an increase in population of from 2,000 to 4,000, the new arrivals being principally Patagonians, Greeks, Russians, and other aliens, who came to Australia temporarily at the invitation of the Government, and will return to their homes as soon as their work is finished. I believe, too, that a sum approximating Â£13,000 to Â£15,000 per annum has been spent on the Lands and Agricultural Department over a number of years, and the net result of that expenditure is that there are. only ten farmers on the land. lt would have been infinitely cheaper for the Commonwealth to have given each of those farmers a bonus of Â£1,000, or even Â£5,000, not to go to the Territory. In that land, where one cannot wear a starched collar for more than a month or two in the year, there are other administrative evils. The State hotels are a disgrace to the Government.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 5) 191718","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[6]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Of course, it is easy to criticise and pull down, but at this time we ought to attempt to do a little building up. Suggestions have been made that instead of the present Commonwealth control and centralization in Melbourne instead of having the Territory administered from various capitals by various organizations for instance, the Customs Department and the Defence Department are controlled from Brisbane, the Post Office from Adelaide, and Naval Defence from Melbourne there should be formed a council on the lines of the executive body in a British Crown possession, consisting of nominees of the Government and various other interests. At any rate, if the principle of home rule is believed in, the sooner we apply it to the Northern Territory the better for Australia. Rather than allow the present unsatisfactory state of affairs to continue, I would suggest that the Commonwealth should open up negotiations with the Queensland Government for that State to take over control of the Territory in some way.

That Mr. Lloyd George has accepted this principle is shown by many of the appointments that he has made during the last twelve months. It is late now for us to follow his example, but better late than never. I consider that the Defence Department should coopt some of the business brains and instincts of Australia rather than leave the square pegs in round holes and round pegs in square holes we see all over Australia.  The Prime Ministers Department seems to me to be overweighted. Those who have been brought into contact with its many and varied operations are quite assured that the Prime Minister, enthusiastic and able as he is, is overweighted with the work of controlling them.

Meeting again on 11th July, 1917, it sat for two months and. ten days, and adjourned on the 26th September for three months and two weeks. Meeting on the 9 th January of this year it sat for one minute, and adjourned for a week and a day. It is now sitting intermittently, and the Supply Bill before us intimates that we are to adjourn immediately until the middle of April. After sitting for two or three weeks, we adjourn for three months. I am dealing with lunar months; it is appropriate when referring to the Prime Minister. When we meet again, Parliament will have been in session for seven lunar months out of thirtyone months since Mr.( Hughes became Prime Minister, and will have been in recess for twentyfour months. Yet a responsible senator, representing the State of Victoria, urge3 Parliament to go into recess in order to enable the Government to have sufficient time to formulate a policy.  I commented previously on the fact that the House of Commons sat almost continuously since the outbreak of the war. But in Australia we have a National Government of the Commonwealth meeting Parliament during about only onefourth of the time that has been spent in recess. Our record in this respect is not a good one. People outside may have been led. to believe that members of this Parliament have had a very easy time of it. But that is not the case, because ever since the outbreak of the war there has been a continuous uncertainty as to when Parliament would assemble, or for how long it would adjourn. Members of this Parliament have not known what position they would be in. They have been un able to make their domestic arrangements, and have been almost continually travelling from State to State at the maximum of expense and inconvenience with the minimum of service rendered to the country. During the course of this debate, not merely in Parliament, but also in the press outside, there have been many references to the fact that the Prime Minister and his Government have broken Â» pledge made by Mr. Hughes at Bendigo. I may say candidly that the breaking by Mr. Hughes of a pledge given by him to the people at Bendigo or at any other place was not a matter of surprise to me. He has broken so many pledges, verbal and written, that what would have surprised me would have been to learn that he had kept his pledge. As a result of the action which the Prime Minister has taken we are faced with a peculiar political situation. This is very apparent from what is at present appearing in the newspapers. In connexion with the situation which now exists, I might make some passing reference to the part which the GovernorGeneral has played in quite recent times. The ordinary constitutional course in the circumstances which arose was, as the Leader of the Labour party in the Senate has pointed out, for the GovernorGeneral, upon the resignation of the Prime Minister, to send for the Leader of the Opposition and commission him to form a Ministry. Had that been done, and had Mr. Tudor refused, or expressed his inability, to form a Government, the GovernorGeneral would have been quite justified in resorting to other means in the endeavour to find out the possibilities of Parliament in the matter of the formation of a Government. But to recommission the retiring Prime Minister without giving an opportunity to the Leader of the constitutional Opposition to form a Government was a breach of constitutional practice. Ever since this gentleman has been in Australia we have had evidence of peculiar decisions on his part. Those decisions have occasioned much food for thought. He played a very discreditable part in what is known as the Senate scandal, and is otherwise known as the ReadyEarle incident. Recent events have led me to consider how conveniently the GovernorGeneral happened to be in Sydney about the time that Senators Gardiner and Russell and Mr. Higgs refused to approve of a certain regulation under the War Precautions Act. A Cabinet meeting was hastily convened in Sydney at the time to proclaim the regulation, and the GovernorGeneral very conveniently happened to be there. I have obtained from the Sydney Worker of 25th October, 1917, the following very excellent summary dealing with the sudden retirement of exSenator Ready from this Chamber, and the substitution in his place of Senator Earle. It shows the lightning change that took place Great Display of Speed. Just here it is interesting to note the rapidity with which the following machinery moves were made all between 6.1 p.m. and midnight on 1st March: (1)Beady resigns his seat as senator in Federal Parliament. (2)President announces same in Senate and officially notifies GovernorGeneral. (3)GovernorGeneral officially notifies Governor of Tasmania of Readys resignation. (4) Mr. Earle in Melbourne resigns his State seat in Tasmania. Resignation to go to Tasmanian Speaker. (5)GovernorGeneral notifies Tasmanian Governor that he has attested Earles signature and resignation, which was written in his presence. (6)Tasmanian Speaker takes steps to fill vacancy. Matter reported to Tasmanian Government. (7)Tasmanian Governor brings matter under notice of Tasmanian Premier to call meeting of State Executive Council convened to appoint a senator to fill the vacancy until the next election. (8)Earle has to be officially asked and to accept nomination for position of senator. (9)State Cabinet has to elect him. (10)State Premier notifies State Governor. (11)State Governor of Tasmania officially certifies to GovernorGeneral in Melbourne that Senate vacancy has been constitutionally filled. What master hands must have been at work to accomplish all these things in so short a time, and in such a way that they fitted one into the other with dovetail accuracy? This all happened between 6.1 p.m. and midnight of 1st March, 1917.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 5) 191718","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[7]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I think that the attention of the people of Australia should be called to the attitude which the present GovernorGeneral has adopted in connexion with what may be termed domestic affairs, apart from his constitutional position. I take this opportunity of protesting against what I may say is the partisanship which he has displayed in this connexion. The best evidence that Mr. Hughes was not able to give the GovernorGeneral an assurance of any weight or worth that he could carry on the government of the country is to be found in the developments that have taken place since the present Administration was formed. Two statements on the present position appeared in the newspapers today : one from Mr. Austin Chapman and the other from Sir William Irvine, which give no assurance of solidarity in the Ministerial party, but quite the contrary. The present division in the Nationalist party is the most damaging commentary upon the decision of the GovernorGeneral that could possibly be imagined.

I rarely refer to the Prime Minister as  Billy Hughes, but I did on that occasion, because as soon as I read the report of the Warwick incident, knowing Mr. Hughes, and knowing his speeches and writings, I was able to fasten the dictation of the newspaper report of the affair on to the Prime Minister. Subsequent information confirmed my assumption, because I was informed next night when I was at Warwick by a gentleman who travelled from Warwick to Wallangarra on the same train as Mr. Hughes, that between Warwick and Wallangarra the typewriters of the two publicity agents were going at about nineteen words to the dozen, and the press reports of the incident were despatched from Wallangarra.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 5) 191718","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[7]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

At Ipswich, Toowoomba, and Brisbane he made the statement,  I have the power, and have had it ever since 5th May last, to conscript every one of you, men and women. I could conscript you at ls. per day and send those eligible for military service overseas and send others to trawlers and minesweeping at ls. per day. He did not mention the other members of his Government or the party behind him, but said that he personally had the power, and might have put it into execution at any time since the 5th May, which was but a poor compliment to the other members of his Government and the party behind him. The people hearing such statements naturally came to the conclusion that if he really possessed that power it was a very dangerous power for any man to have in Australia,, and it would be very unwise to give him any further power. I think that the judgment of the people of Australia, and of Queensland in particular, as expressed at the referendum, was right.  We have been told ever since the outbreak of the war that it is necessary to conscript Australians and send them 12,000 miles away to fight for honour, freedom, and liberty. I want to say that when Australia, on the 28th October, 1916, and on the 20th December, 1917, turned down conscription for oversea service, it did more in the interests of honour, freedom, and liberty than all the armies of all the nations have done or will do on the field of battle since the . outbreak of tha war. In my view, the decision of Australia in this matter will have a lasting and beneficial effect on the history of the world, not only for generations, but for centuries to come. Does it not occur te honorable senators that if Australia had adopted conscription the militarist powers of the world would have said, There is Australia, the most advanced Democracy in the world, with adult suffrage, embracing conscription? What is good enough for the leading Democracy of the world is good enough for an Autocracy, and so militarism would have been everywhere to stay. In my opinion, Australias example will be the commencement of an agitation for the abolition of conscription in every country in the world, and that will take place perhaps sooner than some of the sceptics imagine. Generations who come after us will bless those who voted  No  for preserving inviolate the freedom of Australia from military despotism and tyranny.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 5) 191718","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[7]/continue[16]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It was not in the best interests of the Allies, Great Britain, or Australia that the question of conscription should ever have been raised here. In June or July, 1915, the enlistments under the voluntary system had totalled 36,500 for one month. Was not that enough? Yet about that time the party opposite started howling for conscription, which was unreasonable, and should never have been raised. Where Senator Pearce has done mischief in Australia has been by his weakness as administrative head of the Defence Department. As a weak Minister, he has given the military serangs and militarism in Australia such freedom to go ahead that they were doing very well in the way of introducing Prussianism here without adopting conscription at all.

On the question of the terms of peace what should we as Australians do? Everybody has accepted the basis of no annexations, no indemnities, and freedom of the seas. That opens up a point raised by Senator Bakhap this afternoon in a question to the Leader of the Government here (Senator Millen) regarding the Pacific Islands. Lloyd George, President Wilson, and others proclaim that this is not a war of annexation. Then if Australia, or the Australian Government on its behalf, takes up an immovable attitude with regard to the Pacific Islands, will that not be regarded as annexation ?

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","FERRICKS, Myles","JYT","N/A","N/A","N/A","3396","I leave that for the honorable senator to say. On the occasion of the recent referendum, I was compelled to answer a number of questions which were put to me under Regulation 25 of the War Precautions Act. First, I was asked whether I was a naturalized British subject. I replied,  No, adding that I was Australianborn. I was then asked where my father and mother were born. I replied that my father and mother and their progenitors, back to the time of the Spanish Armada at least, were born in the county of Mayo, Ireland. It is sometimes suggested, I know, that we have Spanish blood in our veins, because of our dark complexion. However, I saw that the challenging of my vote was merely an attempt to heap indignity on me, so I smilingly answered all the questions that were put to me. I added,  I suppose that this is a sample of the freedom for which we are asked to conscript Australian soldiers 12,000 miles overseas to fight a sample of the Prussianism against which we are alleged to be fighting. Seeing that I am the last of a family of twelve who have been reared in Australia, I was surprised the other day to receive the following communication: [Regulation 25(8)  Commonwealth of Australia. Military Service Referendum 1917. To Myles Aloysius Ferricks, of Old Sandgateroad, Eagle Junction, Brisbane. In connexion with the referendum held on the 20th December, 1917, the ballotpaper issued to you was indorsed Regulation 25, and placed in the prescribed envelope (which was fastened) and has been forwarded to me in such (fastened) envelope for the purpose of scrutiny. In order that I may be in a position to satisfy myself as to whether your ballotpaper is to be accepted for further scrutiny, or rejected, I hereby require you to furnish information so as to reach me on or before 17th January, 1918, as to whether or not (a)you are a naturalized British subject who was born in an enemy country within the meaning of the War Precautions (Military Service Referendum) Regulations 1917; and (b)your father was born in an enemy country within the meaning of the aforesaid Regulations. If you fail to furnish me with information as aforesaid on or before the said date, the ballotpaper may be rejected. Dated the 9th day of January, 1918. Geo. E. Driver, Divisional Returning Officer for the Division of Lilley. Address Albion. I thought that as I had satisfactorily answered all the questions put to me, my vote should have been allowed without further question, but, presumably because I had taken a prominent part in the anticonscription campaign in Australia and Queensland, an attempt was made to heap indignity upon me. I think that the action of the Government in disfranchising Australianborn citizens on the occasion of the recent referendum was unworthy of any Ministry professing to be imbued with a sense of fairness, and I believe that it deprived the Yes side of quite a lot of votes. I am of opinion that many of those who, at the previous election, voted under section 9 of the Electoral Act, and who were disfranchised at the recent referendum for various reasons voted  Yes  at the first referendum. Those reasons, from the German standpoint, can be readily understood, and I think that one of them was fear. They feared that if their votes were placed in sealed envelopes they would be interned. They also thought that German districts in Australia would benefit if many thousands of our soldiers were sent overseas. But, whether the Government lost or gained by their action, it was a scandalous thing to deprive Australian natives of a vote, many of whom were better Australians than the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) ever was or ever will be. A man who is so obsessed with Imperialism as he is will never become a good Australian, even if he attains to the age of 100 years. Before the last adjournment of the Senate took place I was one of those who held that the recent industrial upheaval, particularly in New South Wales, was the result of a conspiracy between a combination of capitalism and of the  Governments throughout the Commonwealth. I hold in my hands something which confirms my belief in that connexion. 1 find that, towards the last . week in September, the London Times published a series of articles headed  The Ferment of Revolution. The Times advised the people to put down this rising army of organized labour. It stated that the British nation was divided into two armies one composed of business and professional men, agriculturists, and workers, in privatelycontrolled industries; while the other consisted of large numbers of wellorganized workers in Governmentcontrolled industries. These Northcliffe articles pointed out that, the struggle between the two factions may develop into a sort of civil war , but that the danger must be faced, and  it is a small risk compared to those undertaken by our armies in Flanders and Mesopotamia. How the war was to be waged against the workers was hinted at in the following passage :  Those who are loyal to the nation should do the work of the nation themselves, and allow no one to impede them. That was how the menace of organized labour was to be met by wholesale blacklegging, It was just about that period when the attack on labour was made in Australia. The articles in the Times extended over a week, and seemed designed to provoke the workers to rise against the capitalistic class. Doubtless, it was thought that, with the continuance of the war, the workers would be divided and the capitalists would thus be able to crush what they termed  the serpent of unionism  for all time. I am quite convinced that the same conspiracy was launched in Australia, and that it culminated with the Sydney strike, with which my leader in this chamber dealt so exhaustively on a previous occasion. I know that frantic efforts were made to extend that strike to Queensland, and also to Victoria. The members of my own party were in close contact with the members of the Strike Defence Committee, who were making desperate endeavours to prevent the extension of the struggle. But the Employers Federation and the Chamber of Manufactures desired to extend the trouble to Victoria.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 5) 191718","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[7]/continue[36]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When one sees departmental heads, not only going out on strike, but subscribing to the strike funds, one naturally becomes suspicious, remembering that these people have never in their existence cast a vote for Labour. The antiLabour newspaper boosted these gentlemen much more than it did the men on the other side.  Whilst the Leader of the Government in this Chamber is present, I desire to bring under his notice the internment of an Australian native from the Gladstone district, named Schache. He was the secretary of the Labour organization in that area, and one who to whom, by virtue of his office, anticonscription leaflets were sent during the conscription campaign. In connexion with the distribution of that literature, writs have been issued by the Prime Minister against Mr. Ryan, Premier of Queensland; Mr. Theodore, Treasurer of that State; Mr. Cuthbert Butler, organizer of the anticonscription cam *paign; and Mr. Lewis McDonald, secretary of the central executive. The cases have not yet come on for hearing, and, in the meantime, Mr. Schache has Deen interned. When I was coming down from Queensland, I encountered on the platform exSenator Mullan; Mr. Lane, a member of the executive of the Australian Workers Union ; and Mr. Kelly, who occupies a similar position. Mr. Schache who has done valuable work in the cause of Labour in Queensland for years, was travelling by the same train under a military guard, and we asked the guard if we might exchange a word with him. We were allowed to talk to him for a couple of minutes, but the person in charge acted with so much dominance that he forced from me the remark,  We have a lot to be thankful for, in that conscription was not carried. I ask Senator Millen to inform the Senate why this man was interned. Inquiries have been made in Queensland, officially and otherwise, and we have been told that in 1916 a report on this man went to the GovernorGeneral. Many such reports, no doubt, have been made concerning persons with German names. Schache being in close contact with the Waterside Workers Association, was, I assume, a waterside worker. If Senator Millen feels unable to state publicly here why he was interned, I ask him to give me the reasons. There are ugly rumours in Queensland concerning the matter, it being said that there was an ulterior motive for the internment that Schache has been interned, not because of his connexion with any unlawful association, but with a sinister object. As secretary to a Labour organization in Gladstone, he was one of some 250 recipients of anticonscription literature, and Mr. Hughes seized on the fact that he has a German name. The news was flashed throughout the Commonwealth that the AntiConscription Committee in Queensland was sending its literature to a man named Schache. Writs have been issued against four citizens of the State for having sent this literature to this man, but before they were put into execution he was interned.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 5) 191718","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[7]/continue[37]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I had the pleasure of looking over those immense works erected at Darwin by Vestey Brothers, and while there it occurred to me that they were not the class of people to invest such a huge sum of money in an industry if they thought it was likely to prove a failure. I expected that while Senator Pratten was criticising the administration of and the methods employed in the Territory, he would offer some observations concerning the reappointment of the present Administrator, and of the fact that he was kept in Melbourne in doubt as to whether he was to be reappointed or not for almost seven months, during which time he was allowed Â£2 2s. a day expenses, in addition to his salary of Â£1,700 a year; but no word of protest came from the honorable senator.

They prate about doing so much for our soldiers on the other side of the world, but when our fighting men return they will find that they will have to assist in meeting the bill. Few people, I repeat, realize the extent of our war indebtedness, and that it carries with it an annual interest liability of Â£8,747,000. Surely honorable senators have a right to ask what the Government intend to do to liquidate it? This interest bill is a mighty obligation that is not going to be liquidated by the issue of war bonds bearing interest at 4$ per cent., and exempt from all taxation. I was rather glad to hear Senator Pratten discuss this question as he did this afternoon, showing that there is sitting behind the Government at least one honorable senator who takes strong exception to the financial methods which, so far, have been employed. Then there is that greatest of all questions, the repatriation of those who have gone to the Front, who have done their duty and have come back to Australia, many of them in a maimed condition. For over three years we have been at war, and with the exception of a few very fine speeches such as those which the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen) can so readily make, nothing has been done towards solving that great problem. Surely the representatives of the people of Australia are entitled to know what are the intentions of the Government in respect to the financial position of the Commonwealth and the repatriation of our soldiers. Surely the Government do not anticipate hostility to any genuine, honest., practical, intelligent effort in that direction. We all know that the bill has to be met, and the party to which I have the honour to belong will, I feel confident, render every assistance in the liquidation of this debt and in the solution of the other great problem that confronts us.  I am now supplied with, information that will enable me to show Senator Russell that it is unwise for him to rush into an argument with an imperfect memory. I do not know that I could put his position in a milder form. If he turns to Hansard, page 4267, he will find that when introducing a Supply Bill in the Senate in June last he made a few observations. I shall hand Hansard to him, and after he has read the report I shall consider his apology. There are one or two other matters to which I desire to refer. In dealing with a Supply Bill honorable senators are allowed considerable latitude, and like those who have already, contributed to this debate, I intend to avail myself of my privileges.

But most important result of all, it killed for all time sectarianism, that last refuge of the miserable type of politician. The vote of the people demonstrated that bigotry and sectarianism shall never again be a determining factor in the national politics of Australia. I am thankful tq the tolerantminded Protestant section of the Australian people for the grand response they made in opposition to the worst tactics that a*ny Government or party can employ. The most continuous efforts were consistently made to insult a very large section of the Australian community. The most diabolical cartoons I have ever seen, or wish to see, were exhibited on every railway station in Victoria. Included amongst them was a picture of Australia encircled in the toils of a green serpent, and on each coil, was written.  I.W,W.ism,  Sinn Feinism.  ProGermanism, and  The General Strike, implying that these were the sentiments for which the Irish people and the Catholics of Australia stood. That cartoon daily met the gaze of many mothers, brothers, and sisters of Catholic soldiers while their hearts were torn with grief at .the loss of some near and dear relative in the Empires cause. Honorable senators opposite say they had nothing to do with the issue of that cartoon. The Government must have sanctioned its use, or it would not have been distributed as it was in such a wholesale manner, and I say that any Government who are responsible for such diabolical propaganda are not entitled to a position in this Parliament, or to the respect of any decent man or woman. The Nationalist party will answer for that insult to the Irish and the Roman Catholics of Australia when next the people have an opportunity of expressing their judgment upon it.

Throughout Australia, clergymen of other denominations advocated conscription morning, noon, and night, and nobody ever challenged their right to express their views; but immediately another minister of religion saw fit to take a different view he was selected for the most bitter, insolent, and impertinent abuse that members of the Nationalist party could bring against him. The fearless attitude adopted by Dr. Mannix in connexion with the conscription campaign has endeared him more than ever to the freedomloving people of Australia.  Another scurrilous production issued during the campaign was the Antis Creed, but although it contains statements of which honorable senators on the Government side ought to be ashamed, I do not take the same strong view of it as I did of the sectarian attacks. It is stated in the Antis Creed that members on this side believe in the sinking of the Luisitania, in murder on the high seas, in the Industrial Workers of the World, in the massacre of Belgian priests, in the murder of women and baby killing, that Nurse Cavell got her deserts, that treachery is a virtue, and that disloyalty is true citizenship.

In 1916 the Prime Minister returned from England with the latest knowledge of the actual situation in Great Britain and Prance. He gave us his solemn assurance that the position was so serious as to necessitate the Commonwealth making a considerably greater contribution of men. He asked for 32,000 men for September, and for 16,500 men per month for the succeeding eleven months. Just after the honorable gentleman had arrived in Australia the Russians were sweeping the Austrians before them, and in three months had taken nearly 200,000 prisoners.

The Government this Parliament, if you like have been criminally neglectful of their responsibilities in this direction. They say, We have no ships. We have no men who understand shipbuilding, no engineers ready to undertake that class of work, and no engines.

I understand that the shipping company paid a wage of 1 yen 50 sen, and the men struck for another 50 sen, or 2 yen, which is a dollar, or 4s. 2d. per day. No Japanese could be found to take the place of the strikers in that strike. The same thing is true of the strike in the coal mines. Each of these strikes was settled within two or three days by granting the demands of the strikers. I had nothing to do either with the strikes or with the settlement.  Senator Guthrie will see, when we remember the huge number of ships of the Allies that have been sunk by the Huns during the last three years, and i he rapidity with which the Japanese have been building ships, that Japan today occupies a much more prominent position in the mercantile shipping world than she has done hitherto. I was interested in this question when T was in Japan, and it may surprise honorable senators to learn that today in that country there are twelve shipbuilding yards in full work, and two more, costing something like 3,000,000 yen, in course of construction. I was privileged to visit the yard of the Osaka Iron Works, and this and the Mitsubishi Dockyard are the two most extensive works of the kind in Japan. I can assure honorable senators that in the shipbuilding yard I visited I saw seven ships on seven different stocks in course of construction at the same time. These vessels would range from 2,000 to 8,000 tons register. At the two shipbuilding yards in course of construction it is proposed to build ships up to 18,000 tons register. There is in the shipbuilding works alone of Japan a capital of 800,000,000 yen invested, and these works employ over 63,000 hands. Today Japan need not worry about assistance from any other country for the transport of its products, since Japanese ships are traversing every ocean and are carrying Japanese products, which, during the last few years have increased in number and volume to a remarkable extent, to every market in the world.

Subsequently a shuffling of the cards took place, and Mr. Poynton became one of the historic twelve. For his loyalty on that occasion he was appointed Treasurer. In consequence of the altered opinions of the subordinates of Mr. Hughes, he cut the estimate down by another Â£1,000,000, and anticipated to receive Â£2,000,000 from that source. Then another shuffling of the cards took place, and the party of the Leader of the Government in the Senate becoming predominant in the new Government made necessary a further readjustment of the amount to be levied under the measure, with the result that we have now before us Sir John Forrests estimate of Â£500,000. There are in this chamber honorable senators who are continually quoting, and often rightly, the example of the Old Country in legislation.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","BAKHAP, Thomas","K18","N/A","N/A","N/A","3416","When the Prime Minister of Great Britain made his speech, compulsory rationing was in contemplation, but was not in force. If it now is in force, my remarks are the more apposite. Mr. Lloyd George has warned us that a Democracy, if it will not endure to the end, must perish. He has told us that we must either  go on or go under. He has said that if the men in the trenches are not satisfactorily reinforced they will be almost justified in following the Russian example in walking out. Recrimination is being indulged in by the public men of the Empire as to the sharing between the politicians and the soldiers of the responsibility for the military position.. We are told that a great many of the inconveniences that have attended the contemplated advance of the Allied Forces have been caused by the lack of sufficiently large and timely drafts of men. The eating of horse flesh has been hitherto associated in the minds of the people of the United Kingdom with beleaguered fortresses, with towns around which lines of circumvallation have been thrown. When we hear of these things it behoves us, as one of the most important Dominions of the Empire having a white population, to consider the remarkable pass to which the Empire has come.  It will be well in this connexion to cultivate a sense of proportion. We have been discussing many matters which, though fairly important in themselves, are small in relation to the general issue. My principal concern is for victory. It is victory that I want, and it is victory that is essential to the cause of the Empire and its Allies, which, beyond all cavil and doubt, is the cause of humanity. Apart from what Lloyd George may say, or what sentiments this or that league may express, or even what may be the opinion of so great a man as President Wilson, I declare in all sincerity and with all conviction that victory is essential to the cause of the Empire and its Allies. Day and night with me there is a feeling of fear that we may be misled, that the leaders of the Empire, or the chiefs among our Allies, may foolishly be led into making with the enemy an inconclusive and unsatisfactory peace. A peace made in the present temper of the ruling classes of Germany would to all intents and purposes be the equivalent of a German victory. Every man who wishes to do justice to himself will endeavour to school his mind to a proper appreciation of the facts; if he wishes to get a proper sense of things he will refrain, to use colloquial Australian, from pulling his own leg. I subscribe to the deliverance of one of the bestknown writers on the war situation, who has said,  The enemy thing unbroken is incompatible with us. Either it lives and we die, or it dies and we live. If, after the war, the German is able to go about the world smacking his chest and saying,  The whole world was against us, but we kept the soil of Germany inviolate, and imposed our will on our enemies, then the disintegration of that great Empire of which we are proud to be citizens is within measurable distance. It is essential that the leaders of Labour, and the political leaders too, shall understand that we are at the parting of the ways. If our will to war becomes paralyzed before that of the Germans, we shall be defeated. It is idle to say that the Germans are suffering greater privations than the people of our Empire. If they intend to endure longer than we are prepared to endure, the fact that they are suffering more now matters little, because, enduring longer, they will secure the victory, and we shall experience the defeat. It is essential for us to recognise that differences of opinion in regard to the desirability of making peace have caused conflict among the people of our Empire in other wars. It is always because the ruling classes of the Empire have shown a tenacious spirit, like, that of the old Romans, the determination to hang on, to achieve victory at all costs, that the Empire is what it is today. Now: I very rarely indulge in anything like prophecy, and I remember that Mark Twain has very wisely advised us never to prophesy unless we know; but I do take the responsibility of declaring that if the people of this great democratic Empire of ours we are all interested in the preservation of our liberties have sufficient resolution to endure this year, victory is certain, because the insidious German peace propaganda keeps in view the fact that, before long, the organizing genius and inventive ability of 100,000,000 people across the Atlantic Ocean will be brought to bear. They know quite well that once Americas strength is exerted, nothing can save the German Empire from a pretty substantial defeat. And during the recent referendum campaign a most singular use was made of the fact that America is our ally. But I warn the people that this is the crucial year, and that? on the confession of Mr. Frank Simmonds, who is recognised as Americas greatest writer on military subjects, we must not entertain .any illusion about Americas military effort during 1918. In an article in Land and Water, he says that the troops or assistance which America can provide during this year must be regarded rather as an earnest of her intention than anything else, and that we had better understand that American armies will not be sent into the field in anything like substantial numbers before 1919. Therefore, every Englishspeaking man, every citizen of the Empire, who entertains a real and loyal hope that its prestige may be preserved, must understand that this year will be the real trying and testing time. Let us endure. Let us preserve our will to war unimpaired during 1918. If we do this, we may rest assured that victory, with all its compensations, can be promised. I have no hesitation in saying that if the British people do not become wobbly at the knees, but will equal and surpass, the Germans in endurance during this year, the ultimate and comparatively speedy success of our cause will be insured. But it will be incumbent on British people in all parts of the world to endure during 1918. If we get over this year, if we withstand the insidious efforts on behalf of a peace which would be equivalent a German victory, we shall, during 1919, be able to bring about peace imposed by the victorious arms of our. Empire and our noble Allies. That is the ideal we must keep in view. These are times when all public men have a profound responsibility and great duty resting upon their shoulders, and I say that, in this crucial hour, it is their sacred duty to animate and inspire the people with hope and an inflexible determination to endure until victory is achieved. I may say that I am greatly disappointed, but not very much surprised, at the result of the recent referendum. It is probable that, had other action been taken, something better might have been achieved. I am sorry that, in a democratic community like ours, the referendum was decided upon without some submission of its terms to the National Parliament. But regrets are vain. It is to the future that we must turn our attention. Nothing will be gained by whining over the past. The people of Australia had a great opportunity available to them in 1916, and they had another on the 20th December last, but, unfortunately, a kind of dementia, which I can only compare to that derangement of mind which afflicts unfortunate people occasionally, and which sometimes impels unhappy men to emasculate themselves, overtook the people of Australia, who in a sense emasculated themselves by voting  No, and thus to a large extent fettered any future Administration in regard to Australias war efforts. The people very unwisely, in my judgment, voted No. A very large number voted  Yes, but I am sorry to say that my opinion of the referendum as an instrument of government and for ascertaining popular opinion has been very considerably impaired by what was discovered by me during my attempts to assist in securing *\ satisfactory  Yes  vote. I found that most remarkable motives and most singular reasons inspired some people to vote one way or the other. On one occasion I met a sensible woman who was at the time in the throes of a breach of promise action with some swain who had deserted her. She was a most enthusiastic Yes voter,, and when I laughingly asked her for her reasons, she expressed the hope that conscription would be carried, so that this gentleman who had breached his promise would be sent to the Front and killed. Another friend of mine whose entire, household would vote  Yes  had some sort of a quarrel with the head of a Department, and he told me that he would vote No in the hope that it would lead to a change of Government and the dismissal from the Commonwealth employment of the departmental head referred to. If in a great national crisis like this fairly intelligent people have their opinions determined by considerations of the  kind I have mentioned, one must readjust ones ideas concerning the referendum as an instrument for ascertaining the public will. Even in those wellconducted Democracies where the referendum has been used for some years, it has come to be regarded as a Conservative instrument. I venture to say that Parliaments are nearly always more progressive than and considerably in advance of the great body of electors whose opinions are asked by medium of a referendum, for whenever a direct question involving personal interests is submitted to the electors for their judgment they will invariably vote on the Conservative side. The referendum, therefore, is recognised by nearly all political writers  of any great status as a Conservative instrument, and it is rarely used. Honorable senators will, of course, remember that the referendum has been employed on several occasions since the inception of the Commonwealth, and that in regard to only two or three trivial and impersonal matters have we secured an affirmative vote.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 5) 191718","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[11]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This illustrates the correctness of my argument.  I had no very great hope of the second conscription referendum being carried. I thought that, in the circumstances, and with the full knowledge of the fact that the position of the Allies was certainly more perilous than in October, 1916, a sufficiently large number of electors might have changed their minds to enable us to secure a bare  Yes  majority. But the campaign had hardly opened before I recognised that the position was very nearly hopeless. I had always considered it perilous, even before the publication of the result of the voting at the first referendum. When I saw that over 100,000 virile, or assumedly virile, Australians who had been called into camp, who were of fit military age, and who had been declared medically fit, had, to the extent of about 95 per cent, of their numbers, applied for exemption, I contemplated the future of my country with very doubtful feelings. The fact is that nearly 100,000 men called into camp in 1916 applied for exemption, and T think it can reasonably be stated that the great majority of them voted  No. I encountered the most amazing and most unnecessary candour on the part of some of these young men. I was surprised at the attitude taken up by many who had been friends of mine since their early childhood, and by many I had known almost since their birth. In the most friendly way they stated to me at street corners that they would not go to the wai; that if the referendum were carried they would have to be bound with ropes and transported by main force to the scene of action. When I reasoned with them when I asked,  Why this unnecessary solicitude about the issue of the referendum ? Why this unnecessary fear about going to the field of battle and fighting as so many of your countrymen are fighting?  they told me, in very plain Australian, that they were afraid they would suffer from an infirmity which I can best characterize by the use of an expressive phrase culled from the fertile pages of the elegant Plutarch, who, describing a general who suffered from the same infirmity, says, His bowels used to lose their retentive faculty. I explained this to these young men, and told them that their candour did not lead me to believe, as they imagined it would, that they would not make fair soldiers. It was a very stout general whom we read of in the pages of history, and, despite the affliction which always overtook him on the day of battle, he accomplished some very great military deeds. He was an eminent warrior in fact, one of the greatest generals of Grecian antiquity.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 5) 191718","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[11]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","BAKHAP, Thomas","K18","N/A","N/A","N/A","3419","Quite so; I am construing the plain Australian into the elegant language of classical writers. These men probably were very much better material than were those bie commercial men Owners of big businesses here who, while leading the Yes speakers to believe that they were going to vote Yes, were marshalling their entire households to vote No at the polls. If I had sufficient knowledge of military tactics I should not be afraid to lead into battle the men who confessed to me at street corners that they were afraid, for I believe that they would prove good soldiers. They only feared that they would be afraid, and the probability is that they would do as well as any of their countrymen, who have fought so gallantly on the European battle fields. The referendum was defeated by the selfishness of those classes of the nation who ought to have known a great deal better. It was defeated by men who ought to have risen to a sense of their duty, but did not recognise the responsibility that rested upon them because of their citizenship in one of the greatest Empires in history. The referendum was defeated by the insidious opposition of many who professed to be its supporters.  I regret that we were not allowed to deliberate here on the details of the referendum, because I recognise that in it we had probably the last opportunity that will ever present itself for obtaining most interesting information in regard to the psychology of the Australian nation. I wanted the ballotpapers polled by voters of the two sexes to be placed in separate ballotboxes. I wanted to know, whether the vote was an affirmative or a negative one, which sex was responsible for it. The voters on the Commonwealth rolls are classified by letters indicating their sex, and I am very sorry that opportunity was not given for the casting of the ballotpapers into what I might call sex ballotboxes. We would have known then whether the lack of fibre was in the male or the female portion of the voting population. I am sorry to say and this again fills me with greater doubt than ever as to the future of this country that the figures I have in connexion with two of the seventyfive electorates for the House of Representatives into which the Commonwealth is divided, show that in one of them the number of female votes polled was more than 1,300 in excess of the male votes, and that in that electorate there was a substantial Yes majority, whereas in the other, where the male voters who exercised the franchise were over 1,000 in excess of the female voters, there was a  No  majority of nearly 1,000. Unlike many others who have investigated this matter, I am of the opinion that it was not the women who lacked soul or fibre that it is not our women* who are unworthy of being compared with the Spartan mothers but the decadent manhood, the too great pleasureloving manhood of Australia remaining behind here, that was responsible for the  No  vote. I attribute the result of the referendum to a large negative vote on the part of male electors. In the two electorates the statistics of which are at my disposal, I am able to show that where there was a preponderance of female voters there was a majority of  Yes  votes, and where there was a large preponderance of male voters there was an almost equivalent majority of  No  votes. That speaks little for the virility of the Australian men who have remained behind.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 5) 191718","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[11]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I must say that the Official Labour partys attitude, since it got into Opposi tion, compares very unfavorably with that of the Liberal Opposition during the first two years of the prosecution of the war.

Since then, I venture to say, that section of the Labour party that has gone into Opposition has been conspicuous for nothing else but a constant attempt to thwart the efforts of the Administration to continue to do the best possible in the prosecution of the war.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 5) 191718","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[11]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","BAKHAP, Thomas","K18","N/A","N/A","N/A","3420","I do not think so. The records of Australian politics, since a section of the Labour party went into Opposition, simply teem with evidence that the Administration has had to face incessant attempts to thwart its best endeavours. There is this to be said and honorable senators who sit in Opposition must know I am telling the truth that, bereft of the most scientific, democratic, and equitable way of raisin? troops for reinforcements, the possible efforts of any Ministry must be regarded as seriously impaired. It is true that much can be done in the way of providing shipping, as Senator Pratten suggested, and in the stimulation of the production of .metals and ores and in the establishment of factories for munitions within our Territory. A thoroughly enthusiastic effort may secure great results in these .directions ; but in regard to the vita! essential of men, beyond all doubt the Australian people, by their referendum vote, have seriously impaired the efforts of any Administration that may be in office. It is as well to recite these facts, and honorable senators opposite know them as well as I do.  When I went down into the city today, I found the cajoling system in full operation. The bands were playing, men  spruiking  from platforms the splendid voluntary system ! All the circus methods of Wirth and other promoters of such pageants, are in full use by the military authorities of this great Dominion of the Empire. Blow your trumpets ! Beat your drums ! Drag in the services of politicians, and get women to meet young men individually and shame them into enlisting. It is a misuse of the word  voluntary  ; it is not the voluntary system at all. Why do you call for speakers, and for the establishment of recruiting committees ? Why should there be all these things in connexion with the voluntary system? It is a system of cajolery; that is all it is. It depends on the warlike enthusiasm of those youths who are approaching their majority, and on the indignation of men really past the military age, who, in their righteous wrath, tell untruths in order to get themselves accepted by the enlisting authorities. If I have erred since the beginning of the war in advocating compulsion I have erred with the somewhat laggard authorities of Great Britain with Asquith, with Lloyd George, with Roosevelt, with Wilson, with the Judges of the Supreme Court of the United States of America, who, the other day, would not allow an appeal in a case where a wealthy man had been sentenced to fine and imprisonment for having stigmatized conscription as slavery. The very fact that that man had the effrontery, in the freeborn community of America, to stigmatize an equitable, democratic effort, instituted by the Legislature, as slavery; cost him a term of imprisonment and a fine of 10,000 dollars. The impeccable and unimpeachable authority of the Supreme Court quashed the appeal and allowed the conviction to stand. If I err, I err in company in which I am glad to be. I do not plead guilty to having used one offensive or vituperative term during the prosecution of the two referendum campaigns in which I assisted. I admit that for good or ill perhaps for. ill this is a Democracy; and when a question is relegated to a Democracy for decision, it is implied that there are two sides to it, and vituperation and invective in connexion with the arguments for and against are entirely out of place. I have never accused a  No  voter of being disloyal or of being a traitor, but I have said, as I shall say now, that those who voted No were beguiled and misled, and, in a national and Imperial sense, came to an essentially wrong, and possibly, fatal decision. I had not intended to speak, and would not have spoken, had it not occurred to me that it would be well if I incorporated in Hansard certain extracts from German publications which ought to serve as a terrible warning to tie people of Australia in regard to their international association with the people of the German race. What I am going to quote might, perhaps, be regarded as the production of panGermans, or jingoistic Germans, of a somewhat ignorant class, but, as a matter of fact, educated Germans, belonging to the professorial class, are responsible for the opinions expressed. I venture to say that, although the people of the British race are not impeccable although they have their faults it would be impossible to get a series of British publications embodying threats or suggestions such as these in regard to dealing with the people of the German race if we should fortunately prove victorious. Some honorable members may think that I am a jingoistic kind of man. Not at all. I would not advocate the retention of the German colonies captured by the Australian troops, if I did not think it was absolutely essential to the safety and welfare of Australia, and of our children in the days to come. Honorable senators know that I have taken certain action in a certain direction, and that action has secured the almost unqualified indorsement of the Senate. If honorable senators will favour me with their attention for a moment they will be well repaid; and if the Australian electors, or such of them as read Hansard, will peruse carefully what they will find in its pages within the next few days, and will, as a matter of patriotism and of justice to themselves and posterity, spread the knowledge and intelligence amongst their fellowelectors, both men and women, they will do the country a service.

I despise Critchley Parkers efforts so much that I am not even going to refer to them. I have my own way of protecting myself, and my own way of presenting my private grievances. I do not propose to mention them in Australias highest national chamber at a time when the Empire is in very grave peril.  I wish to say something about shipbuilding. In his Bendigo speech, which I have had the pleasure of quoting on many platforms during the election campaign of April and May last, the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) said that freight was a vital factor in regard to winning the war, but, unfortunately, it was one that was beyond our control. I subscribe to the truth of the statement that freight is a vital factor, but I certainly protest against the idea that it is altogether beyond our control. Very early in the campaign of last year I said that I thought a very vigorous policy of shipbuilding in Australia would be one of the very best things a Winthewar Ministry could undertake, and that, . by building ships we ought to be able to build them with the resources of a continent at our disposal and by arranging for convoys, just as in the eighteenth century the East India Fleet had to be conveyed by the British menofwar, we could combat the submarine menace. The pirates of Barbary were almost as big a menace to commerce in the eighteenth century as the German submarine is today, and British menofwar were frequently under the necessity of going as far south as the line in order to convoy the East India fleets to the shores of Great Britain. I pointed out during the campaign that a very satisfactory method of combating the submarine menace would be for all the component parts of the British Empire to address themselves individually and collectively to a vigorous policy of building ships wooden ships; any sort of ships that would take cargoes to the Home Country. I am somewhat surprised at the statement that the Prime Minister has ordered the building of fourteen wooden ships in America. I applaud the actual administrative act, but it squares most unsatisfactorily with the attitude of the Prime Minister towards the proposal to build wooden ships in Australia. I understood from those who were commissioned to investigate the matter in Tasmania, and whom I had the pleasure of accompanying, that the Prime Minister was opposed to the building of wooden ships in Australia. If he has given orders for the building of wooden ships in America I speak with only a partial knowledge of the facts, because they have not been even moderately disclosed to us he should also have arranged his shipbuilding policy in such a fashion that we should have begun the building of wooden ships in Australia months ago. We have built wooden ships in Australia that have made the ocean voyage to London. Tasmania is now getting its supplies of wheat from the mainland in wooden sailing ships. Only a week ago there was at the Launceston wharf a wooden vessel a converted missionary craft which had been built in England, and which is now engaged in taking wheat from New South Wales to Tasmania, that mainland wheat which is necessary for the operations of the Tasmanian millers. If a vessel which was built in England, and which has made the stormy ocean voyage to Australia, is actually engaged in the Australian wheat transport trade, cannot we, setting aside all our political differences, address ourselves enthusiastically, even at this late hour, to the building of ships ships of any sort, rough ships, if you like, so long as they are seaworthy and will carry substantial cargoes to help to mitigate the unfortunate position of the people of Great Britain? Undoubtedly, we can do so. Surely this is an item of policy with which no one will disagree. While I applaud what the Administration has done already, I say that it has not done nearly sufficient in this particular, and if there is such incongruity in its. shipbuilding policy in the direction I have mentioned, my surprise at the lack of proportion is increased for, if we are to pay for American wooden ships with good Australian money, surely in an insular continent, with vast forests at our disposal, we should be able to build wooden ships here ? In fact, some of them ought to be well on the way to launching at the present time. We all know that the Prime Minister and the Administration have been confronted with considerable difficulties, but I must say there has been a lack of that dash, that enthusiasm, that fever of shipbuilding, to which Senator Long has referred. Even at this late hour amendment is possible, and I sincerely hope that the Administration, purged somewhat by the fire through which it has passed, will address itself with tenfold energy to the question of increasing the Empires mercantile marine. A constructive war policy that will really assist is badly needed. As I said in my opening remarks, I am sorry to say that we are forced back on the most unsatisfactory method of providing men, but forced back on it we are, and men of the world deal with things as they are; they deal with facts, and not with suppositions, and they do not indulge in vain regrets as to what might have been. It seems to me our mineral production will have to be greatly stimulated by encouraging enterprise. While I thoroughly agree with the policy that those who are enjoying large incomes at the present time should pay proportionately to the cost of the war, I question very much whether the wartime profits tax is likely to prove anything but a brake on the energies of the people of Australia. Human nature being what it is and every politician should be a bit of a philosopher we must recognise that we cannot get men to put money into productive enterprises when they are liable to have their profits taken from them to the extent of 50 per cent, or 75 per cent. There are other avenues in which they can employ their money. As honorable senators suggest, they may even put it into the war loans, where it may be of service, but there they will not be running the risk of having threefourths of their profits taken from them. I am not going into the bare ethics of the question, nor do I argue that patriots ought not to be willing to sacrifice every shilling which they possess. Theoretically, they ought to be willing to do so, but human nature being what it is they will not do it. Our friends are talking about raising the pay of Australian soldiers, implicating and insinuating that it is necessary to  raise the pay before men will come forward in increased numbers to fight. I do not say that it is necessary, but undoubtedly that is the logical implication. We must stimulate mineral production here. I believe that if the production of metals and ores is vital, as it undoubtedly is, for the successful prosecution of the war, and the maintenance of our part in the struggle, it will be found desirable, as it was found desirable in New Zealand, to revert to the income tax form of raising money and to let the wartime profits taxation go by the board. I am sure that it will be found by the collection of the wartime profits impost that in Australia wartime profits on the scale on which they are made in the United Kingdom do not exist. Yet the presence of this bugbear in the path of enterprise will, I feel sure, do much to check our reaching a consummation which wedevoutedly wish, namely, the great stimulation of Australian production. I have not the ability to epitomize my remarks as Senator Pratten has done, but in his short and wellconsidered speech he alluded to the necessity of our greatly stimulating production of every kind. He referred to the production of metals, the building of ships, and the manufacture of munitions of war. If we undertake all this work, recognising that we shall always be geographically an isolated continent, and our people the population of an island, it may be that this war, great as its drain upon the resources of the Commonwealth in men and money has been, will, in after years, because of the prosperity resulting from the stimulation of our industries, be recognised as a blessing in disguise. It may possibly be that it will result in the planting in Australia of the roots of industries which, like the grain of mustard seed, will eventually bloom and flourish into tremendous industrial trees. As we are restricted in the way of providing men, we should exhibit all the more energy in the development of our resources, the building of ships, the growing of produce, the rearing of stock, and the systematic production of ores and metals. I am not one. of those who care to make too long references to things that are past and cannot be mended.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 5) 191718","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[11]/continue[19]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I suppose that it is almost impossible to speak on the Supply Bill without making some reference to the political position quite recently created by the unfortunate and unnecessary pledge on the part of the Prime Minister. I am not going to criticise nor am I going to absolve. I feel that as I am one of the contemporaries of the Prime Minister, I am, perhaps, unable to judge him as dispassionately and correctly as he may be judged by posterity. Every one knows that I am not inclined to indulge in fulsome praise of the right honorable gentleman. I have a keen sense of some of his defects and limitations. Nevertheless. I say that his political career and his political fortunes are identified with the fortunes of our Empire. He stands for all that is  Imperial. He stands for the growth of that Imperialism without the existence of which Australian nationalism must perish. If our Empire comes out of this war unqualifiedly successful, there is no doubt that the future historians of politics, which to us are contemporary, may think the Prime Minister a very much greater man than do some of us who are his contemporaries. I like to do him justice. I have been very much annoyed by many of his political blunders since he has been Leader of the Government. At the same time, while I do nob condone them, I am not inclined to very harshly criticise them. I must say that I greatly regret that the referendum was carried out by executive act. When voting for the War Precautions Act I never dreamed that it would permit of the creation of such a condition of things as an administrative atmosphere in which we could have an appeal to the people of Australia without the slightest intermediate reference to Parliament. Now the thing is done, the result has been arrived at, and regrets are vain. His tying of his feet with pledges, his frothy vituperation, his unnecessary acts of administration, and) so on, are things for which Mr. Hughes himself must be responsible. I simply make reference to the matter to protest against any responsibility being thrown upon the Nationalist party, as a party, in respect of any pledges which the Prime Minister may have made. He made them entirely of his own volition, and without consultation with the party. If they have been found inconvenient, he has had to address himself to the consideration of the position in which he landed himself.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 5) 191718","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[11]/continue[20]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Honorable senators must remember that the GovernorGeneral has no concern with the individual or . collective pledges of members of this Parliament. His concern is to see an Administration in office supported by a majority of the members in the popular chamber. That is his concern. Everything else set aside, he must go about that business.

We know that he sought the advice of a number of gentlemen. I think that whatever criticism may be directed against the attitude of the Prime Minister in connexion with the matter, the GovernorGeneral must, by every loyal, sensible, and chivalrous man, be held to have done what was undoubtedly the right thing from the standpoint of the Kings representative, namely, the securing of fi stable government for the Commonwealth of Australia at a time of great Imperial strain. The GovernorGeneral is well qualified to defend himself, and I am not taking up the role of his apologist. I merely say, as a member of the Senate, that I think that, whatever may be the attitude adopted in another place, the senatorial attitude towards the GovernorGeneral ought to be chivalrous, and should indicate a recognition of the difficulties imposed upon him arising from a political crisis. That is all that I desire to say about the matter.  Honorable senators know that I have been a conscriptionist from the beginning of the war. I have been a conscriptionist, not because of the necessity of getting enough men. I should be a conscriptionist now if we were getting a sufficient number of men, because I hold that conscription is equitable, democratic, and scientific. The war authorities should know how many men they can depend on, and that they can depend upon a regular supply. That is possible only under conscription. That is why students of the military art have always been advocates of conscription.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 5) 191718","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[11]/continue[25]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Under the system we have adopted, nearly Â£50,000,000 of Australian money has been spent on foreign soil by Australian soldiers in a way that has brought them little or no benefit. Had conscription been introduced, with a scale which permitted of only a nominal monetary payment to the soldier himself, while providing ample allowances for the keep of those dependent on him, and allowing a much more amplified fund for the payment of pensions, something very much better would have been instituted than the system which we are now carrying on to the detriment of our national effort.

I fancy I would return again tomorrow without any difficulty if another election occurred. I have been a conscriptionist because of the equity of the system. Every man who understands the military art knows that it is the only system under which satisfactory reinforcements for armies can be depended upon. That being so, it will come with a certain amount of grace from me to suggest that we ought to bury the hatchet with regard to recriminations about this matter. Many mistakes were made on both sides. Pamphlets were published by very indifferent directors of public opinion on both sides, which posterity will regret were ever sent broadcast among Australian people. Lot us all address ourselves now to the problems facing us, rightly or wrongly, straightforwardly or otherwise, according to different viewpoints. A Government is in power which has the confidence of the majority of this Legislature in both Houses. If it peacefully, but energetically addresses itself to the organization of Australias resources; if it is allowed to do so without unnecessary recriminations, something may be achieved; but if we fritter away our internal strength by continual bickering over matters which, after all, will not be regarded as worth a jot by the historian of fifty years hence, we shall be doing a very unwise thing, unbefitting the legislators of one of the most important of the Kings overseas Dominions. After all, there are 5,000,000 almost purely British people in Australia, and there are only 67,000,000 of white people in the whole British Empire. Therefore, the percentage of responsibility on our shoulders is very heavy. It is our duty, all other considerations set aside, to allow this Administration, which ought reasonably to have two years of office before it, to address itself to the question of what can be best done on Australias behalf. I hope before election time comes again we shall have surmounted the Alpine heights and landed on the other side, where we can fully survey the broad meadows of unqualified and measureless victory. When we do get such a victory and I believe we will, if we are sufficiently enduring we can all look back on this time of trial as one not likely to occur again during our lifetime, and I hope not within the lifetime of two or three generations of our descendants.
