       Judeo-Christian Values

      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       That we are concerned that the Judeo-Christian moral values which have been fundamental in our laws and education systems since the foundation of the country are now being undermined in the current practice of law making, and we are concerned that the values of the secular-humanistic philosophy have taken their place therefore jeopardizing the moral climate of our society and contributing towards immorality and violence in our society.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore ask the Senate for the restoration of Judeo-Christian laws and moral values.

       Relocation of Transylvanian Village Dwellers

      <para>
       To the Honourable the President of the Senate and members of the Senate assembled in Parliament:
      </para>
      <para>
       The petition of certain citizens and residents of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate, the plan proposed by the Government of Rumania, to re-structure the Rumanian countryside. Some 7,000 villages, many of them in Transylvania, at this time still occupied by the descendants of those Hungarian extraction citizens of Rumania, whose ancestors lived there for over 1,000 years, are earmarked for total destruction. The Rumanian Government's intention is that no trace of such inhabitation remain. The reasons proposed for the destruction, that is: to ``provide arable land'', is nothing but a ruse.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore respectfully urge the Senate, to ask the Australian Government, to call on Rumania to forthwith desist from any action envisaged in the bulldozer-policy.
      </para>
      <para>
       Rumania signed many international instruments which provided guarantees to the human rights and the rights of the minorities living in Rumania. Now the rights of all people living in the 7,000 villages are in danger of not only being eroded, but irrevocably destroyed.
      </para>
      <para>
       The destruction would not only affect homes, the monuments, the cemeteries and the churches, some 9024 (!) churches of many denominations, would disappear forever.

       In-vitro Fertilisation Patients: Medicare Funding
      </title>
      <para>
       The Honourable, The President and Members of the Senate in Parliament.
      </para>
      <para>
       The petition of the undersigned shows a request for Medicare benefits for in-vitro fertilisation for the medical treatment of infertile couples.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled grant Medicare benefits for in-vitro fertilisation, IVF, for the medical treatment of infertile couples. 1 in 10 Australian couples are infertile and unable to conceive and carry a baby to birth. Having a family is one of the most fundamental and rewarding aspects of life and benefits the community as a whole. IVF is an established and proven treatment for infertility. There are existing mechanisms to regulate and control IVF, including the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Reproductive Technology Accreditation Committee. Currently IVF patients pay up to $1500 per treatment cycle for IVF out of their own pockets. This means that some couples who need IVF to help them establish their own family do not have access. We request that Medicare funding be granted for IVF for the treatment of infertility, and your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.

      </para>

       that your petitioners deplore the Federal Government's decision to remove 53 Pharmaceutical drugs-including the best available for the treatment of high blood pressure, cancer, epilepsy, high cholesterol and uneven heartbeat-and place them, for cost saving reasons only, on a special list requiring Authority from a Canberra Bureaucrat, and;

       Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legislation

      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.

      <para>
       The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. That it be recognised the proposed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill is a public, legal acknowledgement that Australians who are non-aboriginal do not have sovereignty in their own country.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. That the Australian people are opposed to the idea of a treaty, compact or makarrata between the Australian people who are non-aboriginal and those who are aboriginal, and the Government has no mandate or authority to pursue it.
      </para>
      <para>
       3. That the proposed legislation and treaty
      </para>
      <para>
       will damage Australia's position under international law and in any conflict,
      </para>
      <para>
       will cause distrust and conflict between our aboriginal population (1%) and the non-aboriginal population (99%),
      </para>
      <para>
       will extend aboriginal land rights, contrary to the wishes of the Australian people,

      <para>
       will not be acceptable to the aboriginal people themselves,

       will solve none of the problems of aboriginal people who need housing, health services, education and employment.
      </para>

       Oppression of Albanians in Yugoslavia
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable, the President and Senators in Parliament assembled,
      </para>
      <para>
       The humble petition of the undersigned Citizens and Residents of Australia (of Albanian background from Kosova in Yugoslavia), showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) We draw attention to the House that in Kosova, we have left behind our Fathers and Mothers, Brothers and Sisters, our relatives and above all our people, whom we love very dearly-that is why we fear for their well being.
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) In recent times, Albanian people have been under enormous oppression and terror from the greater Serb ``Communist'' Leader Milosevic and his Nationalist-chauvinist elite, whom the Weekend Australian of 24/25, 9, 88 parallels with the Nazi propagandist Goebbels.
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) Albanians in Yugoslavia are being imprisoned en masse and many are being murdered in mysterious ways; Quote: ``Xhemail Blakaj (22) was arrested on 3/11/86 and on  8/11/86 was said to have ``Committed suicide'', his family was told of his ``death'' on 11/11/86 when instructed to collect his body. See Amnesty International report 1988, Page 225, p6. Albanian political activists are being assassinated by Government agents (even outside Yugoslavia) see Amnesty International Report 1983, page 295, p2.
      </para>
      <para>
       (iv) Albanians are being made ``scape goats'' for Yugoslavia's economical and political failures.
      </para>
      <para>
       (v) Albanians are being accused as ``Oppressors'' and all types of immoral crimes. These accusations are akin to the White Australian Community complaining to the World that they are being ``Oppressed'' by Aborigines.
      </para>
      <para>
       (vi) In pre-war Nazi Germany the same hysteria was employed by Goebbels and Hitler against the Jewish people and where did that lead the world? Today the very same hysteria is being employed by the Greater-Serb Leaders and the Yugoslav KGB (UDB-a). We wonder whether this hysteria will lead the world to a similar fate. One should remember that Serb nationalism ignited the spark that lead to World War I/ Will the world allow them to start World War III?
      </para>
      <para>
       (vii) Therefore, for the sake of peace and co-existence, We Australians of Albanian origin, ask not only the Australian Parliament but all Democratic Parliaments throughout the world to use their diplomatic influence to bring peace to that part of the world.

       Many Australians, and indeed people of other nations, are, for the first time, becoming aware of and concerned about the implications of what is commonly termed `the greenhouse effect'. If the predictions that have been made are correct, this phenomenon will have a profound impact on virtually every section of Australian society. In view of the present high level of interest in this matter, the Industry, Science and Technology Committee believes that it would be appropriate for it to make a contribution to the current debate about the issue.

       The Committee is aware that to cover all aspects of the greenhouse effect would be beyond its resources and may unnecessarily duplicate work that has been and is being done by other bodies. For these reasons the Committee intends to be briefed on the greenhouse effect between now and the end of the current parliamentary session in order to refine the terms of reference within which it will conduct its inquiry. At the commencement of the autumn session next year the Committee will report back to the Senate on the specific terms of reference for its selected area of inquiry.

        —When I was speaking on the Appropriation Bills on Wednesday I was stating that the competition between the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has reached the point where the real economic management of the country is in jeopardy. Many of the statements emanating from the Government at present do not truly reflect the state of the economy and its outlook. In recent times we have seen statistics rolling out on inflation and the balance of payments which demonstrate quite clearly that the Government does not have its hand firmly on the tiller of the nation. Many of the problems can be sheeted home to the internal political problems within the Australian Labor Party. Those pressures are generating very great concern in the Australian community.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       In order to put the argument into perspective, perhaps we could examine the stewardship of the Labor Party since it came to power in 1983 by looking quickly at two or three indicators. First, if we measure Government expenditure against gross domestic product we see that, after appropriate adjustments are made for such things as asset sales by the Government, the percentage of Commonwealth expenditure as a proportion of total product in the country has not fallen at all. This is quite contrary to the Government's claims. Secondly, if we look at taxation, we see that in 1983 it represented 26.4 per cent of the gross domestic product of the country. That has now risen to over 27.4 per cent. In other words, the Government has failed those two critical tests of its management to reduce its involvement in the total community. Of course, the Government would have us believe otherwise.
      </para>
      <para>
       Looking at some of the other relevant statistics we notice that the taxation applied in 1983 by the Hawke-Keating Government to ordinary individuals comprised 51.3 per cent of total collections. In this financial year that has risen to 54.3 per cent. In other words, the pay as you earn taxpayer is bearing far more of the taxation burden now than when the Hawke Government first came to power, and the people of Australia know it. They know that they have been had by this Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have been somewhat negative in our comments about the Government but let us try to examine where we are going. The only way that this country can really improve its situation with the repayment of its huge debt that it faces in the future is to improve its productivity. Productivity of course is the volume of goods and services that are produced per head of population in the country. With the balance of payments crisis, the debt crisis that Australia faces, one would have thought that the Hawke-Keating Government would have been putting a great deal of effort into trying to improve the productivity of the nation. Yet if we look at just the last four quarters of the last financial year, we see that the total productivity per person in this country has in fact declined quite significantly. Since the September quarter last year productivity has gone down from 100.3 on the index to 98.9.
      </para>
      <para>
       With the crisis we have in this area, we would have expected the reverse to occur, that there would have been an improvement in productivity, that incentives would have been provided through tax reductions for people who worked harder so that we would have seen some improvement in people's ability to earn more if they worked harder. As a result, productivity would have improved. But no, that is not the result. The reverse is occurring. Through high taxes and disincentives imposed by this Government and all kinds of restrictive labour practices in various areas, this Government has failed to improve our productivity. It is productivity that will determine the final outcome of our economy. It will determine whether we can repay that huge mountain of debt-debt having trebled since this Government came to power in 1983.
      </para>
      <para>
       Other areas of concern regarding this Government's management have caused and are causing significant worry to Australians. I refer first to the activities in our financial markets. We have seen recently the collapse of Rothwells merchant bank in Perth and the ramifications that that has had for the financial system generally. It comes as a shock, though, that the Treasurer, in reply to a question in the House of Representatives the other day by the Opposition's financial spokesman, Dr Hewson, about the financial collapse of Rothwells bank, was able to dismiss the suggestion that the ripples rolling outwards from the collapse of Rothwells will have an effect on the financial system.
      </para>
      <para>
       This is very disturbing, because we know, firstly, that that company has been put into liquidation; secondly, that the auditors are finding it very difficult to put together the financial statements of Rothwells in order to find out its exact financial position; and, thirdly, the National Companies and Securities Commission NCSC, which is the national securities watchdog, is conducting investigations and collecting documents preparatory to an exercise designed to determine what has gone on in Rothwells in recent times. I applaud what the NCSC is doing in this area. We would like to see it moving faster. We would like to see it properly resourced so that it can undertake a thorough examination of Rothwells affairs and its associated companies to ensure that we get to the bottom of the cause of the collapse. I think it behoves the Government to take a far more serious view of what has happened in Rothwells and in the Western Australia Inc. scene, as it is called, than it has to date.
      </para>
      <para>
       Rothwells after the recent collapse has ended up being virtually a shell-from which $400m, $500m or maybe $600m has disappeared. When one analyses the statistics and figures one can see that there is a very real danger that the Western Australian Government will be obliged to pay into Rothwells funds, when the liquidator calls upon it, a sum of at least $150m to cover a debt to the National Australia Bank. That debt has been cleared, but, quite clearly, there is a question mark over those payments and they could well be called back by a liquidator as a preference.
      </para>
      <para>
       The second thing that is of great concern in relation to Rothwells is the creation, by nefarious means, of an investment of $400m in a company called Petrochemical Industries Co. Ltd. When one analyses the assets of that company, PICL-and it really is in a pickle-we find that it has virtually none. It owns a block of land worth about $200,000. It has certain heads of agreement in its name concerning the supply of gas to it by the gas producers in Western Australia. It also has some agreements, apparently signed for the sale of the product of the proposed works-some plastic materials-but at prices which are only equal to what can be supplied by Taiwan or any other Asian nation. There is, therefore, not much prospect of this company reaching a very great state of productivity and profit.
      </para>
      <para>
       We see that $400m has been invested in this organisation-an organisation with virtually no assets. The question needs to be asked: Just what has happened to the $400m? Does it exist? Is there value in PICL or not? The answer that we can determine at the moment from published records is that there is no value to PICL. Consequently, the $400m invested in that company really constitutes a nothing; a piece of paper-nothing else.
      </para>
      <para>
       Who has invested that $400m? The facts are that through a series of transactions too complicated to mention here, the Bond Corporation has a paper investment of $225m in the petrochemical company. The Western Australian Government through the Western Australian Development Corporation has invested $175m in cash on loan from the State Government Insurance Office. That is then a further risk that the taxpayers of Western Australia have in respect of the wash-up of Rothwells. It appears that at the moment there is a total commitment and obligation of $175m at risk in the petrochemical operation-an operation which, of course, has not started, and does not look like starting. There is the possibility of a further loss of $150m from the repayment of the guarantee for the National Australia Bank. That represents a total of over $300m. There are far too many questions that cannot be swept under the carpet with just a cursory examination of the figures I have mentioned.
      </para>
      <para>
       The fact remains that the taxpayers of Western Australia are exposed, by a series of transactions that have been undertaken, by up to $300m. This is an absolute tragedy for them because, obviously, it will mean higher taxes and charges for the people of Western Australia as the Western Australian State Government seeks to recover the funds in the event of loss. The taxpayers are certainly at significant risk. On the other hand, the Bond Corporation has received repayment of a great part of the moneys it had deposited with Rothwells-something in the order of $200m. One could say that virtually the investment I have just mentioned in Petrochemical Industries by the Western Australian Government of something like $175m has in fact been funnelled out through Rothwells to the Bond Corporation. Consequently that represents a repayment of its debt by way of a loan from the Western Australian Government. Of course, the people at risk are the Western Australian taxpayers.
      </para>
      <para>
       I mentioned that the NCSC is presently conducting an examination of the affairs of Rothwells. I believe, however, that it needs to take the matter further and to do that quickly. I believe that there is a crying need for the National Companies and Securities Commission to immediately institute a public hearing into the affairs of Rothwells to determine what has happened to the organisation's funds, to determine who is at risk-whether it is the Bond Corporation, the Western Australian taxpayers via the Western Australian Government, or other persons connected with Mr Connell who, of course, was the Managing Director of Rothwells; and his various associates. I believe that those questions have to be addressed now. They have to be addressed now because as time goes by memories change and, of course, documents disappear, as might money disappear-money which ought to finds its way into the hands of creditors to whom that money is properly due. I think that is the first point that has to be noted. The NCSC should immediately institute a public hearing process into what has happened with Rothwells bank.
      </para>
      <para>
       Secondly, because of the way in which Rothwells has been transacting its business across the various State boundaries and the way in which it has been collecting funds from depositors in Queensland, the Queensland Government, through its Premier, Mr Ahern, should immediately institute a royal commission into the transactions that occurred at the time of the creation of the Rothwells merchant bank. There should be an investigation of the role of Sir Edward Lyons, who at the time was Chairman of the Queensland TAB, and his role in depositing money with Rothwells bank in Western Australia. The Premier of Queensland, Mr Ahern, should set up that investigation immediately as a proper judicial inquiry with royal commission powers. That is fully appropriate to demonstrate to the people of Queensland, if nobody else, that the investments in Rothwells were undertaken with proper consideration of the risks involved. The people of Queensland demand that that occur. I believe it should happen as soon as possible.
      </para>
      <para>
       Thirdly, there are many unanswered questions about the Federal Government's role in relation to Rothwells. Many of those questions have been discussed in the Parliament. I invite honourable senators to recall that in 1974 the Federal Parliament passed a law called the Financial Corporations Act, part of which requires merchant banking organisations to report to the Reserve Bank of Australia each month on their financial position. The part of the Act which touches that question, however, has never been proclaimed by any government. In answer to a question in the House of Representatives the other day, the Treasurer chose to use that fact as an excuse for the Reserve Bank's not properly surveying the financial affairs of Rothwells bank. In fact, the Treasurer slipped out from under in his obligations on that. That is simply not good enough. If the Reserve Bank was not properly exercising its role of overseeing the financial affairs of Rothwells, surely there was enough information about in the general financial community for the Government to be alerted to the dangers of various kinds of investments in Rothwells. The point needs to be noted that reports were given to the Reserve Bank by Rothwells and that those reports, on the face of it, may well have been incorrect and false reports, in which case the financial position of Rothwells may have been misrepresented to the Government. That matter needs to be investigated by the Reserve Bank-even though it is so late-and certainly the Treasurer should take an interest in it.
      </para>
      <para>
       The point of real concern is: if the Reserve Bank did not have a role in overseeing the affairs of Rothwells, who did? It is somewhat at odds with reports in the newspapers this week that the Reserve Bank has been ringing around various banking institutions in the last month to determine their exposure to Rothwells. The information that had been provided previously in the returns, which the Treasurer claims were not actually examined or taken seriously, was available to the Reserve Bank all the way through. Many questions need to be answered in that area. Consequently, it behoves the Federal Government to move immediately to institute a royal commission into the affairs of Rothwells bank at the Federal level. Of course, it should coordinate with the State corporate affairs commissions. It should coordinate with the National Companies and Securities Commission. It should coordinate with the various State governments in view of the information they have at their fingertips. I mention particularly the Western Australian Government in that context.
      </para>
      <para>
       We also have the very important question of the role in the affairs of Rothwells of the financial institutions under the control of the Western Australian Government. The Rural and Industries Bank of Western Australia has lent money to Rothwells. We also have Western Australian Government Holdings with its loan to the State Government Insurance Office. All of these are at risk. The Treasurer's statement that there is no risk to the financial affairs of this nation or of the financial community generally from Rothwells collapse is totally without reality. There are many unanswered questions concerning the role of the Queensland and Western Australian governments in the affairs of the various institutions over which they have control. The way in which money was invested in Rothwells by Queensland and Western Australian government instrumentalities, trade unions, charities and other organisations at the behest of the Western Australian Government causes Australian investors and the financial community generally very real worry.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Federal Government and Mr Hawke and Mr Keating should move immediately to set up a royal commission to examine the affairs of Rothwells. If we had the power in the Senate I would certainly be prepared to move a motion to that effect. The Government should give immediate consideration to that matter.

        —The economic situation we now find ourselves in is far different from the one that was presented to us at Budget time. It is far worse than the problems we then thought we faced. They have certainly been dramatised to be far worse. One could almost chart the way in which our economic prospects have declined and our economic problems have been built up by the heat and fervour of the push by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to become Prime Minister.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       At Budget time when the forecasts were high, when governmental expectations were great, when everything was fine and the world's greatest Treasurer had solved all the problems, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was under immense threat from the Treasurer. All around Australia there were reports of the deals being done by the Treasurer to try to usurp Mr Hawke's position. What has happened to those pressures? The answer is very simple: the economy has gone bad. Mr Keating's forecasts were wrong. There are now serious troubles facing us, as in fact the Opposition said at the time the Budget was brought down. Coincidentally, Mr Keating's push for leadership has evaporated because he has made a mess of the one issue on which he had any sort of foundation in his push for prime ministership, that is, the economy. Anyone who looks at the political scene is aware of that simple fact. We have only to look at the recent economic indicators that have been coming out to see just how wrong Mr Keating was in his Budget about the economic prospects we face this year.
      </para>
      <para>
       The assumptions on which the Budget was based, the assumptions which Mr Keating made and trumpeted at Budget time, have been proved dramatically wrong. The more they are proved wrong the more Mr Keating's push for power, his attempt to usurp Mr Hawke, has been brushed aside. It is simply no coincidence that Mr Keating's evident attempts to undermine Mr Hawke have eased up. It is no coincidence that no longer do his henchmen, such as Mr Dawkins, go to the Prime Minister and tell him that he must stand aside before the next election to enable Mr Keating to have at least a few months as Prime Minister before the Australian Labor Party gets defeated at the next polls. All that has ended, and it has ended for one simple reason-because Mr Keating has been clearly shown to have been incompetent in the Budget which we are now discussing. The veneer of the world's greatest Treasurer certainly has not lasted to push him to become, in his view, the world's greatest Prime Minister. Let us face it: if he maintained the same mistake rate, if he ever did get the Prime Ministership, it would be for a very short period.
      </para>
      <para>
       Let us see how much the Government's strategy has been shot to ribbons; for example, by the huge blow-out in the external deficit on the balance of payments. In the first four months the loss in our overseas dealings has blown out to $5.4 billion. The Budget forecast was $9.5 billion for the whole year. It is well over half that after only four months. In fact, if the present rate continued the blow-out would be about $16 billion for the full year, as against $9.5 billion in the Budget. I do not expect that to take place, but there is no doubt that the Budget target, which is one of the key assumptions of the Budget on which the economic plan for the nation was set by Mr Keating, has blown out enormously. It has occurred because, according to the latest figures, exports are down and there has been a huge rise in imports. This has provided us with our worst trade balance for years.
      </para>
      <para>
       Just to show how serious this is, Senator Walsh said in an answer to a question in this place, I think this week, that the external deficit on the balance of payments could go up by up to 4 per cent this year. Senator Walsh got very little press for admitting that. The media chose to ignore that most extraordinary admission. For Senator Walsh to admit that the deficit could go up by up to 4 per cent means that this year's deficit could be over $12 billion. There has been an admission by the Finance Minister that the external deficit could end up at over $12 billion, which would be worse than last year's figure. We can imagine what effect it would have on Budget forecasts if our external deficit-our balance of payments deficit-was even bigger than last year's disastrous result. We can see that on this one key assumption on which this Budget was based there has been a major error.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is a major need for the Government to look again at its economic policy. There is no doubt that if these figures keep up there will have to be a May mini-Budget-another admission of mistake. What is particularly irritating about these mistakes which have taken place consistently under this Government is that on every occasion the Opposition has pointed out where the Government has been wrong and what it should do. We have been proved consistently right. The Government has been proved consistently wrong, particularly going back to the first two Budgets which, in fact, undermined our economic recovery.
      </para>
      <para>
       The 1983-84 and 1984-85 Budgets were absolutely disastrous for this country and we are still paying the price for those reckless increases in government spending. It is all very well for the Government to say now, `But we have cut in since', but the fact is that it should never have been increased. Government spending was increased by extraordinary volumes by the Treasurer in those two Budgets. It is largely because of those two disastrous Budgets that this Government has had to respond so vigorously-and, I must say, has at least recognised the problem, if it has not dealt with it properly-and savagely, according to some people, in some areas.
      </para>
      <para>
       The fact is that there has not been enough reduction in government spending. There has not been enough genuine fiscal policy restraint by this Government, with the result that the people of Australia have to carry the burden in the huge interest rates that this Government is now imposing upon us. That is another of the assumptions on which this Budget was based which have been blown aside by what has actually happened. According to the Budget Papers, monetary policy was to remain firm, not get more severe and not have huge rises in interest rates. Instead we have interest rates going through the roof. The extent of that rise is only too evident to those people who have borrowed to build a home. The problem facing people who want to be home buyers in this nation are so clearly evident and so disastrous. The Sydney Morning Herald ran a very interesting article last Saturday under the headline `The new price of a home-no kids for 10 years'. The article went on:
      </para>
      <para>
       Many young couples are agreeing to put off having children for up to 10 or 15 years to qualify for a home loan in Sydney.
      </para>
      <para>
       This is because both partners' incomes are committed to the limit to pay the mortgage.
      </para>
      <para>
       That is one of the prices of incompetent economic management by this Government. Interest rates are now pricing so many young Australians out of the prospect of owning their own home. Another of the major assumptions on which Mr Keating's economic strategy was set for this year and on which this Budget was based has been blown aside.
      </para>
      <para>
       Inflation is another key basic assumption on which this Budget that we are discussing today was built. Inflation has blown out. That destroys any chance of meeting the Budget target of 5 1/2 per cent. The Budget Papers show that the Government expected the inflation rate by the end of the year to be down to 4 1/2 per cent. The latest 12 months figures show that inflation is up to 7.3 per cent as against this target. This is way beyond the Government's year end forecast of about 4 1/2 per cent. What is the Government doing about this? Clearly, one of the reasons why it has jacked up interest rates so high is to try to calm down economic activity, to hit the private sector, to hit ordinary Australians, and to reduce their economic activity. These people are suffering the burden of a problem that has been generated by the Government's refusal to cut its own spending. We have heard some extraordinary comments and some remarkable claims from this Government about its restraint. The Government has no interest in actually reducing its expenditure. Page 12 of the Forward Estimates that came out only this week says:
      </para>
      <para>
       Current Outlays on the Commonwealth's own behalf are not expected to change in real terms in 1988-89.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the current year this means there will be no cut in real terms-that is, after we account for inflation-on the Commonwealth's own current outlays. This is set out in the report, but that is not the rhetoric we hear from this Government; all we hear about are the dramatic and enormous cuts that have been made. We hear Senator Walsh saying that there is no scope for further major cuts in Government spending. I do not know what he means by `further'. The Forward Estimates say:
      </para>
      <para>
       Current Outlays on the Commonwealth's own behalf are not expected to change in real terms in 1988-89.
      </para>
      <para>
       In other words, most of the figures which it has been using to try to show it has cut its expenditure are fudged figures. They are crooked figures. This report reveals that the Government is not cutting its expenditure in the current year. In its capital spending this Government has been guilty of a multi-million dollar fraud in hiding the real size of its capital spending. That multi-million dollar fraud relates to the $250m-odd that it has hidden, that is really capital expenditure. But the Government has decided to make the purchases on time payment, so we do not see what the real level of spending is.
      </para>
      <para>
       I pursued the matter in Senate Estimates hearings. We found that the Government will be paying for its Parramatta office for something like 10 years. This kind of inventive accounting enables the Treasurer and the Finance Minister to pretend that there have been great cuts in government spending. Yet we know the reality. According to the Commonwealth Department of Finance in its report on Forward Estimates, current outlays on the Commonwealth's behalf are not expected to change in real terms this year. That means that they will not be cut.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is saying, `Isn't it wonderful? The Forward Estimates show that government spending will fall next year'. That is what the report says. It says that current outlays are estimated to fall in real terms in 1989. However, much of this relates to the completion of big projects-for example, this Parliament House and other major investment projects. Next year's figures will reflect the full year effect of taking a lot of expenditure off Budget so that we do not see it any more. It is just changing the accounting practices, not the spending. For example, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation no longer appear in the Budget figures; and they are big operations. The Government has caused a large amount of the current problem by not matching its rhetoric with facts. It keeps talking about restraint and cutting government spending but, as this report shows, it is not cutting expenditure enough.
      </para>
      <para>
       The three major assumptions on which the Budget was based have already been proved wrong. On that basis, the Treasurer this week put on one of his normal and, I believe, totally disreputable stunts. During this week, immediately before Question Time, when he knew that he would be subjected to attacks from Professor John Hewson, the Opposition spokesman on finance in the House of Representatives, he called a press conference and released the hurriedly printed report on the Forward Estimates of Budget outlays. I understand that there was a special printing run the night before to provide enough copies of the documents so that the stunt could be pulled. It was an attempt to divert attention from Dr Hewson's very effective attack on the Government's economic policies which took place in the House of Representatives that afternoon.
      </para>
      <para>
       Having given that press conference, the Treasurer then went into Question Time and took a dorothy dix question, saying what a wonderful prospect there was for the economy despite the fact that the three major Budget assumptions had been proved wrong. They were glossed over, and ignored. Having taken a dorothy dixer to say what a clever fellow he was, he then scurried out of the chamber and could not bring himself to respond to the parliamentary attack on him, on his policies and on his economic performance by certainly the most outstanding economic brain in this Parliament and one of the most outstanding economic brains in this nation. Professor Hewson, until he became a member of this Parliament, was the Dean of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New South Wales. He was on the board of the Macquarie Bank and was involved not only in theoretical economics but also in practical business. He is exactly the sort of person whom, if Mr Keating had any strength, determination or competence, he should have answered. If Professor Hewson had a good case to demonstrate that this Government is on the wrong economic track, it was cowardly of the Treasurer not to respond to him and to put up a backbencher to reply.

Mr Keating has shown himself to be an expert in foul language in the Parliament; it is a pity he cannot display the same competence in dealing with economic matters in the Parliament. His failure to respond to Professor Hewson, his ducking of the issue, his inability, it seems, to defend himself and his policies against vigorous, effective and of course totally correct attack say a lot about Mr Keating and how badly he is doing right now.

      <para>
       As I say, we have not heard anything at all about his push for leadership. But it is interesting that all Mr Keating's assumptions that I have just outlined are wrong. The Budget is built on those assumptions. Let us see how good those Forward Estimates that Mr Keating was so triumphant about the other day are. The report says:
      </para>
      <para>
       The economic assumptions underlying the forward estimates are consistent with, and built upon, those for 1988-89 detailed in Statement 2 of the 1988-89 Budget Paper No. 1
      </para>
      <para>
       So the Forward Estimates are built on and consistent with these assumptions which have already been proved wrong. Yet Mr Keating has the hide to say in a press conference, `Isn't it wonderful. Look what the Forward Estimates show-they show how clever I have been, how wonderful the economic future is, and how the Government has shown restraint and how Government spending will fall'. Who can believe statements like that, based on Budget forecasts which have already been established to be wrong?

I might say that this desperation to resolve some financial problems appears to have flowed over to the activities of the Australian Taxation Office. There is no doubt that the Government's desperate need for money has manifested itself in a whole range of Taxation Office activities. Many people have commented on the vigour of the Commissioner of Taxation's pursuit of some people who it is claimed have been tax dodgers but who quite rightly say that what they were doing was totally within the law.

       I do not want to pursue that matter now; I want to raise another matter-the question of why so many ordinary taxpaying Australians are being cheated of their tax rebates by this Government. I use the term `cheated' in a very vigorous way, because that is what is happening. I have been receiving complaints from tax agents in my region, the Illawarra region, about the incredible and unjustifiable delays in paying tax rebates to ordinary Australian taxpayers who put in their tax returns early, on time. The delays indicated in my region this year are just incredible. One tax agent I spoke to only yesterday told me that the number of delayed rebates in respect of returns that he has put in on time has trebled, from 573 to 1,708. The Tax Office just has not got around to paying the money back-significant rebates in many instances-to ordinary Australian taxpayers.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another tax agent in my region wrote to the Australian Taxation Office and to the Treasurer saying, `Come on, what is wrong? Why aren't my clients getting their tax rebates? There is nothing wrong with their returns. They are honest, decent people and their returns are clear'. Under the new system in the Tax Office, it should be easier for taxpayers to get their rebate back within a reasonable period. The Tax Office is now spot auditing rather than examining individual returns. I want to read the reply from the Tax Office, which strikes me as being incredible. The Tax Office wrote to the tax agent in the following terms:
      </para>
      <para>
       It may better help you understand the situation if we firstly explain that, at this time last year-
      </para>
      <para>
       The tax agent clearly said to the Tax Office, `Look, at this time last year we had very few outstanding rebates but this year there are an enormous number'-
      </para>
      <para>
       our resources were such that we were in a position to provide a quick turnaround time for most salary returns that were lodged. This year, however, considerable resource constraints imposed on us as part of the Government's budgetary process has meant that the same situation no longer applies. An industrial dispute earlier on this month -
      </para>
      <para>
       that was back in August -
      </para>
      <para>
       did nothing to improve the situation.
      </para>
      <para>
       The letter then said:
      </para>
      <para>
       One of the key objectives of the Australian Taxation Office's Corporate Plan for 1988/89 is for all salary returns to be issued within ten weeks of lodgment and this is what we are currently working to-with, we add, considerably less staff this year.
      </para>
      <para>
       The letter continues:
      </para>
      <para>
       Irrespective of our imposed constraints, we are firmly committed to making the most efficient use of the resources we have to achieve our corporate goals.
      </para>
      <para>
       A couple of things are not mentioned in that letter. Sure, it is evident that this Government has imposed restraints on the Tax Office. But let us notice who is picking up the bill for that restraint. It is not the Government-it keeps the money. It is the Australian taxpayer. As part of the pattern of this Government's economic restraint pattern, the Australian taxpayer is not being given his money back. That is great! Decent, honest taxpayers are being penalised because of this Government's incompetence by not being given their rebates.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another matter of concern is hidden in the last sentence of the Taxation Office's letter in terms of the comment about making the most efficient use of resources. One of the reasons the Tax Office has not had enough people in the tax rebate area is that staff have been involved either with the tax amnesty or the tax file number proposal. In other words, once again the ordinary Australian taxpayer has had to suffer as a result of this Government's priorities. It seems to me that the Tax Office is trying to offset the economic impact of the amnesty, and various other things which are delaying the payment of some tax rebates, by holding on to the money that should have gone out to taxpayers long ago.
      </para>
      <para>
       I was told by the accountant that the turnaround time of 10 weeks that the Tax Office says it is working towards is simply illusory. According to his advice, returns lodged in one week are not recorded then by the Tax Office. There is such a pile of returns to be registered, by the time the Tax Office gets around to registering what time they came in, it is two or three weeks later. It seems to me that there is a real problem in the Tax Office-which just happens to suit this Government's policies and helps resolve the problems that it has at the moment.
      </para>
      <para>
       I say to the Tax Office and to this Government: I think you had better get your priorities right. It is the people of Australia who deserve a decent level of treatment. There should be no delaying of the payment of rebates to ordinary, honest Australians in the volumes in which they have been delayed. If this Government believes that all it has to do in taxation is harass people, make highly publicised raids and all that sort of thing to try to discourage tax cheats, that is fine, but what is it going to do about the honest taxpayer? When is it going to give him his rebate? Let us stop the concentration by this Government on matters that happen to suit it financially but disadvantage the ordinary Australian.

       We all know that Mr Hawke has very little association now with ordinary Australians and is much more interested in his new old mates, the rich and powerful of this country, with whom he seems to find a great deal of pleasure in associating. Certainly, he finds far more pleasure in associating with them than with the ordinary taxpayers to whom he will not give rebates.

The names of the people I invited to the opening of Parliament House were revealed publicly, yet the Prime Minister's invitees are somehow different.

These kinds of double standards, I believe, are aimed at preventing the people of Australia knowing just how close Mr Hawke's old mates operation really is.

        —Despite what we have just heard, we are debating the Appropriation Bills, and I would like to return to those. I notice from reading the Hansard record of the beginning of this debate that the Opposition proposes to move an amendment to the motion for the second reading of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) which condemns the Government for being out of touch and so on and makes three points, (a) (b) and (c). Later in my speech I wish to make some comment about point (c), which states:

      <para>
       That is a most appalling amendment, based on no fact at all. But, as we have just heard, that would not necessarily stop the Opposition. In addressing the matters contained in this legislation, the Opposition has run some very curious arguments past us. If one reads the speeches made on these Bills by Government senators, particularly Senator Maguire and Senator McKiernan, one sees that many of the points raised by the Opposition have been thoroughly canvassed and dealt with.
      </para>
      <para>
       Senator Chaney made two points in particular that I want to take up. I refer first of all to his comments about the family. He was particularly outraged, as was, I think, Senator Michael Baume in his contribution, when he cited very selectively comments that have been made to the effect that in some families a couple might have to work for 10 years so as to be able to afford to buy a house, implying that all of this is somehow associated with an attack on the family. I do not believe that the Opposition in making such comments indicates that it has much understanding of what constitutes a family in this country or yet what constitutes the information that goes into people's decision making as to how to live their lives.
      </para>
      <para>
       What couples take into account when they decide to have a family is a very complex and multifaceted matter. I am sure that Senator Messner would agree with that. It is certainly much more than one item here or one item there. It is also quite interesting for me to hear the Opposition argue that couples having to work for 10 years is apparently preventive to having a family when there is all sorts of evidence in this country that couples who do have families continue to be two-income families. There is a lot of evidence from the use of child-care in this country, from the informal arrangements for child- care and from the use of private and public sector child-care that all sorts of couples continue to work as two-income families and have children.
      </para>
      <para>
       I urge caution on the Opposition about suggesting that figures on housing mortgages and statements by bank managers may be the only evidence that needs to be taken into account when we are talking about how people decide to have families. It is not bad if one wants to make a one line political statement, but it is very wide of the mark in terms of comprehensive analysis. Members of the Opposition do not need to be told that, although I am very happy to tell them. I would like to pick up a quite extraordinary comment from Senator Chaney's speech. He spends quite a lot of his time complaining and bagging the Government because it has not done anything to help families. On page 2630 of the Senate Daily Hansard, Senator Chaney stated:
      </para>
      <para>
       With respect to assistance to families, I condemn the Government for the fact that the only families it has been prepared to help have been those on the lowest incomes.
      </para>
      <para>
       Even if that were true, what an extraordinary remark. How splendidly Senator Chaney highlights one of the priorities for this Government. In the very process of highlighting that, he also condemns the Government for daring to offer its priority assistance to families on the lowest income. I should have thought that that is precisely one of the principal priority areas and one reason the Government is proud of this Budget and the appropriations before us.
      </para>
      <para>
       But as Senator Chaney said, the Opposition condemns the Government for the fact that the families it has been prepared to help are those on the lowest incomes. Can I assume that Senator Chaney would actually praise us if we had helped families on the highest incomes? This is a very curious comment from Senator Chaney and it runs quite counter to the complaints he wants to make. It is not the only assistance this Government gives to families, but it is certainly curious to be condemned for targeting as a priority those on the lowest income. In fact, I would have thought that it might give Senator Chaney considerable cause to read his own speech.

       One interesting thing about attending the presentation of the Budget Speech this year and the briefing beforehand from my perspective was to compare the response and the feeling at the time of the announcement of this Budget with that in relation to the Budget we had to deal with when I first entered this Parliament in 1983. At that stage we were dealing with the consequences of seven years of Fraser Government and a presumed or projected Budget deficit approaching $9.6 billion. Our first Budget was aimed at reducing that to about a $6.5 billion deficit. In just five years we are now looking at a $5.5 billion surplus. It is an extraordinary achievement. It is certainly something, I am amazed to say, to have experienced that extraordinary turnaround in just five years. It has been achieved because of any number of decisions that this Government has taken. These decisions, in the macro-economic level, are very well described in Senator Maguire's speech and I have no intention of running over all of them again. But to highlight them: we have restrained government spending and public sector spending, and we have certainly targeted that spending so that it goes to those most in need. It is easily targetable. At the same time there has been massive restructuring in tax. To hear members of the Opposition talking about tax in the last few speeches, one would believe that they were talking only about personal income tax. I have not heard them talking about the contribution to tax revenue of the capital gains tax; I have not heard them talking about the contribution to revenue of the fringe benefits tax; I have not heard them talking about the contribution to revenue of those people previously, one way or another, not paying their tax and now paying it; and I have not heard them talking about their extraordinary restructuring and the consequential benefits to revenue and to all Australians. I have not heard them being appreciative that we have a surplus. I do not suppose that it is an experience they know-at least not from being in government. I do believe that for the record it must be acknowledged that this is an extraordinary achievement and turnaround in just 5 1/2 years of the Hawke Labor Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       I also have considerable difficulty listening to members of the Opposition because they are very long on complaint. I have yet to hear from them what they would propose to do differently. We have had policy documents, the release of programs prior to elections and a number of promises and at the moment we are apparently waiting with bated breath for a manifesto. But I do not know of any substantial contribution to an alternative program announced by members of the Opposition, not even during this debate. They do not have any clear ideas of what they are proposing to do. (Quorum formed)
      </para>
      <para>
       I was reminding members of the Opposition that we have waited for a long time for policies or platforms and we are now, apparently, waiting for a manifesto in which they promise that they will tell us what they would do that in some way would be different from what we do and also that they will tell us anything that they plan to do. It is interesting that Senator Newman called a quorum on me at this point because my notes here say that it is also very interesting that members of the Opposition forever get up in this place and argue about the importance of government restraint in expenditure. They say that the Government must cut expenditure. One principal argument we have heard over the last few weeks has been the veritable same Senator Newman arguing about the need for Defence Force expenditure. I do not quite know how Senator Newman is planning to argue within the manifesto that government expenditure can be restrained across the board but increased in defence. It may be that that is a priority she will be able to win in the Opposition party room, but apart from anything else it is a curious case in point that the Opposition, which wants to see restraint in government expenditure, is very excellent at arguing for increase in government expenditure in this place. I have not yet heard how members of the Opposition plan to balance those two, although any reading of Senator Walsh's speeches over the last two or three years would explain, on his evidence or on any evidence brought to his mind, that they do not know how to do it.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is also interesting that not too long ago, in a debate in this place on pharmaceuticals, the Opposition objected to the very criteria, and said that, as well as responsible assessment by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee about medications, it should also take into account cost restraint, amongst other things. The Opposition argued at that time that the cost restraint criterion was very bad and should not be considered at all-was not a proper consideration of government. I find it very curious that, while from time to time we are criticised strenuously for cutting expenditure or trying to restrain it, members of the Opposition argue that it should be cut even more and then come in here and argue frantically for increased expenditure.
      </para>
      <para>
       What this Government has done, just in terms of the deficit to surplus, stands worthy of serious appreciation. In targeting its expenditure to those with specific needs or those most in need, the drain on the public purse has been reduced so as to benefit all Australians. That is a point that the Opposition seems not to remember. The high unemployment we had some time ago, apart from anything else, was an enormous drain on outlays. It, therefore, cost all Australians. By creating 1.1 million jobs in the last five years not only has the Government reduced the outlays side and all those unemployment benefits and other services attendant on people in need; it has also increased revenue from the tax those people are now contributing. This is of benefit to all Australians. But the Opposition's case has much to do with homing in on individuals and their needs-not as the right consideration but as the only consideration. This confuses the issue and I think creates misrepresentation in the minds of the people listening.
      </para>
      <para>
       This Government's achievements have been spelt out by my colleagues, and I will not go into them in great detail. The 1.1 million jobs which have been created in the last five and a bit years are many more than the Government's promise of 500,000 jobs when it came into office. That promise was more than achieved, and the Government will continue to achieve in this area.
      </para>
      <para>
       One of the things I note is that the percentage of those jobs going to women is a matter of considerable satisfaction: all those women who have sought employment are now getting it. About 56 per cent of those jobs now provide opportunities for women. At the same time, for the first time ever, the labour force participation rate of women in this country touched 50 per cent. Most women are very pleased to have had the opportunity to move into the work force to get that income assistance and support.
      </para>
      <para>
       Backing up the need to work, let alone the need to train or the need to seek an education, has been the Government's policy of necessary infrastructure in the area of child-care. There has been an enormous increase in the number of child-care places. The number of child-care places has been necessary to assist not only women, but in large part women, who still have the priority consideration of looking after children. They are now able to enter the work force to contribute to those two-income families. Senator Chaney seems to think that it is not possible to have two-income parents and a family.
      </para>
      <para>
       Child-care is also providing opportunities for many more women to obtain education and training. For the first time ever more than 50 per cent of students in tertiary institutions in this country are women. The figures also show that more girls than boys are completing year 12 schooling. All of those things are very exciting for those of us who have been pushing for opportunities for women-not more opportunities than for men but an equal prospect of opportunities along with men in this country, for so long denied to so many women.
      </para>
      <para>
       I believe that Mr Kinnock made the comment-and it certainly did not win him the last election against Maggie Thatcher-that he and his wife were the first people in their families ever to have had the opportunity of tertiary education. That is the case for many Australians, and particularly it is the case for many women in our society. For the first time for generations, women in those families have been able to take up the opportunity of completing school to year 12 or going on to tertiary education of whatever sort they might choose. It is also true that we now have that high participation rate-over 50 per cent-of women in the work force.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think all of those things are indications that the Government's programs targeting women are having considerable success and are being considerably appreciated. I am quite surprised that the women in the Opposition in this place-Senator Vanstone and Senator Newman-seem to be loud in their protests about the benefits of child-care. Anybody who had talked to women in the community would be quite clear that child-care was one of the most sought after needs for people in the community, in particular, for women. (Quorum formed) In the few minutes remaining to me I want to return to paragraph (c) of the amendment proposed by Senator Chaney, which states:
      </para>
      <para>
       coercing participation in the ABS Household Expenditure Survey in the face of substantial doubt about its validity and legal basis . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       I chaired Estimates Committee C and heard at length the evidence about the legality of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) household expenditure survey (HES). No evidence was brought forward and there has never been any doubt that that expenditure survey, HES, is anything other than legal. Its validity and its legality are not in doubt.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Opposition's amendment flies in the face of all the evidence. A considerable amount has been said and written about this. From the beginning there has never been any doubt that the ABS household expenditure survey is legal. If I put the kindest interpretation on it we are dealing with a considerable misunderstanding by some in the Opposition consequent upon letters being received and not known to have been received. I do not want to go into the details. If it is necessary that might be taken up with the Minister in the committee stage of the debate. But even to move this amendment suggesting that there is any doubt about the validity and legal basis of that household expenditure survey is wrong and it will be defeated.
      </para>
      <para>
       When I read the report of Estimates Committee C I also noted that there was a dissenting minority report to the Senate. It was signed by Senators Teague, Messner and McGauran. They raised, amongst other things, the points about the failure of the ABS to inform fully the Attorney-General. They talked about the appropriation and asked that consideration be given to not providing the appropriation for the ABS survey; that is, that part of the household expenditure survey for the period 1 July to 30 September 1988 amounting to $1.3m. There is no way that that can be sustained either on any of the evidence to the Estimates Committee or on material brought to my attention subsequently. Nor do I think that an Estimates report should direct attention to the Chief Statistician's correspondence with the Clerk of the Senate. There are more appropriate ways of dealing with those matters. I think they were properly dealt with but they are mentioned in the dissenting report.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is a bit of a crack at me for failing to conduct some parts of the Estimates consideration in a sound and fair manner. I find this quite interesting, because, if we are to talk about mannerly behaviour or maintaining the usual procedures, I must say for the record that I find it very curious that I was not provided with a copy of this dissenting report until I tabled it in the Senate already bound. In terms of manners, it is a bit slack of the Opposition not to have at least provided me as chairperson, if not the other Government members of that Committee, with a copy of their dissenting report.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is also important to say that there was considerable and extensive examination over many hours in the Estimates of the legality of the household expenditure survey. I repeat: no evidence was brought before the Estimates Committee to sustain the Opposition's amendment that there is doubt about the survey's validity or its legal basis. There is also no evidence that anybody has ever been coerced into providing that information when the household expenditure survey has randomly chosen people and asked them to contribute to the ABS data. I think everybody in this place acknowledges the importance of the data, the importance of reliable and accurate collection of the data and the considerable number of surveys returned so that the statistical analysis of that data is comprehensive.
      </para>
      <para>
       If honourable senators have any further doubts about this, they might like to read Senator Bob Collins's contribution in this place yesterday during a debate on Senator Sheil's private member's Bill. He very comprehensively dealt with the issues and more than adequately addressed the spurious point raised in this amendment by the Opposition. It is regrettable that those kinds of campaign, not dissimilar to many other campaigns by the Opposition, does not contribute to light and reason in our community but up the level of fear and anxiety.
      </para>
      <para>
       I particularly condemn the Opposition for those sorts of tactics. It is not without a pattern. The Opposition is running its campaigns around this country on fear. It is also because it has no policies. But underlying all its attacks, whether on pharmaceutical benefits, elderly pensioners, the household expenditure survey or whatever, is its lack of policy in this area. I guess I could say that I am waiting with bated breath for the Opposition's manifesto but I would be misrepresenting myself. I am not waiting with bated breath. I am not sure we will ever get one. It certainly is not the first document that I want to read when it comes.

       In closing my remarks on this Appropriations legislation, I simply say that this country is emerging from the straitened times it has experienced over the last decade or more as a consequence of seven years of Fraser and, more recently, the loss of $9 billion or more of revenue to this country. We have seen a government that has restructured the Budget in a way that has enabled it to proceed from deficit to surplus. By targeting its programs and expenditure outlays to people with specific needs it has been able to provide the number of services listed in the Budget Papers that I have chosen not to list in detail.
      </para>
      <para>
       In particular, I would like to highlight the women's Budget Paper and the contribution to women in Australia not only in this Budget but also since we came into office. There is clear evidence that the Government, in this appropriations legislation, is making sure that all Australians participate, as they have in the past, in restraint and now in the opportunities this country continues to provide.

When the Budget was brought down in August the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) were quick to congratulate themselves on achieving an estimated Budget surplus of $5.5 billion. However, the method by which that surplus was achieved and the treatment of individual sectors leave a lot to be desired. It must be very clearly understood that the massive Budget surplus was achieved not by brilliant economic management, massive spending cuts or productivity gains but rather by increasing levies, sales tax and excise duties, and maintaining high personal tax rates.

       In the five years since Labor came to office total tax revenue has almost doubled from $44 billion to an estimate of $82.3 billion for 1988-89. Personal income tax revenue will increase by 13.8 per cent this financial year, bringing it to $37.9 billion. About $10 billion of tax revenue collected this year will be due entirely to people being forced into higher tax brackets as they receive pay rises under Labor's wage indexation policy. The Government has continually promised but not delivered on tax cuts for average Australian workers. Cuts in personal income tax were promised by Mr Keating in his May mini-Budget. Cuts were again promised in the August Budget but the Australian taxpayer is not likely to see such cuts until shortly before the next Federal election. This latest promise of tax cuts will of course be conditional upon the unions maintaining wage restraints.
      </para>
      <para>
       While the Government maintains its tax gathering obsession, it has consistently refused to take any serious steps towards curbing spending. Total Government spending in 1988-89 will go up by 4 per cent, to $82 billion, from the figure for the previous year. Indeed, I heard Senator Michael Baume say earlier that current outlays are not expected to change in real terms in 1988-89. That is an interesting point.

       Interest rates remain well above the average rates of our major trading partners. Savings bank home loan rates are currently 14.5 per cent.

Wages and labour costs in Australia far outstrip those of our major trading partners. Under the national wage case decision handed down on 12 August workers were to receive an immediate 3 per cent wage rise, plus a further $10 a week rise in six months time, thus increasing average weekly earnings by 5.2 per cent and forcing many into higher tax brackets.

       Australia's gross foreign debt in the June quarter 1988 totalled a staggering $115 billion and will increase further during 1988-89. Let us compare that figure with our gross foreign debt in June 1983. At that time the debt stood at just $36 billion. There was a change of government, of course, at that time. That figure of $36 billion was bad enough, but nothing like the $115 billion in the June quarter 1988. It is small wonder that under Labor we have lost our AAA international credit rating. Under Labor our current account deficit has risen from $6.7 billion in 1982-83 to a massive $11.9 billion in 1987-88.

       Surprisingly, in the Budget, the Government saw fit savagely to attack our export industries, at a time when those vital, wealth generating industries were most in need. Every assistance scheme for export industries has been cut by over 25 per cent on the figures for the previous year. These are incredible moves, considering that Australia's economic well-being is so dependent upon our ability to compete and trade on world markets.

       The Government is pouring money into non-productive areas, while it continues to bleed dry productive areas generating wealth. If this country is to remain competitive, the Federal Government should be doing everything possible to increase our competitive ability. Instead, regrettably, the opposite is being done. I know that Senator Boswell agrees wholeheartedly that something needs to be done to increase our competitive ability. For example, the Budget grants for the development of export markets were cut by $59m for 1988-89.

        —Not content with slashing assistance to the sugar industry, the Government appears determined to proceed with the proposal to remove the sugar embargo. Senator Boswell must have known what I was going to talk about. The Hawke Government has done a complete about-face on its position in 1983 when it strongly defended the sugar embargo as being crucial to the survival of the industry. The Government has now decided that as from 1 July 1989 the embargo is to be removed-a step which constitutes a direct threat to a most vital element of the industry's security.

      <para>
       The sugar industry is export oriented. With 80 per cent of Australian sugar sold on overseas markets, the industry is very exposed to volatile world prices. It relies heavily on a home base of secure and predictable markets. The Government's action in removing the embargo will erode this essential base to the detriment of the local sugar industry and to the benefit, I regret to say, of its international competitors. The Australian sugar industry guarantees full supply to the local market at Government controlled prices. As a result, Australian consumers have, for many years, enjoyed sugar prices which are about the third lowest in the world. Thus, the consumer has benefited from the embargo, the industry has benefited, and it has not cost the Government anything. So why remove the embargo?

In summary, the embargo provides guaranteed sugar supplies for consumers, control over domestic price rises, and stability and confidence for sugar producers. Loss of the embargo will, I believe, result in higher sugar prices for the consumer. The competitiveness of our sugar export industry will be severely eroded. Refiners and middle men will benefit. The industry's confidence and stability will suffer a major setback.

       The Budget contained no joy for rural Australians. There is no recognition of the tremendous contribution to export earnings made by primary industry over the years. There is no incentive offered in the Budget to maintain the industry's excellent record of productivity. Meanwhile, total revenue from primary industry levies will increase by $105m this financial year. Total revenue from other primary industry charges will rise by a further $19m. These increases relate to rises in wool tax, the livestock slaughter levy, milk levies and export inspection charges. It must be understood that the success of the Budget is conditional on a 9 per cent improvement in Australia's terms of trade and the continued performance and efficiency of rural industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       While the Hawke Government recognises the importance of rural industries in its economic forecasts, it has again failed to provide any of the ingredients vital to improving the international competitiveness of the rural sector. Woolgrowers particularly have cause to be disgruntled with the Federal Government. The Government has refused to introduce income equalisation deposits-the self-help income stability insurance scheme. In fact, the Government would not even maintain wool promotion at the recommended level. It was left to the industry to help itself in this regard. Considering the fact that the woolgrowers have made the biggest contribution to Australia's performance and to the Budget surplus by paying $1 billion in additional tax, I feel that this is rather poor.

        —That is right. The Government believes in helping people in the cities, not in rural Australia where, unfortunately, so few live now. People seem to be having such a hard time in rural Australia that they are coming into the cities.

       Despite the fact that primary industry is Australia's highest export earning sector, this Government seems determined to squeeze the industry dry. At a time when Australia's major export industries are battling against the subsidised production and export policies of European nations, the United States, Japan and New Zealand, this treatment of our major foreign earning industries is not only sad but quite disgraceful. The Hawke Government has long ignored the tremendous contribution made by the rural sector to the growth and affluence of our nation. But enough is enough. The time has come for the Government to appreciate one of the major sources of its income. The Government must take positive steps to increase the competitive ability of our primary industries.

       In keeping with Labor's general attitude of contempt for rural Australians, country students are now to be disadvantaged even further. In addition to the tertiary tax, an assets test will be introduced for Austudy and for the isolated children's assistance program. Messrs Keating and Hawke talk loudly about social justice, but rural people apparently are not part of the social justice program. While total outlays in 1988-89 on all student assistance schemes were forecast to increase by about 12 per cent in real terms, allocations under the program of assistance for isolated children are being savagely cut. The assistance for the isolated children program is being cut back by nearly 17 per cent in 1988-89 compared with Commonwealth allocations for the previous year. This program is aimed at providing some equality of education for bush children as compared with city children. Total allocations for the program in 1988-89 will be $26.9m compared to actual expenditure on the same program in 1987-88 of $32.4m. This will mean a cut of nearly 24 per cent in the number of students being educated through this program-from 19,000 in the calendar year 1988 to 14,500 in the calendar year 1989. What have country people done to be treated this way? I think that it is very sad indeed. I believe that country students deserve every educational opportunity, just as city children do.
      </para>
      <para>
       On 24 August I addressed a question on this subject to Senator Walsh as the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. I noted that total Budget outlays on education in 1988-89 were estimated to rise by 10.4 per cent or $6.3 billion, and that that included an increase in assistance under Abstudy of 21.3 per cent of $16.6m. I then went on to ask Senator Walsh to explain why assistance to isolated children had been so savagely cut. Senator Walsh merely replied that an assets test had been introduced and that this accounted for the reduction in assistance. But, for country people particularly, the assets test is a most inaccurate and unfair system of determining a family's financial status and ability to make ends meet.

       Country people were disappointed to see that the pre-Budget speculation of a reduction in fuel excise came to nothing. The priorities of this Government are questionable, to say the least. How can the Treasurer justify cutting sales tax on cosmetics, perfumes and photographs while standing firm against the prospect of any reduction in fuel excise? In fact, fuel excise will increase by at least the projected inflation rate of 4.5 per cent.

       Funding for roads is to be cut by $50m in 1988-89 and a further $25.7m in 1989-90. I have no doubt that when the roads legislation comes in there will be lots of senators speaking-that is if we get time before the end of the session-on the problem of funding for roads. Australia's roads are falling apart because of inadequate funding. Federal spending on roads has remained at the same level since 1984-85 but when inflation is taken into account we see that funding has declined in real terms by 25 per cent. I note that the Minister has been saying that these figures are wrong and that road funding has gone up but he is not allowing, of course, for the inflation level. Taking inflation into account, there has been a reduction of more than $300m or 25 per cent in real terms.
      </para>
      <para>
       Local authorities are naturally very concerned about the Government's refusal to acknowledge that insufficient funding for roads has become a gigantic problem for a significant percentage of regular road users. Funding cuts have had a major impact in country areas particularly. It has become impossible to keep up with the demand for new and improved roads to cater for the needs of the transport industry and the individual motorist. The funding cuts that were forecast in the Budget will create enormous problems for a significant number of Australia's road users-urban commuters, tourists and the man on the land. More than half the money spent by motorists on petrol goes to the Federal Government. For every litre of petrol or diesel purchased, the Government takes about 30c in tax. Regrettably it returns only about 5.35c to the motorist in the form of road funding. There is certainly a vast difference between taking 30c in the dollar in tax and returning only about 5.35c of that to the motorist.
      </para>
      <para>
       A safe, reliable road network is of fundamental importance to our nation's economy. Despite that, the rate of construction and reconstruction of the local road system has slowed to a virtual standstill. In rural areas particularly, roads are wearing out far more quickly than they can be replaced. I have had lots of people say to me that bitumen roads are fast turning into gravel roads because councils cannot get enough money to keep the bitumen roads repaired. Recent studies have shown that roads carry 97 per cent of all passenger journeys, 77 per cent of all freight and 83 per cent of all domestic tourism journeys. Studies have also revealed that last year road accidents cost almost $5.7 billion when taking into account property damage, lost wages, and hospital and rehabilitation costs. Better roads mean fewer accidents, and that means fewer Australians killed or permanently maimed every year.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is quite obvious to me and, I believe, to all Opposition senators and members that the Labor Government should get its priorities right and give increased financial assistance to rural Australia, from where so much of its export earnings come. I certainly support the Opposition's amendment to the second reading motion for the Appropriation Bill (No. 1).

        —We are dealing with the Appropriation Bills for 1988-89. The process involved in this examination is that Estimates committees examine the Bills before they are debated in the chamber. Each Estimates Committee consists of six senators. It is my pleasure to chair Estimates Committee A, the first of the Estimates committees. I would like to mention a number of points in the report of Estimates Committee A. First, I would like to refer to the examination of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. In discussing the offsets and partnership development program the Committee said in its report:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Committee draws attention to what appears to be a disturbing tendency, exemplified by these programs, whereby former departmental officers involved in framing quite complex systems to implement government policy subsequently take up positions in the private sector advising industry on the very systems or policies they helped to frame.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee went on to say:
      </para>
      <para>
       While recognising the rights of individuals to move between the public and the private sectors it may be necessary in the future for governments to consider the American practice of requiring former government employees to undergo an appropriate e.g. two year prohibition period before they are able to take advantage of their inside knowledge.
      </para>
      <para>
       I agree very strongly with that recommendation of Estimates Committee A because I believe that we have to be concerned that departmental officers can be hired by the private sector. One could use even stronger wording and say that there have been examples of people in the public sector literally having been filched by the private sector so that it could use the knowledge that these people have obtained. I have looked at the American legislation which provides penalties for officers who divulge the information they have gained in their public capacity to private organisations within that two-year period. I noticed that there was a report in the Australian Financial Review of last week concerning this problem in the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce-a department which has been in the forefront of change. I think that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) must be commended for the very active role undertaken by his Department under his leadership. The Australian Financial Review report said that the loss of senior staff is a significant problem and that there is a morale problem because of the pressure of work in that Department. We can understand that because it is headed by a Minister and a Government determined to change the face of industry in Australia. We have to watch this Department's situation carefully. We know that it is a dynamic department, but we must make sure that no more officers are taken from it. This problem applies to other ministries, but it highlights something that I commend the Government to consider.
      </para>
      <para>
       The second matter to which I wish to draw attention is very topical. In the report of Estimates Committee A on the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce reference is made to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). The Committee stated in the report:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee noted with concern the difficulties CSIRO is undergoing with respect to obtaining funding for purchase of capital equipment and endorses the Minister's remark where he stated ``I hope that the Government would be in a position to improve the budgetary situation of CSIRO in the future and I hope that the outside earnings and the targets for outside earnings which have been set for CSIRO will be made; and I have every confidence that they will.
      </para>
      <para>
       I have raised within the Government my view that, despite the attempt by the Government to achieve those outside earnings and an expansion generally of CSIRO, there is a need to extend the funding of that organisation. It is too important to all Australian industry for it to be in difficulty. I appreciate, of course, that the Government is concerned that the private sector has been very lazy, indolent, in its attempts to develop research in this country. There is an attitudinal problem. The `she'll be right' attitude in many sectors of industry has meant that not enough money has been spent in this area. A couple of nights ago there was a major scientific development in this city. Scientists demonstrated their belief that more money should be given to the CSIRO. I have no problem with that as a trade unionist. It is high time that people in this situation showed their concern. The democratic process of complaining about the way science must take off in this country and the fact that it is not going ahead sufficiently is something that I hope will be rewarded in the next Budget.
      </para>
      <para>
       In referring to Estimates Committee A I refer to the reservation expressed by Opposition Senators Bishop, Alston and Chapman. They have contributed probably a record reservation in that it is 13 pages. It should get into the Guinness Book of Records because it is larger than the report itself, which is nine pages. I draw attention to the fact that the Senate committee system works on a give and take basis, with a general preparedness of honourable senators to sit down and come to a position slightly different to that which they started off with. If these minority reports continue-and there have been several from Estimates Committee A-I fear that there will be a Government senators' report and an Opposition senators' report. Unfortunately, not enough effort is being made to reach genuine compromise, at least on Estimates Committee A as I see it. I draw the attention of the Senate to that because if the practice continues we will be presented with a different sort of report to that which the Senate has before it today.
      </para>
      <para>
       In drawing attention to the positive side of an Estimates committee report, I point out that one of the things we looked at was this Parliament itself. I do not intend to dwell on this, but I commend the reading of the report on the Committee's examination of the new Parliament House. The Committee noted with concern a number of matters related to the new building which, although raised during its consideration of the estimates of the parliamentary departments, are in reality matters for resolution by the Parliament House Construction Authority. I will mention only the headings in the report to illustrate our concern. We are critical of the way in which television cabinets were purchased and their inadequacy. We referred to many practical things such as the sound and vision system and even the door closing mechanisms in committee rooms. Very large doors are thumping closed during hearings and the witnesses, officers of the various departments and members of the Committee cannot always be understood. Even the inadequacy of the cleaning arrangements that has been manifest in the new Parliament House was raised. The Committee carefully drew attention to a whole range of miscellaneous matters that are of concern. We hope that they will be resolved fairly quickly.
      </para>
      <para>
       The other major matter I would like to look at is the real matter before us. Senator Chaney and a whole host of Opposition senators have berated and criticised the Government. I remind the Senate of the other side of the story. At the same time as the Government is creating record employment growth and maintaining Labor's long held commitment to a comprehensive and effective social security system, it has created over one million new jobs. Everything we have heard this morning denies the basic fact that over one million Australians have been taken from the unemployment pool or have been given the opportunity to fulfil themselves. This particularly applies to women in our society. This is a singular achievement of this Government. We have had the highest job growth of all the countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. A better, more fair and effective, social security system is being created, aimed at helping the most disadvantaged people in the community.
      </para>
      <para>
       In these appropriations, in this Budget, we have seen increases in the family allowance supplement which help over one million children from low income families to have a higher standard of living. This is the answer, yet we hear nitpicking from the Opposition this morning. So much for the Opposition's criticism when one million children of low income earners are facing a far better situation than they were previously. This Government is setting out to achieve a qualitative change and to remove poverty as it affects children. That is our contribution to the family. It is not a phoney use of the word `family', as so often happens with members of the Opposition, which says that everything is done in the name of the family. We well remember the way the Fraser Government treated families as it added to the unemployment pool in 1981-82.
      </para>
      <para>
       Rent assistance payments are being progressively restructured and will rise to $30 a week for larger families by June 1990. I particularly mention two new programs in the social security portfolio which reflect the Government's commitment both to our electorate and to providing long term economic independence through the employment of all Australians. These two new programs are the New Start program and the jobs, education and training (JET) program. The New Start program will provide adult long term unemployed with 25,000 places for reskilling and training. An amount of $100 will be paid to each of these trainees to help with the costs of starting a new job. The JET program will help single parents in a similar fashion. Improved counselling services and child-care places for up to 12,000 people will be provided.
      </para>
      <para>
       These types of programs reflect our commitment to assisting the most disadvantaged, in particular the long term unemployed, through appropriate restructuring of education and training. This is just one aspect of a program involving massive changes in our economy. The Australian Labor Party has steered the country through the most difficult period in our postwar history. We are in transition from an economy based on digging up Australia and selling it to an economy which is becoming more diversified, more export oriented, more export replacement oriented and much more competitive. This Government realises that, unless it tackles what has been termed a deep-seated malaise of manufacturing industry, the long term future of the Australian economy is bleak indeed.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Labor Government's success in the process of modernisation and revitalisation has rested on many factors. One of the most important is the agenda it has set for labour market and industrial relations reform in Australia. This was demonstrated when we examined the Department of Industrial Relations in Estimates Committee A. A few years ago nobody would have believed that management, unions and employees in Australian companies would be able to discuss, let alone cooperate in, the remarkable changes in the workplace that have started to occur. Nobody knows that better than you, Mr Acting Deputy President, as a person who has had long experience in industrial relations. This has happened because the accord between the union movement and the Labor Party has allowed the Government to tackle the structural crisis, with the involvement and help of unionists and their organisation.
      </para>
      <para>
       This Government has set an agenda for labour market and industrial relations reform in Australia. High on that agenda is award restructuring, which reflects the rapid change that is occurring in industry. This goes hand in hand with the development of a more skilled and adaptable work force and the introduction of more flexible forms of work organisation and management. This year's Budget included a number of important new measures aimed at quickening the pace of workplace reform, particularly award restructuring. I emphasise award restructuring because it has always been an area of entrenched interests. People are fearful of change, and that is understandable.
      </para>
      <para>
       I have mentioned the new Parliament House. I know that a lot of parliamentarians were a bit unhappy about the changes that have been part of the move. Industrial relations are particularly important. This Government set out to create a supportive and positive atmosphere in management and labour in which people can shed concepts they may have which are not relevant to the present. I am very proud of the fact that the unions have led the way in the modernisation strategies that are emerging. Many unions recognise the importance of award restructuring in order to promote skill formation to reduce significantly labour market segmentation and to provide better career structures, and of course this is absolutely vital for women in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       In these appropriations there are a number of initiatives that I am very pleased to be associated with. The Government's workplace reform will sponsor research and special projects. It will assist union employer bodies to employ special advisers in workplace reform. It will provide advisory and consulting services for firms involved in the process of re-establishing and improving competitiveness. Workplace resource centres are to be established and will provide a range of technical and human resource services. The Government will also undertake a major survey of Australian workplace industrial relations. It is incredible in a country where everything is surveyed, where people in the street are accosted all the time and asked their attitude in polls on the order of political life, that we are so ignorant of the basic things that occur in our factories and workplaces. This initiative will provide trade unions, employers and the Government with the comprehensive information that is essential for long term success in workplace reform.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am pleased to say that the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, with which I am associated, has recently brought down its own report on manufacturing industry revitalisation and is about to study the related matter of the various forms of management organisation. This Government also recognises that people need to want to learn a new range of skills so that they can confidently and happily perform a broader range of functions.
      </para>
      <para>
       The new Federal industrial relations legislation will enable much greater flexibility in workplace negotiating. While I do not want to be controversial, as some other senators have been, the reality is that this is being done in a realistic way. Unions are having an input into this process, change is occurring, and of course we have rejected the New Right ideologues. Senator Bjelke-Petersen, as the last speaker for the National Party of Australia, was bemoaning the wage increases that workers are entitled to receive next year. I suppose one could understand why Senator Bjelke-Petersen, being a senator from Queensland and associated closely with the discredited Queensland Government, should plead for woolgrowers at a time of record prices and bemoan the assets test. She probably wants the rich cockies to get their snouts in the public trough once again. She talked about education, when everybody knows that the Queensland education system under the National Party is the worst in Australia. I suppose we have to expect that from people associated with the National Party Government in Queensland, which is discredited in every possible way, but in no greater way than in its poor contribution to the education of the Queensland people.
      </para>
      <para>
       I conclude by referring to the industrial relations legislation, which contains new processes of certified agreements and broadens the scope for negotiation on wages and conditions. The parties to a dispute will now be able to reach their own terms of settlement under the umbrella of the Commission's general wage fixing principles. Unlike the Opposition's proposal for so-called voluntary agreements, there are safeguards against exploitation. The unhappy industrial relations situation that exists in Queensland is an example of how the Opposition's voluntary agreements process works in practice. There is an unequal situation where employees are at a great disadvantage compared with employers. Through the changed legislation and the proposals in this Budget, this Government is continuing a process of allowing the devolution of power so that all people in industrial relations can meet, discuss and resolve problems as adults. They can democratically make arrangements so that they know exactly what they are doing. We know that that is the way to go forward. It is only when people freely engage in agreements that we can release human creativity and develop the human resources which Australia so sorely needs to compete with other countries.

        —Today we are debating the Government's Appropriation Bills. Australia is a country which is resource rich. Yet our economy is not just stagnating; it is going backwards, while around us in the South East Asian region we have seen a most incredible growth rate-firstly in Japan, followed by Taiwan and Korea. As most people are aware, the next economic cab off the rank will be Thailand. It is worth mentioning that all of those countries are resource poor, except in the attitude of their people and the sense of direction of their governments.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Instead of capitalising on this resource richness and using it to introduce value added type products of our natural wealth, Australia still relies on three industries: primary industry, which Senator Childs kicked to death a minute ago; mining; and, more recently, tourism. I am sure that everyone agrees that each of those industries is subject to the vagaries of international markets and is somewhat fragile. Thus, while we rely entirely on those three industries-I think that those industries are terribly vital to us; without them we would be in a shocking mess-our terms of trade will be subject to cyclical roller-coasters. There is an absolutely urgent need to develop our manufacturing industries both for import replacement and exports.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the 1960s and 1970s, tariff protection of import industries was used as an incentive. It proved to be a failure. Yet it was a technique which was highly successful in those countries in South East Asia to which I have referred-Japan, Taiwan and Korea. There are many reasons why it did not succeed in Australia. The most significant was that that protection enabled militant and centralised trade unions to impose wages and conditions which did nothing more than make our industries inefficient and ultimately caused the loss of jobs. Mr Bob Hawke was President of the trade union movement at that time and we remember well the pantomimes and shows that went on, the solving of disputes after people had been brought to their knees. Business was also at fault because it was inward looking and was interested only in production for domestic purposes. Thus it could afford to give in to union militancy and we were paid more than could be afforded. In fact, I can recall statements by the current Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) when he was President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) that, if necessary, to gain these massive wage increases at the expense of the country he would use the devil himself. Honourable senators might remember that comment. The day of reckoning had to come and come it did.
      </para>
      <para>
       So much for some brief history. We must look to the future. We are competing in a world and, having seen, we must learn from the past so that we can pick up the pieces and provide an environment and a framework which will ensure a better Australia and higher standards of living for future generations of Australians. I would say that unless we respond to that, our young people, the people who should be of great concern to this Government but who have been neglected by this Government, will end up with very menial tasks. I do not want my children or grandchildren to face a future of being shoeshine boys. Unless we do something about it, that is where we will go.
      </para>
      <para>
       The three major industries must be supported because, as I mentioned earlier, without them we will be in an absolutely shocking mess. If we do not move quickly into competitive manufacturing, using our natural resources, it will be only a matter of time before our standard of living deteriorates and we will become one of the poor countries in our region of South East Asia. The great questions are: Can we lift our game and will Australians respond under the right conditions which have not been present in the last five years? I am sufficient of an optimist to say that it can be done and I share with Senator Button the frustration as to why it is not being done and why it is so infintesimally slow.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government tried the so-called J-curve, the theory being: if we collapse the dollar, export incomes will rise, the price of imports will go up and that will provide the incentive to import replacement and exports of manufactured goods. The theory did not work, except in some very few cases. Yet an undervalued currency was, once again, a great success in the rise of Japan. The question must be asked why it did not work. There were many factors that this Government could not or would not address. The reasons are fairly well known. Why, for example, do individuals put their savings into real estate rather than into the wealth creating manufacturing industries, which would assist in our balance of payments problems and create jobs?

        —Senator Cook will be aware that in other countries when things are bad there is a move towards gold. When there is political or economic instability people move into gold because they see it as holding its value and also being readily tradable. Because of this Government's policies and actions, which have acted as a disincentive to savings and investment, we in this country have moved into real estate. So there is a gold mentality here but we see it in a different light. People think to themselves, `How can we protect our hard earned savings?' The only thing they can think of is, `Let's get some real estate.' That has the effect of pushing up the price of real estate. In addition, this Government has brought incredible interest rates upon this country over a sustained period-not the little pips that Senator Walsh used to refer to when he talked about the Fraser Government, but sustained interest rates-which are about double what people in other parts of the world have to pay.

       Why is it that people overseas prefer places such as Korea, Taiwan and now Thailand rather than Australia? Yet, as I mentioned earlier, we are a resource rich country. We have an intelligent, reasonably well educated population. Why do people prefer those countries? All the glossy brochures and missions will not make one iota of difference to investment in Australia in wealth creation. Until our serious and apparently entrenched structural problems are addressed nothing will happen.

       What a criticism. What has been the response? We have not had that sort of investment. We need that investment. Why do they not come here and share their technology in joint ventures? I even heard the President of my Party, Mr Elliott, the other day complain that Japanese investment in real estate should be diverted to manufacturing industry. While the incentive is not there to go into manufacturing, what is happening is inevitable. We cannot blame the Japanese or anyone else for investing in the areas we do not want them to invest in-there is no attraction. That is the problem.
      </para>
      <para>
       We must look at two areas. Firstly, we must capture what is left of the savings of Australians after the Government got at them and encourage Australians to get into those investments. To do so the structural problems I have just referred to must be addressed. The trading banks' prime rate of interest in this country is about 15.5 per cent and rising. Let us compare that with the Japanese rate of 5 to 6 per cent. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) says, `Our economy is overheated; let's lift the interest rate up'.
      </para>
      <para>
       A lot of people ask why we have to increase the interest rate to 15 or 16 or 17 per cent at great expense, not only to business but to the ordinary person with a house mortgage, when in Japan, which has a rate of 5 to 6 per cent, the economy is not overheated and when in the United States, with interest rate of 8 or 9 per cent, the economy is not overheating. We have to go to 16 or 17 per cent to curb so-called overheating. The answer is that this Government has not done anything to control inflation. Our inflation rate on an annualised basis is 7.3 per cent. It looks to be locked in at about 7 per cent. The inflation rate in Japan is 0.6 per cent. I can quote a host of other figures, whether they be from West Germany, Japan, the United States or wherever. So much for the accord. There is great uncertainty about the dollar. Secondly, we have the restrictive work practices, a centralised industrial relations system and a perception of industrial anarchy. Senator Childs said in his speech that there had been great improvement under the accord.

        —I am quoting the facts and describing to Senator Cook exactly why we are having difficulties and how they can be resolved. Senator Childs said that the accord had been a great success, that there had been a reduction in industrial disputes and that there was cooperation at various levels. I question that. Certainly, when looking at the October monthly economic and social indicators we find that the number of disputes has come down. Let us look at the number of working days lost. That is what counts. That is what affects people, local or foreign, when they decide whether they are going to put their money up. In 1983-84, 1.27 million working days were lost because of industrial disputation. In 1984-85 the figure was 1.3 million and in 1985-86 it was 1.46 million. It came down in 1986-87. That was around the time of the `banana republic' comments. In 1987-88 1.689 million working days were lost by industrial disputation. What a great success! What an encouragement to get this country out of its mess. So much for domestic investment. Why do people go into real estate-this is what I call the gold mentality-instead of the wealth creation areas? I do know that. Investment in real estate does not contribute much, if anything, to the economy, except to push the price of real estate up.

       Let us look at overseas investment. Why are people not coming here? They have a plus: their interest rates are less. The inflation rate in Australia is at least double the rate of the European Economic Community, which is a problem. There is continuing uncertainty about the exchange rate, as there is with the domestic rate. Anyone who invested in an import replacement or export industry when our dollar was worth US60c or US65c, which Senator Button said was about the right level, would now be dead in the water. I was surprised the other day at the lack of understanding shown by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. In answer to a question, he said that if those people are in trouble-this is what he implied-it is their own fault and that they could have purchased forward cover. I ask: for how long? For three months, for six months? It would not be enough; they would still be dead in the water.
      </para>
      <para>
       As I mentioned, the number of days lost is a disincentive to domestic and foreign investment in Australia. Compared to our near neighbours, our level of disputation and our level of uncertainty are totally unacceptable. That is the perception. Senator Cook might say it is not right, but I am telling him that that is the perception; that is the real world. It will not be corrected until people in the union movement get responsible runs on the board. We recently had the Australia-Japan Coal Conference. The coal people are already in difficulties because of the rise in the dollar, as are a lot of our export industries. I have a newspaper article which states:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Managing Director of Nippon Steel Corp, Mr Toyohiko Ohno, warned that appalling industrial relations placed Australian coal producers in a `very disadvantaged position'.
      </para>
      <para>
       We recently had the iron ore problem at Mount Newman which Senator Cook would know a lot about. The unions bucked the orders handed down by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. According to that article, the chief executive of that corporation, the leader of the delegation, warned:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . appalling industrial relations placed Australian coal producers in a `very disadvantaged position'.

       Meanwhile, two BP Coal Australia mines in NSW remained inoperative yesterday in a dispute over management plans to introduce more continuous rosters, although talks in search of a solution were in train . . .

       The President of the Miners Federation said:

       What impeccable timing: right in the middle of-in fact, on the same day as-the discussions between the Australians and the Japanese on the future of our coal exports! One wonders about these people's motives. Are they really interested in the future of their Australian colleagues? Are they really interested in the development of our export market? Continuing restrictive work practices, wildcat strikes, inflexibility and the perpetuation of a `them and us' attitude all add up to a lack of productivity. That is really what we are talking about; we must increase productivity per worker. We live in an increasingly competitive world.
      </para>

       I was taken the other day by some remarks by Sir Bruce Watson, who made an interesting analogy when he pointed out that a person who won a gold medal in the Los Angeles Olympics just over four years ago would not have got a place in the Seoul Olympics. It is exactly the same with the level of international competitiveness. I note, as others have, the remarks of Terry McCrann in the Brisbane Sunday Mail and in other papers. He simply put it this way: `We are not earning our way. We are going backwards in an increasingly competitive world'. He went on to cite our increase in gross domestic product and then the changes in the gross domestic product (GDP) per person employed, which has been going down, and the changes in GDP per hour of work.

       We desperately need investment, both domestic and foreign, in our manufacturing industries, but we will not achieve it while these structural problems are out of kilter with those of other countries. They must all be addressed; but by far the most critical, from a foreign investment point of view, is what is perceived to be our permanently inflexible industrial relations system. There is no way that this Government will face up to this problem. Until it does, the other structural problems will not be corrected. When I go around Australia I am surprised to see how few people realise that no Australian citizen can become a Labor senator or member of the House of Representatives unless he or she is a member of a union acceptable to the ACTU. So all Labor senators and members, from the Prime Minister down, are here by the grace of the ACTU.

       Senator Maguire, in his speech, criticised my previous remark that this is the highest taxing government in Australia's history.

       I would like to give honourable senators a list of the sorts of increases that have occurred since this Government came to power. In 1982-83 income tax on individuals-in the main, pay as you earn tax-was $23 billion. In 1988-89, that figure has gone to around $48 billion, an increase of 107 per cent, a burden on the backs of the ordinary Australian family man, the ordinary Australian worker. Company taxes, including the fringe benefits tax, have gone from $4.8 billion to $11.2 billion, which is an increase of 132 per cent. The Government reckoned that it was not going to introduce a consumption tax, but it has done it by stealth. Everything from milkshakes to whatever is now included under sales tax.

Income tax has gone up by 107 per cent; company tax has gone up by 132 per cent; and sales tax has gone up by 147 per cent. And-guess what?-the consumer price index, the inflation rate, is up by 51.6 per cent. I might just say in passing-and going back to the remarks I made earlier-that for the full five-year period the increase in Japan was only 6.5 per cent.

       What a great job this Government has done! We have a punitive taxation regime which penalises savings. Is it any wonder that people are protecting their savings by going into real estate? What is needed is a regime which encourages savings and investment. In recent days, with the issue of the report on Forward Estimates, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) claimed a reduction in government spending compared to GDP, so that in three years it will be at its lowest level for 20 years. That is very interesting. Let us look closely at the figures. They claim that things are going so well that inflation will be 4.25 per cent next financial year, and will then fall to 3.5 per cent in the following two years. Nothing short of a miracle will bring that about. The way this Government is running the economy has nothing to do with miracles; it is a disaster. As mentioned a few times previously, the rate of inflation is 7.3 per cent, which was also the rate for the last financial year and, in spite of rhetoric to the contrary, there is every chance it will remain high for some time.
      </para>
      <para>
       If we look through the various Budget figures, we find that the Government has not reduced its own spending. Sure, it reduced its payments to the States and things like that, but its own spending has not gone down one iota. It is also interesting to note that the Government attributes the fall in spending partly to a 5.6 per cent cut in unemployment benefits by 1989-90. Unemployment is currently around 7.8 per cent and for 1988-89 it is projected to be 7.4 per cent. The high youth unemployment figure of 1984 was 21 per cent. That figure has fallen to 15.6 per cent, which unfortunately is still a very high figure but is an improvement. I notice a curious coincidence. I do not mind this, but I just wish the Government would be honest about it. With the fall in youth unemployment, the numbers receiving Austudy have risen from 175,000 in 1984-85, with a payout of $333m, to a projected 335,000 in 1988-89, with a payout of $785m.

       Unfortunately, time is going to beat me. The people of Australia are not gullible. They know that the balance of payments deficit has not, as the Treasurer said, been caused by a manufacturing boom. With all the rhetoric of this Hawke Government, with its calls for belt-tightening, what has it achieved over five years? It has achieved an incredible reduction in the standard of living and a bleak prospect for the future. The Government will not address the major structural problems confronting this country.

        —This Government has developed and endorsed a national conservation strategy; it has acknowledged land degradation and the greenhouse effect as two of the greatest problems facing our society. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) has pointed out on nationwide television that the greenhouse effect is evidence that continuing abuse and overuse of the earth's finite resources must stop. Yet, when it comes to supporting such a sensible change in direction of our national use of resources in the Budget, environmental issues are pooh-poohed and dismissed as single issue demands-despite the Commonwealth's clear responsibilities in the areas of energy policy, soil conservation, resource use such as forests, and the conservation of the Australian natural heritage through the Register of the National Estate.

       Energy trends are an important indicator of the world's economic and ecological health, and they are not yet on a sustainable course. In fact, according to the Worldwatch Institute in its publication the State of the World 1988, energy trends are at the root of some of the world's most intractable environmental problems. The nuclear fuel cycle is a continuation of this trend, not a solution to it. The key to resolving the coal-nuclear conundrum is simple but radical: greatly improved energy efficiency, emission controls, and stemming deforestation in the short term, complemented by renewable energy in the long run. What better credibility for the Australian Government to influence the elimination of nuclear weapons than by demonstrating safe, cheap energy alternatives-alternatives which do not undermine the international monetary system, do not pollute the atmosphere, do not encourage wasteful, high consumption life-styles, and do not generate intractable wastes, and which stimulate innovation, employment and sustainable economic development?

       It is no coincidence that the Western Australian Government Minister who lobbied the hardest for a deregulated uranium policy earlier this year was the same Minister who cut out funding for the Solar Energy Research Institute in Western Australia, better known as SERWA, the only research, testing and information centre for renewable energy in my home State. It is a pathetic situation when creative solutions are discarded in favour of perpetuating the problem.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), the best qualified government research body in the land, must beg and scrape simply to restore the funding cuts which have been undermining its programs since 1983-84. It has now been granted $1m per year for solar energy research-non-polluting, renewable energy-as compared to the $8m granted for coal research. Further pleas by CSIRO this week for a mere $15m to begin to address other Australian environment problems are evidence of an international disgrace and an insult to the growing community concern about unsustainable resource use. It is interesting that even scientists-some of whom have never before taken to the streets to do so-demonstrated their concern when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) opened the new science institute here in Canberra the other day. Obviously the cuts are affecting so many of our top scientists who are now part of the brain drain overseas, which is a waste of a very valuable national resource.

       It was pointed out to me by a constituent in the business of energy management that our Government provides no incentives for increased energy efficiency. In fact, incentives usually work in the opposite fashion. This trend is consistent with that of the United States, where nuclear energy was pioneered. In 1979, researchers Yergin and Stobaugh from the Harvard Business School estimated that distortions in the pricing of coal and nuclear energy systems from tariffs, subsidies and unaccounted costs to the environment were in the order of $50 billion per year. The failure of the United States `superfund' to adequately deal with intractable wastes generated since the Harvard Business School calculations attests to the long term consequences of natural resource abuse.

       It was interesting to hear our State Minister for Transport in Western Australia defend current transport policy at a greenhouse seminar held in Perth last May. In response to an observation by a member of the audience that our metropolitan transport system encourages the use of private automobiles and carbon dioxide emissions, the Minister insisted that a balance must be kept between commuter convenience and atmospheric protection. At what point do the public good and survival of the planet override individual convenience? That time is fast approaching.

       Some implications of ignoring the warning signs that sustainable limits to development have been exceeded were explored in The Bulletin's May 1988 edition on the ozone problem. The author, Ben Sandilands, describes the difficulties in dealing with larger-than-life issues which, despite their apparent distance from everyday experience, would change daily life forever. He states:
      </para>
      <para>
       [These issues] confront political systems, which have attention spans of a few years at most, with problems that need action over decades or even centuries. They may lead to crisis in which authoritarian figures arise offering solutions beyond the will or ability of free enterprise economies or normal democratic institutions to provide.
      </para>
      <para>
       While ozone depletion may be a relatively recent concern for most of us, other environmental and social justice issues continue to receive only token support by this Government. Witness our nation's soil erosion and salinisation and the continuing support for fossil fuel research, development and consumption, despite solemn acknowledgments of the imminent costs of perpetuating the greenhouse effect.
      </para>
      <para>
       This politically easy deregulatory path which the Government seems intent upon following does not augur well for our environment. Faith in market-place economics will not save the ozone layer or our topsoil, because until the Government actively promotes the sustainable use of renewable resources, they will continue to confront institutional barriers to compete in the market for our custom.

       This means looking critically at the energy demands created by large scale developments such as the current proposal for a petrochemical plant in Western Australia. Its purported contribution to our society is to use up so-called surplus natural gas, thus diverting it from more appropriate energy uses, to produce more disposable plastic products. Unfortunately, a lack of public participation in environmental management is something of a tradition in Australia. Since colonial times, the government has been the source of information, knowledge and resources, resulting, as James Colman, town planner, points out:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . [in] a strong local tradition of intolerance, suspicion and distrust towards freethinkers, radicals, outsiders and nonconformists. In spite of the great Australian respect for mateship and the independent spirit, as a community we are ever ready to indulge in a knee-jerk reaction whenever we are confronted with a nonconformist or unorthodox view. Those who hold such views are peremptorily labelled ratbags, lunatic fringe dwellers, commos, public enemies, knockers, eco-nuts, greenies and (most derisive of all) intellectuals.
      </para>
      <para>
       How true that is. Fortunately, awareness of the need for environmental care is growing in the general community. A poll commissioned by the West Australian newspaper in July showed that 85 per cent of West Australians oppose mining in national parks. A nationwide poll conducted this month, by Frank Small and Associates, showed that three-quarters of the Australian community identified the breakdown of the ozone layer as the most significant problem requiring urgent action, 73 per cent of Australians are concerned about the disposal of nuclear wastes, 67 per cent of Australians are concerned about the use of pesticides on crops, and 63 per cent think that forests are being cut too rapidly. These are not the opinions of radical greenies. They are views held widely in the Australian community.

Awareness of the public concern for environmental management has also reached the most mainstream news magazines. Time and the Bulletin now feature regular sections on the environment. Significantly, this week's edition of Time is devoted to national environment issues and the role of the voluntary conservation movement in monitoring government commitment to resource management.

I refer the Minister to complaints that have been made by a number of people that they have received calls from members of the Special Investigations Unit to question them about allegations that they had been involved in war crimes. I ask the Minister: Firstly, how many of the 500 or so individual files which have been opened by the Special Investigations Unit, as disclosed in evidence to Senate Estimates committees, have resulted in police calling on suspects, and how many statements have been obtained from these people by this method? Secondly, have Australian Federal Police officers explained to these people the origin of the allegations and the fact that the War Crimes Bill has not yet been passed by the Parliament? Thirdly, have the police explained carefully to these people their rights under existing law in regard to answering questions? Fourthly, in light of the evidence that is now available about the number of people who have been questioned, why has a spokesman for the Attorney-General, as reported in the Age on Wednesday, denied as `absolute nonsense' that any such visits have taken place?

I have heard no allegation of anything to the contrary so I cannot specifically respond to such matters. Senator Durack mentioned some 500 files and he wanted information as to how many persons had been approached.

         —For some years the lack of access to child-care in the Parliamentary Triangle, which is visited literally by millions of people each year, has been regarded as a problem. The Government has been looking at it for a long time. When this building was under construction there was a fair bit of debate about the merits of providing child-care either within the building itself or at a site nearby. I am pleased to say that this debate has finally reached its conclusion. I am sure many who participated in the debate are even more pleased about that than I am.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Government has now agreed to the establishment of a purpose built child-care facility in the garden on the House of Representatives side of the provisional Parliament House. The facility will cater for a range of child-care needs through the provision of 40 long day care places under the Commonwealth's children's services program. These places, available to the general community, will meet the needs of working parents, particularly sole parents and low income earners. I would expect that this child-care centre will be used by a great cross-section of Australians because its location will be so handy to this building. Thirty occasional care places will cater for the many visitors to the national institutions within the Parliamentary Triangle.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe this decision adds to the Government's excellent record in child care. It must be remembered that since the Government came to office it has more than doubled the number of child care places, from 46,000 in March 1983 to 110,000 this year. The national child care strategy announced in the Budget provides for an additional 30,000 places over the next four years. I believe that this decision of the Government is not just an end to the debate but is a satisfactory conclusion for all concerned.

         —No, not for best actor. There have been confusing reports as to just who the Emmy was awarded to but I can say to the Senate that the Emmy was definitely awarded to the Australian Children's Television Foundation. Of course that is a tremendous tribute to Patricia Edgar and her creative team at the Foundation for the excellent work they have been doing for some years and the standards they have set for the production of children's films in Australia. The Foundation does receive considerable assistance through my portfolio. Captain Johnno was one program in the Foundation's  Touch the Sun series, shown on Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) television earlier this year. I should say that the ABC deserves our congratulations for continuing to support the Children's Television Foundation by being the television station that accepts its programs. The response from the commercial networks has been particularly disappointing in this regard, a point that I have made to those networks on a number of occasions.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The series Touch the Sun, of which Captain Johnno was a part, has won many awards, including first prize for live action at the Chicago International Festival of Children's Films for another program Devils Hill. Damien Walters, the leading actor in Captain Johnno, received an award on Saturday night for best performance by a juvenile actor at the Australian Television Society awards. So I would hope that all senators, including even Senator Boswell, would join with me in congratulating the Children's Television Foundation for an achievement which is notable among the many achievements of which it can boast in recent years.

But for the next Commonwealth Public Service pay day, which I think is Thursday of the week after next, there is certainly not enough money to meet that payment unless the Appropriation Bills are passed.

        It is hard to believe that the Bjelke-Petersen Foundation is a charity or a benevolent institution. Indeed, it is very hard to believe that Sir Robert Sparkes is a modern-day Robin Hood blackmailing his National Party colleagues for charity. I think it is far more likely that he was blackmailing them for some much less worthy purpose. I would have thought, too, that there was some question of contempt of parliament in making such a threat to a Minister, as Mr Hinze then was, in the Queensland Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the Bjelke-Petersen Foundation is a wholly political fund, and if members of the National Party are being blackmailed and told that they will not get anywhere in politics unless they make a contribution to it, it could be argued that that contribution was an expense necessarily incurred in the earning of income.

So as far as the Income Tax Assessment Act is concerned, there would be no direct applicability to the relationship between Mr Hinze and the Bjelke-Petersen Foundation if Mr Hinze's claim that he had given not one dollar is correct because, if he made no donation, obviously no deduction could legitimately have been claimed. However, it seems that Mr Hinze has a double standard on these issues. He believes that it is quite okay to be the recipient of a political pay-off but not to be the contributor to it.

         —As most honourable senators will have heard, in a reported statement this morning South African Justice Minister Coetsee announced that Nelson Mandela's improved health will soon allow him to be released from a private clinic in Cape Town and that he will not be returned to prison but to guarded quarters with better facilities, allowing improved access by members of his family. But Minister Coetsee also reportedly said that Mandela could not be released because of the alleged risks or threats to his safety. No information was provided as to what these alleged risks were or what the Government was doing about them, nor did the Justice Minister give any indication whether Mr Mandela's own wishes or views were being taken into account. These must be considered paramount.

       <para>
        The Australian Government would be most concerned if unsubstantiated alleged risks to Nelson Mandela were to be used as an excuse to delay his release indefinitely. The Government firmly believes that Mandela's unconditional release could help to heal the deep divisions among South Africans and thus help to break that cycle of violence and encourage movement towards a realistic resolution of the country's crisis by peaceful political means. The Government will continue to urge the South African authorities to release Mandela and other political prisoners unconditionally, to repeal current repressive laws, to allow free political expression and organisation, and to negotiate now with authentic black leaders on a non-racist democratic political system based on equality and dignity for all South Africans.

         —My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. It arises out of what appears to be widespread concern about the transfer of responsibility for defence service loans from the Defence Service Homes Corporation to the Westpac Banking Corporation. I preface my question by saying that I am sure the Government will have had representations about this in view of the volume of representations I have had in my electoral office from people who are worried about the implications of the sale of the loan portfolio to Westpac, some of whom are quite angry and who believe that their loans are at risk of increased interest rates. Is the Government aware that, in advance of the legislation passing through this Parliament, Westpac is contacting existing loan holders and seeking from them details which many of those concerned feel they should not have to provide to the bank as all of the information is held by the Defence Service Homes Corporation? Is Westpac entitled to make such inquiries at this stage? Will the Minister give an unequivocal assurance that the interest rates now paid on defence service mortgages will not be increased because of the privatisation of the loan portfolio? Finally, will the Minister let us know why the information is being sought by the bank when, presumably, it is held by the Defence Service Homes Corporation?

         —Senator Chaney gave notice of the general nature of this question. I thank him for that, but there are a number of issues in the text of the question that will have to be taken on notice. Nevertheless, Minister Humphreys has advised the following: Existing borrowers will not be disadvantaged in any way by the transfer of the defence service home loans to Westpac. Existing loans have been taken over by Westpac on the same terms and conditions as at present. In particular, the interest rate and monthly repayments will not increase and all ancillary benefits currently available under the present scheme, for example, the widows' relief scheme, will be maintained. The General Manager of the Defence Service Homes Corporation has written to every existing borrower to explain these provisions and to emphasise that the new arrangements are dependent on the passage of enabling legislation by the Parliament. Enclosed with this letter was a letter from Westpac and a form inviting borrowers to nominate the most convenient branch of Westpac with which they could deal. I understand that it is this form which is causing confusion to some borrowers in that it is being seen as seeking their consent to the transfer of the loan, which is not the case. The Westpac letter was intended merely to facilitate that smooth transfer.

        Senator Chaney asked me in the chamber before Question Time why the Government had not handed over the information to Westpac. I have tried to seek an answer on this and the response at this stage is that a comprehensive press release has been issued on this. If inquiries have been made to Senator Chaney's office or indeed to other senators' offices, a further press release could be issued. If there is still confusion, we should take the matter up with Minister Humphreys.

What is the amount of the training allowance now? What conditions apply to the payment of this allowance? How does this differ from the amount and conditions applicable before August 1988? How many beneficiaries receive the training allowance? How many of these beneficiaries are women?

         —Changes to the rates of the training allowance paid by the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service to clients undertaking formal vocational courses were announced in the recent Budget. I am sure Senator Dunn is referring to those changes. The changes are to bring the allowance into line with those paid by the Department of Employment, Education and Training. The training allowance is primarily an incentive payment to encourage clients to undertake vocational training. It is in addition to income support paid in the form of rehabilitation allowances. All other costs associated with clients' rehabilitation programs are met by the Department of Community Services and Health. Clients affected by the new rates received three months advance notice of changes. The new rates-I think this was one of Senator Dunn's questions-from 1 January 1989 are $30 per week for full time courses and $20 per week for part time courses. If any clients believe they are using their training allowance to pay for essential costs associated with their studies, they should discuss the matter further with their local rehabilitation unit. Senator Dunn asked whether I am aware of the report Breaking In and Breaking Out. I am aware of that report and its contents.

I am pleased to have this opportunity to pay tribute to my colleague Senator Graham Richardson for the work he has done in relation to the listing of the wet tropics in north Queensland. A number of myths abound about the cooperation of local government. For example, for nearly 12 months Senator Boswell has been speaking in this place and elsewhere about how local government is distressed and how local government will not talk with Senator Richardson or me or officers from our respective departments. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is certainly correct that local councils and their representatives do not necessarily agree with World Heritage listing. That is their right in a democratic country. However, unlike the Queensland State Government, local government has been responsible enough to continue, on an ongoing basis for over 12 months now, to work very closely with the rainforest unit and with the Office of Local Government.

Well may he talk blackmail, because in actual fact it was the Queensland Government that told local councils that they were not to do business with Senator Richardson or me, because it is the Queensland Government that is being intransigent and uncooperative in this regard. Of course, we have worked quietly away behind the scenes talking with local government about opportunities for its communities, and at last, in the last 10 days or so, we have finally reached agreement. I announced in Ingham only last week the first of the community initiatives projects, and I will be announcing later today the second of the community initiatives projects for none other than the tableland region. I had an interesting conversation with a journalist from the tableland up there who said, `How can these councils agree to go ahead with your community initiatives project when they are so opposed to World Heritage listing?'. I said, `Well, you had better ask the councils that'. The reality is that the councils are pragmatic. They are concerned about the needs of their communities, and they are very enthusiastic about the way the community initiatives project can assist their people. They know that our community initiatives project is based on the very successful two-year pilot program of the country centres project. They know that this approach brings the community together, identifies new opportunities, and brings new investment to a region, and that it is a very appropriate form of structural adjustment for an area undergoing considerable changes.

        I think it is appropriate that I should be placing on record the support that local government has given and the fact that this is in total contrast to the Queensland Government, which has not been prepared to negotiate and has spread impossible rumours, such as saying that great vigilance is necessary because we are going to set up new local authorities in the region-which is an absolute furphy and goes totally against local government legislation in Queensland. Yet persistently the Hon. Jim Randell and Geoff Muntz are putting out press releases saying that the Federal Government will create new local governments in north Queensland. What nonsense! That is what the issue of constitutional recognition of local government was all about-that only State governments have control over any amalgamations of local governments.

         —As the Prime Minister made clear in the House of Representatives yesterday, the Government very much welcomes the decision of State President Botha to commute the death sentences against the Sharpeville Six. Also-this might be a little more to the taste of Senator MacGibbon-the Government naturally welcomes the decision by the President to commute the death sentences of the white policemen. Australia also made representations in those cases. It might come as some surprise to Senator MacGibbon and the fellow squawkers on the benches opposite to appreciate that we are consistent in our approach because we are absolutely opposed to capital punishment imposed on anyone because of its cruelty and inhumanity.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The decision in relation to the Sharpeville Six must be regarded as something of a victory for international public opinion in view of the many calls for the reprieve of the six, including personal appeals by the Prime Minister to the South African Ambassador. Our Ambassador in Pretoria made renewed representations on behalf of the six as the Court of Appeal refused leave to appeal and before the death sentences were commuted. Of course, relief at the news has to be tempered by the lengthy prison terms that the six have been sentenced to-up to 25 years. Those sentences seem particularly onerous in view of the highly controversial use of the common purpose doctrine in this case. The relief that most of us at least feel about the reprieve of the six has also been very much tempered by the further news received this morning that several more people have been hanged in South Africa in the last 24 hours since the reprieve of the six.
       </para>
       <para>
        The ugly reality of the matter is that, in addition to all the other offences against fundamental human rights that the South African Government perpetrates, that country hangs more people in terms of population than any Western country. Between 1983 and 1987, 627 people have been executed in South Africa. And the number is increasing. Last year there were 164 executions-the highest number in 75 years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, on 11 November the Australian Ambassador in Pretoria, at my direction, made representations to the South African Government over the very frequent use of the death penalty in that country and we will continue to voice that concern.

Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the article in yesterday's Australian Financial Review concerning proposed new remuneration arrangements for senior public servants? Can the Minister confirm the substance of this article? Is the Government, as part of its proposal to introduce a performance based salary system, also considering movements downwards in salaries in the case of public servants not performing their duties adequately and a greater use of contract employment to provide increased flexibility in the Public Service? Are these proposed new arrangements going to be referred to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and be tested against the Commission's wage guidelines? When does the Government propose to introduce the new payments system to stem the tide of Public Service resignations and to improve the performance and professionalism of the Service?

The Government has indicated that, consistent with its emphasis on increased public sector efficiency, consideration is being given to developing a new approach to remuneration for the most senior levels of the Public Service. These matters are still being given careful consideration by the Government in light of overall wage policy.

        However, the Government has agreed that departmental secretaries and Senior Executive Service (SES) officers at level 3 and above-that is, division heads and deputy secretaries-be given private use of the government cars they currently drive to and from work, which will bring conditions of service for senior Public Service managers into line with their private sector counterparts. A personal financial contribution to offset the private use will be required and, during working days, cars will continue to be available to departments for official use.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Peter Morris, also announced on 22 November an early retirement scheme to allow some staff in the Public Service over the age of 50 to take advantage of early retirement. That is consistent with the Government's ongoing reform to ensure that the Public Service is effective and responsive to requirements. The scheme will be administered by departmental secretaries who will be able to invite staff who are over 50, in the levels immediately below the SES, who are not coping fully with the nature and pace of change in the Public Service to retire. They will be entitled to the standard voluntary retirement benefits that apply in redundancy situations.
       </para>
       <para>
        This proposal has been the subject of consultations with relevant unions, which have been supportive of it, and there are to be further staff consultations on the detail of the scheme. It is entirely voluntary. There will be no pressure on staff to retire if they do not wish to do so. But, by allowing staff who are coming closer to retirement and, in some cases, are anxious to retire, to retire early with appropriate benefits, the scheme will allow for an infusion of new talent and energy at the middle management level of the Service.

Assembly laws are then subject to change or repeal by the Assembly. But given the support for the casino proposal within the ACT community I would be surprised if the new ACT Government were to reverse the decision. I would find that extraordinary. However, the possibility exists.

        The honourable senator asked me about section 19 and selling parts of it for the casino. She also asked what would happen if no suitable casino operator were found. As a result of Australian Federal Police inquiries which were, to say the least, rigorous, we were able to select an operator to proceed with the casino on Christmas Island and I would be pretty surprised if the new Administration could not find an acceptable operator, not only in terms of running a good operation but also in terms of running a clean one. But that is something I will leave to the incoming Administration. In so far as the property is concerned, I think it is well known what section 19 is and what the Government expects of it. Many questions were asked at Estimates committee hearings about how a value could be placed on the site. In fact, those who were at the Estimates committee hearings--

An industrial dispute in August caused some delay in customs clearances but that delay was remedied within a week; that is, by early September. In September-October of this year almost record levels of import transactions were dealt with by Customs-143,000 in September and 128,000 in October. The Australian Customs Service continues to maintain a standard of 90 per cent of imports being cleared within four hours of lodgment of documents. That is a vast improvement on the two- to four-day period for clearance of imports which took place before the introduction of new Customs systems.

The importance of this stability in the superpower relationship rests mainly on the strategic significance of submarine operations in the area covered by North West Cape's transmissions. It is also of crucial importance to Royal Australian Navy submarine operations as it is able to provide communications wherever the Navy be operating in our region. The Government is not engaged in any negotiations with the United States in relation to the North West Cape agreement. The current arrangements relating to that communications station will continue.

As I stated in my initial response to Senator Puplick, I share Mrs Kelly's view that the conduct of these officers was totally unacceptable.

       </para>
       <para>
        The main purpose of this Bill is to set in place the next four years of the Government's historic eight-year general recurrent funding scheme, by providing guaranteed real increases in general recurrent funding for both government and non-government schools for the 1989 to 1992 funding period.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also appropriates funds for 1989 for the specific purpose and capital programs at the same real level as in 1988. The ethnic schools program continues to receive funding at the same money level as in 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        As announced in the May statement, from 1989 there will be changes to some elements of the Government's planning and funding policy for new non-government schools designed to ensure the best use of available resources and a co-ordinated approach to planning. The new minimum enrolment requirements have already been determined under the former Act and will continue under this Bill. For established schools not covered by sections 6c (1) or 7c (1) of the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act 1984, the minimum enrolment requirement will be one for each level of education provided by the school. In addition, new non-systemic schools will be funded at categories 1 to 6 only and establishment grants will be discontinued from 1989. Schools currently receiving establishment grants, however, will continue to receive them under the previous arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also implements the Government's decision that requests for a review of recurrent funding category will be considered only on the ground that there has been a significant change in the need for financial assistance resulting from factors outside the school's control.
       </para>
       <para>
        There has been a significant simplification to the language and structure of the schools legislation. The former Act has proved to be unnecessarily complex and has made difficult the efficient administration of the Commonwealth's programs for schools.
       </para>
       <para>
        One effect of this has been the removal of the detailed financial conditions which have appeared in the legislation to date. The Bill now requires States and non-government school authorities to enter into an agreement with the Commonwealth before payments can be made. These agreements will include the normal accountability requirements that were previously included in the Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the previous Act, resource agreements with State governments and with non-government school system authorities have only applied to the real increases in general recurrent grants provided since 1985. This Bill will provide the flexibility to enable agreements from 1989 to apply to the total general recurrent grant each year and to reflect more closely the educational objectives of the Commonwealth, the States and non-government school authorities.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some concern has been expressed about the nature of the objectives to be included in agreements and possible penalties for failure to meet those objectives.
       </para>
       <para>
        School authorities can be assured that the form and content of the agreements will be fully negotiated. For government schools, the Minister has already had detailed consultations with State Education Ministers. Broad national goals for schooling are being identified and these will serve as a basis for cooperation and collaboration and will assist in the further development of specific objectives and strategies by each government school system. Agreements with the States will reflect this process.
       </para>
       <para>
        There have also been detailed consultations with non-government school authorities on the form and content of agreements. These agreements will reflect the above-mentioned broad national goals for schooling. They will, however, recognise that non-government schools have their own objectives and priorities. Schools and systems will be asked to provide a statement of their objectives and priorities and the strategies they will be adopting to address those objectives. There will be no question of schools being penalised for failing to achieve their objectives.
       </para>
       <para>
        The explicit process of identifying objectives and articulating strategies will lead to better education for Australia's children.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill also recognises that schools and systems are being faced with real increases in their operating costs arising from the implementation of the 3 per cent productivity superannuation agreement and provides appropriate supplementation to grants to assist in meeting these costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The financial impact of this Bill will be to appropriate an estimated $1,913m for 1989 programs, $1,533m for general recurrent grants in 1990, $1,574m for general recurrent grants in 1991 and $1,611m for general recurrent grants in 1992.

       </para>
       <para>
        The primary purpose of this Bill is to adjust 1988 grants to government and non-government schools in the States and Northern Territory, in line with the Government's policy or providing retrospective cost supplementation for the Commonwealth's programs for schools to meet price increases that have occurred during the year. Included in this adjustment for price increases is an amount of $5.6 million which will be allocated to those non-government schools and systems which have had an increase in their operating costs in 1988 arising from implementation of the 3% productivity superannuation agreement.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also implements the decision announced in the May Statement that proposed new non-government schools no longer need to be able to demonstrate that they have reasonable prospects of financial viability prior to receiving approval.

        STATES GRANTS (TECHNICAL AND FURTHER EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) BILL 1988
       </para>
       <para>
        The States Grants (Technical and Further Education Assistance) Bill 1988 gives effect to the Government's budget decisions on Commonwealth assistance for TAFE in 1989 as announced in TAFE 1989 Commonwealth Programs and Priorities which was released on 24 August 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        The purpose of the Bill is to provide the legislative basis for the distribution of Commonwealth funds for technical and further education in the States and the Northern Territory for 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill provides $313.152m for technical and further education for 1989. The allocation of these resources reaffirms the Government's commitment to the directions set out in Skills for Australia in 1988 and reflects the new agenda for technical and further education and the Government's continued commitment to establish a framework for the future development of TAFE.
       </para>
       <para>
        Against the background of the macro-economic reforms already in place, and the increasing focus on structural adjustment policies, the Government's broad objectives for technical and further education are to achieve:
       </para>
       <para>
        further increases in participation in vocational education and training;
       </para>
       <para>
        improvements in the relevance of TAFE provision;
       </para>
       <para>
        productivity improvements and efficiency gains in the use of existing resources;
       </para>
       <para>
        greater industry involvement in TAFE; and
       </para>
       <para>
        an enhancement of the labour market prospects of the unemployed and other disadvantaged groups.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1988 the Government moved from a system of earmarked grants for TAFE to the provision of a general recurrent grant subject to resource agreements with the States. The Commonwealth maintained a substantial infrastructure program, providing around 65 per cent of the total Australian investment in TAFE buildings. The negotiation of resource agreements provides as mechanism for an integrated approach to Commonwealth and State priorities for TAFE, a new flexibility in the use of Commonwealth funding and a new emphasis on performance and outcomes. In 1989 the Government will continue to place a strong emphasis on the national development of TAFE, through both the General Recurrent Program and the Infrastructure Program.
       </para>
       <para>
        Expanding participation in vocational education and training is fundamental to the Government's plans for economic growth and social justice. While TAFE's role as a significant provider of further training, designed to facilitate the development and maintenance of a highly skilled and efficient labour force will continue, emphasis in 1989 TAFE funding will be given to expanding opportunities for Australians to undertake entry-level education and training in pre-vocational, trade, certificate and para-professional courses.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government will continue to emphasise also the importance of strengthening relationships between industry and TAFE in relation to curricula, staff development, delivery arrangements, equipment and use of facilities. The Joint Venture Equipment initiative introduced in 1988 will be enhanced in 1989 as a means of providing an increased incentive for industry to contribute to the purchase of equipment for TAFE and generally promoting links with industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite significant developments during the past five years, the access of disadvantaged groups and women especially sole parents, to education and training remains a problem. In 1989 the Government will, consistent with its other Budget measures, begin an attack on two of the major barriers to the participation in TAFE of Aborigines and women with children, particularly sole parents. During the next three years the Government will commit $10m from the Infrastructure Program for the construction of facilities directed towards enhancing the participation of Aboriginals in TAFE. The provision of child care has been identified as one of the barriers to the participation of women in TAFE. Accordingly the Government will commit $6m from the Infrastructure Program during the next three years to expand the provision of child care facilities for TAFE students.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government will provide for 1989 an Infrastructure Program of $186.065m. Within this program the Government will give consideration to projects that meet its priorities for economic and social development, in particular those that:
       </para>
       <para>
        generate additional capacity in areas of strategic economic importance;
       </para>
       <para>
        are directed towards the training of Aboriginals or provide additional child care facilities; and
       </para>
       <para>
        enhance the capacity of TAFE to respond to the training needs of young Australians, including trainees under the Australian Traineeship System.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth will continue to provide a level of recurrent funding for TAFE that meets about 9% of the total recurrent expenditure. The Bill provides for a General Recurrent Program of $120.434m. This includes funds to maintain those courses provided by the New South Wales and Queensland TAFE authorities that were previously funded under higher education arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        Special grants for advanced English language courses for migrants will be maintained in real terms at the 1988 level to enable TAFE to continue the provision of courses which migrants will need to develop the more advanced English necessary for occupational purposes or for further study. Grants for adult literacy and for non-government adult education are also maintained in real terms.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also provides for the subsidies payment provided to non-government business colleges; it gives effect to the phasing out of the scheme as detailed in TAFE 1989 Commonwealth Programs and Priorities and also provides an additional $1.5 million to assist colleges in the first half of 1989 to adjust their financial bases following the withdrawal of the subsidies and meet commitments already made to students in respect of 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. I commend the Bill to the Senate.

        HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING BILL 1988
       </para>
       <para>
        In the 1988-89 Budget context the Government released A New Commitment to Higher Education in Australia, which marked the culmination of an intensive twelve-month process of discussion and review of the future of higher education in Australia. The Statement addressed this Government's plans for substantial growth in higher education over the next three years, the associated resource requirements of the higher education system, measures to improve equity of access to higher education, and the means by which the total resources required for growth can be provided.
       </para>
       <para>
        The expansion and funding strategy, the cornerstone of the Government's Higher Education package, is one of the most significant in the history of Australia's higher education system, ensuring that the system will have been substantially expanded over the 1989-91 Triennium. The Higher Education Funding Bill 1988 gives effect to the decisions announced in the Budget statement, with adjustments to take account of the Government's policies on cost supplementation.
       </para>
       <para>
        To support its growth plans, the Government will significantly increase in real terms the funds available to higher education institutions over the next triennium. Funds will be increased over 1988 grants by $141 million in 1989, $275 million in 1990 and $427 million in 1991. This represents a total real increase in resources over the next three years of $843 million.
       </para>
       <para>
        The main thrust of the Higher Education Package is the creation of more higher education opportunities, particularly for young Australians. Taking into account pipeline effects of funded increases, an additional 49,000 places will be created by 1991.
       </para>
       <para>
        Special recurrent funds have been earmarked to promote access and equity. The Higher Education Equity Projects Program, first introduced in 1985 and currently expending $1.2 million each year, will be boosted by a further $2 million in each year of the new triennium. $1 million will be used to provide seeding grants to assist institutions to incorporate proven pilot initiatives into their programs. A further $1 million will be used to provide additional child care places for higher education students.
       </para>
       <para>
        Provision has also been made to earmark 200 of the annual intake increases over the triennium for Aborigines under the Aboriginal Participation Initiative, bringing to around 3,000 the total number of higher education places for aboriginal students by 1991.
       </para>
       <para>
        The growth in higher education planned by the Government will need a substantial increase in capital facilities. As a result there will be a significant injection of capital funds during 1989-91.
       </para>
       <para>
        Capital funds will rise from $78.5 million this year to $126.7 million in 1989, $145.4 million in 1990 and $177.2 million in 1991. Included in the 1989 grant is a special injection of $19 million for the urgent renovation of higher education buildings.
       </para>
       <para>
        Institutions will also be assisted by the introduction of rolling triennial funding, enabling them to undertake long term planning with confidence. The introduction of a single operating grant to replace the existing general recurrent, equipment, minor works and special research grants will enhance institutions' flexibility in the use of their recurrent funds.
       </para>
       <para>
        To help finance the substantial expansion in the funding of higher education that was announced in the 1988-89 Budget, the Bill makes provision for the establishment of the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS).
       </para>
       <para>
        HECS will apply to study in award courses undertaken in higher education institutions from 1 January 1989. People who benefit from participation in higher education will be required to make a small contribution towards the cost of their study. The scheme will replace the existing Higher Education Administration Charge (HEAC) which required a payment by students on enrolment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The key features of HECS are:
       </para>
       <para>
        an annual course charge of $1,800 per year of equivalent full-time study for study in award courses;
       </para>
       <para>
        pro rata charges according to the actual proportion of an equivalent full-time load being undertaken;
       </para>
       <para>
        payment arrangements based upon personal capacity to pay; and
       </para>
       <para>
        a choice between lump-sum payment with a 15 per cent discount at the time of enrolment each semester or payment through the taxation system once a person's taxable income reaches $22,000 (i.e., around the level of average earnings in the Australian workforce).
       </para>
       <para>
        If people choose to pay through the taxation system, the required annual repayments of HECS liability, once the Scheme is fully operational, will be:
       </para>
       <para>
        nothing for personal taxable incomes below $22,000;
       </para>
       <para>
        1 per cent of personal taxable income for incomes of $22,000 to $24,999;
       </para>
       <para>
        2 per cent of personal taxable income for incomes of $25,000 to $34,999;
       </para>
       <para>
        3 per cent of personal taxable income for incomes of $35,000 or more; and
       </para>
       <para>
        no further payment once debts are discharged.
       </para>
       <para>
        These repayment rates will be halved for the current financial year in view of the introduction of the Scheme on 1 January 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        The annual course charge, the outstanding debt and the personal taxable income levels above which payment is required will be indexed to keep pace with inflation. These arrangements will ensure that those paying the charge will pay the same amount in real terms, regardless of how long they take to do so.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Scheme will cover all higher education students (both new and continuing) and study undertaken from 1 January 1989, except for:
       </para>
       <para>
        students enrolled in fee-paying postgraduate courses;
       </para>
       <para>
        students in non-award courses;
       </para>
       <para>
        students in recognised bridging and supplementary courses;
       </para>
       <para>
        overseas students who are fully sponsored under a foreign aid program, who are subject to full fees or who are otherwise subject to the Overseas Students Charge arrangements;
       </para>
       <para>
        students enrolled in basic nurse education courses will be exempt until 1993, when the Commonwealth takes over full responsibility for funding these courses (unless State and Territory governments ask the Commonwealth to collect the contribution on their behalf before 1993);
       </para>
       <para>
        students undertaking industrial experience as part of a course will not be liable for that proportion of their course spent in industry;
       </para>
       <para>
        students receiving a postgraduate scholarship exempting them from liability; and
       </para>
       <para>
        students enrolled at Marcus Oldham College of Farm Management and students enrolled in courses at Avondale College, McAuley College or Signadou College of Education that are not funded by the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para>
        Adult and continuing education students and TAFE students, including those studying higher education courses provided wholly by TAFE institutions, are not covered by the Scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        With those exceptions, the Scheme will apply to all students enrolled in higher education institutions from 1 January 1989. There is no liability for studies undertaken prior to 1 January 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        To encourage participation in postgraduate courses, especially those relevant to the national research effort, a system of postgraduate scholarships will be introduced providing exemption from liability under HECS for a given year of study. To be directed particularly at full-time higher degree students, these scholarships will be allocated by institutions in accordance with Government guidelines. Institutions have already been advised of their allocation of scholarships for 1989. A special allocation of postgraduate awards will be incorporated under this arrangement to assist in the professional development of teachers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government will establish a Higher Education Trust Fund to receive all HECS funds collected by the Australian Taxation Office. These funds will help finance the expansion of the higher education system.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Trust Fund will operate as follows. The Commonwealth, under its `benefits to students' power, will make direct payments from the Trust Fund to higher education institutions each semester to fully discharge students' outstanding course charge liabilities for that semester. These payments will amount to about 20 per cent of total operating grants to institutions. The Trust Fund will be financed in part from HECS payments made by students through the taxation system, and in part from a reallocation of general operating grants for higher education which would otherwise be paid to institutions via the States. The remaining 80 per cent of total funding will continue to be paid via the States in line with current arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        All students who are liable under the Scheme will be offered a choice of payment arrangements each semester. They may choose to pay their liabilities in a lump sum directly to the institution, in which case a discount of up to 15 per cent will apply. Alternatively, they may ask the Commonwealth to pay their contribution to the institution and agree to repay the Commonwealth through the taxation system. Students who thereby incur higher education debts to the Commonwealth will also be required to notify the institution of their current tax file number or where they do not have one, make written application for a tax file number.
       </para>
       <para>
        The provisions of this legislation relating to the use of tax file numbers for purposes of the Scheme are based upon, and are generally consistent with, the corresponding provisions in the government's general Tax File Number legislation currently before Parliament. Normal taxation secrecy provisions will protect the privacy of a student's taxation information, including the tax file number. In addition, the provisions of the Government's Privacy Bill relating to the use of the tax file number generally will apply equally to the use of the tax file number for purposes of this Scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Higher Education Contribution Scheme is an essential part of the Government's plans for expansion and development of the higher education system. In financial terms it will raise more than one-third of the additional funding for the 1989-91 triennium allocated to higher education in the Budget. The size of this contribution will grow in future years. Just as important, the Scheme will increase the fairness of funding arrangements for higher education, ensuring that the total burden of funding does not fall entirely on the taxpayer.
       </para>
       <para>
        For these reasons the Government believes that the introduction of the scheme must be a pre-condition for implementation of the other aspects of its higher education package. It has framed its legislation accordingly. In the event of significant amendments or outright rejection of those provisions of the Bill giving effect to HECS, the Government will have no alternative but to curtail its plans to expand higher education. Without HECS, the higher education administration charge will be retained and indexed, and the funding of higher education institutions for the next three years will be held at a level consistent with the maintenance of 1988 funding levels in real terms together with pipeline effects for funded intakes prior to 1989. The unfortunate consequence would be that many Australians would then be denied the opportunity to participate in higher education.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Budget announcements on higher education were followed by a series of consultations between officers of the Department of Employment, Education and Training, individual higher education institutions and State authorities. This process, which enabled the Commonwealth to identify priorities for the allocation of resources according to State and regional needs, and the agreed educational profile of each institution, continued during September and October. Advice on these matters has also been sought from the Higher Education Council of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the Government's policy statement on higher education made clear, Commonwealth support will be directed mainly towards those institutions which form part of the unified national system of higher education. The letter of invitation to all higher education institutions requested a response by 30 September, but the Commonwealth agreed to accept a response by 30 October in line with the publicly expressed wishes of some institutions for more time for consideration. Decisions on final membership of the unified national system will be made during November.
       </para>
       <para>
        Because of the timetable for consultative processes and membership of the unified national system, the Government was faced with severe time constraints in the drafting of funding legislation for the 1989-91 triennium. As a result, while this Bill incorporates system-wide funding levels, it has not been possible to include details of the allocation of grants to individual institutions. The Government proposes instead to table before both Houses of Parliament this session a report which will give details of the majority of institutional grants for each year of the 1989-91 triennium. The Government will then table determinations in early December which will give legislative effect to its decisions on institutional grants.
       </para>
       <para>
        HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1988
       </para>
       <para>
        The second reading speech introducing the Higher Education Funding Bill 1988 outlined the Government's proposals for funding of higher education during the 1989-91 triennium. It also made clear the Government's intention that successful introduction of the new higher education contribution scheme should be a pre-condition for the program of expansion and development which was announced in the 1988-89 Budget.
       </para>
       <para>
        Consistent with this intention, the Higher Education Funding Bill itself makes no provision for the appropriation of funds to finance the growth initiatives covered by Chapter 3 of the Bill. Subject to successful passage of that Bill, however, this Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill is designed to amend the provisions of sections 115-119 of the principal Act to allow for the payments authorised under chapter 3 to be made out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund or the Loan Fund, as appropriate.

        OVERSEAS STUDENTS CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 1988
       </para>
       <para>
        The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the Overseas Students Charge Act 1979 to fix the overseas students charge rates for the 1989 academic year. The levels of the charge are indicated in the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        Charges for higher education courses will remain at the current percentage rate of the full average cost of a place to the Commonwealth. Charges for TAFE courses will remain at the current percentage of the Commonwealth contribution to a TAFE place. The actual increases in the charges reflect the increase in cost to the Commonwealth. The increase in the secondary charge reflects the movement in the consumer price index.
       </para>
       <para>
        A further purpose of this Bill is to extend charge liability to an overseas student who is enrolled as a casual higher education student undertaking miscellaneous studies not for award. This is expected to raise $3.6m in 1988-89.
       </para>
       <para>
        The overseas students charge raised $56.7m in 1987-88 (higher education administration charge not included) and is expected to raise $70.3m in 1988-89.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also makes some changes to terminology to be consistent with that of the Employment, Education and Training Act 1988.

        The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Overseas Students Charge Collection Act to extend charge exemption to a tertiary student who enters Australia under an approved reciprocal organisation exchange. This will bring exemption provisions for tertiary exchange students into line with current provisions for secondary students and is estimated to cost around $200,000 in 1988-89.
       </para>

        The creation of the Australian Sports Commission in 1985 is now history and it is pleasing to reflect on some of its achievements. Since it commenced operations the Commission has addressed a variety of issues of importance to developing sporting opportunities for all Australians at the community level. A fine example of this has been the development of a major children-in-sport program-Aussie Sports, which although launched as recently as April 1986 has now been implemented in over 1,700 primary schools and reached over 500,000 children.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commission has been actively involved in the drugs in sport campaign, and has established a national program on drugs in sport which has seen the implementation of a program of drug testing during training and at sporting events, and the production and distribution of information kits warning against the use of drugs in sport throughout Australia and to over 40 countries overseas. Perhaps one of its most noteworthy achievements, however, has been the establishment of an Australian Sports Aid Foundation as a public company to raise money from the corporate sector and the community at large to supplement Government funding for the development of Australian sport. In order to maximise such support tax deductibility on donations to the Foundation was approved in June 1986. The result of this initiative has been very encouraging with over $2.3m being donated to the Foundation, and paid out through the Commission, for distribution in support of our national sporting organisations and specific sporting events, such as the defence of the America's Cup, during 1986-87.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition to these activities, the Commission has continued to administer the Government's major programs of sports assistance: the sports development program and the sports talent encouragement plan. In 1987-88 the sports development program provided almost $6.3m to 94 national sporting organisations and other bodies to assist with, amongst other things, administration, junior sports development programs, coaching development, travel to international sporting competition, and the drugs in sport program. The sports talent encouragement plan provides direct financial support to individual athletes and teams to help defray costs and loss of earnings associated with training and participation in sporting competitions. This year in excess of $600,000 will be made available to about 300 athletes, the majority of whom are members of the Australian Olympic team.
       </para>
       <para>
        Following on from this last point, I would like to turn to our elite athletes and the Australian Institute of Sport. When this Government was elected, the Australian Institute of Sport was still in its infancy. There were only 183 scholarship holders in eight residential sports in 1983. Its training and competition facilities had not been completed, it was not fully staffed, and it was still in the process of developing its various coaching and training programs. As the Institute has become increasingly settled, it has been possible to build on the initial base established by the previous Government. A further seven sports have been accepted since 1984. Many of the new sports have been decentralised, and as such the Institute has been able to establish a significant presence in Brisbane with diving and squash, Perth with hockey, and Adelaide with cycling and cricket. The cooperation and assistance of State and local governments and State institutes of sport has been invaluable in this process. Smaller satellite units have also been set up in Melbourne and Sydney. These developments have given the Institute a truly national profile.
       </para>
       <para>
        With its world class facilities and a highly qualified and professional administrative and coaching staff, the Institute has worked effectively towards realising its major aim of improved athlete performance. And while the international success of any individual athlete or team can be said to result from a variety of factors, the Institute has played an important role in the improved sporting performances of many Australian athletes and teams over recent years. Together the Institute and the Commission have contributed greatly to the development of Australian sport in recent years. The objectives of the two organisations are complementary and are derived from the broader Government objectives of encouraging increased participation in sport by all Australians, promoting equity of opportunity at the community level, and providing opportunities and support for the development of our elite athletes.

         —I actually said `equity of opportunity'. We are always about fairness. Beyond the financial support, the facilities, the technical expertise and the leadership they have offered, they have provided for a balanced involvement by government in sport. All Australians, be they high performance athletes, coaches, members of national, State or local sporting bodies, or individuals who have the opportunity to participate in community sports programs or utilise local sports facilities, have benefited from the existence of both organisations.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        With the support of the Commission the sporting community has begun to recognise and take on the responsibility for the further development of sport in Australia. To qualify for continued assistance under the sports development program, for instance, national sporting organisations have had to adopt a more professional administrative approach, and to plan for the individual future development of their respective sports.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have come a long way since March 1983. The sporting community has a greater appreciation of the fact that it cannot rely on government to shoulder all the responsibility associated with sports development. Similarly, the Australian Institute of Sport and the Australian Sports Commission have made great advances in their relatively brief histories. They, too, have demonstrated a maturity in overseeing the development of Australian sport at all levels.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is now necessary to consolidate the achievements to date, and to reassess the Commonwealth's role in the development of sport at the national level. In doing so, this Government will ensure the further improvement of an environment favourable to the continued development of sport in Australia. At the same time it must use its resources as efficiently and effectively as possible. A merging of the functions and administrations of the Commission and the Institute and some of the sports program functions of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories to rationalise government involvement in sport will achieve this end.

        Government Announcement
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        On 25 September last year, the former Minister responsible for sport, the Hon. John Brown, announced the Government's intention to streamline the Commonwealth's sports administration through the establishment of a single national sport body-to be known as the Australian Sports Commission. The new Commission will assume responsibility for the functions of the Institute and the Commission as they are presently constituted. Since that announcement, as an interim arrangement pending passage of this legislation, the Institute and the Commission have, for all intents and purposes, been informally amalgamated. For instance, the sports talent encouragement plan, previously administered by the Commission, has been transferred to the control of the elite athlete side of the new organisation, while the sport for people with disabilities program and aspects of the cultural relations program concerning sporting exchanges have been transferred from the Department to the Commission. These rationalisations, in addition to producing staffing and servicing savings, will remove the overlap and uncertainty which previously existed in government sports administration at the national level.

        Major Features of the Bill
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill outlines the objectives of the new Australian Sports Commission, which are to provide leadership in the development of sport in Australia; to encourage increased participation by Australians in sport; to provide support for the development of high performance athletes; to improve the sporting abilities of Australians generally; to foster cooperation in sport between Australia and other countries; and to encourage the private sector to contribute to the funding of sport and so supplement assistance provided by government.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill defines the general functions of the Commission, which include program management, the coordination of our national sporting effort, and the requirement to consult widely with the sporting community. It also outlines the functions of the Commission which will be undertaken under the name of the Institute. The Bill also describes the powers that the Commission will have to undertake its activities. These powers are largely a composite of those described in the pieces of legislation that will be repealed with the enactment of this legislation. As an additional check, the Commission will be required to submit estimates in respect of its proposed budget, and to produce an annual report, an annual operational plan, and a strategic plan tied to the Olympic cycle every four years. Each of these must be approved by the responsible Minister. Its financial affairs will also be subject to scrutiny by the Auditor-General.

        Financial Impact Statement
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The strategic and annual operational plan requirements are in line with the Government's commitment to overall financial management improvement within the public sector. In its strategic plan the Commission will be required to develop objectives for its programs and activities, to define performance indicators, and to regularly evaluate performance against these indicators. Ministerial endorsement of the plan will be required. Already, as a result of the interim arrangements, the rationalisation of program administration between the Institute, the Commission and the Department has achieved a saving of five staff years. Relocation of all staff at the Bruce facilities has also generated significant accommodation savings.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, under this legislation, membership of the Commission will not exceed 12. This compares favourably with the membership arrangements this legislation will supersede, which allowed for up to 22 commissioners to be appointed to the Australian Sports Commission, and up to 14 members to be appointed to the Australian Institute of Sport Board of Management. The fewer board appointments will produce savings in terms of total remuneration paid to members, reduced meeting costs, and a reduced requirement for secretariat and other support services. Overall non-staff savings are expected to be in the order of $250,000 per annum.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the legislation, the Commission will continue to receive funds from the private sector donated to the Australian Sports Aid Foundation-which, incidentally, will in future be known as the Australian Sports Foundation-in order to supplement public funding made available for sports development.

        Priorities

       <para>
        I mentioned earlier that since the interim arrangements came into effect in October last year, the amalgamated organisation has continued to operate existing programs and services. It has also continued to grapple with a number of contentious and challenging issues. Foremost among these, perhaps, is related to the need for the sporting community to explain to the Australian community and its political representatives the value of sport to the community and, therefore, why it is necessary to provide continuing financial support. This becomes a particular concern given the pressures in the corporate and business sectors that, of late, have seen a reduction in the level of private funding being channelled into sport.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commission, therefore, will work to achieve and sustain the valuable outcomes that can be derived from sport, such as more children playing sport, assistance to coaching to improve the overall standard of sporting performance throughout Australia, the continued fight against drugs in sport, and so on. This, in turn, will mean identifying the resources available, both government and private, and ensuring that they are directed in ways that will maximise their impact and benefit.
       </para>
       <para>
        But increased funding is not the only requirement of sport, if it is to continue to grow. We also need a sound administrative infrastructure, particularly at the national level. We need efficient and effective management to ensure that what we spend has the most beneficial impact for Australian society as a whole. We need a unified approach to sports administration if we are to undertake the increasingly complex task that is sports development in the late 1980s.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, the Government is confident that the proposed Australian Sports Commission is a new and improved organisation that will consolidate the considerable gains made by sport over the life of this Government and allow for the continued and organised development of Australian sport into the 1990s and beyond. I commend this Bill to the Senate.

        SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT BILL 1988
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, this is the first of four Bills to amend the sales tax law to give effect to the Treasurer's Budget announcement that significant changes would be made to the sales tax treatment of computer software. At present under the sales tax law, a computer program is subject to sales tax where it is embodied in a storage medium and is imported into, or sold in, Australia. Sales tax is payable whether the program was developed for a single user or for a number of users.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill and the three other Bills that I will be introducing shortly will change the law in two main respects. Firstly, recognising that a large part of the price of customised software can be for software-related services and that identifying the service component of the price can be difficult, programs developed for a single user are, in certain circumstances, to be freed from tax. Secondly, to remove the distortions and avoidance opportunities created by applying sales tax only to computer programs delivered in goods, multiple user programs that are delivered electronically are to be brought into the sales tax base. Both these changes will come into effect from 3 November 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        To be exempt from sales tax, a single user program must only contain material developed by the programmer for the sole use of the single user as part of the program or, if it contains other material, that other material must not account for more than 20 per cent of the value of the program. Where the 20 per cent test is not met, sales tax will be payable on the value of the other material.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill will also extend sales tax to computer programs transferred within Australia otherwise than when embodied in goods, that is, when transferred by electronic means. Transfers made free of charge, however, will not be affected. A further change to be made by the Bill will ensure that sales tax applies to parts of computer programs as well as to complete programs.
       </para>
       <para>
        With the availability of the exemption for single user programs, it is inappropriate for registered taxpayers to continue to be able to quote their sales tax certificate number to buy, free of tax, those goods that are for use exclusively, or primarily and principally, as an aid to embodying tax-exempt single user programs in goods. Consequently, changes to the sales tax regulations to limit the `aids to manufacture' exemption will be submitted to the executive council as soon as practicable.
       </para>
       <para>
        These changes will also apply to goods to be used exclusively, or primarily and principally, as an aid to transferring tax-exempt single user programs that are not embodied in goods. The changes will apply to goods bought as `aids to manufacture' after 3 November 1988. Some consequential changes to the sales tax regulations in relation to the quotation of sales tax certificates will be needed. Refunds will be made available to overcome any double taxation that may occur before the regulations can be amended.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, the Bill contains two amendments to complement the extension of sales tax, by the Sales Tax Assessment Bill (No. 12) 1988, to computer programs transferred electronically into Australia from outside Australia. The first of these will ensure that any exemption from sales tax available for computer programs that are transferred electronically within Australia are also available for programs transferred electronically from outside Australia. The second will require the recipients of programs transferred from outside Australia to lodge sales tax returns. I commend the Bill to the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        SALES TAX ASSESSMENT BILL (No. 12) 1988
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, this Bill complements one of the main measures in the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill 1988, about which I have just spoken.
       </para>
       <para>
        By that Bill, computer programs transferred within Australia otherwise than when embodies in goods are to become subject to sales tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill will ensure that sales tax is also payable on computer programs transferred, otherwise than when embodied in goods, from outside Australia to a person in Australia who is not registered for sales tax purposes. The buyer of such a program must lodge a sales tax return and pay the tax within 21 days after the end of the month in which the program was transferred.
       </para>
       <para>
        The new assessment Act proposed by this Bill will contain machinery provisions for the collection and recovery of tax similar to those in existing sales tax assessment Acts.

        I commend the Bill to the Senate.

        SALES TAX BILL (No. 12) 1988

       <para>
        Mr President, it is a requirement of the Constitution that a law imposing taxation deal only with one subject of taxation.
       </para>
       <para>
        In accordance with that requirement, this Bill will formally impose sales tax payable under the proposed Sales Tax Assessment Act (No. 12) 1988 on computer programs that are transferred electronically from outside Australia to a person in Australia who is not registered for sales tax purposes.
       </para>
       <para>
        The rates of sales tax are to be the same as those that currently apply to computer programs embodied in goods-generally, 20%.
       </para>
       <para>
        I commend the Bill to the Senate.

       <para>
        Mr President, as with Sales Tax Bill (No. 12) 1988, this Bill also is necessitated by the constitutional requirement that a law imposing taxation deal with one subject of taxation only.

        On 1 January 1988 the Federal Airports Corporation assumed responsibility for the operation of seventeen major airports throughout Australia. These included the primary and secondary airports in each of the State capital cities as well as Coolangatta and Launceston airports.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government announced in the Budget that it had decided that the FAC should assume responsibility for a further group of airports.
       </para>
       <para>
        The FAC is to take over the operation of the Alice Springs, Mount Isa and Mackay airports.
       </para>
       <para>
        It will also assume responsibility for the civil aviation facilities at Darwin, Canberra and Townsville airports.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Darwin, Canberra and Townsville airports are joint user airports which serve both defence and civil aviation purposes. The Federal Airports Corporation Act currently provides for the Corporation to operate airports which are declared as Federal airports for purposes of the legislation. The Act does not specifically provide for the Corporation to enter into arrangements for the shared operation of joint user airports.
       </para>
       <para>
        Moreover, the Act requires that Federal airports be on land which is owned by the Corporation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill before the House provides for the amendment of the Federal Airports Corporation Act in order to provide a framework within which the Government can determine arrangements for the operation, by the Corporation and the Department of Defence of the Darwin, Canberra and Townsville airports.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also provides a basis on which any future transfers to the Corporation of civil facilities on joint-user aerodromes may be undertaken.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Corporation will be able to enter into arrangements with the Commonwealth under which the Corporation would participate in the operation of jointly used areas and would be able to levy charges where it has financial involvement in these areas. This provision would have application in circumstances where the primary responsibility for areas such as runways and taxiways is not vested in the Corporation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill provides for the Minister to determine that ownership of the land on which a Federal airport is located need not be transferred to the Corporation. The Corporation could instead lease the area from the Commonwealth or enter into other arrangements for it to control that area.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government considers that the arrangements for the operation of joint user aerodromes for which this Bill provides will enable both the commercial operation of designated areas by the Corporation as well as providing the necessary safeguards to ensure that the integrity of defence operations is maintained.

        CUSTOMS AND EXCISE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1988
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill is an omnibus Bill proposing miscellaneous amendments to the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901.
       </para>
       <para>
        The main proposals contained in the Bill are to:
       </para>
       <para>
        (i) amend the manner in which the quantity of beer produced is measured for the purposes of assessing both Customs and excise duty (clauses 10 and 33);
       </para>
       <para>
        (ii) amend the controls pertaining to prohibited exports, so as to permit the Minister for Defence to suspend licences and permissions to export goods from Australia in circumstances where it is in Australia's national interest to suspend such licences or permissions (clause 8);
       </para>
       <para>
        (iii) extend the duty-free entry to the Australian mainland of goods from Christmas Island to those goods which were 50% produced on the Island (clause 11);
       </para>
       <para>
        (iv) amend offence provisions contained in section 228 and 234 of the Customs Act 1901 (clause 20 and 23); and
       </para>
       <para>
        (v) provide, as part of the Government's decision to impose for the first time excise duties on Government instrumentalities, that existing legislative provisions protecting those instrumentalities from excise duty are of no effect (paragraph 29 (b) and clause 30).
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, the Bill makes a number of other minor, technical amendments to the Customs Act 1901, the Excise Act 1901 and the Off-Shore Installations (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 1982. These amendments are set out in detail in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated.
       </para>
       <para>
        I shall now outline the major proposals in the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clauses 10 and 33 amend the manner in which beer is measured for the purposes of assessing duty.
       </para>
       <para>
        The dutiable content of bulk vessels containing beer is presently fixed by legislation. For example, the traditional ``kilderkin'' is a vessel with a capacity of between 76.5 and 82 litres, although the dutiable content is set at 79 litres irrespective of the vessel's actual contents.
       </para>
       <para>
        Technological improvements in the manner in which bulk vessels are manufactured and filled means that it is now possible to measure beer more accurately.
       </para>
       <para>
        As from 1 February 1989, it is proposed to assess duty on bulk containers, that is, vessels in excess of 2 litres capacity, according to the quantity of beer nominated by the manufacturer as being in the bulk container, providing that the actual contents do not exceed 101.5% of the nominated quantity of the beer.
       </para>
       <para>
        As from 1 July 1991, the 1.5% overfill tolerance just discussed will be reduced to 1%.
       </para>
       <para>
        For beer in bottles and cans up to 2 litres capacity that are entered for home consumption as from 1 February 1989, duty will be based on the labelled contents of the container providing the actual contents do not exceed 101.5% of the labelled contents of the container.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn now to clause 8 of the Bill which allows for the Minister for Defence to suspend previously granted licences or permissions to export goods from Australia in circumstances where it is in Australia's national interest to do so.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government announced in June this year that the existing export controls on defence related goods would be revised so as to reduce constraints on exports where that could be done without prejudice to Australia's national interests and international obligations.
       </para>
       <para>
        The existing controls require case-by-case ministerial permission for defence exports regardless of lethality or military significance. Case-by-case ministerial permission is also currently required for the export of non-military but potentially lethal goods like sporting firearms or commercial explosives.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government proposes introducing a system of licences for recognised exporters of potentially lethal, non-military goods. This system, whilst enabling the Government to stop exports of such goods in particular circumstances, will eliminate the current requirement for case-by-case approval of all such exports. When circumstances require, authorised exporters will be notified that export of these goods to particular destinations will require ministerial approval on a case-by-case basis. Case-by-case ministerial approval will still be required by non-authorised exporters of such goods.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although the Government wishes to remove impediments to this trade, it recognises that from time to time circumstances may arise which make it contrary to Australia's national interest to continue exports to particular destinations. This proposed amendment to the Customs Act makes it clear that the Government may impose these controls should the circumstances arise.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clause 11 provides for an extension of duty free entry to the Australian mainland of goods imported from the external territory of Christmas Island.
       </para>
       <para>
        Currently, provision is made for the duty free entry into Australia of goods from the territory where those goods are the produce or manufacture of the territory, unless similar goods produced or manufactured in Australia are subject to excise duties. To meet the existing requirements of the Customs Act 1901 that deem goods to be the ``produce or manufacture'' of Christmas Island, those goods must either be wholly manufactured in the territory or partly manufactured, where the last process of their manufacture was performed on Christmas Island and not less than 75% of their factory or works cost is represented by the value of labour and/or material of Christmas Island or Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, as part of the Government's strategy to foster the development of new manufacturing industries on Christmas Island, in the face of an uncertain future for the phosphate mining industry, it is proposed from 1 January 1989 to reduce the local Australian content requirement under the Customs Act from 75% to 50%. This is the same preferential treatment currently applying to forum island countries and Papua New Guinea.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is hoped that this measure will encourage small industries that will generate local employment and income. The Government considers this measure to be highly desirable in view of the small size of the population, its remoteness from the Australian mainland and its historical dependence on one industry, namely phosphate mining. This measure is consistent with the Government's policy on Christmas Island, namely, to widen and diversify the Island's economic base and improve its financial and management arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clause 20 amends the offence contained in section 228 of the Customs Act 1901.
       </para>
       <para>
        This section currently provides for the forfeiture to the Crown of ships or boats not exceeding 250 tonnes registered tonnage where that ship or boat has been used in smuggling, or knowingly used in unlawful importations or exportations, or is found to be altered so as to allow for the concealment of goods; or where the master of the ship has refused permission for customs to search the ship, or cannot account for cargo deficiencies.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has decided that references to ``registered tonnage'' should be replaced with references to the ``overall length'' of a ship, because the maritime term ``registered tonnage'' is ambiguous, having a number of possible meanings. It is now proposed to move to a basis of the ``overall length'' of the vessel by adopting the definition of the term contained in section 10 of the Shipping Registration Act 1981.
       </para>
       <para>
        The length of 80 metres has been chosen as the appropriate qualifying measure as it is considered that the master of a ship or boat should be able to exercise sufficient control over a ship or boat not exceeding 80 metres in overall length to warrant forfeiture if one of the circumstances set out in section 228 is established.
       </para>
       <para>
        The owners of ships over 250 tons registered tonnage which have been engaged in the practices described above are currently subject to a penalty not exceeding $10,000. This penalty has remained the same for many years, and it is light compared with the replacement cost to an owner of a vessel under 80 metres overall length which is forfeited to the Crown. The Bill will increase the penalty for vessels over 80 metres overall length, and engaged in the activities I have mentioned, to $100,000.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, clauses 29 and 30 of the Bill particularly implement a government decision to impose excise liability on government business enterprises (GBE'S), by removing any statutory exemptions from paying excise duty as from 1 July 1989. This complements amendments to the excise tariff proposed in the Excise Tariff Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1988, recently introduced into the Parliament, which contains the substantive provision giving effect to this decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        Most Commonwealth enterprises, particularly those in direct competition with the private sector, are subject to the full range of Commonwealth, State and local government taxes and charges. Consistent with the move to place Commonwealth business enterprises on a more commercial footing, the Government has decided that all GBES should be exposed to the same charges as private businesses.
       </para>
       <para>
        Accordingly, as was announced in the Treasurer's May 25 1988 economic statement, excise duty will be payable by all GBES, the only exemptions being those authorities that have express exemptions to pay excise duty inserted in their establishing legislation as from 1 July 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        Financial Impact Statement
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The change in the manner in which beer is measured for the purposes of assessing duty is not intended to net the Government any more revenue. If necessary, duty rates on beer may be adjusted for an overall, industry-wide revenue neutral result.
       </para>
       <para>
        The revenue impact of extending duty free concessions to Christmas Island is difficult to assess, as much depends on the level of exports coming from the Island. However, it is anticipated that the extension of the concession will only lead to a minimal loss of government revenues.
       </para>
       <para>
        The remaining amendments to the Acts have no direct financial impact.
       </para>
       <para>
        I commend the Bill to the Senate, and present the accompanying explanatory memorandum.
       </para>
       <para>
        CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1988
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1988, which is now before the Senate, contains in its seven schedules a wide variety of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. I will now briefly outline those amendments.
       </para>
       <para>
        Schedule one to the Bill, operative on and from 1 January 1988, contains amendments necessary to enact tariff changes made by customs tariff proposals in August of this year. These amendments relate to:
       </para>
       <para>
        walnuts;
       </para>
       <para>
        large machines imported in separate component form; and
       </para>
       <para>
        deerskin leather garments of New Zealand origin.
       </para>
       <para>
        Also contained in this schedule are:
       </para>
       <para>
        an amendment to restore the rate of duty applying to polyphenylene oxide. This overcomes an anomaly that has emerged following the introduction of the Government's decision on the chemicals and plastics industries; and
       </para>
       <para>
        an amendment to additional note 1 to Chapter 72 to raise the minimum copper content specification of high alloy steel. This note was prepared some years ago and has been overtaken by changes in the steelmaking industry. The steel industry authority has confirmed that changes in technology have made the restrictions imposed by this note irrelevant to current assistance requirements.
       </para>
       <para>
        Schedule two to the Bill, operative on and from 22 June 1988, restores a rate of duty of 15 per cent to certain paper cutting machines and parts thereof.
       </para>
       <para>
        These amendments were previously included in the Customs Tariff Amendment Act 1988 retrospective to the 1 January 1988. The amendments legally establish the date of operation as 22 June 1988. Complementary amendments are also contained in schedule one to the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        Schedule three to the Bill, operative on and from 1 July 1988, also contains a variety of amendments.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first amendment is necessary to enact a tariff change made by Customs Tariff proposals in August of this year. The amendment relates to aviation turbine fuel.
       </para>
       <para>
        Also included in this schedule are:
       </para>
       <para>
        amendments, consequent on the May economic Statement, to provide for the phasing rates of duty and remove the revenue duty applying to certain tariff classifications. A complementary amendment has also been made to Part III of schedule 4 to the principal Act to remove redundant item 42c as a result of the removal of the revenue duty;
       </para>
       <para>
        the imposition of protective rates of duty on certain raw and refined sugar, consequent on the removal of the import embargo on 1 July 1989, which will phase in accordance with the Government's decision announced in the May economic statement;
       </para>
       <para>
        amendments to a number of items of schedule 4 to the principal Act, which:
       </para>
       <para>
        rename the Australian industry participation Program to the Australian industry involvement program;
       </para>
       <para>
        take account of the new Employment, Education and Training Act 1988; and
       </para>
       <para>
        make it clear that item 22 covers goods for use in natural gas exploration as well as for petroleum exploration;
       </para>
       <para>
        the remaining amendments of this schedule implement certain wording changes to align the principal Act with the international convention on the harmonized commodity description and coding system.
       </para>
       <para>
        Schedules four and five, operative on and from 6 July 1988 and 24 August 1988 respectively, enact tariff changes made by tariff proposals in August of this year, relating to:
       </para>
       <para>
        fibre glass insect screening; and
       </para>
       <para>
        beer, which was part of the Government's budgetary measures.
       </para>
       <para>
        Schedule six to the Bill, operative on and from 1 January 1989, includes amendments relating to the Government's decision on the chemicals and plastics industries. These exclude certain metallic stearates and vinyl wallpaper from duty phasing arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        also included are other amendments which:
       </para>
       <para>
        accelerate the phasing-out of New Zealand rates for passenger motor vehicles-complementary amendments have also been made in schedule three relating to components for passenger motor vehicles;
       </para>
       <para>
        adjust certain forum islands and developing country rates to accord with the forum islands and revised developing country preference schemes introduced on 1 July 1986. These rates were not carried through to the harmonized tariff; and
       </para>
       <para>
        remove redundant item 41d from Part III of schedule 4 to the Principal Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        Schedule seven, operative on and from 1 March 1989, contains a series of amendments made in the context of the post-1988 assistance arrangements for the textiles, clothing and footwear industries (TCF).
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendments include changes to TCF tariff and tariff quota arrangements. They reflect recent Government decisions on the TCF plan, the May economic statement changes to the plan, the outcome of a review by the TCF Development Authority on velvet duty rates, new ANZCERTA arrangements, and handicraft textiles and clothing and handmade footwear.
       </para>
       <para>
        In June 1987 the Government announced the new assistance arrangements for the TCF industries post-1988 TCF plan. The plan commences, in the main, from 1 March 1989 and is aimed at encouraging the restructuring of these industries through a combination of gradual reductions in protection and the provision of special positive adjustment measures. The first of the tariff changes were introduced in legislation in 1987. The proposed legislative changes relate to tariff quota arrangements which will apply from March 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        The main changes to the post-1988 TCF plan announced in the May economic statement on the twenty-fifth day of May 1988 were:
       </para>
       <para>
        a reduction in tariffs of five percentage points for apparel and footwear and for most higher tariff rates for fabrics and footwear parts. Because of this reduction a duty surcharge equal to five percentage points will also be introduced where quota is issued on a past import performance basis and base quota duty rates are being reduced. This surcharge will help maintain the relativities between the base quota and out-of-quota imports which existed prior to these decisions;
       </para>
       <para>
        the end of the TCF plan on the thirtieth of June 1995, resulting in quota arrangements being abolished eight months earlier than originally announced.
       </para>
       <para>
        As part of its decision on the TCF plan announced in June 1987, the Government decided that there would be a rationalisation and simplification of textile fabric duty rates. This decision included the duty on imported velvet fabrics being rationalised on the first of January 1988 to twenty-five per cent. A number of representations were received on this aspect of the decision. After analysis and investigation of the concerns by the TCF Development Authority, the Government decided to reduce the duty to twenty per cent in 1989 and fifteen per cent in 1990, and to determine future rates in the mid-term review of the plan.
       </para>
       <para>
        Also included in this schedule are liberalisation arrangements to accelerate the achievement of full free trade in goods by 1 July 1990. These arrangements were recently decided upon by the Australian and New Zealand governments.
       </para>
       <para>
        New entry arrangements for handicraft textiles and clothing and handmade footwear will also be introduced.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, included are amendments to remove certain tariff classifications from the ambit of the TCF policy. This action now allows the duties applicable to these tariff classifications to be phased in accordance with the rates alterations reductions.
       </para>
       <para>
        Financial Impact
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The restoration of the ten per cent duty rate for polyphenylene oxide will result in a small decrease in revenue. However, this will be offset in part by the Government's decision to remove the phasing rates currently applying to certain metallic stearates.
       </para>
       <para>
        The change in regard to the copper content of high alloy steel will result in a decrease in revenue not exceeding $1.4 million as a result of claims for refund of duties.
       </para>
       <para>
        Revenue implications flowing from the tariff reductions announced in the Government's May economic statement are difficult to isolate accurately. However, it is anticipated that the reductions covered by this initiative, tariffs which are already phasing, the changes to the passenger motor vehicle plan and the abolition of the two per cent revenue duty will result in revenue decreases of $460m in 1988-89 increasing to $900m in 1992-93.
       </para>
       <para>
        The TCF sector currently provides the Government with revenue from the duties levied on imports and from the partial sale by tender of tariff quota.

        It is difficult to estimate with any certainty the future budgetary implications of changes in assistance for the TCF sector because of variables such as:
       </para>
       <para>
        the phasing out of tariff quotas resulting in a decrease in revenue because of lower tariff rates. However, this will be offset by an increase in revenue resulting from an increase in the volume of imports;
       </para>
       <para>
        liberalisation of trade with New Zealand;
       </para>
       <para>
        replacing quota issued on a past import performance with quota sold by tender;
       </para>
       <para>
        relative competitiveness of Australian production;

       <para>
        changes in consumer demand and consumer preferences; and
       </para>
       <para>
        significance of developing countries as import sources.
       </para>
       <para>
        Notwithstanding these complexities, it is expected that the total revenue collected from the implementation of the post-1988 TCF arrangements (including those arising out of the May economic statement and the closer economic relations changes) should increase by over $200 million over the period of the plan. The increase is likely to come largely from the sale of tariff quota by tender. There is expected to be minimal financial impact caused by the other amendments in the Bill.

         —I bring before the Senate a Bill to amend a number of areas affecting human services within the community services and health portfolio. This Bill seeks changes under the first home owners scheme to better ensure that assistance is properly targeted at those in need and is not used, for example, for investment purposes. It also tightens eligibility to Medicare entitlements to exclude a range of people such as visa overstayers, illegal immigrants and the like. This is in recognition that Medicare is primarily a health insurance system for Australian residents. As well, from 1 January 1989, Medicare benefits will not be available for overseas medical treatment. Unfortunately, many people have previously travelled overseas without comprehensive travel insurance on the incorrect assumption that Medicare would cover any hospital and medical costs they incurred. This change removes any such confusion. Instead the Government will concentrate on extending its network of reciprocal health care agreements.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Bill will overcome a recent problem which has arisen in Victoria where some private health insurance funds have threatened to cease payment of hospital benefits for certain long stay nursing home-type patients. These patients have been paying contributions to their health funds for many years and have a right to expect that when they are admitted to hospital their health fund will contribute towards their hospital charges. This change reinforces the Government's belief that the funds have both a moral and a legal obligation to continue the long established practice of payment of benefits for nursing home-type patients.
       </para>
       <para>
        The legislation also establishes the framework for the new Medicare hospital funding arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories. These arrangements not only guarantee eligibility of all Australians to free public hospital treatment, but also will help improve access and throughput for Medicare patients. In addition, the Bill honours Government commitments to provide for a limited number of exempt nursing home beds, and to increase availability and access to respite care services in nursing homes and hostels as part of its aged care reforms, and imposes lodgment and processing fees for appeals against nursing home fees determinations.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill, firstly, seeks to amend the First Home Owners Act 1983. The proposed amendments to that Act authorise the recovery of assistance paid on the basis of an applicant's intention to reside in a dwelling, but where that intention was not realised. The amendments will provide that where a person has not resided in a dwelling and no longer intends to reside in that dwelling, the Secretary shall direct that the person be deemed not to be a prescribed person for the purposes of the Act. The amendments further provide that once such a direction is made, the assistance which has been paid becomes recoverable. The amendments will enhance the Secretary's ability to prevent assistance being paid in relation to homes which are not owner-occupied.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, in cases where only one of two or more owners ever occupies the dwelling, the moneys paid under the first application may be recovered or offset against the remaining entitlement. This leaves the party who never occupied the dwelling free to reapply in relation to another dwelling. This aspect will be of assistance to couples who separate prior to one party occupying the dwelling. There are no financial implications arising from these amendments.
       </para>
       <para>
        A further amendment involves the definition of an eligible person in relation to Medicare entitlements. For some time now the Government has been reviewing the key elements of Medicare eligibility. The major focus of the review centred upon the principal eligibility issue-that is, who should have access to the Australian health care system. Since its inception in February 1984, Medicare eligibility has been conferred on all Australian residents. An Australian resident is generally defined in the Health Insurance Act 1973 as a person who resides in Australia, including a person domiciled in Australia, but not including diplomatic-consular staff, or their families.
       </para>
       <para>
        The effect of the existing definition is that in addition to conferring eligibility on bona fide Australian residents-that is, persons who have a legal entitlement to reside in Australia-it also unintentionally permits access to a range of categories of other people on whom Medicare eligibility should not be conferred; for example, visa overstayers, illegal immigrants and the like. The new definition limits Medicare access to persons who have a legal entitlement to remain in Australia permanently. The change of eligibility for Medicare benefits made by this amendment is consistent with the changes of the eligibility for social security benefits and veterans' entitlements that were made by the Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Act 1987.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition to the principal definition, there remains in the Act a discretionary power available to the Minister for Community Services and Health to confer Medicare eligibility upon individuals or classes of persons in exceptional or unusual circumstances. Consistent with that discretionary power and with other measures being taken administratively, and the repeal of section 21 of the Act relating to the payment of benefits for overseas treatment, it is the Government's intention from the date of effect of this amendment that non-residents of Australia, whether they be Australian citizens residing abroad or long term visitors from overseas, shall henceforth be excluded from Medicare eligibility. Only people who actually reside in Australia legally should have access to Medicare. This proposed amendment is not expected to achieve immediate savings. Moderate savings in Medicare benefits are, however, expected in the future. The Bill also repeals section 21 of the Health Insurance Act 1973.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since the inception of Medicare in 1984, Australian residents have been able to claim Medicare benefits in respect of the cost of medical services incurred overseas. Where there is an equivalent item in the Medicare benefits schedule, such medical services have attracted benefits at the Australian schedule fee rate. No financial assistance is available in respect of hospital costs incurred overseas. The average Medicare benefit paid in respect of medical services rendered overseas represents approximately 40 per cent of the actual cost of the service provided. Australian travellers are thus required to pay about 60 per cent of the cost of the medical services, and if hospitalised they are responsible for 100 per cent of these costs. In some countries, the Medicare benefit is only a small proportion of the costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has decided to discontinue the payment of Medicare benefits for medical treatment received overseas, which in practice is often very little more than a token payment against very high costs, and to extend the network of reciprocal health care agreements (RHCA) with other countries. Such agreements provide Australian residents with access to both medical and hospital treatment on the same basis as residents of the host country. Reciprocal agreements are therefore a more appropriate and effective means of providing health care cover for Australian travellers abroad. Australia is currently party to agreements with the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Malta and Italy. Agreements with Sweden and Portugal are close to being finalised and I expect them to be operational in the near future. Negotiations are also under way with several other European countries.
       </para>
       <para>
        Health costs overseas are often high, particularly in the United States of America, where hospital charges in excess of $2,000 a day are not unusual. Thus, a 10- to 15-day stay in hospital can result in a devastating outlay of $20,000 to $30,000 for the patient. It is the responsibility of the individual to purchase appropriate travel insurance cover, just as it is to make arrangements covering all other aspects of overseas travel. The former availability of Medicare benefits provided what was at times quite a false impression in the minds of travellers that they were adequately protected against such costs. Henceforth, from 1 January 1989, medical benefits will not be available for overseas medical treatment, and the Government will focus its efforts on further developing reciprocal arrangements with countries which have health systems which are compatible with, and comparable to, Medicare. This amendment is expected to save approximately $5m a year in Medicare benefits from 1 January 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        A further purpose of the Bill is to establish the framework for the new Medicare hospital funding arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories. Of course, the cornerstone of the Federal Government's contribution to the improvement of Australia's health care delivery system has been the introduction of Medicare, our universal health insurance scheme which is now nationally and internationally recognised for its social and economic successes. Not surprisingly, Medicare's social and economic advantages to Australia are reflected in the level of community support for the health insurance system.
       </para>
       <para>
        One area in which substantial future enhancement is now being undertaken is the Medicare public hospital funding arrangements, under which the Commonwealth is entering into new five-year agreements with the States and Territories from 1988-89 to 1992-93. The proposed amendments to the heads of agreement under schedule 2 of the Health Insurance Act allow definition of the purpose for which funding is provided--

The Government is confident that this major increase in the hospital Medicare grant, with its much improved growth index, combined with the additional incentive package and measures to ensure equality of access to public hospitals for both public and private patients, will ensure a significant improvement in State public hospital services.

        The Bill also gives effect to a decision made in the context of the 1988-89 Budget, when the Government announced that it had decided to introduce lodgment and processing charges for the review of nursing home fee determinations under the National Health Act. Section 40ae of the National Health Act permits nursing home proprietors to request the Minister to review nursing home fee determinations. The legislation requires the request in the first instance to be investigated by a nursing homes fees review committee of inquiry. These committees are established in each State to assist the Minister's investigations by providing a detailed professional and independent review of fee determinations, where proprietors are unable to reach agreement with the Minister's delegate on the level at which fees are set. The process of review is a thorough one involving the gathering and analysis of complex information. The length of time for each review varies but on average consumes almost 100 hours of Public Service time. In the past, the cost of a review, estimated at about $4,000, has been met entirely by taxpayers. (Quorum formed)

         —I do the best I can, Senator Hill, under difficult circumstances. Paragraph jumping may be a new sport which we will introduce to the Olympics very shortly. I do not think I will win the gold medal. There is a statutory obligation on the Minister to consider these requests for review. However, to address the current extraordinary volume of appeals will involve the diversion of significant departmental resources from implementing other necessary Government reforms in aged care, some of which have been requested by industry associations, to handle many non-genuine appeals.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There is no way of distinguishing between protest or vexatious appeals and those which are genuine. It is in the interests of the taxpayer and nursing home proprietors with genuine grievances, to free up the nursing home fees review mechanisms by ensuring that only those cases which are genuine become the subject of review and that those appeals are expenditiously handled. There is a further need to prevent the situation from worsening by avoiding future protest or vexatious appeals against fee determinations. The Government considers the introduction of a lodgment fee of $500 and an additional processing fee of $500 for each half-day a committee meets to consider an appeal, will achieve those objectives. Administration of these arrangements-for which provision is made in clause 29-will be facilitated by fees being deducted from payments due to a nursing home under part 5a of the National Health Act on authorisation by the proprietor. To safeguard the position of genuine appellants both lodgment and processing fees will be refunded in full where a request for review is wholly or substantially successful. Provision is also made for the lodgment fee to be refunded in full to a proprietor who withdraws a request within 84 days following a decision by the Secretary.
       </para>
       <para>
        As indicated previously, the Government is committed to the provision of respite care services as part of its strategy of responding positively to the needs of the aged and to the needs of the often forgotten husbands, wives, relatives and friends who care or assist in the caring for aged persons in their own homes. Respite care is essential to assist aged persons to live for as long as possible in the community. The Government's program of reform in aged care seeks to increase the availability and accessibility of respite care services in nursing homes and hostels. The long term objective is to provide two respite care places per thousand persons in both hostels and nursing homes with an additional 4,000 places available by 1995. Clause 42 of this Bill allows regulations, which are subject to disallowance by the Parliament, to be made which allow the formulation and implementation of a scheme for providing respite care in nursing homes. The scheme being developed, and which is to be defined in the regulations, is expected to be implemented in the second half of the 1988-89 financial year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Honourable senators also will be aware that the Government has introduced a major reform program in aged residential care to overcome serious criticisms of the nursing home program which have been made by representatives of the industry, aged people, unions, Commonwealth parliamentary committees and other representative bodies. The reform program has been phased in to ensure that the process of adjustment is smooth and avoids disruption of the care of the 110,000 frail aged residents and the employment of the thousands of people providing that care.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reforms to the nursing home funding arrangements introduced on 1 July 1987 and 1 July 1988 will result in non-government nursing homes for the aged being phased to a standard fee and standard benefit arrangement by July 1991. The standard fees and benefits will embody funding for uniform nursing and personal care staffing levels linked to service needs of residents and a standard aggregated module for infrastructure costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        Currently, approximately 26 per cent of residents across Australia are required to contribute more than the minimum statutory contribution towards the fees set by the Commonwealth. The minimum statutory contribution is equivalent to 87.5 per cent of the sum of the maximum single rate pension and rental assistance. Under the arrangements introduced on 1 July 1988 these additional contributions will be gradually eliminated so that by July 1991 no resident will be required to contribute more than the minimum statutory contribution.
       </para>
       <para>
        Previously, in introducing the amendments to the National Health Act to enable the implementation of the reforms to the nursing home funding arrangements from 1 July 1988, including the phasing out of the excess amounts over the minimum statutory contribution, the Government advised that the only exception would be in relation to residents of exempt homes. It was also foreshadowed that, in these sittings, legislation would be introduced to enable the exempt nursing homes arrangement to be implemented.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also amends the National Health Act 1953 to enable the introduction of an exempt nursing homes arrangement, under which a number of non-government nursing homes for the aged will be permitted to charge their residents fees which are higher than the maximum that would otherwise apply. The amount of Commonwealth daily benefit payable under this arrangement will be reduced by a minimum of 50c in the dollar for each dollar by which the fee charged exceeds the fee otherwise payable. The exempt nursing homes arrangement will provide scope for a small proportion of residents, who so desire, voluntarily to buy a higher level of accommodation and services than that provided by non-exempt homes. It is proposed that only a small proportion of nursing homes in each State-comprising initially up to 6 per cent of beds-be granted exempt status.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clause 24 of the Bill inserts a new provision in the National Health Act empowering the Minister to grant exempt status to a nursing home for a specific period following consideration of a proprietor's application for such status.

        The Bill further provides in clause 27 that the proprietor of an exempt nursing home may vary the additional fee only once in ever 12 months and that the redetermined fee requires the Commonwealth's approval. Under clause 28 the rights of existing residents of a nursing home which is granted exempt status are protected. Existing residents will be given a period of six months within which to decide whether they wish to participate as exempt residents and consequently be subject to the additional fee.

Clause 33 of the Bill empowers the Minister to revoke a home's exempt status if it violates the conditions attached to that status. It is estimated that when the system has been fully implemented, savings in Commonwealth benefits of $10m a year will accrue. I commend the Bill to the Senate.

         —The Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill 1988 gives effect to the Government's decision to sell the assets of the Defence Service Homes Corporation to Westpac Banking Corporation and to put in place arrangements for the delivery of Commonwealth-subsidised housing loans by that bank. This major change in the way benefits under the Defence Service Homes Act 1918 are delivered is of the greatest importance to the Australian veteran community and to present and former members of the Defence Force. In this context, representatives of the veteran and service communities have been involved over the last two years in looking at ways of improving both the benefits available under the defence service homes scheme and their delivery to the client group. There has been close consultation with these groups during development of the revised arrangements.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The arrangements with Westpac involve the sale of the interest of the Defence Service Homes Corporation in its portfolio of about 134,000 mortgaged and terms contracts for an amount equal to the face value of those assets. At 31 October 1988 the face value was approximately $1.39 billion including accrued interest. In addition, Westpac will pay a premium of $100m to participate in the defence service homes scheme. Under the new arrangements, Westpac will take over responsibility for all future lending under the scheme; this will include delivery of certain ancillary benefits such as instalment relief and special loans for windows in hardship.
       </para>
       <para>
        For several years the Government has been unable for budgetary reasons to make necessary changes to the defence service homes scheme including: removal of the 10-month waiting period for loans to buy homes, now costing borrowers several thousand dollars in bridging finance interest charges; and an increase in the maximum first mortgage loan from the present level of $25,000, set in 1980, to a more reasonable proportion of the cost of acquiring a home.
       </para>
       <para>
        There will be no waiting period for Westpac loans which will be repayable over a period of up to 25 years and will be portable from one home to another. Home buyers will be able to borrow in excess of $25,000 as a first mortgage with the Commonwealth subsidising the repayments on the first $25,000 of any loan; borrowers will also save by not having to meet two sets of loan establishment charges or pay second mortgage interest rates on the amount borrowed in excess of $25,000.
       </para>
       <para>
        The revised arrangements will remove the need for a statutory corporation and the Defence Service Homes Corporation will cease to exist once the handover to Westpac is complete. The future administration of the defence service homes scheme will be undertaken within my portfolio. It is estimated that under the revised arrangements there will be resource savings of up to 360 staff and $11.5m per year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The revised defence service homes scheme will involve the assessment and determination of the entitlement of eligible persons for benefits under the scheme; and the payment of subsidy in relation to both the assets sold to Westpac and those new loans made by Westpac. The subsidy will be an amount paid to the bank, not the client, on a monthly basis, reflecting the difference between the interest paid by clients on their loans-6.85 per cent on new loans and various rates below that rate on mortgages sold to the bank-and an agreed rate of return to the bank. It is estimated that the subsidy cost in a full year will be $145m. The revised arrangements agreed with the bank do not involve any change to the status of people who are already eligible under the Defence Service Homes Act. Any of these people who have not previously sought assistance under the scheme will be able to apply for the new benefits. The Bill will give effect to the Government's decision that persons who enlisted in the Defence Force after 14 May 1985 will not become eligible for benefits under the scheme. The form of housing benefit to be provided for these persons is being considered.
       </para>
       <para>
        The defence service homes insurance scheme is not included in the business sold to Westpac-this business will continue as a self-funded cooperative home insurance scheme, being operated by the Commonwealth and administered within my portfolio. Other benefits under the scheme will continue to apply and be delivered by the Commonwealth or the bank as set out in the agreement which is attached as schedule 1 to the Bill. When announcing the proposed changes to the scheme the Government promised that eligible persons and borrowers would not be disadvantaged under the new arrangements. The agreement with Westpac and this Bill provide for a considerable improvement in the range and quality of benefits available under the scheme. I commend the Bill to the Senate.

       </para>
       <para>
        SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1988
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill contains amendments to the Social Security Act 1947 and minor consequential amendments to other Acts. The amendments are to implement decisions announced in the 1988 May Statement and the 1988/89 Budget Speech, and to introduce certain other minor amendments.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendments to the Social Security Act include further, major steps in implementation of policy changes flowing from the Social Security Review established in 1985. These steps, relating to payments for children, sole parent programmes and the long term unemployed are further tangible evidence of the Government's commitment to a fairer distribution of income in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was the Hawke Labor Government which placed the abolition of the need for child poverty on the political agenda of this country-no other political grouping was pressing it as a priority. This Government deliberately chose not simply to make the attack on child poverty a priority-we invited the Australian people to judge us on our performance in delivering on that priority.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill contains a range of further measures in the progressive implementation of the centrepiece of our attack on child poverty-the Families Package. That Package draws on the work of the Social Security Review in its first issues paper: ``Assistance to Families with Children''.
       </para>
       <para>
        Rates of Family Allowance Supplement and child payments to pensioners and beneficiaries will rise in December 1988. For each child younger than 13, families will receive $24 a week, an increase of $2. For each child aged 13 to 15, a payment of $31 a week will be made, up by $3. 600,000 families with 1,200,000 children will be better off as a result.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill will implement the first steps to achieving an integrated child payment. Family Allowance, Child Disability Allowance, Double Orphan's Pension and Family Allowance Supplement (including Rent Assistance) are to be integrated to achieve the one fortnightly payment for children. Next year we will take the further step of integrating the additional benefit paid for children with this fortnightly payment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The integration of Family Allowance, Child Disability Allowance, Double Orphan's Pension and Family Allowance Supplement (FAS) will avoid the possibility of FAS becoming a marginal welfare payment-as occurred with the old Family Income Supplement.
       </para>
       <para>
        There will be the one payment, payable in respect of 80% of Australian children, the rate of which will vary depending on factors such as:
       </para>
       <para>
        the number of children in the family;
       </para>
       <para>
        the income of the parents;
       </para>
       <para>
        the special difficulties faced by families caring for children with disabilities, or those whose natural parents are not able to care for them; and
       </para>
       <para>
        the costs faced by families who have young children from a multiple birth.
       </para>
       <para>
        The basis for income testing of FAS will be changed. Currently the income test, which operates on income received in the previous four weeks, encourages perceptions of the payment as a welfare measure. It is difficult to administer and creates anomalies for many low paid workers whose income fluctuates.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill will implement an income test based on the taxable income of the claimant and her or his spouse. This change will substantially simplify understanding of the payment and enable simpler administration. The change highlights the importance of FAS in our tax transfer system-making FAS, in every sense, as good as a tax cut for low income families.
       </para>
       <para>
        The move to taxable income as the basis of income testing from 29 December 1988 effectively indexes the income test threshold for FAS. Payments in 1989 will generally be based on taxable income for the year ending 30 June 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        As from 1 January 1990, the threshold for this income test is to be indexed in line with the CPI increase in the previous financial year. This will ensure that income increases that match price increases will not erode child payments or contribute to work disincentives and poverty traps. 179,000 families including 430,000 children will benefit from this constructive measure.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill contains three measures to ensure that child payments are directed to those families in most need by improving targeting and reducing the scope for abuse of the system.
       </para>
       <para>
        First, an assets test is to be introduced in establishing entitlement to Family Allowance Supplement. Like the income test, the assets test will take CPI increases into account. From the last payday in 1988 FAS will not be payable to a person when the value of the assets of the person and her or his spouse exceeds $300,000. Property excluded from the pensions assets test (such as the family home) will also be excluded from the FAS assets test.
       </para>
       <para>
        Second, Family Allowance Supplement will not be payable in respect of any child who has unearned taxable income in excess of the tax free threshold which is currently $416 p.a. This will prevent parents from qualifying for FAS by divesting themselves of income in favour of their children and ensure proper targeting of the payment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Third, payment of additional benefit and Mother's/Guardian's Allowance to an unemployment or sickness beneficiary who is contributing to the maintenance of a child who is not in his or her care will cease. It is both more efficient and more equitable that such payments be made directly to the custodian through the pensions, benefits or child allowance systems.
       </para>
       <para>
        In its third issues paper. ``Bringing Up Children Alone'', the Social Security Review highlighted the difficulties faced by sole parent families-difficulties of unfair and inaccurate stigmatisation, of inadequate income and labour market barriers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has addressed these problems in a systematic way. We have introduced the Child Support Scheme and will proceed, next year, with Stage 2 of that scheme. The Families Package has delivered major increases in payments for sole parents.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the Budget the Government announced the introduction of the JET scheme-Jobs, Education and Training for Sole Parents. JET will provide comprehensive advice, assistance, labour market training, education and child care. The JET scheme is designed on the basis that sole parents usually receive pensions for relatively short periods-until they find work or repartner. It will be targeted to those sole parents most at risk of long term dependence on pension or benefit; teenagers, those whose youngest child has just commenced school and those whose youngest child is 14 or over.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill contains changes to complement the introduction of JET. The Supporting Parent's Benefit and Widow's Pension Class A will be replaced by a uniform Sole Parent's Pension. This change rids the social security system of categories of benefit based on moral judgments of the worth of individuals and provides a pension which acknowledges the present need for support of sole parents, regardless of the cause of the sole parenthood. The Sole Parent's Pension will be available to all those to whom Widow's Pension Class A or Supporting Parent's Benefit would have been available.
       </para>
       <para>
        The new pension will also extend support to a small number of people who had previously been ineligible for benefit because of the requirement for them to have legal custody (such as some grandmothers). However, this extension will be limited to those who have cared for a particular child for twelve months or more-in order to ensure that the availability of Sole Parent's Pension does not distort established patterns of foster care or otherwise unduly encourage single people to take on the care of children for whom they have no formal responsibility.
       </para>
       <para>
        In Issues paper No. 4, ``Income Support for the Unemployed in Australia-Towards a More Active System'', the Social Security Review dealt with the unemployed. Flowing from that paper, in the Budget the Government announced the implementation of New-Start, a comprehensive programe to assist unemployment beneficiaries who have been receiving benefit for 12 months or more.
       </para>
       <para>
        New-Start will consist of a number of policy and legislative elements which together recognise the need to overcome the self-perpetuating situation of joblessness, poverty and dependence often encountered by people who remain out of work for long periods. Their job skills become eroded or irrelevant, employers are increasingly reluctant to take them on, their self-confidence and motivation evaporate and they become enmeshed in a cycle of financial hardship and dependence on social security payments.
       </para>
       <para>
        New-Start introduces through this Bill an Employment Entry Payment of $100 which will be payable to people in this category when they return to full time employment. It is to help them meet the short term costs of moving into and retaining full time work, such as clothing and transport costs and union membership, and is payable only once within a 12 month period.
       </para>
       <para>
        This group of people will also benefit from a waiver of the waiting period which currently applies should they need to claim unemployment benefit again within 3 months of the cancellation of their last benefit. This reduces the disincentive of moving from benefit to short term full time work or work of uncertain duration.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unemployment beneficiaries will also be able to undertake a wider range of activities which promote employability while still retaining eligibility for benefit. By allowing them to participate up to certain limits and with CES approval in full time training courses or voluntary work, the barrier to people attempting to improve and maintain their job skills will be reduced.
       </para>
       <para>
        New-Start is an imaginative strategy for improving the prospects for the long term unemployed to reintegrate into the workforce. It will deliver real opportunities to a group of people who have been excluded from the benefits of the massive job growth we have seen in Australia over the last five years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Job Search Allowance is paid to unemployed young people aged 16 and 17 subject to an income test on both their own and their parents' income. This Bill increases the threshold for that parental income test by $950 to $16,950 a year and introduces indexation of the threshold in line with increases in average weekly earnings. This action prevents the undermining of the entitlement through routine income increases while still maintaining the intention of the income test. Children in authorised foster care will be exempted altogether from the application of the parental income test on Job Search Allowance entitlement.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Young Homeless Allowance which is payable to young unemployed Job Search Allowance recipients is to be increased in this Bill by $27.85 a week so that the two allowances combined will be the same rate as that paid under AUSTUDY to 16 and 17 year old students who are independent and living away from home.
       </para>
       <para>
        Certain student children who attract the payment of defined allowances will be deemed to be covered by the Family Allowance provisions in 1988 so as to retain Family Allowance Supplement entitlement.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill introduces a measure to provide special support to newly released prisoners on their reintegration into society. To meet the special adjustment problems of newly released prisoners, especially urgent housing, food, clothing and transport costs and the like, a double payment of Benefit will be made in respect of their first week after claiming. Compassionate considerations aside, it is simply not in society's interest to have released prisoners reoffending because of lack of immediate support. In conjunction with this measure the Government is consulting the states to achieve effective co-ordination between prisons and the Department of Social Security to ensure released prisoners obtain the income support they need when they need it.
       </para>
       <para>
        An important segment of the Bill in terms of the Government's high priority for protecting the rights of the individual in the social security process is the one dealing with the gathering and disclosure of information.
       </para>
       <para>
        This segment introduces a clearer statement of how the Department of Social Security's information gathering and disclosing powers are to operate. The measure is in response to a perception by some in the community that the current powers can trespass upon the privacy of individuals, especially those who are no longer clients of the department. The powers to compulsorily obtain information will be limited by provisions of the Bill. These limitations will be additional to those already contained in the legislation. Further, the powers conferred by the Social Security Act in this respect will be exercised in accordance with the Principles of the Privacy Bill.

        The Bill will end the sexist distinction currently embodied in the Class C category of Widow's Pension. That pension will be replaced in March 1989 with a Widowed Person's Allowance. This will remove anomalies in the coverage of income support to people without dependent children who have been recently widowed, including inconsistencies in the treatment of widowed males and females.
       </para>
       <para>
        The remainder of the Bill deals with administrative reforms and minor amendments which will improve the quality and consistency of service provided to social security clients.

        Refinements are to be made to the provisions governing the portability of Australian social security payments overseas. From May 1989, payment of Family Allowance will cease where the recipient has been overseas for 3 years or longer. From February 1989, pre-departure certificates will be required for all pensioners who leave Australia to enable continuation of payment of pension overseas after 6 months' absence. And recipients of the existing Supporting Parent's Benefit or Class A Widow's Pension, or the new Sole Parent's Pension (other than de jure widows), will have their overseas payments limited to 12 months from their departure from Australia if this was on or after 1 July 1988, or ceased on 1 July 1989 if they were already overseas as at 1 July 1988.

        The Bill removes anomalies in the provisions covering the payment of entitlements to people who are treated as unmarried and paid at the single rate because they are separated while still living under one roof, or where Child Disability Allowance is paid to only one of the people in respect of a child formerly dependent upon them both.

        In presenting this Bill I record the Government's appreciation to Professor Cass and those who have worked with her on the Social Security Review.
       </para>
       <para>
        The process of reform in social security is by no means complete. The Social Security Review has recently released a paper on disability issues which will form the basis of policy development for assistance to people with disabilities. Consultation on disability issues is indicating a fundamental shift in attitude about the range of activities that should be available for people with disabilities so they too can have a greater choice in their lives including greater access to employment and training opportunities.
       </para>
       <para>
        Soon to be released is a paper titled `Towards a National Retirement Incomes Policy' which will assess the overall adequacy, equity and incentive effects of the current system of retirement incomes. This paper will propose longer-term directions for reform and is due for release within a few weeks.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a result of the work of the Review, we can look forward to developing more flexible approaches to retirement, including opportunities for part-time work in addition to retirement income and long-term care and social support systems for the elderly which encourage them to remain within the community.
       </para>
       <para>
        The culmination of the immensely valuable work of the Social Security Review will be the Final Report due for release early next year. Professor Cass's final report will address future directions in social security policy including how to simplify the system as well as options for a payment structure which is more tailored to the specific needs of disadvantaged people according to their stage in the life cycle and their capacity to participate in economic activity.
       </para>
       <para>
        Further reform in the social security area will be dominated by the need to achieve a more active labour market orientation of income support programs, not just for those who we may expect to be in employment but also for sole parents, for some older people and people with disabilities. Taken together, these measures will provide a significant impetus ensuring that all Australians have an opportunity to participate in this country's economic and social life.
       </para>
       <para>
        The major achievement of this Government in the social security area has been to align social policy objectives more closely with economic policy objectives, to support the broader process of structural change, and to ensure that Australians have adequate opportunities to participate in economic and social activities by equipping them with the necessary skills and training and by providing opportunities to all Australians to participate in economic recovery.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill is a significant step in that process.

        SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1988
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill contains amendments to the Social Security Act 1947 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to implement several decisions announced in the 1988-89 Budget Speech, to make minor amendments to the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and to revise the social security reciprocal agreement with New Zealand.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill contains the most fundamental restructuring of the system of rent assistance since its introduction for pensioners.
       </para>
       <para>
        For the first time the rent assistance system will acknowledge the additional housing costs of families with children.
       </para>
       <para>
        For the first time that system will acknowledge the additional costs of larger families-families with three or more children.
       </para>
       <para>
        There will be parity in levels of rent assistance for pensioners and beneficiaries.
       </para>
       <para>
        Among low income individuals and families, those who rent in the private market are the least well off. As part of a far-reaching housing assistance package and in special recognition of the plight of families in the private rental market, the maximum rate of rent assistance for people with dependent children is to be increased by a special $5 child add-on. This increase will apply from June 1989 to families who qualify for family allowance supplement or additional pension or benefit payments for their children.
       </para>
       <para>
        Further rent assistance increases will be introduced in December 1989 and June 1990. In December 1989, beneficiaries without children will receive a $5 increase to bring their entitlement to the same $15 a week level that is payable to pensioners without children-providing parity of treatment for pensioners and beneficiaries.
       </para>
       <para>
        Then, in June 1990, the maximum basic rate of rent assistance payable to all recipients will rise by $5 a week and the child add-on component will be raised to $10 a week where there are three or more dependent children. People without children will then receive a total of $20 a week, those with one or two children will receive $25 a week and families with three or more children will be paid $30 a week.
       </para>
       <para>
        The rent assistance threshold will also rise in June 1989 from $15 to $20 a week. This threshold is the minimum amount of rent a person must pay before becoming eligible for rent assistance. The increase means that more assistance can be given to people in greatest need paying higher rents.
       </para>
       <para>
        From June 1989, rent assistance eligibility is to be modified to remove an anomaly whereby the payment is currently available to pensioners and beneficiaries in respect of the rented premises that they occupy, although they may also own a home which they do not occupy. Certain homeowner groups will remain eligible-people who move into nursing homes or other approved institutions, those who sell their homes and are likely to use the proceeds for re-purchase within 12 months and those who pay for the use of a site or mooring of a mobile home or vessel.
       </para>
       <para>
        The eligibility of people who acquire a right or interest in a principal home in a retirement village from today may also be affected by this rent assistance modification, depending on how much they pay for their right or interest. They will be ineligible for rent assistance if they pay an entry contribution of more than the difference between the assets test limits for property owners and non-property owners. This is an indexed amount currently standing at $64,000. An acquisition of this type and amount gives a person security of tenure broadly comparable to that of someone living in his or her own home. People paying $64,000 or less will still be eligible for rent assistance. This change removes the incentive for village promotors to deny security of tenure to residents even though they have made substantial investments.
       </para>
       <para>
        From June 1989, pensioners and beneficiaries who apply for rent assistance in respect of their board and lodging accommodation will have their assessable rent calculated on the basis of two-thirds of their board and lodging costs rather than the full amount. Existing board and lodging rent assistance recipients will be phased into the new arrangements-they will continue to receive the same amount of rent assistance they would have received before June 1989 had the new $20 threshold applied, until they either stop boarding and lodging or become eligible for payment at a higher rate under the new conditions.
       </para>
       <para>
        These wide ranging amendments will enable a redistribution of rent assistance support to the areas of greatest need.
       </para>
       <para>
        To complete the housing measures and in recognition of their special circumstances, ex-prisoner rent assistance claimants who have no children will have the 26 week waiting period during which they would normally have had to be receiving unemployment benefit reduced by the length of time they have spent in prison.
       </para>
       <para>
        A cornerstone of this country's social security system is a fair means test. An essential element of a means tested system is an income test with integrity. An environment in which some in the investment industry have developed and marketed products for the purpose of enabling avoidance of the income test requires constant monitoring.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government has given a clear undertaking that it would act to counter devices or schemes designed to circumvent the income test for pension and benefit eligibility. This Bill closes a significant loophole in the income assessment of certain investment products in the interests of a fair and equitable income test which does not favour one group of investors over another.
       </para>
       <para>
        Growth on market-linked investments, which is currently assessed on realisation or maturity will now be assessed on an ongoing basis.
       </para>
       <para>
        From 1 December 1988, pensioners and beneficiaries who, on or after 9 September 1988, invested or invest in institutionally managed market-linked investments which yield capital growth will have a rate of return calculated on their investments and counted as ongoing yearly income.
       </para>
       <para>
        There will be a statutory rate of return on all market-linked investments of 11% or such other lower rate not below zero % as is specified by the Minister from time to time. Any such specified rate lower than 11% is to be subject to disallowance by Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        In fairness to investors, the costs necessarily incurred by an investor in establishing and maintaining an investment will be taken into account-by deducting them from the amount determined by applying the rate of return to the amount of the investment.
       </para>
       <para>
        This change from a realisation basis to an accruals basis for the income test removes a significant disincentive for retired people to access their savings, helping to achieve a more rational retirement incomes system.
       </para>
       <para>
        Applying the flat, deemed rate of return is the only point at which the investment is subject to the income test-investors can be confident that the realisation of their investments will be irrelevant to the operation of the income test: there is to be no double counting of the return on an investment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact that the system is based on a flat, deemed rate of income provides a strong incentive for fund managers to improve their products' rate of return to attract investors in this category-any improved return over the specified rate will not affect the pension or benefit.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Secretary of the Department of Social Security will be able to decrease the deemed rate of return in respect of particular products either on his own volition or following a written application by the fund manager or a natural person who is an investor in the fund. If satisfied that the rate of return on the particular product is at a lower level than the specified rate, and if that lower level is clearly assessable, the Secretary will determine a new product rate of return for that product. The Secretary will not then, however, be obliged to determine a further variation within a period of 3 months.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fund manager of a particular fund or a pensioner or beneficiary who has invested in a particular fund will have a right of appeal to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal against the product rate of return deemed appropriate by the Secretary in respect of that product.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government recognises the need for certainty in the provisions determining eligibility for pensions and benefits. It also recognises that any system which has gaps in eligibility criteria enabling people to make investments the returns from which avoid the income test before they are cashed in or mature is unfair and, in the longer run, economically irresponsible.
       </para>
       <para>
        The procedures and rules to apply under this Bill have taken account of consultations with pensioner bodies and investment fund associations. The Government will keep in close contact with these groups once the new provisions are in operation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The procedures and rules should lead to a situation where pensioners, potential pensioners, fund managers and investment advisers will see clearly what the applicable rate of return is for each investment product. Variations in the rate will depend on the performance of the particular product.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill will make some amendments to the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. These amendments are necessary to correct minor errors which occurred in the drafting of the Act earlier this year and to ensure that the Act, when it comes fully into operation on 1 December, correctly reflects the intentions of Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill also revises the reciprocal social security agreement with New Zealand. Since 1973, Australia has paid its pensions into New Zealand under domestic law. However, as New Zealand does not pay its benefits into Australia, a financial imbalance developed in the agreement. This imbalance has been exacerbated by recent large increases in the number of people moving from New Zealand to Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Following negotiations earlier this year, the New Zealand Government agreed to reimburse Australia for pensions paid to former New Zealand beneficiaries. It will reimburse the cost of all Australian age, invalid, wife's and widow's pensions paid to people in Australia who leave New Zealand on or after 1 April 1989 and who were in receipt of New Zealand national superannuation, invalid's or widow's benefits when they left New Zealand.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reimbursement payment will be made annually in advance between 1 April and 30 June and is estimated at around $A8.8m cumulative per annum. This amount, less a small administrative expense, will represent a direct reduction in future Australian social security expenditure.

        OZONE PROTECTION BILL 1988
       </para>
       <para>
        The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the provisions of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer: Australia can then ratify the Protocol. Also, the legislation will put in place measures whereby the emissions to air of substances that deplete the shield of ozone gas in the upper atmosphere will be substantially reduced beyond the minimum requirements of the Protocol, thereby safeguarding to the maximum practicable extent human health and the environment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Protection of the ozone layer is one of the Government's highest environmental priorities. While the Montreal Protocol requires a fifty per cent reduction in the use of ozone depleting substances over ten years, the proposals contained in the Bill should enable Australia to achieve those reductions in half that time.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senators are undoubtedly aware that small amounts of ozone gas in the upper atmosphere shield living things on earth from the harmful ultraviolet radiation present in sunlight. Emissions to air of some synthetic chemicals-certain chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons are the main ones-can break down this ozone shield, with serious implications for human health and the environment. CFCs are also powerful greenhouse gases and would be worthy of control on this account even if there were no concern about ultraviolet radiation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Emissions of CFCs arise from their use in about 20 per cent of aerosol sprays, in refrigeration and air conditioning, in some plastic foams, in some dry cleaning machinery and as degreasing solvents in the electronics and other industries. Halons are used in specialised fire protection. Most industries, notably aerosol filling and foam packaging, are already converting to ozone-safe alternatives.
       </para>
       <para>
        The main body of scientific advice shows that there has been a global decrease in stratospheric ozone of between two and three per cent over the last nine years, approximately half of which is not attributable to natural causes.
       </para>
       <para>
        The seasonal decrease in stratospheric ozone over Antarctica is now well known. In 1987 the `ozone hole' was the worst ever-with around a 50 per cent reduction from normal levels of ozone. Although this year's rate of depletion is not nearly so strong, there is, nonetheless strong evidence that links the presence of CFCs to this phenomenon. The unique meteorology during winter and spring over Antarctica sets up an isolated air mass, the polar vortex, which is accompanied by very low temperatures. The low temperatures lead to the formation of stratospheric clouds which appear to greatly increase the potency of CFCs to destroy ozone.
       </para>
       <para>
        Protection of the ozone layer is an environmental issue of world importance which requires urgent action. The implications for Australia arising from ozone depletion are especially important in terms of a possible increase in the already high incidence of skin cancers, possible damage to primary industries, and our interest in preservation of the Antarctic environment.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1987 Australia became a party to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer. In June 1988 Australia signed the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. The Protocol which is due to take effect from 1 January 1989 establishes a requirement to limit the domestic supply of the specified CFCs according to a tightening program which will freeze supply at the 1986 level, with effect from mid-1989; reduce supply by 20 per cent from 1993; and reduce supply by a further 30 per cent from 1998. The Protocol also requires that the supply of halon gases be frozen at the 1986 level, with effect from 1990. (The commencement date for the first control action for both the CFCs and halons will be delayed if the Protocol does not enter into force on 1 January 1989.)
       </para>
       <para>
        The Protocol also provides for periodic reviews of its control requirements based upon scientific, technical and economic considerations. The first review is to be completed by 1990. Recognising that the latest scientific findings indicate that chlorofluorocarbons are responsible for the Antarctic ozone hole and are also implicated in the small global losses already identified, it is likely that the Protocol will be significantly strengthened after the review is complete.
       </para>
       <para>
        The provisions of the Bill have been the subject of extensive liaison between Government and industries which manufacture, import and use CFCs and halons. For example, in May this year Senator Richardson met with industry representatives. As a result of that meeting, a series of action plans were produced and the Bill's provisions reflect the recommendations of those plans. Liaison has also been maintained through an interdepartmental working group on ozone and with the industry group, the Association of Fluorocarbon Consumers and Manufacturers. State governments and consumer and conservation groups have also been consulted. I am advised that industry supports the proposals in the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill provides for:
       </para>
       <para>
        a system of licences and tradable quotas for the production, import and export of scheduled substances, and
       </para>
       <para>
        controls on the applications of scheduled substances so as to limit, so far as is practicable, the emissions of these substances to the air.
       </para>
       <para>
        The licence and quota provisions relate to Australia's obligations under the Protocol. Licences will be granted to persons who produced, imported or exported scheduled substances during the year 1986. Quota will be granted to the same persons according to their market share in 1986. Once they have their quota, they will be free to buy and sell their share of quota on the open market. Total quota on issue will be adjusted according to the provisions of the Protocol.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second category of restrictions gives effect to the Government's determination to take all reasonable steps to exceed the minimum requirements laid down in the Protocol.

        But these controls are only the beginning. It is the Government's firm intention to continue with the joint industry/government working group so as to develop practical measures to reduce further Australia's consumption of scheduled substances. Additionally, a representative of the environment movement will be appointed to the working group to ensure that environment interests are kept abreast of developments and to ensure their views are taken into account in future action plans to limit further applications of these substances.

        The Protocol generally has no controls on exports and in fact allows production to be increased by up to 15 per cent under certain circumstances. However, the Government proposes that exports first be frozen and then gradually reduced by 5 per cent a year. If this was not done, industry could simply convert production for domestic consumption into exports.

        The Bill has no continuing financial implications as fees will be levied on each kilogram of scheduled substance manufactured or imported to recoup the costs of administering the legislation. Until the scheme is operational three positions have been funded at a cost of $185,000 for the first year within the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories.

       As honourable senators know, the appointment to a casual Senate vacancy is made by both Houses of the relevant State Parliament sitting and voting together, as is required under section 15 of the Australian Constitution. The only restriction, which has applied since 1977, is that the person chosen must be a member of the same party as the person being replaced. We all remember former Senator Field. There is no provision under the Constitution that the person chosen must be the nominee of or in any way approved of by the party. Unless a majority of members of both Houses of Parliament give a guarantee as to whom they would choose if there were a vacancy, it is impossible to be sure who would be chosen, not even with the guarantee of a sympathetic Premier-which Mr Greiner certainly was not. One has only to look at the experience of Senator John Devereux from Tasmania to see how an unsympathetic State Government can disfranchise an electorate by rejecting the nominee of the party.

In this case, if a joint sitting of both Houses of the New South Wales Parliament had, in the event of my resignation, nominated someone other than my predecessor, there would have been no legal remedy for the situation. Furthermore, our Party at that time had no means under its constitution to expel anyone whom it did not want to see represent it. I was faced with several unpalatably real scenarios representing a Pandora's box of legal and constitutional difficulties which could have had the effect of delaying and even disfranchising those voters who wanted a strong anti-nuclear voice in the Senate. For example, a Call to Australia member of the Nuclear Disarmament Party could have been nominated to fill the position, as the NDP had no prescription clause in its constitution. The choice was clear. I could resign on the remote chance that my predecessor--

On the one hand, I was incurring the displeasure of a handful of people; on the other, I could have been responsible for losing the Senate position entirely, and I was not about to do that. Unfortunately, my reasons for accepting the Senate position and for my election were not widely canvassed in the media. This is why I have been misrepresented in the media and why I hope my explanation today will at least set the record straight.

        —I have been listening, Mr Deputy President. I assure you that I did not butcher Senator Wood. I have received, as I understand have all other senators in this place and members of the House of Representatives, a quite outrageous letter from The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), which I know to be an old and honourable society of god-fearing people who would not knowingly misrepresent anybody, least of all a charitable soul such as myself. The general tenor of the letter is to chastise me, in quite unqualified ways, for my measured criticism of Senator Vallentine for her poor attendance in this chamber, which is justified in this letter amongst other things by her membership of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Only her colleagues on that Committee will be able to judge whether that is a fair explanation. The letter makes certain claims against me and commends Senator Vallentine in its thrust. I can only speculate as to who provided this honourable organisation with that misinformation on both sides. The letter says that I referred to all peace activists, some of whom it says are highly respected members of the community, as `rabble', `dirty', `not washed for a month', `loutish', `hairy lesbians' and other such epithets. I did not say that in this chamber, nor would I ever say it in this chamber. That was a description I used in a very selective, precise and objective way designed and intended to reflect upon a specific group in the community. In no way would I ever use that description to criticise broadly and unfairly the vast majority of decent people, such as myself, who can describe themselves as members of the peace group.

         —This afternoon we are discussing a very important subject which, clearly, the Opposition does not want to have discussed. The acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) may yet become the Black Death of the twentieth century. The actual and potential seriousness of this disease is still not fully realised, either by the public or by most politicians. The consequences for the whole community of its almost inexorable progression through the homosexual community, to intravenous drug users, to heterosexuals, to women and, finally, to children is far from being fully appreciated. Yet if we fail to understand and respond appropriately to this rapid increase in numbers and to the sequence of infection, which I have just outlined, it seems likely that few will be immune from infection in just a few short years. The human immune deficiency virus is one which has emerged very recently as a human pathogen. Since its first detection the number of infected people has increased rapidly.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The acquired immune deficiency syndrome was first reported in the United States in 1981. One case only was reported in Australia in 1982. That person is now dead. Six were reported in 1983, all now dead; 42 in 1984, 41 of whom are now dead; 113 in 1985, 96 now dead; 224 in 1986, 174 now dead; 345 in 1987, 160 already dead. In short, the number of AIDS cases has been doubling every six months since 1982. At that rate, another 15 doublings would have the whole Australian population afflicted and that would take just 7 1/2 years. I say `afflicted' because the number of human immunodeficiency (HI)virus infected is perhaps 20 to 30 times the number showing symptoms of AIDS. Thus the number of HI positive people in Australia probably already lies between 10,000 and 40,000.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is suggested that all those who are HIV positive will sooner or later develop AIDS. Of those 1,023 who have developed AIDS in Australia, 511 have already died. Ninety per cent of those diagnosed in 1985 and 98 per cent of those diagnosed in 1984 are now dead. So far in Australia most of the cases and most of the transmission has been in homosexual men. This is merely the first phase. The HI virus is spread very effectively through shared unsterilised needles. The virus has no natural predilection for men. Through intravenous (IV) drug use it is being spread to the female and the heterosexual male population. Infection of intravenous drug users is the second phase now developing. This phase provides the link to the heterosexual community to women and thence to the newborn. It is this intravenous drug link which must be broken. New York provides a picture of what will occur here if we do not act now. Of New York's 200,000 intravenous drug users it is estimated that 60 per cent carry the AIDS virus. In Australia the figure is still probably about 4 per cent but rising rapidly.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is necessary to say something about the human immunodeficiency virus. It is an RNA virus. Most cells are DNA as their genetic library. DNA is reproduced with a high degree of sequence integrity and the translation of DNA into RNA for purposes of cell metabolism is also a process of highly faithful translation. Mutations in DNA leading to new genetic strains are not common. The same is not true of RNA viruses. These viruses must back translate their RNA into DNA using a reverse transcriptase enzyme. That is why they are called retroviruses. This process of reverse transcriptions is highly error prone, leading to rapid mutation rates and large numbers of genetic variants. Indeed, the gene coding for the reverse transcriptase enzyme is also subject to mutation, further increasing the mutation rates. This has several very important consequences. The possibility of making an effective vaccine is remote. Indeed, in a single patient several quite distinct zero types have already been identified, indicating the rapid changeability of the virus. Moreover, it is not inconceivable that a genetic variant could arise which was transmitted much more readily by non-sexual means or without the need to share needles. Without doubt the virus poses an extremely serious threat. It is spreading rapidly and for that reason a rapid and effective response is essential.
       </para>
       <para>
        This motion calls on the Federal Government to provide intravenous drug users with their drugs of addiction in ways that do not involve the sharing of needles and the consequent risk of the spread of the AIDS virus. As I shall argue later, this would have a number of other benefits, both for the drug users and for the community as a whole. We must think about drug use and especially drug addiction as a public health problem. We must think of addicts as people needing help, not as criminals to be punished, and of a society in which more people turn to drugs as a sick society needing treatment, not one merely needing more gaols and stricter penalties for the victims of its social and economic ills.
       </para>
       <para>
        We must conceptualise drug addiction-AIDS as a medical problem, not as a criminal one. A survey conducted early this year showed that 5 per cent of adult Australians or 80,000 people had injected drugs at some stage in their lives and that 2 per cent or 30,000 had done so within the last 12 months. Thus, intravenous drug use ranges from the once only experiment to the occasional user, through to those who may inject themselves up to eight times per day. Thus, we are not talking just about drug addicts. The majority of drug users are occasional users. While drugs remain illegal, these occasional users are most likely to obtain their drugs through sharing with those who are more regular users. It is estimated that some 3 per cent to 5 per cent of gay and bisexual men are intravenous drug users. Sharing needles is a much more effective way of transmitting the HI virus than either homosexual or heterosexual intercourse. There are a number of causes of death among intravenous drug users. The most common by far will soon be AIDS.

         —There are a number of figures which, I must say, I cannot give off the top of my head, so it is necessary for me to refer to those figures. Only about 2 per cent of intravenous drug users died each year from their drug use pre-AIDS. In New York 20 per cent to 30 per cent of intravenous drug users will develop AIDS within five years and will then live for less than one year. The greatest risk to the intravenous drug user is not the drug but the risk of getting AIDS. The greatest health risk posed to the community by the intravenous drug user is the risk of spreading AIDS.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        AIDS also places on the community a large and growing financial burden. There is no cure. Nursing care and hospitalisation are expensive. The only treatments are palliative, not curative. AZT presently costs $10,000 per year per patient, and when the other treatment costs are added it appears that the 1988 costs of treating and caring for the present 500 or so living AIDS victims in Australia, plus the associated AIDS dedicated expenditure by the Commonwealth, are approaching $50m. If no effective action is taken now, this figure is likely to be about $1 billion in five years' time. If this money is not found the quality of care will deteriorate and our efforts to control the further spread of AIDS will falter. By then it will be too late.
       </para>
       <para>
        We now have a short period in which we can make, on this disease, a very significant impact. On a per capita basis Australia has the fourth highest incidence of AIDS in the Western world. We are perhaps only 18 months behind the United States in its spread and only a few years behind some African communities, where already 50 per cent of all pregnant women have AIDS. The policy discussion paper: `AIDS: A Time To Care, A Time To Act', released only a few days ago, lists three objectives of a national AIDS prevention strategy, the first and most important of which is to minimise transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus.
       </para>
       <para>
        The urgency motion this afternoon proposes that injectable drugs be supplied to intravenous drug users through facilities which may be either stationary or mobile and clean, non-threatening, friendly, and non-judgmental. This extends the concept of the needle exchange program for drug addicts. Preferably, the drugs would be used in the facilities and would not leave those places, or, as a second best, they could be provided in non-reusable single dose syringes. There is evidence that the use of intravenous and other drugs is principally influenced not by supply but by fashion and peer behaviour. Heroin use in the United States peaked in 1970, and has since declined. Cocaine use has also peaked in the United States and has now declined in that country. Supply limitation has not been responsible for these behavioural changes. Most Western countries, despite very considerable efforts by Customs and police agencies, have been markedly ineffective in damming the flow of the drugs.
       </para>
       <para>
        Injectable drugs are relatively readily available. Those people who wish to inject themselves will do so. Should we not attempt to ensure that when those people do so they pose the least threat both to themselves and to society at large? The damage done to society by drug abuse extends also into the areas of minor and major crime, the costs of attempted crime prevention, criminal investigation and prosecution and punishment. It is well known that many drug addicts in Australia must obtain $100 to several hundred dollars per day to buy their drugs. Many drug addicts, both male and female, turn to prostitution to earn this money. This provides one direct route between homosexual and heterosexual people in the community via the intravenous drug use. Many other drug users turn to theft to provide money to buy drugs. A growing proportion of house breaking and theft of money and salable items is related to drug addiction. Experience seems to indicate that the capacity of our police forces is already inadequate to deal with this growing minor but very costly crime. This was something Senator Crichton-Browne referred to just yesterday, I believe in regard to Western Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some indication of what lies ahead is again given by United States experience. In some cities in the United States, 50 per cent of all criminal work is made up of drug indictments. Prisons are full and overflowing. Convicts must be released early to make way for new arrivals. It is no secret that intravenous drugs are available in gaols and that homosexuality is also reasonably common. Prisons are therefore likely to become a major source of spread of the AIDS virus back into the community.

         —I rise to follow Senator Coulter in speaking to the urgency motion he has moved in the Senate this afternoon. At the outset I would like to make clear that the Government has no intention of legalising illicit drugs at this stage, although it would clearly see today's debate as a contribution to the community debate on this matter-a debate which it supports. However, I cannot possibly support the terms of Senator Coulter's motion. I was interested to hear his contribution because, to my surprise, he seemed to talk more about acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) than what I thought was the main thrust of his motion. The first part of his motion states:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The requirement for the Federal Government as a matter of urgency to supply injectable drugs to intravenous drug users so as to-
       </para>
       <para>
        Then there follow four points. First, I wonder whether this is really a matter of urgency. An examination of the Government's record would convince anyone that this matter is something that the Government has taken very seriously over a number of years. There is a national campaign against drug abuse well established in this country. It covers many of the points alluded to by Senator Coulter. There is an AIDS program which is a fine example, if not an exemplary model, for other countries to follow in addressing the question of AIDS. There is the excellent strategy for all Australians to address AIDS in the policy discussion paper `AIDS: A Time To Care A Time To Act' which was tabled I think in both Houses this week. It fully canvasses the whole issue relating to AIDS and takes up many of the points that Senator Coulter has raised.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's record in the community services and health portfolio of preventive and public health measures also indicates the way in which this Government has handled this question. Whether we are dealing with the drug problem or the related problems of health care, they are all matters that have been seriously addressed by government and are being seriously addressed. So I cannot allow the opening line of the motion which states that it is a matter of urgency: it is a matter of serious concern which is currently being addressed and has been addressed for quite some time and will continue to be addressed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Coulter asks that as a matter of urgency the Federal Government supply injectable drugs to intravenous drug users. Again, even without hearing the honourable senator's contribution I have to object to such broad terms. Is he talking of heroin? Is he also talking of cocaine? Would he include amphetamines? All of these drugs can be called injectable drugs and are certainly provided in that way. I have to object to the general terms of the motion because they are too vague. What is an `intravenous drug user'? Does the honourable senator mean occasional users? Does he mean addicts? I understand from what I know of the honourable senator that he distinguishes between an addict and an occasional drug user.
       </para>
       <para>
        Again, I indicate why I do not support the motion. It is too vague. Even from a layperson's understanding of it, it is still open to disagreement. I do not believe, and neither does the Government, that at this stage any of the points that the honourable senator has alluded to and which I want to move to, can be properly addressed by making currently illegal drugs legal, though that is a matter of serious concern and both the National Advisory Committee on AIDS and the National Health and Medical Research Council are seriously addressing the problem. I will return to that point shortly.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Coulter claimed that one of the reasons for proposing this motion is that taking these steps would help make drugs more safely available. Certainly, it should be of concern that if people are using drugs they use them safely. But the safe use of dangerous substances must not be confused with encouraging illegal activity. If people choose to become users of intravenous drugs we have to say first that we hope to encourage, treat, counsel and assist those people to change that choice and to go off drugs. But if they are using them we would like to see them used safely. I do not believe that is promoted necessarily by making currently illegal substances legal.
       </para>
       <para>
        The point about the spread of AIDS which is particularly relevant to intravenous drug use is not what drug is being used in the syringe but that the syringe be clean. It is the passage of the virus by intravenous drug users, or needle users, no matter what is contained in the needle, that is the concern. For this reason the Government has placed very serious consideration on the points the honourable senator made-not about the substance but about the proper and clean use of all intravenous equipment, needles, materials, et cetera. The Government provides for the exchange of needles for drug users precisely to address the very points that the honourable senator so properly raised in this debate. I think we can distinguish between encouraging the clean and wholesome use of needles and so on by intravenous drug users so as to prevent the spread of AIDS and encouraging people to use intravenous drugs at all. We have to draw a very fine line. The Government is trying to manage that and I support the emphasis that it makes on this point. I endorse all the honourable senator's points about the spread of AIDS. It is a very grave matter. I do not believe everybody in the community is fully aware of that or of its potential to spread further in this country. We must also appreciate that, while IV drug users contribute to the spread of AIDS, that is certainly not the only way in which the AIDS virus is spread. To the extent that we can contain the spread by providing clean needles and assisting people to have clean equipment and so on, that is something the Government encourages. That is to be distinguished from legalising the currently illegal substances that go with the needles or are used in that way.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Coulter alluded to major and minor crime. Both of those issues are very important and are clearly matters of concern. Any examination of this AIDS document, for example, let alone the drug campaign, will make it quite clear how comprehensively the Government is addressing this issue. Legal concerns and crime prevention are certainly part of both the drug campaign and the AIDS question. Again, there is very little evidence to suggest that if we made illicit substances licit we would reduce major crime. A lot of evidence suggests that major crime shifts to another area or another substance. I do not know that we can hold our breath on this and assume that even if it were done it would make an impact on major crime, although I expect that it would make some contribution to reducing minor crime.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a lot of evidence that people who turn to crime to maintain a drug habit have certainly committed crimes before they became drug users. That evidence is cited in some of the reports I have read prior to today's debate. It is also true that even if we did reduce the amount of minor crime associated with intravenous drug use that would not make a very big hole in minor crime in our country. I do not dispute Senator Coulter's points on that at all. If we can do anything at all to reduce crime that is to be encouraged. I do not believe that legalising currently illegal substances would make a major inroad into either major or minor crime. I am not sure that, even if it did, it would be sufficient to justify legalising those substances at this point.
       </para>
       <para>
        My final comment in relation to this motion is to highlight the importance of bringing drug users into contact with treatment and counselling services. That is something I strongly endorse, but I dispute that this is the only or the best way to do it. To provide treatment services to people when they come to seek the substance that is causing their illness, at least in my head, creates a contradiction that is very difficult to get around. Certainly we should put people in touch with counselling services. The Government is aware of the importance of treatment and counselling services for drug users to the extent that some $56m has gone into increasing the number of such services on the ground in the community. The improved provision of services does have its effect. It is accepted particularly by those who are trying to deal with the problem of AIDS, for example, by working with people in the drug treatment and counselling area. Those community services have a very significant role to play not only in containing the spread of AIDS and assisting people with proper advice but also in trying to help people who decide to reduce their drug usage or to come off drugs altogether.
       </para>
       <para>
        Again, I know the seriousness of this issue and I know of Senator Coulter's seriousness in trying to address it. I just have to say that ultimately I am not persuaded, one, that it is a matter of urgency or, two, that by legalising these substances we would make much impact on the points the honourable senator raised. Please let me make it clear that I strongly endorse the seriousness of the points Senator Coulter has brought to our attention in this debate, points that I hope my comments have supported. They will have to continue to be addressed because, as Senator Coulter properly pointed out, the problem of AIDS, let alone drug usage, is not going to go away. In fact, there is a lot of evidence that it will only increase in the next few years.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government, because it has seriously and comprehensively addressed these issues, has been able to anticipate the spread of AIDS in the next few years. I think that already we can see a slowing of the spread, even though one would be guarded in making that as an absolute claim. Australia's record in this area is something which we can be pretty proud of. One of the reasons it has been so good is that the Government has resisted the temptation to try to find simple or one-line solutions to a very complex area. That AIDS strategy clearly highlights just how many areas of government, how many areas of life and how many areas of the community are touched by the problem. They range from employment to economic management, insurance, occupational health and safety at work and superannuation, apart from all the issues of care and concern and provision of services for people as they become ill or discover that they are carriers. It is no easy problem to deal with and I do not believe that we should be tempted to find one-line solutions, or even small solutions as part of a very complex problem. I prefer to endorse the Government's approach, so at this stage there is no likelihood of endorsing illicit substances. The Minister for Community Services and Health, Dr Blewett, at the Third National Conference on AIDS, stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        You will all be aware of the current debate being conducted about the pros and cons of legalising illicit drugs, particularly heroin. While I believe this public discussion is healthy and should be encouraged, it is important that this not be allowed to confuse the AIDS and intravenous drug use issue. Again, it is not use of the illicit drug which causes someone to become infected by the virus, but the use of contaminated equipment to administer the drug. Legalising heroin is not a simple answer to this problem, and discussion of the issue must not be allowed to cloud the overriding need to educate intravenous drug users to abandon needle sharing behaviour.
       </para>
       <para>
        I draw the Senate's attention to a press release issued by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) which addressed this issue. At that stage the Chairman of the NHMRC, Professor John Chalmers, was concerned that there had been a misunderstanding of what the NHMRC's recommendations had been in this area. He expressed concern that there was an understanding that the NHMRC had recommended legalisation of heroin as a means of controlling the spread of AIDS among intravenous drug users. He wanted to make it clear that the NHMRC had not said that. What it had said was:
       </para>
       <para>
        Council endorsed a package of measures proposed by the Australian National Council on AIDS to address the problem of the spread of AIDS by IV drug users.
       </para>
       <para>
        The package includes more education, counselling and rehabilitation programs, greater availability of syringes and needle exchange programs, making syringes, needles and bleach available in prisons, compulsory urine testing for drugs in prisons, AIDS testing of prisoners before release and the assessment of single use syringes.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the elements of the package is a study of the use of injectable drugs in a controlled situation. The nature of the drugs to be used and the design of the trial have not yet been determined.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, any prospect of moving towards what is proposed in Senator Coulter's motion is down the line. It is being considered only as a prospect for a pilot study. I wanted to reinforce those remarks and that concern for adequate understanding of what was said by the NHMRC in this contribution to the debate. I take Senator Coulter's point that this is a serious matter. I believe that what he and others have said in this debate might be part of that continuing discussion in the community on this issue. It will not stop now. In fact, it will continue, I think, for many years. However, at this stage the Government will not support Senator Coulter's urgency motion.

         —This so-called urgency motion of the Australian Democrats has, unfortunately, like so many other issues raised by the Democrats, very much missed the mark. It is rather sad that they have moved such a motion today when only this week the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) and the shadow Minister for health came to a bipartisan agreement in terms of what needs to be done for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). We do not oppose the motion because we do not consider the AIDS issue important; in fact it is quite the reverse. We are most concerned about the whole AIDS blow-out. But giving more drug users more drugs to abuse is not a way of solving it. Sadly, Senator Coulter has made the assertion that if an injectable drug is freely available to abusers it will limit the spread of AIDS. What Senator Coulter fails to remember-Senator Crowley also reminded him-is that it is not the drugs that give people AIDS; it is the syringes that people use when injecting the drugs. Senator Coulter has alleged that such an initiative will reduce major and minor crime. Where is his evidence? There is no such evidence. Some professionals working in the area are expressing concern that it may actually do the reverse.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Intravenous (IV) drug abusers have been given access to the needle exchange programs. Those programs are particularly important. In some respects they go much further than many people in the community would see as desirable. The proposition creates concern about where it would stop. If authorities are going to provide free heroin, will they prevent the free supply of other injectable drugs, which I will not list again because Senator Crowley has listed them already? Still by far the greatest incidence of AIDS is found in the homosexual and bisexual community. This group constitutes 88 per cent of cases, and IV drug users only 0.9 per cent. I am not too sure why the Democrats and the Government are zeroing in on this side of it, as opposed to encouraging people to change their lifestyles and to try to get off drugs. Surely we as legislators should be doing more to encourage people to use drugs less and finding methods of getting users off their addictions as opposed to proposing a course of action that could do the reverse.
       </para>
       <para>
        It must be recognised that a consequence of the free heroin proposal may well be the spread of drug abuse. That is the last thing that we want. I believe that it is wrong to make the assumption that once IV drug abusers are supplied with injectable heroin they will have less occasion to resort to illegally obtained drugs or to share needles. As with so many other assertions, there is no data to support the proposal that abusers would stop obtaining drugs illegally.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another difficulty associated with the proposal is who decides what the abusers really need. It is quite conceivable that many abusers would overestimate their need and thereby obtain supplies of heroin which they may then sell illegally. This is particularly the case of take home doses. If they are to be permitted, the option is then available to share the oversupply. On the other hand, if the prescribing doctor underestimates the abuser's need there is still the incentive to obtain a supplement illegally. The fact behind that assertion is that that is exactly what is happening with some people on the legally provided methadone treatment program. That treatment is supplemented with illegally obtained heroin. There is also the logistics of the problem, which I do not think Senator Coulter addressed at all. Heroin is a relatively short acting drug. There may well be the necessity for abusers to get more than one dose, or shot-call it what we like-per day. That creates its own difficulties. In addition to that nothing has been said as to how the injecting of these drugs would be supervised. If it is not supervised the drugs could well be shared or given to others. Surely that is not what Senator Coulter is saying is highly desirable.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other million dollar question is: How would such abusers be identified and do we give all abusers a free go or do we selectively choose, remembering that there are many positive users who are not, and many who will not be, identified? On the other hand, what would prevent every IV drug abuser from seeking to qualify for the free treatment? What really concerns me is that there seems to be a progressive approach to making drug prevention less important than making drug use safer. To me that opens a Pandora's box with absolutely frightening consequences.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is interesting to note that the Director of Alcoholics and Narcotics Anonymous, Dr Jean Lennane, doubts the likely success of a free heroin campaign and is concerned about the consequences for the individuals involved. That is a particularly valid argument, considering that it leads towards people never being forced to solve their addiction without being confronted with the consequences of it. A number of specialists working with drug addicts and people generally in the community see this whole proposal as equating to giving alcoholics a free keg of beer on a daily basis. Once again, I do not think anyone would be stupid enough to come into this place and suggest that was the remedy for alcoholics. The essence of this motion has the potential of prolonging a person's addiction instead of combating it. Professor David Hawks, Director of the National Centre for Research into the Prevention of Drug Abuse, argues that users may obtain a supply of drugs that they would then sell illegally. He also went on to say in this month's issue of the Medical Journal of Australia:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . unless we can assume that intravenous drug users will share their needles less often if they are provided with heroin in an injectable form, the `cost' of making heroin available to some intravenous drug users may well outstrip the benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that really sums it up, because the whole dreadful problem of AIDS is not going to be solved by quick fix methods which really amount to bandaids on the bucket. The subject needs more and more research and a much harder approach that is not influenced by apologists for any one section of the community. I consider the research expenditure to be not only desirable but essential and it is therefore of concern to me that the Federal Government has rejected calls for more funds by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), with the Minister, Dr Blewett, simply saying that it too had to wear the responsibility of economic restraint. I might add that Dr Blewett also was forced to concede in a somewhat contradictory statement that financial cuts could have impact on the NHMRC, while the Council itself has predicted grave consequences.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not believe that Australia can any longer afford to pander to special interest groups, and nor should we for the sake of the health of this country. Drugs are well known to cause enormous suffering in our community and the use of such drugs should never be seen to be condoned by the Government. We should learn from the experience of other countries such as Britain and redirect our thinking toward a more comprehensive public education program.
       </para>
       <para>
        This motion before the Senate today is not only grossly premature; it is ill thought out when put side by side with the facts as we know them. That is the great tragedy of it, because I think the Australian Democrats are very much unaware, even though Senator Coulter did refer to the discussion paper, of what is really involved with such a discussion paper. The discussion needs to take place in an unemotional climate and without foolish recommendations such as giving more drugs to drug abusers or, as I said before, such as giving more alcohol to alcoholics. The Opposition will not be supporting this motion. Considering the importance of this motion, I now move:
       </para>
       <para>

         —This morning I presented to the Senate a petition praying that the Senate request the Australian Government to use its diplomatic influence to cease the oppression of Albanians in Yugoslavia and to bring peace to that nation. That petition was signed by only four petitioners. The four were all Australians of Albanian origin, and they are members of the Committee of the Albanian Community in Australia. But those four people had in fact collected over 2,000 names of other Australians of Albanian origin on the same petition. However, a meeting of the Committee decided not to hand to me for presentation the petition forms with those 2,000-plus signatures because the signatories feared reprisals against themselves and their families here in Australia from Australians of Yugoslav origin.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        That such fear can exist in this nation of ours is almost unbelievable, and, much more to the point, it should surely be a matter of gravest concern to all Australians that such fear can exist amongst citizens of this most peaceful of nations. I urge the Government to look into this matter. It is of the gravest importance that we do all that is necessary to prevent the development of fear-ridden racial or ethnic minorities in Australia who bring to our soil the internal conflicts of their countries of origin.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, that having been said, Australia, as a nation with a deservedly high reputation for human rights, cannot turn its back on gross violations of human rights in other nations. It is for this reason that I willingly presented to the Senate today the petition urging the Government to express its concern to the Government of Yugoslavia about the violation of human rights of Albanians in Yugoslavia. In addition to its human rights elements, the matter has direct relevance to all Australians in the sense that for centuries the Balkans has been a powder-keg which, when the fuse has been lit, has exploded on the whole world. One has only to recall Sarajevo and the resulting First World War to demonstrate that point with great force and clarity.
       </para>
       <para>
        The evidence that I have indicates that for at least the past seven years the Albanian minority in Yugoslavia has been subjected to persecution and oppression by the Yugoslav authorities. The problem is centred on the province of Kosova, where the majority of the population is Albanian. Albanians are in fact Illyrians, one of the oldest European races, who have lived in the Balkans for more than 4,000 years. There are in the Balkans some six million Albanians. About half of these live within the boundaries of Albania proper, whilst the remainder live within the borders of Yugoslavia. In 1981 Albanian students at Kosova University took to the streets to protest against their living standards and what they saw as a lack of freedom for Albanians in Kosova province. The authorities called in the police and the armed forces and hundreds of students, including, I am told, small children, were killed. I am also told that since then oppression has continued unabated. Albanians, both within and outside Yugoslavia, have been assassinated, and the living standards of the Albanians have continued to fall and are now quite deplorable.
       </para>
       <para>
        Albanians make up about 10 per cent of the population of Yugoslavia but, according to Amnesty International, 80 per cent of all political prisoners in Yugoslavia are Albanian. It was alleged recently in the Zagreb weekly paper, Danas, that 72 Albanian school children are in prison for political crimes. A member of the European Parliament recently stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        The physical safety of every Albanian man, woman and child in Kosava is being put at risk.
       </para>
       <para>
        An article in the Melbourne Age of 15 October last said that the Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic's anti-Kosava style is, according to his critics, `reminiscent to a Hitler or a Mussolini'. It is further alleged that since 1986 Albanian mothers in Yugoslavia are forbidden by state decree to have more than two children and that any more pregnancies are forcefully aborted. Today's press reports that public meetings have now been banned in Kosava and that this is aimed directly at the Albanians.

        There are many other allegations of oppression, including the prevention of the teaching of the Albanian language and of the re-writing of history texts to exclude any Albanian history. The highly respected paper, the Christian Science Monitor, believes that there is a real danger of Yugoslavia `turning into Europe's Lebanon', in large part because of the situation with the Albanian minority.

        Some of these allegations and others that I have not mentioned are contained in a letter written to the Secretary-General of the United Nations on 17 September this year by the Inter-Committee of the Albanian Community for Victoria. I seek leave to have the letter incorporated in Hansard.

        More than seven years ago, Albanian Students in Kosova University, Prishtine (Yugoslavia), took to the streets to protest against the miserable living conditions and for more freedom for themselves and for the Albanian population. They were chanting: ``WE WANT BREAD'', ``TREPCA IS OURS'', ``KOSOVA REPUBLIC''.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yugoslav authorities, instead of talking to them, and to find out the reasons for this discordant ordered the special police units and the armed forces with tanks, helicopters, gunships and machine guns who killed hundreds of unarmed students, even school children.
       </para>
       <para>
        Today, seven and half years later, this killing has not stopped, but only changed the strategy of torturing and killing Albanians throughout Yugoslavia in the most mysterious way and assassinating Albanian intellectuals outside Yugoslavia (in exile).
       </para>
       <para>
        After the peaceful demonstrations, Yugoslav authorities begun a campaign of mass arrests, jailing thousands and thousands of Albanians, sentencing them for up to 20 years imprisonment. According to Amnesty International, of all political prisoners in Yugoslavia, 80% are Albanians. On a wider scale, they follow the so-called POLICY OF DIFFERENTIATION which resulted in opening a new front in the field of crimes by Belgrade hegemonists upon defenceless Albanian inhabitants, manifested in the loss of their jobs, of thousands of Teachers, Professors, and workers, with the endeavour of provoking the Albanian people, the Belgrade ``Communists'' showed their true arrogance, and went thus as far as changing the Albanian National Flag, which is the greatest insult to the Albanian people and their history.
       </para>
       <para>
        Oppressions against Albanians have surpassed even the ill-famed Rankovic era. School text books and courses have been revised, so that instead of learning the Albanian history and culture, they are now forced to learn Serbian history. Albanians in Macedonia, are being imposed to attend mixed classes with Macedonian speaking students, in this form, suspending their constitutional right to learn the Albanian language, to sing Albanian songs and to wear Albanian National Costumes.
       </para>
       <para>
        Today, seven and half years after the bloodiest oppression of this tragic event which has no parallel in Europe since World War Two, the condition of more than 2.5 million Albanians in Yugoslavia, in the contrary the oppressive strategy of the Belgrade expansionist and opportunistic practices against Albanians has taken new perspectives and Montenegrians are gang organised by the greater Serb leaders in flaming a hatred against Albanian people using hysterical slogans such as ``DEATH TO ALBANIANS'', ``WE WANT WEAPONS'', WE ARE GOING TO KOSOVA'' and ``EVERY SERB MUST KILL AN ALBANIAN'' cursing Albanian mothers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Two months ago a mass rally was organised in the Montenegrian Capital, Titograd, where more than 5,000 people, in front of the `Communist' leaders, drew their revolvers and showing them to the TV cameras . . . In so-called Communist Yugoslavia creating scenes like in the wild western movies and chanting continuously `DEATH TO ALBANIANS'.
       </para>
       <para>
        By contrast, non-Albanian demonstrators in Belgrade in 1968 and these today against the Albanian people, did not result in the use of armed forces and brutal violence, but political compromise, once again however when Albanians conducted peaceful demonstrations for the status republic for Kosova in 1981, Albanian demonstrators were met by army torture and murder of hundreds of brothers and sisters. The non-Albanian participants in the former demonstrations, share heritage, language, culture and are well represented in the National Government. Albanians share none of the above, and thus are forced to function outside the system, or inside the Yugoslav prison walls, as such as the Kosovar Albanian writer Adem DEMACI, whom is serving over 26 years jail (Europe's MANDELA). As a result a potentially explosive situation has ensued as Serbians are calling for a return of practices of the ill-famed Rankovic's era and Albanians are becoming increasingly disillusioned with the policies of the State. Governmental discriminatory practices are exemplified by Yugoslavia's system of justice. Amnesty International reports that close to 30% of Yugoslavia's prisoners of conscience, person convicted of `verbal crimes'. (Something in Australia or America and many other countries, we would refer to as the practice of the inalienable right of free speech), are Albanians of the 35 prisoners put to death in Yugoslavia from 1981 to 1985, more than half were Albanians. Yet Albanians constitute only 9% of the Yugoslav population. Of the former convictions, many were based on Orwellian-like crimes: remarks in conversations and letters; drawings; joke telling; and even for singing. Typically prison terms for these `crimes' have ranged between one and 20 years. Indeed, Adem Demaci, a prominent Albanian author, has spent the last 27 years of his life in prison, for simple act of writing a pamphlet calling for the creation of the republic of Kosova. An extremely harsh sentence for a man who as a US Congressman Joseph DioGuardi describes, `never held a knife or gun, but only said what was in his heart'. Belgrade chauvinist oppression of Albanians extends beyond its borders, into foreign countries such as West Germany.
       </para>
       <para>
        Where the Yugoslav secret police, the ill famed UDB-a, assassinated four Albanians including two brothers Jusuf and Bardhosh GERVALLA. The existing horrors in Yugoslavia have not gone unnoticed, in the United States of America however, as members of Congress, led by Joseph DioGuardi in the House of Representatives and Senators Bob Dole and Paul Simon in the US Senate, have introduced a resolution formerly protesting Yugoslavia's violation of human rights. This resolution calls for compliance with the Helsinki Final Act, which Yugoslavia signed and demands it take steps `To ensure that human rights and fundamental freedoms . . . are respected in regard to persons from all National and Ethnic Groups'. We the Australian citizens and residents of Albanian background, plead with the Australian Government and any other Government that gets this Memorandum to take example to the United States Congress and Senate. Violation of human rights in any nation whether adversary or orally should be condemned. As the member of the Democratic World, Australia has an obligation to confront Governments that engage in such violations with actions to influence change. In order for this to occur in a healthy political environment, the Australian people and all other peace loving people throughout the World must be informed of the existing situations so that conclusions can be drawn and representatives influenced accordingly. If the World disagrees the crimes occurring and likely to occur upon the Albanian people by Belgrade Chauvinists we may forget a very important reality that the Balkans is the powder-keg, where both world wars started . . .

       <para>
        Kosova is the poor house of Yugoslavia and Europe. Unemployment and standard of living is far worst of the Yugoslav average. Tens of thousand of Albanians and their families live below the poverty level. The Chauvinist Serbia is reaching the highest point against the Albanian history and cultural values. Albanians are sent into the streets on their jobs and are treated as scums. We are asking that the freedom loving people of Australia and the world to raise their voices and protest against this unparalleled corrupcy and injustice perpetrated by the Yugoslav Government. Albanians in Yugoslavia are asking for equality to have as much as other nationalities enjoy. They are asking for recognition of Kosova as a full pledge Republic free of Serbian tutelage and exploitation. Albanian people in Yugoslavia want to live in dignity and peace and harmony with other nationalities of the Yugoslav federation, free of oppression and persecution. We felt morally compelled to keep the UNO appeared to this situation.

        Today seven and half years after we have seen no improvement force coming in that unfortunate land of Kosova we must therefore retaliate our efforts hoping that people of good-will assist the two and a half million Albanian people in Yugoslavia. Albanian community in Australia is also convinced that if constructive steps are to be taken, they will greatly benefit on improvement and stabilization of the situation in that area inhabited by Albanians in Yugoslavia and by extension, they will be seen to great contribution to peace in the Balkans. These steps are:-

        7. The entire political life of the region must develop on democratic principals. We also respectively request that the UNO take the initiative to explore the possibilities of a popular referendum in the areas involved as a just means of finding a solution to these difficult problems. With your help and ours, all this can be achieved prevailing upon the Yugoslav authorities to free themselves of dreadful chauvinism and the problems with understanding and justice. All this will contribute to a lasting key for security of Yugoslavia, Balkans and Europe.

        —The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) No. When the Minister announced the Government's proposal for a compact he made it clear that it was important to consult extensively with Aboriginals. The Government has always indicated that it has no intention of rushing the task or of imposing its own will on Aboriginal people.
      </para>
      <para>
       On 12 June the Prime Minister announced, at Barunga, that he would assist the process of Aboriginal consultation by a committee of seven elders. He envisaged that the wishes of Aboriginal people would be ready for negotiation with the Australian Government prior to the end of the life of the present Parliament.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) A number of proposals are being considered to allow the non-Aboriginal community to effectively participate in these negotiations. It is too early to indicate the proposed timing of such negotiations, or of the manner of participation by other Australians.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The Government has made its position on sovereignty clear on a number of occasions. It is not negotiable. While I expect that the issue will be raised during the consultation process, those raising the issue will, once again, be informed of the Government's position.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) No. State Governments have responsibility for land title and the administration of pastoral and other leasehold land. The Western Australian State Government has granted a number of excisions to Aboriginal communities. There are few Aboriginal people living on pastoral properties in the other States, and the States have therefore determined that there is no need for the type of excision arrangements which apply in the Northern Territory.
