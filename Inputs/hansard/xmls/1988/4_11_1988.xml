       War and Violence Related Toys, Games and Video Games

      </para>
      <para>
       They are gravely concerned over the availability of war toys and other combat or violence related toys and games, including video games, in our country.

       They believe there is sufficient scientific evidence to show that these kind of toys and games are educationally unsound, psychologically damaging to children, and socially undesirable.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore humbly pray: that the senate will take measures to end all trading in war and violence related toys, games, and video games, through either self-regulation by the traders in these products, or legislative action.

       But for a High Court decision narrowly favouring the Federal Government, 20,000 years old archeological cave sites near the Franklin River, Tasmania, would have been destroyed, like a United Kingdom Government unable to stop a Wiltshire authority from clearing Stonehenge for a freeway.

         —The Regulations and Ordinances Committee moves this notice of motion for disallowance as this is the last day on which it can do so. The Committee has written to the Minister for the Arts and Territories (Mr Holding) and the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown) concerning aspects of these matters. It is with some degree of trepidation that I have to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that the first ordinance in respect of which I have moved for disallowance is the Casino Control Ordinance 1988. I can inform Senator Hill that the reason for the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances moving for disallowance of this ordinance is not related in any way at all to the political discussion that was held last night. Last night I was engaged in a very late meeting with officers of the Minister's Department to resolve this matter. I am hopeful that later today I will be able to withdraw this notice. If I should fail to do so, next week all correspondence should be referred to me care of the Cocos Islands, Indian Ocean. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the list of instruments, with a short description of the Committee's concerns.

The Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support advised that he had sought the drafting of legislation to cover all instances of unauthorised zoning charges as quickly as possible. The Minister also advised he had sought a report from Telecom under section 100 of the Telecommunications Act 1975 on the circumstances of the whole matter and would furnish the Committee with a copy of the report. The Chairman of Telecom indicated that Telecom had instituted procedures whereby the problems of introducing new exchanges prior to having in place by-laws would no longer occur. The Committee is extremely pleased that Telecom has moved in this way after a long period of correspondence with the Committee. The Committee thanks the Minister and the Chairman of Telecom Australia for their cooperation in these matters. The acronym for the system of computer control which will solve this problem is CHARM-something which Telecom could do with a lot more of.

        Dear Minister,
       </para>
       <para>
        At its meeting of 25 August 1988, the Committee considered the Interpretation (Amendment) Ordinance 1988 being A.C.T. Ordinance No. 36 of 1988, tabled in the Senate on 24 August 1988. The Committee draws your attention to section 19 which provides for the amendment of section 50 of the Principal Ordinance. Paragraph (a) of section 19 reads in part:
       </para>
       <para>
        ``(b) the regulations shall take effect-
       </para>
       <para>
        (i) if the regulations so provide-
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        (C) on the commencement of a specified Ordinance or a specified provision of an Ordinance;''
       </para>
       <para>
        The wording of (b) (i) (C) is identical with the wording used in the original form of the amendment to the Acts Interpretation Act that was proposed in the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 1987. That original wording was the subject of the Committee's Eighty-Second Report. In that Report, the Committee said, in relation to the equivalent clause in the Bill, the following:
       </para>
       <para>
        ``Proposed subparagraph 48 (1) (b) (iii) would enable regulations to take effect from the commencement of a specified Act or a specified provision of an Act. The committee was concerned that under this amendment regulations could be expressed to take effect from the commencement of a specified Act that was already in force, thereby lawfully imposing retrospective liability. Since such regulations would not be expressed to take effect from a date before the date of notification but rather from the commencement of an Act, the Committee considered that subsection 48 (2) might not apply to prevent retrospective regulations taking effect.''
       </para>
       <para>
        Following the Committee's comments and concerns, the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, agreed to amend the legislation to read as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        ``(b) shall, subject to this section take effect from:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        (iii) the date, or date and time, of commencement of a specified Act or a specified provision of an Act; or''.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee's concerns in relation to the amendment in this Ordinance are identical to those expressed in the Eighty-Second Report. The Committee would welcome your views in relation to this important matter.

        Dear Bob
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer to your letter of 30 August 1988 to the former Minister, the Hon. Gary Punch MP, expressing your Committee's concerns with regard to subparagraph 50 (1)(b)(i)(C) of the Interpretation Ordinance 1967 inserted by section 19 of the Interpretation (Amendment) Ordinance 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        This amendment is one of several which reflect amendments of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 made by the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1987. New paragraph 50 (1)(b) of the Interpretation Ordinance was intended to widen the range of options for commencing ACT Regulations as new paragraph 48 (1)(b) of the Acts Interpretation Act would for Commonwealth Regulations.
       </para>
       <para>
        As you observed, subparagraph 50 (1)(b)(i)(C) of the Ordinance is in substance the same as the original form of subparagraph 48 (1)(b)(iii) of the Act as proposed in the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, but the latter paragraph was altered following the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, accepting your Committee's representations.
       </para>
       <para>
        If there is merit in the reason why the Commonwealth provision was altered, that reason will of course be equally valid in relation to the Ordinance because subsection 50 (2) of the Ordinance corresponds to subsection 48 (2) of the Act proscribing retrospective regulations that would affect existing rights prejudicially or impose liabilities in respect of past conduct. However, I suggest that as the Ordinance stands at present, on a proper construction subsection 50 (2) would prevail so that offending Regulations could not circumvent it by relying on a commencement provision that attempted to tie them to ``the commencement'' of an existing Ordinance or a provision of an existing Ordinance. On that view, such Regulations would not have to refer specifically to a particular date to be caught by the subsection; a commencement provision of the kind described should still fall as contravening the spirit of the subsection because it would still be in effect referring to a date, i.e., the date of commencement of the Ordinance or provision. In expressing this opinion, I am of course agreeing with the view expressed by Senator Tate in the second paragraph of his letter of 18 November 1987 reproduced in your Committee's eighty-second Report.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, the matter is arguable and the fact that the Commonwealth provision has been altered is a telling factor; a court that was required to construe the ACT provision may well attach unintended significance to the difference in wording between it and its Commonwealth counterpart.
       </para>
       <para>
        In any event, these provisions deal with the important area of parliamentary control over delegated legislation, an area where uniformity is clearly desirable.
       </para>
       <para>
        Accordingly, I propose to arrange for the ACT provision to be amended as soon as practicable to bring it into line with the Commonwealth provision. I trust this will resolve your concerns about the matter.

        I am writing to you about your notice of motion for disallowance of amendments of the Telecommunications (Charging Zones and Charging Districts) By-laws and the Telecommunications (Community Calls) By-laws.
       </para>
       <para>
        I share the Committee's concerns about the handling of recent zoning and charging changes by Telecom. However, the effect of the by-laws is not to impose or authorise changes retrospectively. It is to authorise future charges, from the effective date of the by-laws, due to zoning changes that were made previously. The matter of authority for charges made prior to the date of effect of these by-laws, but subsequent to the relevant zoning changes having been put in place in practice, is a separate matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        I understand that Senator Evans, as Minister for Transport and Communications had asked for appropriate legislation to be prepared addressing the question of retrospective authorisation, because it was just not possible to retrospectively calculate adjustments to customers accounts for this period. Nor would it have been desirable, since many customers are likely to have had reduced bills as a result of the charges and retrospective surcharges would obviously be inappropriate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since Senator Evans' decision, the scope of the problem has been found to be greater than first advised.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have therefore today sought the Prime Minister's concurrence to the drafting of legislation that will embrace all instances of unauthorised zoning changes. It is my intention that the matter be resolved equitably as quickly as possible.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, I have sought from Telecom a report under section 100 of the Telecommunications Act 1975 on the circumstances of this whole matter. I would be pleased to provide you with a copy of that report when it is received.

        At its meeting of 29 September 1988, the Committee considered Telecommunications (Charging Zones and Charging Districts) By-laws-Amendment No. 82 and Telecommunications (Community Calls) Bylaws-Amendment No. 53, tabled in the Senate on 29 August 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee expresses some surprise that in the Explanatory Statements supplied with the Amendments reference is made to the fact that certain changes had already come into operation with some rates being higher and some lower. As this reference related to a period prior to the coming into operation of these instruments on 1 September 1988, there is clearly prejudicial retrospectivity.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee notes that reference is made to the Attorney-General's legal opinion, as supplied to the Committee on 24 August 1988, in relation to the need for enabling legislation to validate such Amendments. The Committee views the making of these Amendments with considerable concern in view of the availability of the Attorney-General's legal opinion and the fact that no validating Act has yet been considered by the Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        As these Amendments will affect some subscribers in a prejudicially retrospective manner they will contravene the provisions of section 48 (2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. The Committee seeks your advice as to the reasons for the Commission making these Amendments after being advised by the Attorney-General's Department as to the legal position of such Amendments. The Committee also seeks clarification as to the action the Commission intends to take in relation to those subscribers who have been adversely affected by the changes prior to 1 September 1988.

        Dear Sir
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer to the letter of 30 September 1988 from Senator Collins concerning Amendment No. 82 to the Telecommunications (Charging Zones and Charging Districts) By-laws and Amendment No. 53 to the Telecommunications (Community Calls) By-laws.
       </para>
       <para>
        The changes referred to in the letter as coming into operation before the date of commencement of Amendments Nos. 82 and 53 were physical changes made to the telecommunications network before 1 September 1988 which would, because of the metering arrangements associated with the changes, have the potential to increase or decrease subscribers' payments for some telephone calls by amounts not authorised in Telecom's Tariff and By-laws at the time when the physical changes were effected.
       </para>
       <para>
        Telecom agrees with the Committee that the failure to authorise the network changes from the date of their commencement creates a situation of retro- spectivity. As explained in previous correspondence, however, it is unable to determine whether the retrospectivity has been prejudicial to any telephone subscriber or user because the manner in which charges are recorded does not enable Telecom to determine whether there has been a net increase in the Charges billed to any subscriber as a result of the unauthorised retrospectivity or whether any user of a public telephone made trunk or community calls during the period of retrospectivity which were affected by the unauthorised metering changes.
       </para>
       <para>
        Telecom cannot agree with the Committee that anything in the subordinate legislation under review viz. Amendments Nos. 82 and 53 will affect some subscribers in a prejudicially retrospective manner or that the amendments will contravene the provisions of section 48 (2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. The By-laws are expressed to operate prospectively and deal with telephone calls made after the date of their making and after their gazettal on 30 August 1988 (see Commonwealth of Australia Gazette No. S251 p.1).
       </para>
       <para>
        Nothing in the amendments themselves is designed or intended to deal with the unauthorised application of charging rates to telephone calls made before the date of commencement of the amendments. As noted in the explanatory memoranda to the amending By-laws and in previous correspondence, the validation of unauthorised charges made before the date on which the charges were prospectively authorised by By-law must be approved by Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        Telecom is deeply conscious of the need to obtain validation for any network charges which have been implemented before they were authorised by By-law and has been endeavouring, since the Attorney-General's Department's advice on the subject was received on 19 August 1988, to devise in conjunction with that Department, the Department of Transport and Communications and the Office of Parliamentary Counsel a satisfactory method of validating charge rates which require retrospective authorisation. It had been hoped to introduce validating legislation in the Telecommunications Amendment Bill 1988 which was introduced in the House of Representatives on 28 September 1988. However, the drafting difficulties associated with the legislation and the need to ensure that all unauthorised retrospective charges had been ascertained for inclusion in the legislation made that impracticable.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee's letter under reply seeks Telecom advice as to the reasons for the making of Amendments after receipt of Attorney-General's Department advice as to the legal position of such amendments. It is submitted, with respect, that nothing in that advice suggested that it would be in any way improper for Telecom to make By-laws which prospectively authorises rates of charging. The advice related firstly to whether there was a need to validate unauthorised charges if the net effect of those charges was not prejudicial to customers and secondly whether the validation should be effected by Act. As Telecom reads the advice, it relates to the need to validate the retrospective aspects of any unauthorised charges. At no time has Telecom made any By-law which had the effect of increasing individual charges and which was expressed to take effect from a date earlier than its notification in the Gazette. As noted, Amendments Nos. 82 and 53 are expressed to take effect prospectively only.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee's letter also asks what action Telecom intends to take in relation to subscribers who have been adversely affected by the changes authorised in Amendments Nos. 82 and 53 in respect of any application of those changes which occurred before the date of effect of the amendments. As noted in the explanatory memoranda accompanying the amendments, validation of any premature charging involved in the amendments would be sought in conjunction with the validations which are being prepared for submission to Parliament in respect of charges detailed in Amendments Nos. 81 and 52.
       </para>
       <para>
        Until the outcome of any validating legislation presented to Parliament is known, Telecom will be unable to determine whether any further action is required in respect of the charges. However, as noted in previous correspondence, it would be extremely difficult, in the absence of detailed records of individual subscriber trunk dialling and community call charging to provide relief for any individual subscriber and, as also noted, it is quite likely that most subscribers have not been ``out-of-pocket'' as a result of the network changes not covered by By-law amendments.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is not to say, of course, that Telecom is not extremely concerned at the failure in its mechanisms for ensuring that network changes are authorised before new exchanges commence operation or as soon as subscribers are cutover from one exchange or zone to another. There are 1,997 telephone charging zones and 5,227 telephone exchanges in the Commonwealth. There is considerable churn within the system due to closing and opening of exchanges and zoning points. Elaborate measures are in hand to increase the level of liaison and coordination within the commercial and technical areas of the Commission with a view to ensuring that future amendments relate to prospective network changes. However I regret the Commission is not in a position to guarantee that all past network changes were picked up in the August By-law amendments i.e. there may also be future amendments to the By-laws which deal with network changes which have been implemented before the date of operation of the amendments and these would also need to be included in the validating legislation being considered by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whilst all checks have not yet been completed, it appears that the main reason for network changes being effected in advance of By-law authorisation has been that the changes related to the installation of new exchanges or zoning points. The installations occurred in existing charging zones where no variation in charging relationships between zones was involved. In those cases it appears that the field staff effecting the installations were unaware of the need to include the new exchange or point in the By-laws and that the omissions were not picked up by regional staff until after the installations were effected.
       </para>
       <para>
        The recording of aspects of the network relating to charging considerations is now centralised in a single national computer system, CHARMS (Charging Records Maintenance System), which is responsible for allocating the area codes and blocks of exchange numbers required to operate exchanges and zoning points and which will, in future, prevent codes and blocks being allocated unless any necessary By-law authorisation has been obtained. This should prevent network changes occurring without necessary authorisation. In addition, the lines of reporting of network changes from the field are being altered to ensure that notice of planned changes is received earlier in the areas responsible for procuring By-law amendments.

        Dear Minister,
       </para>
       <para>
        At its meeting of 25 August 1988, the Committee considered Air Force Regulations (Amendment), being Statutory Rules 1988 No. 129, tabled in the Senate on 24 August 1988. The Committee seeks your advice in relation to new Regulation 65a.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee's concern relates to the determination of the criteria and procedures used in the promotion of certain officers. The criteria for promotion are not set out in the Regulation but are to be ``determined, by instrument, by the Chief of the Air Staff''. Similarly, in relation to the procedures, the Chief of the Air Staff ``may, by instrument, determine the procedures for the selection of officers for promotion''.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee, while understanding the need to alter the criteria and procedures used in the promotion of officers, believes that the provisions of such determinations ought to be the subject of review by the Parliament. It would appear from the wording of new Regulation 65a that such instruments are not open to Parliamentary review.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee would welcome your views in relation to this matter.

        Dear Senator Collins
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer to your letter to the Minister for Defence dated 30 August 1988 in which you expressed concern that the new regulation 65a of the Air Force Regulations, contained in Statutory Rules 1988  No. 129, does not provide for parliamentary review of instruments made under that regulation.
       </para>
       <para>
        It might be helpful in your consideration of this matter if I set out some of the background to the new regulation 65a. Prior to the amendment, regulation 65a provided that officers were to be promoted to the rank of Squadron Leader or above in the order of their relative efficiency, or if they were equal in relative efficiency, in the order of their seniority. In recent years, the concept of seniority has become outmoded as the basis for promotion and, to that extent, the former provision did not accurately reflect the desired policy. Then, in 1987, a review of officer personnel management in the Air Force concluded that changes were needed in the officer selection and promotion system.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under these changes, officers that the Air Force intends to promote to the rank of Squadron Leader or above will be informed of their selection and placed in one of two groups. The first group is made up of officers who will be promoted at some date between 1 July of the year of selection and 31 December of the following year. The second group is made up of officers who are provisionally selected for promotion. Officers within this second group will be promoted at some date between 1 July of the year of selection to 30 June of the following year provided positions become available. If positions do not become available, they are automatically placed in the first group in the next round of selections. Officers within the two groups are therefore assured of promotions within a given time frame that meets the particular personnel needs of the Air Force.
       </para>
       <para>
        This system of promotion will allow officers' skills, experience and qualifications to be matched to the requirements of the vacant positions. It is also expected that the system will reduce posting turbulence and associated personnel problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        Two further points can be made. The first is that relative efficiency of eligible officers is not the only factor governing selection for promotion. Other factors such as availability, personal preferences and suitability for vacant positions at the higher rank also need to be taken into account. The second point is that there is no comparative ranking of officers within the two selected groups.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendment of regulation 65a was made to enable the Chief of the Air Staff to set up-to-date criteria for promotions and to enable promotions to be made in accordance with the new system as indicated above. The aim is to have determinations setting out the criteria for promotion and the system of promotion so that all officers affected by or involved in the promotion process are fully aware of the conditions attached to promotions.
       </para>
       <para>
        You will appreciate from what I have said that, apart from its inappropriate reference to seniority in the event of equal efficiency, the former regulation 65a was inadequate in specifying relative efficiency as a sole criterion for promotion. In developing legislative changes flowing from the review mentioned above, consideration was given to simply repealing the former regulation 65a without replacement, but it was considered that there should be recognition of the need for criteria and procedures to be set.
       </para>
       <para>
        While I recognize the basis of your concern, I would not favour the detailed prescription of matters of Defence Force internal management being made subject to Parliamentary review. Regulation 65a deals with one small part of the appointments and promotions scheme of the Air Force. No other part of that scheme, which is part and parcel of the normal day to day working of the Air Force, is subject to Parliamentary review.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, in light of provisions contained in other regulations relating to the scheme of appointments and promotions (eg, regulation 65), I suggest that an appropriate resolution to the problem you raised would be to amend regulation 65a to include guidelines for the Chief of the Air Staff in the exercise of his power. The exact form of the guidelines is a matter that would have to be discussed with the Attorney-General's Department, but I envisage that the guidelines could provide that the Chief of the Air Staff should have regard to the skills and experience required for the performance of duties, the career advancement needs of officers, and the need to ensure the availability of an adequate supply of officers suitable for promotion.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would be grateful for an indication of whether this proposal is acceptable to your Committee.

         —Some weeks ago I received a letter from an elderly constituent whose wife has been a patient in a Bush Nursing hospital for some 2 1/2 years. The private medical fund which was supporting her wrote to this gentleman to say that it was going to withdraw support. Not long after that-in fact, last week-two separate stories appeared in the Age and the Sun, stories of elderly patients in rural Bush Nursing hospitals who were being asked to leave because their medical funds were refusing to support them any more. The Minister for Community Services and Health, Dr Blewett, responded and said that the withdrawal of the private funds' support for patients in Bush Nursing hospitals was `outrageous'. I suggest that the Minister's administration of long term care for the aged is outrageous, in particular the lack of assistance to patients in small Bush Nursing hospitals.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        What has led to this situation in Bush Nursing hospitals? We have Bush Nursing hospitals scattered throughout Victoria. They are classified as private hospitals and they usually service small rural areas. Some have approved nursing homes attached to them but the smaller ones do not. One of these hospitals has had eight patients who have been supported by a private nursing fund for a total of 6,300 days. In anybody's books, they are not acute hospital patients. If one were to get a geriatric assessment team to assess these patients they would be assessed as nursing home patients. Eight acute hospital patients would rarely spend a total of 6,300 days in an acute hospital unless they were in a public hospital when they ought to be in a nursing home but cannot move because we do not have enough nursing homes. It is outrageous that the Minister blames the health funds for his Department's inadequacy in dealing with these one-off situations.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is bad luck under this present Government to be an elderly person in a small rural town where there is no nursing home. That is all I can say: it is bad luck. It is bad luck if a person has not had private health cover that at least may have covered him for the last 2 1/2 to three years. In Victoria there has been a 35 per cent reduction in the private health insurance market since February 1984, so a lot of people will be in that situation. It is bad luck for them that the Hawke Government is in power. The health funds can afford to pay benefits only to those to whom they are legally obliged to pay them. Not only has there been a downturn in the market but the funds have been hit by other government decisions which have reduced their funds to critical levels. They can no longer fund long term patients. One may ask, `Why should they?'. The very elderly patients they have been supporting are not acute care patients; they are long term patients. If they lived in major rural centres or towns in Victoria they would be eligible, if they were assessed as being qualified for a nursing home, to go into a registered nursing home and receive funding from the Federal Government. I will not go into what I think about the current funding. Because they live in small rural areas they are not eligible. What sort of treatment is this for our rural elderly? The Hawke Government is for big unions, big business and big organisations, not individuals. If the Government were more flexible and could assess these long term patients as qualifying for nursing home benefits we might then be able to meet the needs of people in small rural communities. I am cynical enough to think that this Government will not extend itself to be creative because there are very few votes arising from the 250 elderly patients this affects. There are very few votes for the Government in rural areas, so why would it bother?
       </para>
       <para>
        Dr Blewett has painted the private funds as big bad bogymen. He said in the House when he was introducing the new funding arrangements for nursing homes that the recent changes to funding were designed `to ensure that nursing home care is affordable by all Australians who need it'. However, he forgot to talk about those people who live in rural areas which are not serviced by nursing homes. He forgot those 250 patients who are in bush nursing hospitals. I do not know how honourable members opposite can sit here when there are people in small rural areas not being cared for. Really the private funds are not the big bad bogymen; Dr Blewett is the bogyman. Let him take the blame. I call on Dr Blewett to stop passing the buck to private funds and to direct his Department to develop ways and means of ensuring that these elderly people in rural areas receive the long term care to which they are entitled.

         —On a day when there is a great deal of comment about Aboriginal affairs administration in this country and we see a series of newspaper accounts of what has been occurring-much of which has been exposed in this Parliament, particularly in the Senate and its committees-I wish to raise another matter of concern to the Opposition in regard to what is currently happening. I do so because I think that to fail to raise it could give rise to the possibility of further abuses which could obscure the facts and make it more difficult for the Parliament to deal with the difficult issues before it.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Before moving to describe the matters of concern to the Opposition, I want however very briefly to mention the suggestion by Mr Neville Bonner that there has been some sort of abuse of parliamentary privilege in raising matters relating to Aboriginal affairs. I do that because Mr Bonner is an old friend, as well as a colleague, of mine. He worked very closely with me when I was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and, indeed, on behalf of the then Government made the second reading speech to the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) legislation when it was brought into the Senate. He worked closely with another of my colleagues Senator Peter Baume when he was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. I just want to say in response to Mr Bonner that the very deep concerns felt by both Senator Peter Baume and me are no different from the sorts of concerns we shared with Mr Bonner when we were in parliament together.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a balance to the views of Mr Bonner I simply wish to refer the Senate to the views expressed by Ms Pat O'Shane, who is a former Secretary to the New South Wales Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs and a person with whom I had dealings when I was the Commonwealth Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. I would say from those dealings that no-one could say that Ms Pat O'Shane was some Liberal or National Party stooge. She was a person of vigorous independence. She often put forward opinions that were highly critical of the governments of that time. I believe that the criticisms which she has made on both radio and television in recent days bear out the concerns of the Opposition. I do not wish to quote her at length but I simply remind the Senate that following the interview on the AM program of 1 November with Senator Grant Tambling, the Country-Liberal Party senator from the Northern Territory who has been raising many of these matters, Ms Pat O'Shane was interviewed and was very forthright in her comments in support of a general inquiry into Aboriginal affairs. She said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . in my opinion, my view, it's very much overdue. There have been numerous allegations over some considerable years now about the financial management of the Aboriginal Development Commission and in more recent years, there's been the Department of Aboriginal Affairs.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wish to repeat what she said a little later, in fairness to the people who were involved in Aboriginal affairs. She said:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . let me emphasise first of all that the majority of Aborigines, like the majority of any people, are decent, honest people. Secondly, that in an organisation such as that, just like in any other similar non-Aboriginal organisation, there is going to be a level of corruption.
       </para>
       <para>
        I support her general affirmation about the majority of Aborigines being decent, honest people and that is certainly my personal experience of them. The point is that, as Ms Pat O'Shane pointed out, there can also be corruption, and it is certainly the object of this Opposition to ensure that in this organisation, as in any organisation, those matters are properly dealt with. I thought it was interesting to note that when the interviewer put to her that Mr Perkins had denied all the allegations about the Aboriginal Development Commission she gave, I think, what is commonly the `Mandy Rice-Davies response'. When somebody had denied something Mandy Rice-Davies was reported as saying, `Well, he would, wouldn't he?'. I noted that in response to the question, `Mr Perkins has denied all the allegations, hasn't he?', Ms O'Shane said, `Well, I mean, it's in his interests to do so, isn't it?'. I was struck by that coincidence of expression.
       </para>
       <para>
        In a television interview the next day on The World Tonight, Ms Pat O'Shane was very forthright about the fact that allegations have been around for a long time and she referred to the fact that there is a power struggle going on within Aboriginal Affairs. It is important to acknowledge that because it provides some of the context within which I wish to make some comments. She made the point that it is not just a matter of a power struggle; that allegations of corruption and so on have been around for many years and anyone who has an interest in this matter might find her remarks on television-which are available in transcript to any of the honourable senators who are interested-very interesting indeed. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, was recorded in the same interview as saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        I'm charging ahead with ATSIC and I'll crash through or crash.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that is a very unhealthy and silly attitude for the Minister to be taking. I think that this is an area of real difficulty and the Minister should not be talking about crashing through or crashing. I think he should be standing back and trying to sort out what will work and what is a sensible way to proceed. I say to the Minister that I do not believe that this Senate will permit him to `crash through'. The Senate will expect the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) legislation to be fully and properly scrutinised and the concerns which have been raised in the Estimates Committee and in the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs to be fully and properly dealt with.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn now to the additional matter of concern which I wish to put before the Senate because I wish to prevent any opportunity for abuse developing-perhaps I should say `for further abuse'. It seems pretty clear that a pattern of behaviour has now emerged in Aboriginal affairs. That pattern of behaviour involves both the Minister and the permanent head of the Department. It seems that those who support ATSIC will be given favourable treatment and it appears on the evidence that I wish to cite in a moment that there is a preparedness to break the rules to advance the pro-ATSIC position. On the other hand, those Aboriginal people who choose to oppose ATSIC and who believe that this is the wrong way to proceed, are subjected to pressure and may even be sacked because of their opposition. The harshest critic of Aboriginal administration under the Fraser Government would not be able to find any evidence of that sort of behaviour. The previous Government was prepared to allow Aboriginal opinion of a very diverse sort to be freely aired, with the solitary exception that public servants were expected, in general, to maintain normal Public Service rules.
       </para>
       <para>
        But Mr Perkins at times went beyond that. That was a matter of difficulty for the Fraser Government. I acknowledge that. In general, I think it would be fair to say that when one looks at the record particularly with respect to the advisory bodies-the National Aboriginal Conference and so on-and the dealings between Ministers and Aboriginals, often highly critical of the government of the day, any suggestion that we sought to influence, suppress or whatever simply did not occur. I believe that we now come to the concerns that I am expressing with clean hands.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have been given reasons, we believe quite phoney reasons, for the sacking of the eight Aboriginal Development Commission commissioners. The Minister said that he sacked them to enable financial management of the ADC to be tightened. But in fact the new commissioners have, in our view, set aside the more careful financial arrangements that were being implemented and have embarked on some new quite irresponsible acts, some of which have been raised in questions and certainly some have been raised in estimates committees. There was evidence brought forward yesterday by Senator Peter Baume which suggested that the Minister himself urged on the Commission consideration of actions which were quite irresponsible and certainly were the reverse of tightening up the Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        The specific concerns that I have today, and which I think have not been previously aired in debate in this place, relate to answers and evidence given to Senate Estimates Committee E in relation to the appearance before the Senate Select Committee of three pro-ATSIC witnesses who were flown to Canberra at public expense. This matter was first raised on Tuesday, 25 October, when the Minister answered on advice from Mr Perkins that no departmental funds had been committed to bring witnesses to Canberra.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to refer to the specific Hansard account of that. In that we find that Senator Tate, who was I am told advised by Mr Perkins in giving this response, answered in response to a question from Senator Tambling that to the best of the officers, knowledge funds had not been committed. That is in fact not true. The fact of the matter is that three witnesses appeared before the Select Committee. They gave evidence which is contained in the Hansard of the Estimates Committee and there was a follow-up indeed to the question asked by Senator Tambling by Senator Collins in the Estimates hearing on 26 October. We find Senator Collins raising a question in these terms:
       </para>
       <para>
        I have a question for Mr Perkins which relates to some information that he gave the Committee yesterday responding to a question from, I think, Senator Tambling.
       </para>
       <para>
        He paraphrased it in these terms:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . did the Department of Aboriginal Affairs pay the expenses of any witnesses who appeared before the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. The answer to that question was no. The reason I want to ask Mr Perkins the question is that I am a member of that Committee and there were three witnesses, Mr Ray Robinson, Darby McCarthy-I think his correct name is Richard McCarthy-and Norman Johnson, who appeared before our Committee in Canberra. This may well be where the confusion lies.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that Senator Collins, whom I have accused of some fancy footwork in the Senate before, seemed to be giving Mr Perkins a chance to get off the hook here. Senator Collins said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The reason I raise the question is this: I spoke to Mr Robinson about the evidence he gave to the Committee because I was curious as to why these three witnesses had appeared before us in Canberra when the Committee was going to Queensland. In fact, it is in Queensland at this moment. I actually said to `Sugar' Ray Robinson that I was curious about why they had actually come to Canberra and were giving evidence before the Committee when they knew the Committee was to go to Queensland and we could have taken evidence from them there. He did tell me, although there was not time to go into it in detail, that they had come to Canberra not for that reason but that they had simply taken the opportunity to appear before the Committee while they were there. What I want to ask the Secretary to the Department is this: Were the expenses of the three people that I have named paid for by the Department, and what was the major purpose of their visit to Canberra on that occasion?
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Perkins replied:
       </para>
       <para>
        The major purpose was sport.
       </para>
       <para>
        He went on to give a quite lengthy explanation about the importance of these people to sport administration and what the concerns with respect to sport were. I do not have time to quote that answer in full. Senator Collins then said:
       </para>
       <para>
        So you can confirm Mr Robinson's advice to me that the primary reason for being in Canberra at that time had to do with consultations with you on sporting matters and was not related primarily to giving evidence to the ATSIC select committee?
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Perkins replied:
       </para>
       <para>
        Consultations on sport.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is important to note the content of Senator Collins's question:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . confirm Mr Robinson's advice to me that the primary reason for being in Canberra at that time . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        That is, the reason it justified the expenditure of public moneys to bring these people to Canberra. I do not have time to talk about these three witnesses, but it is clear that they gave very substantial pro-ATSIC evidence and it becomes clear that one of them, Mr Johnson, is a departmental officer who told Senator Coulter that he would be the ATSIC regional manager in Cairns. Mr McCarthy has been employed as an ATSIC consultant. Some of Mr Robinson's history is set out in the record of the Select Committee and the transcript of the Estimates Committee.

         —Yes, I do not intend to say very much about that at all. But the point that I want to make today-and I think it is an extremely important point-is that, on what we know of the visit of these three men to Canberra, it is simply not credible that the primary purpose of their visit was to discuss sport. The fact of the matter is that Senator Coulter, the Australian Democrats senator, has-I do not know whether intentionally or not-put on the public record his contact with these gentlemen. He wrote to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand. Whether that was intended to be a public document or not, I do not know, but I do know that the Minister chose to publish that letter from Senator Coulter. (Extension of time granted)
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Senator Coulter in his letter to the Minister-as I say, this letter was published, as I understand it, not by Senator Coulter but by the Minister who was the recipient of it-dated 2 November 1988, said this:
       </para>
       <para>
        I am personally concerned that it now appears that DAA provided funding for travel for three prominent Queensland Aboriginal people to come to Canberra precisely at the time the Senate Committee Inquiry into ATSIC was taking evidence. All three were, and presumably still are, strongly in favour of ATSIC. I know it was said they were funded to attend a sport meeting in Canberra. All three contacted me in Canberra late the day before they appeared before the Committee, told me they had just arrived and were going back next afternoon at 4 p.m. All next day they were in Parliament House. I have great difficulty accepting the assertion they were funded to attend a sport related meeting in Canberra. It does not look good that someone who may be in line to take the top job in ATSIC may have had a hand in attempting to distort the Senate Committee perception of the strength of support for ATSIC.
       </para>
       <para>
        That succinctly puts the basic concerns that we have in this matter. I am pleased to have, in support of the concerns which are felt by the Opposition, the concerns of Senator Coulter, the Australian Democrat who represents his Party in Aboriginal affairs matters and who is a member of the Select Committee. On the evidence which is available to us, the substantial time spent in Canberra by these men was spent on the ATSIC matter. I do not care if there may have been some nominal consultations. I want to raise this matter today because I do not want any attempt to gild the lily, to alter the record of these men's visit to Canberra.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the evidence which is available to us at the moment, it appears quite clear that the substantial purpose of their visit was this ATSIC proposal and a weighting of the evidence on this critical and difficult issue the way Mr Perkins and the Minister wanted the evidence to be. It is a serious matter. I raise it on the public record because, as I said in an earlier debate in this place, people play it very hard in Aboriginal Affairs. There are some hard men. I agree with the comments of Ms Pat O'Shane. Most Aboriginal people are very straightforward and honest. I have enormous respect for them, but I do not believe it is deniable that there are also some hard games played. I believe that it is absolutely obligatory on this chamber and on this Parliament to ensure that, in determining the shape of Aboriginal administration, we get the message straight and the facts straight and the hard games do not distort what is before us.
       </para>
       <para>
        We do not believe that there is evidence of any real or meaningful consultations with the Secretary on these matters. There may have been some discussions. The records tell us that the Secretary authorised the funds for travel. They were departmental funds, public funds. We therefore believe that the answer given by Senator Tate was not accurate. The Parliament was effectively misled. It is a serious matter. I want it to be on the public record early because it is very important that there be no distortion of the facts in this area. In what is a most difficult matter, I ask the Senate to take note of the matters to which I have drawn its attention. The record in this area is such as to give rise to very considerable concern in the Opposition that an attempt was made, using public funds, to obtain a weighting of the views before the Select Committee.

        Concessional deductions for income-producing plant
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        In accordance with the May Economic Statement, the Bill will terminate most of the special deductions in the income tax law for income-producing plant.
       </para>
       <para>
        These are-
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) the general 5/3 accelerated depreciation allowances;
       </para>
       <para>
        (b) certain five year depreciation arrange- ments for primary production plant and structural improvements; and
       </para>
       <para>
        (c) the special write-offs for expenditure on general mining or petroleum mining plant, other than exploration or prospecting plant.
       </para>
       <para>
        Plant to which these concessions currently apply will in future be written-off at effective life rates, increased by a 20 per cent loading for most plant as an incentive to investment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Effective life rates, are determined by the Commissioner of Taxation and a definition of ``effective life'' is to be developed for inclusion in a subsequent Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        The present Bill will also require taxpayers who wish to use the prime cost method of depreciation to elect to do so in the first year in which the relevant plant is used.
       </para>
       <para>
        These changes are estimated to produce revenue savings of $190m in 1989-90, $450m in 1990-91 and $1030m in 1991-92, rising further for a few years then settling at an annual gain of around $1 1/4 billion in the mid to late 1990s.
       </para>
       <para>
        Expenditure paid in advance
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The general deductions provisions of the income tax law authorises a deduction in the year in which expenditure is incurred even where the services being paid for are provided over several years.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the other hand, the person providing the services may generally bring the income to account in the year in which the services are provided and this imbalance provides tax shelter opportunities.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill will change the timing of deductions for expenditure paid in advance under agreements entered into after 25 May 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        Instead of being fully deductable when incurred, deductions for the expenditure will be pro rated over the period during which the services will be provided, with a maximum period of 10 years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Immediate deductability will continue to be available if all the services will be provided within 13 months of incurring the expenditure; if the expenditure is less than $1,000; or if it is required by order of a court of by law, or is in respect of salary or wages.
       </para>
       <para>
        Transitional provisions will ensure that the amendments apply prospectively.
       </para>
       <para>
        The revenue savings from this measure are estimated to be $35m in 1989-90 and $20m in subsequent years.

        Dividends paid by tax-exempt entities
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Two measures announced in the May Economic Statement to prevent abuse of the intercorporate dividend rebate provisions will be given effect by this Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the first, certain tax-exempt entities will be discouraged from using innovative financing techniques by which investors receive a return on their investment in the form of tax free dividends rather than as taxable interest receipts.
       </para>
       <para>
        Denial of the rebate on dividends paid by relevant tax-exempt entities removes the distortion in the tax position of investors who would otherwise obtain unintended financial benefits at the expense of Commonwealth revenue.
       </para>
       <para>
        Dividends received by private companies
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Other intercorporate dividend rebate changes will deny the rebate on unfranked dividend income received by private companies.
       </para>
       <para>
        These private companies will accrue franking credits that can be used to frank dividends passed on to their shareholders.
       </para>
       <para>
        This removes the tax deferral advantage of receiving unfranked dividends through a private company and leaves the ultimate individual shareholders in the same position as if the dividends had been received directly.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unfranked dividends that pass from one company to another within a wholly-owned company group will not be subject to the measure, nor will dividends paid under the arrangements for the phasing-out of Division 7 undistributed profits tax which are required to be unfranked.
       </para>
       <para>
        These changes will apply to unfranked dividends paid after 25 May 1988, unless the dividends were declared on or before that date.

        Abolition of section 26aaa
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill gives effect to the proposal announced on 25 May 1988 to abolish the provision which taxes profits made on the sale of property within 12 months of purchase, leaving those gains to be taxed under the general capital gains and capital losses provisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        Gains arising from short term property sales will qualify for the five year notional averaging of liabilities under the capital gains provisions and may be offset against allowable capital losses.
       </para>
       <para>
        This amendment will apply to sales of property after 25 May 1988 and is expected to have a revenue cost of $5 million in 1988-89 and $30 million in 1989-90.
       </para>

        Mains electricity connections
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Capital expenditure in connecting mains electricity facilities to a property on which a business is carried on is to be deductable over 10 years instead of in the year in which it is incurred.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendments will apply to expenditure incurred after 25 May 1988, but will not apply to expenditure incurred under a contract entered into on or before that date.
       </para>
       <para>
        The expected annual revenue saving from the measure in 1989-90 and subsequent years is $5m.

        Valuation of natural increase in live stock
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The value of live stock on hand at the end of a year of income is generally brought to account, at the option of the taxpayer, at either cost price or market value.
       </para>
       <para>
        Where cost price method is adopted, the law permits the taxpayer to select a cost price for natural increase which, for a class of live stock, may not be less than the minimum cost price prescribed in respect of live stock of that class.
       </para>
       <para>
        The minimum values prescribed are substantially outdated and the Treasurer announced in the May Economic Statement that the values are to be increased for natural increase occurring after 30 June 1988, but to a level that is still less than any reasonable estimate of the cost of natural increase.
       </para>
       <para>
        A taxpayer who can demonstrate that the actual cost of producing natural increase is less than the relevant new prescribed value will be permitted to value the natural increase at actual cost.
       </para>
       <para>
        This change will have minimal effect on revenue.

        Pensioner rebate
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill will increase the maximum pensioner rebate from $250-or $308 for service pensioners-to $430 for both social security and service pensioners.
       </para>
       <para>
        It will also increase the taxable income level above which the pensioner rebate begins to shade-out from $6,142-or $6,384 for service pensioners-to $6,892 for both classes.
       </para>
       <para>
        These changes, which will have effect for 1988-89 and subsequent years, are estimated to cost $55m in 1988-89 and $210m in 1989-90.
       </para>

        Beneficiary rebate
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The maximum rebates of tax for other social security beneficiaries and certain recipients of allowances under Commonwealth educational schemes, and the levels at which the rebates begin to shade-out, are to be increased for the 1988-89 and subsequent income years.
       </para>
       <para>
        For married taxpayers the maximum rebate will increase from $430 to $600, with no tax payable on taxable incomes up to $11,059.
       </para>
       <para>
        For other taxpayers the maximum rebate will increase from $180 to $260, with no tax payable on taxable incomes up to $6,184.
       </para>
       <para>
        These measures are estimated to cost $20m in 1988-89 and subsequent years.

        Special temporary allowances
       </para>
       <para>

        Amendments will also be made by the Bill to give effect to the 1988-89 Budget proposal to exempt from income tax the special temporary allowance payable for a period of 12 weeks to a surviving social security or service pensioner following the death of his or her pensioner spouse.
       </para>
       <para>
        This change will apply for 1988-89 and subsequent years and will have a negligible revenue cost in 1988-89 and cost $5m in 1989-90 and $6m in 1990-91.

        Provisional tax for 1988-89
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Provisional tax is that part of the pay-as-you-earn system designed to collect tax on non-salary or wage income within the year in which the income is derived.
       </para>
       <para>
        As such, it is generally accepted that the amount of provisional tax charged should approximate as closely as practicable the amount of tax actually imposed for the year.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill provides for 1988-89 provisional tax to be calculated on the basis of 1987-88 taxable income increased by 12 per cent, and by applying the 1988-89 rates of tax and medicare levy, and the increased low income thresholds for medicare levy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Generally, rebates and credits will be allowed in the provisional tax calculation at the levels allowed in 1987-88 assessments but rebates of tax allowed on franked dividends will be the 1987-88 rebates increased by 12 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        Taxpayers who estimate that their taxable income for 1988-89 will increase by less than 12 per cent, or who consider that their rebates or credits will be at a higher level, will continue to have the right to `self assess' and have the provisional tax for 1988-89 recalculated on the basis of their own estimates.

        Non-cash business benefits
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill will also implement, subject to some minor variations, the proposal which was announced on 4 February 1985 to tax non-cash business benefits, but delayed because of the priority given to major tax reform measures.
       </para>
       <para>
        This measure will address practices that became more prevalent following the full Federal Court's decision that the existing law taxes non-cash business benefits only if such benefits are convertible to cash and are in the nature of income according to ordinary concepts.
       </para>
       <para>
        There had also been an increase in the provision of non-cash benefits to induce business taxpayers to purchase items of plant or equipment.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was originally announced that the law would be amended to tax the arm's length value of non-cash business benefits, subject to certain special rules.
       </para>
       <para>
        On review a more satisfactory approach is to provide separate simple rules to deal with both these practices.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill will tax non-convertible benefits provided after 5 February 1985 in the same way as benefits that are convertible into cash and which are taxable under the existing law if they are of an income nature.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, the existing rules that apply to the taxation of convertible benefits will be extended to non-convertible benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        To ensure that there can be no element of retrospectivity in this revised approach, the Bill contains transitional provisions that will allow benefits provided on or before today to be taxed on the announced basis.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the case of non-cash benefits provided to induce business taxpayers to purchase items of plant or equipment or to enter into service agreements, the amendments will simply treat the portion of the expenditure that represents the arm's length value of the benefit provided as having been incurred in respect of the benefit.
       </para>
       <para>
        This will ensure that the expenditure relating to the benefit will not be deductable or form part of the cost of a depreciable unit of property.
       </para>
       <para>
        This approach, which varies the announcement, will apply only to benefits provided after 31 August 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        Corporate Restructure (Debt Creation) Rules
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill will insert in the income tax law rules foreshadowed by the Treasurer on 30 April 1987 against arrangements under which interest-bearing debt is introduced to finance the restructuring of related foreign controlled companies.
       </para>
       <para>
        The measures will deny interest deductions on debt used to fund the transfer of assets from one related company to another where the buyer and seller are at least 50 per cent controlled by a non-resident or related non-residents, except where there has been an introduction of additional income producing assets.
       </para>
       <para>
        The new rules will replace administrative measures that had previously been imposed as a condition for approval of investments under foreign investment policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        While the amendments will generally apply from 1 July 1987, under transitional arrangements in the Bill, companies that are less than 100 per cent foreign controlled will not be subject to the legislation on restructures carried out between 1 July 1987 and 19 June 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        As part of its consultative approach to new and complex tax legislation, the Government released a draft of the main operative provisions of this legislation on 20 June 1988 and called for comment from interested persons.
       </para>
       <para>
        This initiative was well received and, in conjunction with the seminars sponsored by the Taxation Institute of Australia, has resulted in constructive submissions being made by members of the accounting and legal professions and by industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        A number of changes recommended in these submissions have been adopted so that the measures will not intrude unnecessarily into the normal trading activities of foreign controlled companies.
       </para>
       <para>
        For example, although the earlier draft legislation was to have a 15 per cent foreign control threshold, the Government has agreed to increase the level to 50 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The legislation is limited to corporate restructures, but the Government will quickly respond if evidence emerges of entities other than companies being used to circumvent the provisions now being introduced.

        Other income tax measures
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Other income tax changes being implemented by this Bill will have negligible revenue effect.
       </para>
       <para>
        One extends for the 1987-88 and subsequent income years the range of business activities that may be conducted by a public unit trust, without it being treated as a public trading trust and therefore taxed as a company.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another eases the paperwork burden relating to claims for car expenses, by permitting certain information about car expenses to be specified in records to be retained by taxpayers, rather than in their income tax returns.

       <para>
        Effect is also being given to the Treasurer's announcement on 29 October 1986 that the fringe benefits tax law would be amended to allow employers in Australia's remote areas to amortise the taxable value of certain fringe benefits provided under remote area home ownership schemes.
       </para>
       <para>
        Subject to a seven-year maximum, the value of the benefit may be spread over the period running from the date the benefit was initially provided until the employee is free to transfer the property on the open market.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other amendments will extend the scope of the existing remote area concessions in certain other respects.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendments will apply with effect from commencement of the fringe benefits tax legislation on 1 July 1986, and are expected to cost less than $1m per annum.

        INCOME TAX AMENDMENT BILL 1988
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill will amend the Income Tax Act 1986 to formally impose the rates of income tax payable by individuals and trustees generally for the 1988-89 and 1989-90 financial years.
       </para>
       <para>
        It will also impose for the same period the rates of tax payable by companies, registered organisations and unit trusts treated as companies.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, it will impose rates of tax on superannuation funds, ineligible approved deposit funds and certain other trusts.
       </para>
       <para>
        The rates to be imposed by the measures in this Bill are those declared in the Income Tax Rates Act 1986.
       </para>
       <para>
        The personal rates for 1988-89 remain unchanged but, as announced by the Treasurer in the 1988-89 Budget Speech, reductions will be effected from 1 July 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        A four-step tax scale currently applies.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the lower end of the scale for resident taxpayers, no tax is payable on taxable incomes up to $5,100. On taxable incomes in the range $5,101 to $12,600 the rate is 24 per cent. In the range $12,601 to $19,500 the rate is 29 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        For income in the range $19,501 to $35,000 the rate is 40 per cent, and the top marginal rate is 49 per cent for income in excess of $35,000.
       </para>
       <para>
        These general rates also apply to non-residents who receive Australian social security and repatriation pensions that are taxable in Australia, or who were residents at any time during the income year.
       </para>
       <para>
        For all other non-resident taxpayers, the rate of 29 per cent applies to incomes up to $19,500 and the general rates apply to income above that level.
       </para>
       <para>
        For 1988-89 a rate of 49 per cent applies to all unearned income of resident minors, subject to shading-in arrangements for such income just over $416.
       </para>
       <para>
        The rate of tax on trustees assessed under section 99a of the Income Tax Assessment Act, and on other categories of income subject to anti-avoidance provisions of that Act, is 49 per cent in 1988-89.
       </para>
       <para>
        The company tax rate payable in respect of 1987-88 income will remain at 49 per cent. As announced in the May 1988 Economic Statement, a lower rate of 39 per cent will apply to 1988-89 income.
       </para>
       <para>
        The rates of tax, payable in respect of 1987-88 income, for unit trusts treated as companies and registered organisations will remain at 49 per cent and 20 per cent respectively.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, when decisions are taken as to the reduced personal tax rates to apply in 1989-90 and any other tax rate changes, legislation amending the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 which declares the various income tax rates that I have just outlined for 1988-89 will be put before the Parliament.
       </para>

        MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT BILL 1988
       </para>
       <para>
        The Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1988 will amend the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to impose the basic rate of Medicare Levy for 1988-89 and 1989-90.
       </para>
       <para>
        The basic rate of the levy will remain at 1.25 per cent of taxable income.
       </para>
       <para>
        That has been the rate since 1 December 1986.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also contains increases in the income threshold levels below which people with low incomes will not be called on to pay any levy.
       </para>
       <para>
        For 1988-89 and 1989-90, individuals with taxable incomes of up to $9,560, and married couples and sole parents with family incomes of up to $16,110, will not be required to pay the levy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The income threshold for married couples and sole parents will increase by a further $2,100 for each dependent child or student.
       </para>
       <para>

       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to return to that last point later in my remarks, because it is the major concern of the Opposition with regard to the Bills before us.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Income Tax Amendment Bill 1988 sets down the rates of tax which are to apply for the coming financial year. It extends the rates which were set down in the equivalent 1986 legislation. As the Senate knows, this is an annual process and needs to be carried out each financial year. The rates are exactly the same as those which were applied by this Government in 1986. Since 1986, this Government, because of the effects of so-called bracket creep, and without any change whatsoever to income tax brackets, has reefed in $2,000m to $3,000m from taxpayers, without having returned that to them in the way of tax cuts. This has happened because people's incomes have risen and they have moved into higher tax brackets, causing them effectively to pay higher rates of tax and consequently losing a greater proportion of their income in payments to the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        The taxpayers were promised all kinds of benefits if they were prepared to restrain themselves. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) have promised tax cuts which are to materialise next year. We await those tax cuts with bated breath. But economic events, and statements in the Parliament and in other places by the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, Senator Button and Senator Walsh, all tend to indicate that the tax cuts which people expect some time next year-to be handed down just before the next election-may not materialise. The Government is surely on about some kind of election strategy here. We know that the Government aims to go to an election towards the end of 1989. It was significant that in the May economic statement the Treasurer, Mr Keating, announced that there would be tax cuts, applicable from 1 July next year-in other words, some three months before the people would have to go to an election. Obviously, it is a con trick, an attempt to buy votes through tax cuts given immediately before the next election.
       </para>
       <para>
        Now Senator Walsh has said that tax cuts cannot be achieved without more spending cuts on the part of this Government. That is notwithstanding the huge surplus which the Government has in this financial year's Budget. That is a proper way to go, but what it means is that the Government is in no easy position to grant the tax cuts which we were all led to believe some months ago were quite easily achievable by the Treasurer with some kind of magic wand. The need for tax cuts is there. Notwithstanding Senator Walsh's statistical abstractions about what really measures living standards in this country, people are hurting because of the Government's economic and tax policies. Real incomes have fallen significantly. People's incomes have dropped, on average, $56 a week in real terms since the Fraser Government left office in 1983. In other words, under the Hawke-Keating Administration people have lost effectively out of their pockets at least $56 a week. That has happened by a combination of rising prices, heavier taxation and, of course, the effects of higher interest rates on mortgages and on the cost of housing generally.
       </para>
       <para>
        Only a week or so ago we saw the consumer price index figures come out from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. They demonstrated that inflation in this country is again on the increase. This is chiefly due to the increase in the price of housing, as a result of interest rates and the way that affects mortgage payments, higher rentals and, of course, the higher cost of purchasing a house in the first place. All that is impacting very heavily on the average family man and is having a tremendous impact on his standard of living and that of his family. That is happening right across the board. To put it simply, under this Government incomes in Australia are simply not rising as fast as are living expenses or taxation. People are finding it more and more difficult to exist.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of our amendments is to the motion for the second reading of the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill. We all know what a very dangerous and difficult position Medicare is in in the way that it is restricting people's access to proper health care in this country at present. This Bill imposes a Medicare levy of 1 1/4 per cent of taxable income of eligible taxpayers. By that amendment we again draw attention to the rising cost of Medicare; how this Government appears to have absolutely no strategy to try to improve the standards of health care in this country for Australians; and how that is hurting people in Australia with particular problems such as the need for elective surgery.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn now to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3). Generally speaking, this Bill covers multitudinous concerns briefly described as instituting some roll-over relief from the effects of the capital gains tax which was introduced by the Government back in September 1985. During the debates on the capital gains tax when it was initially introduced-those debates occurred in the middle of 1986-the Liberal and National parties drew to the attention of the Government and the people of Australia the multitudinous anomalies, difficulties and errors in the drafting of that legislation. Of course, these have been continually brought to the eye of the public and of practitioners in the taxation field over the last 2 1/2 years, indicating that some parts of the law are totally and utterly unintelligible to ordinary human beings. The interpretation of that law is very much in the hands of the Commissioner of Taxation, given his tremendous powers of discretion and by effective legislation through his income tax ruling system. That has been partially cleared up by virtue of these many amendments set down in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) that we are debating.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, there is one area to which I wanted to draw the attention of the Senate which needs specific consideration by the Government in the course of debate in the committee stage and about which I understand the Australian Democrats will be moving an amendment. We will certainly consider favourably any amendment that they put forward after we have seen it but I understand that it will fit very much the set of circumstances which are of concern to us. This matter relates to the conversion of crown lease property to freehold property by those who have been holding crown leases for some time. Many taxpayers and many members on both sides of the House of Representatives have welcomed the Government's approach to this. It is to grant roll-over relief from capital gains tax where conversion has occurred from crown lease to freehold. However, there is a difficulty in so far as it obviously does not go far enough to cover the situation where there is some surrender of a crown lease and the adoption of a freehold title to property which may not cover exactly the same property that was the subject of the crown lease. This, of course, is usually at the behest of the State government which holds the crown lease. Therefore, it has an element of compulsion to it. By the terms of the law in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3), the roll-over relief would not be granted as many members on the Labor side of the House of Representatives apparently thought it would. Therefore, any amendment to fix up that situation we believe would be very beneficial. We will be considering favourably the Democrats' amendment on that matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1988 covers a multitude of matters which are of more direct relevance to ordinary taxpayers. First, I would like to mention what is known as the provisional tax uplift factor. Incorporated in this Bill is an increase-this was announced in the Budget-in taxation being applied to provisional incomes this financial year of 12 per cent. That has been raised from the 11 per cent that applied last financial year. Back in the days of the Fraser Government this uplift factor, as it is called, was increased in line with the current rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer price index. Now the Government has gone one better. With the inflation rate running at around 7 1/2 per cent to 8 per cent, it has now incorporated in the provisional tax uplift factor an additional element to cover real growth in the economy. So that is how it has arrived at a 12 per cent factor. That is imposed irrespective of the incomes of people being subject to change. There are many people on fixed incomes who will be unduly penalised as a result of that uplift factor being applied. It is true that there is relief available. People can apply to have that rate reduced. We also know that heavy penalties will be applied by the Commissioner of Taxation in the event of that being not got absolutely right. So the first point is that this is effectively a stealthy increase in taxation by this Government, by its going to the higher than expected level of increase in the provisional tax uplift factor which incorporates factors which under the previous coalition Government had not been applied.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second issue concerns the rebate of tax which will be applicable to age pension recipients in the future. We all know that many pensioners are now suffering taxation on the little bit of extra income they earn over and above the pensions they receive. The Bill includes an amendment to extend the pensioner rebate to a somewhat higher figure in the current financial year. That will have no real impact on taxpayers until the early part of the next financial year when they lodge their taxation returns and therefore save on the tax that they would otherwise pay. The point I want to draw to the Senate's attention is that that amount of extra income which people can earn over and above their pension without its being affected by taxation was just under $1,000 back in the 1983 financial year, the last year of the Fraser Government. People could earn nearly $20 a week without any taxation being applied to it at all. However, in the current financial year under the Hawke-Keating Government the amount which one can earn without having to pay tax has fallen in dollar terms by half; that is, people can now earn only $10 a week over and above their pension and not be subject to tax. Of course, in real terms it is even lower than that. It is probably as little as $5 a week if we take into account inflation. That means that people are suffering as a result of the policy of this Government in that area.
       </para>
       <para>
        I point out that I have had a very successful period of negotiations with the Treasurer, Mr Keating, in relation to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) concerning proposed new section 21a of the Income Tax Assessment Act as set down in clause 13 of the Bill. This is the most controversial area of the whole Bill and covers, in a retrospective way, non-cash benefits payable to people by employers. The amendment proposed by the Government in this Bill is, as I say, retrospective not just for a few months, a year or two years, but for 3 1/2 years back to 4 February 1985. That was the day on which the Treasurer put out a press statement saying that from that date he was going to apply taxation to non-monetary benefits received by business taxpayers. That is all very well, but that was three and a half years ago, and during all that time people have had no detailed legislation to examine, to understand and to apply to their particular circumstances. It means that the law has been totally in a vacuum over that period of time. People have been incurring liabilities without knowing it, because the Treasurer's press statement did not spell out in sufficient detail exactly how the law was going to be applied. That has particular application in many different situations, which we will come to during the debate in the committee stage of the legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        I can instance one or two cases where people who are in receipt of some form of non-cash benefits would be caught as an unintended consequence of this legislation. Take, for instance, the situation where a garage proprietor receives the benefit of low interest loans from an oil company during the setting up period of his business. Under the terms of the Bill as they are presently set down, and before any amendments are introduced by the Government, that garage proprietor would be suffering heavy taxation on that amount, not just from the date when the legislation receives assent, but back to 4 February 1985. During that time he has not known that he was incurring any liability.
       </para>
       <para>
        The point that has to be made is simply this: within clause 13 there is the most insidious application of retrospectivity that I have witnessed during my time in the Parliament. We have a situation where the Government announced by press release in the most vague terms something that might be called an anti-avoidance device. The use of a press release to foreshadow future legislation is recognised as being an appropriate use. But in looking at the Bill that we now have before us, in its unamended form, we see that it goes much further than was ever suggested in the Treasurer's press release. In fact, the sorts of people that I have just mentioned would be caught by the legislation and it would wreak havoc in the business community, far more than we would have understood by the Treasurer's press release.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the most significant examples of where people would be caught by this legislation is the example that has received some publicity. I refer to those ladies who earn a little extra money by selling Avon cosmetic products door to door and who do, on occasions, receive some form of prize, such as saucepans, coffee mugs or coasters. They are of minimal value but they would be taxed in the kind of situation that is included in this Bill. Quite apart from the stupidity of trying to value what such things are worth, we have the nonsense situation where Avon ladies, Tupperware salespersons and other people in that sort of situation who receive very low incomes, would find themselves incurring taxation back to 4 February 1985 on any of the goods which they have received.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is why the Liberal and National parties will be moving at the committee stage to remove from the legislation any retrospectivity to February 1985 when the fallacious press statement was released. We will be moving an amendment-I hope it has the support of the Australian Democrats-to ensure that the Bill has effect from 31 August 1988. I understand that the Government will not accept that amendment, and I understand its reasons for that. But in the House of Representatives it will have to come to terms with the Senate if it wants to see the legislation enacted at some later stage.
       </para>
       <para>
        What the Government is doing is totally wrong. It is wrong to apply the principle of legislation by press release for anti-avoidance measures in this way. This legislation is plainly retrospective and misleading. It will cause enormous concern to Australians if it is enacted in its unamended form. I also hope that the Government will move amendments at the committee stage in respect of certain definitional questions and wording in the Bill. I will not go into detail now but these matters will be discussed at great length during the committee stage of the legislation next week.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me make absolutely clear some of the problems that we see in clause 13 of the Bill. The definition of `arm's length value' which might be applied to any kind of prize or good that a person might receive on the side of earning any income as, say, an Avon cosmetics salesperson, is one for the connoisseur. Honourable senators will not believe this, but according to the Bill, the definition of `arm's length value' is, `The value of a transaction where people are dealing at arm's length'. This is incredible.

         —That is right; it is just amazing. Clause 13 does not contain a definition of what is a business relationship. The Government is very averse to trying to define what is a business relationship because it wants to allow its Commissioner of Taxation to run around freely with all the force of law, exercising his discretion which he has under taxation law, to define a business relationship in whatever way he sees fit. Therefore, the Government has not included in this Bill anything that defines closely what that relationship is. As a result, we can see all kinds of injustices being perpetrated on Australian taxpayers by virtue of the omission of that definition. But I will say more about that when we come to the committee stage of the legislation a little later in the piece.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        One or two other matters in this Bill are of very great concern. Firstly, the Bill seeks to deny taxation deductions for pre-paid expenditures. That, of course, was mentioned in the Treasurer's May economic statement. The Opposition wishes to draw to the Senate's attention the impact that this will have on all kinds of contractors, particularly transport contractors, earth-moving contractors, farmers and others who have entered into leasing arrangements for equipment over the last few years. Because of inflation, the value of second-hand machinery has increased significantly. When that value is taken into account in a trade-in for new machinery and there is an excess over what is called the residual value in a lease, that excess has been applied as a rental payment upfront when the new arrangement for the purchase of new machinery is entered into. Previously that was allowed as a tax deduction. That will not now be so allowable.
       </para>
       <para>
        This will place additional burden and great strain on the financial arrangements of people running transport rigs, earth-moving equipment and so on. It will be felt significantly in the years ahead and it will have a big impact on transport operators. We all know that these days they are under significant pressure because of the costs of fuel, competition in the market-place and numerous other factors. This will ensure that many of them go to the wall.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another matter I wish to mention in the brief moment or two remaining to me concerns the change in the depreciation law. The Government, scrooge-like, has wound back the system to a less generous regime for depreciation applying to plant, buildings and so on. That will apply from 25 May this year when the Treasurer announced the measure. Because of the difficulties that have occurred in applying this legislation, the legislation will have uneven impacts depending on the nature of the entity in which individuals engage in business. (Extension of time granted) I draw the Senate's attention to a situation that may arise when partners do not alter the ownership, in the real sense of the word, of the underlying property-whether it be plant and equipment or real estate-in a partnership. Partnerships alter their affairs and partners come and go, and they may represent only a very small fraction of the total change in ownership of the underlying property in the partnership. Because of the way clause 37 appears to have been drafted, any minor changes of the sort that I have just mentioned will be caught and consequently the new less liberal taxation regime for depreciation will apply thereafter; as a result the benefits of the old regime will have been lost to the continuing partners after the specified date-that is, 25 May 1988. That means that many professional partnerships which go through reconstitution of their structures almost on a day to day, week to week, month to month, basis will find-I am not talking about every firm, but it will occur across the whole spectrum of the Australian economy-their partnerships affected very greatly. The joint ownership of property other than in a strictly partnership arrangement will also be affected by this.
       </para>
       <para>
        The point at issue here is that in most cases there is a very minimal change in the proportion of the total value of the underlying property of a partnership from one set of partners to another. Yet, the full rigour of the Government's rather ungenerous approach in this area will be felt by individuals in partnerships. I hope that during the committee stage of the debate we will hear from the Minister about his intentions in this area. I understand that there are discretions available to the Government, through the Taxation Commissioner, to make decisions in favour of taxpayers. I hope that we can get the Minister's assurances that that will apply in those cases. Otherwise, we would be very interested in looking to possible amendments to the Bill to make sure that taxpayers are properly protected by the law, rather than leaving the matter to the Taxation Commissioner's discretion.
       </para>
       <para>
        In finalising my remarks on the Bills, I point out again the continuing confusion in the Government's ranks about whether or not taxes will be cut in the next financial year in the lead-up to the next election. At this point we understand-it is the only conclusion one can draw-that we have to listen to the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, who says that there will be no tax cuts without further cuts in expenditure. That means that we must go through another Budget process before we are likely to see tax cuts. It means a mini-Budget next May with further expenditure reductions. We know that the Government is in a great state of confusion over the general state of the economy, having failed to talk it up during the Budget process. The Budget now being seen to be in tatters, one can have no confidence at all that the Government will reach its objective of delivering tax cuts in the lead-up to the next election. We welcome the anomalies relief in respect of the capital gains tax and will be concentrating very heavily on the matters that I raised regarding the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) when we reach the committee stage of the Bill. I hope that when we debate that issue we will see some amendments, particularly to clause 13 of the Bill, emanating from the Government.

         —We are debating jointly the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4), the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3), the Income Tax Amendment Bill and the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill. The Bills once again reflect the Government's commitment to a thoroughgoing reform of Australia's tax system, a reform which is unprecedented in Australia's history and is long overdue following the blatant deterioration of the tax system under the previous Liberal Government. The Bills cover a wide range of issues and correct, by amendment, a number of anomalies in existing legislation. They refine the existing tax legislation and, in doing so, lead further towards the development of an efficient and fair tax system for Australia. The amendments include those to increase the pensioner rebate for this financial year, a very welcome move, and to alter the income threshold for the Medicare levy on an annual basis. The legislation provides amendments which are at the core of this Government's social justice strategy and, in the process, provides further assistance to those Australians in the greatest need.

       <para>
        I wish briefly to discuss some of the amendments in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) regarding the fringe benefits tax and the income tax substantiation requirements. I am pleased to note that one of the changes included in that legislation is the removal of the requirement to keep car logbooks on an ongoing basis. Under the previous substantiation rules there was a requirement to keep logbooks for the running of motor vehicles for protracted periods. That has now been relaxed, and I am sure that will be welcomed by those taxpayers affected. There is also general exemption from the fringe benefits tax for a range of minor benefits. Also of great interest are the increased concessions for remote area housing, as well as several other benefits. I am sure that the increased concessions in the tax treatment of remote area housing will go down very well in the remote outback areas of my State of South Australia, where a number of employees benefit from subsidised housing. I am sure that that further concession will be of great interest to them.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill, while not amending the basic structure or principles of the fringe benefits tax or the income tax substantiation rules, will significantly reduce the administrative burdens on taxpayers-for example, through there being a requirement for less paperwork. The passing by parliament of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) will also see the removal of the current five- or three-year accelerated depreciation provisions in the tax laws. It will replace those accelerated provisions with those which will introduce deductability based on the economic life of assets. Over and above that, there will be a loading of 20 per cent of value to encourage new investment. That approach is very important. It is vital to help to boost labour productivity and the competitiveness of Australian industry. Also, the scrapping of the accelerated depreciation over five or three years will help to remove current distortions in Australian investment behaviour. It will encourage future investment decisions to be made on the basis of the highest pre-tax rates of return on investments rather than on the basis of the availability or timing of particular tax concessions which apply. As a result, the tax system will no longer misallocate scarce resources by encouraging investment in longer living plant and equipment at the expense of short-lived assets.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those critics who argue that the removal of the five- or three-year accelerated depreciation allowance will reduce business investment are failing to consider the Government's whole package of measures of tax reform in this area. Those critics who make those claims are simply evaluating individual tax changes in isolation from the overall thrust of the tax measures in general. For example, the removal of the five- or three-year depreciation allowance cannot be considered in isolation from the substantial reduction in company tax rates which was announced last May in the Government's economic statement to Parliament. That cut in the general company tax rate from 49c in the dollar to 39c in the dollar should be associated with far more new investment than any reduction in investment resulting from the removal of the accelerated depreciation provisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The lowering of the company tax rate to 39c in the dollar, in revenue terms, could not have occurred without the removal of the accelerated depreciation allowance. Over the next three financial years it is the Government's estimate that the revenue saving from those two measures combined will total $1,700m-a very significant revenue saving, and one which is vitally important to the general revenues of the Commonwealth and, of course, to the development of the Budget surplus.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the most important social welfare measures contained in this package of Bills is the lifting of the pensioner taxation rebate. Previously, pensioners received a rebate-which is, in effect, a tax credit; it is not a rebate that they get at the end of a financial year-of $250. That has been increased to $430 in this financial year, coming into effect from 1 July last. As a result of that measure those pensioners who are wholly or substantially dependent on the pension will not pay income tax. In endorsing that measure, I should say that I believe that the record of the Labor Government on pensions, and on the treatment of pensioners, is second to none in Australia, despite the rhetoric and the misinformation being put around the community. Certainly, we have not gone down the road that Mr Howard took when he was the Treasurer of this country. I well remember that, for a period of 12 months, he suspended indexation of pensions. We have provided on a regular basis for the cash level of pensions to be adjusted twice yearly for increases in the consumer price index. That is in stark contrast to the record of the Liberal Government. While its rhetoric is about improving pensions, its record in government has been totally different.
       </para>
       <para>
        The increase in the pensioner rebate to $430 in this financial year will mean that many more pensioners will be exempt from tax. In that last financial year pensioners were able to receive a tax-free income of $6,142 as a result of the previous $250 rebate, working in concert with the tax rate. In this financial year the figure has been increased enormously. Now, as a result of the rebate of $430, pensioners will be able to receive a tax exempt income of $6,892, which is a large increase. It must be compared with the level of tax exempt income which is available to the rest of the community. For example, members of the work force can earn a tax-exempt income of only $5,100, so the tax treatment of pensioners in that area clearly is a lot better than that of employed members of the community. While pensions are indexed every six months, in June and December-this increases the value of the pension because of price rises-these rises are not available to employed members of the community. As a result of the new pensioner rebate an age pensioner receiving $30 a week over and above his pension will save about $5.25 a week-quite a significant increase in his after-tax income.
       </para>
       <para>
        This pensioner tax rebate is a highly equitable tax measure. It is focused on the neediest persons, on those aged persons with the lowest total incomes. The rebate is phased out for those on higher incomes. Consequently, it is a very fair measure. The phase-out begins at a taxable income of $6,892. Pensioners with combined incomes of up to $10,331 still receive some part of that tax rebate, which has the effect of reducing their overall tax burden. An income of $10,331 which is subject to some part of that pensioner rebate is quite a significant retirement income.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a result of the introduction of the pensioner tax rebate, the Government estimates that pensioners will be able to earn very close to $10 a week over and above the basic pension without facing an income tax liability. The figure in the last financial year was about $3.75 a week. As can be seen, it is quite a significant increase in the after-tax income that is available to pensioners. In concert with that measure we have relaxed the requirement for the payment of provisional personal income tax by pensioners. In this financial year a pensioner will not be required to pay provisional personal income tax if he qualifies for a full or part pensioner income tax rebate. In broad terms, that means that, instead of facing a $1,000 investment income threshold, as was the case in the last financial year, before paying provisional tax, this year pensioners will be able to earn a combined income-investment income plus the pension-of $10,331 before they become liable for the payment of provisional tax. It is estimated that this relaxation will free a quarter of a million pensioners from the requirement to pay provisional tax. The changes are in line with the Social Security Review paper entitled Towards a National Retirement Incomes Policy released by the Government recently. It recommended improvements to the pensioner tax rebate and other measures to assist low income pensioners.
       </para>
       <para>
        The changes represent another substantial instalment in the Government's election promise to provide a new deal for pensioners. As a result of that promise made in 1983 the age pension has risen to nearly 25 per cent of the average weekly earnings of the Australian work force compared with the figure of 22.7 per cent under the Liberals in March 1983. So there has been a big percentage point boost in pensions in relation to the earnings of the employed members of the Australian community, and it can be demonstrated that in fact the age pension has increased ahead of inflation by 8 per cent over the course of this Government's term. So during the life of this Government there has been an 8 per cent real growth in pensions.
       </para>
       <para>
        Not only has the purchasing power of pensioners increased under the Hawke Labor Government but, as this Bill demonstrates, the tax burden on pensioners and the inconvenience and worry that many elderly people face when filling out tax returns has been eased substantially, particularly as a result of the change to provisional tax as of 1 July last. The reduction in the pensioners' tax burden follows an overall decrease in tax rates for millions of low income earners since this Government came to office. There has been a reduction in the lowest marginal tax rate of 30c in the dollar when Mr Howard was Treasurer to the present rate of 24c in the dollar for the lowest income tax bracket. As I pointed out, the income tax threshold, or the amount of tax exempt income, has risen from $4,595 to $5,100 per annum. The success of this Government's economic policies, its stringent fiscal restraint and the broadening of the income tax base have paved the way for the prospect of further cuts in personal income tax next year, and I believe that those income tax cuts, to be delivered from 1 July next year, will be quite substantial.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to direct some remarks to the parts of these Bills which relate to the Medicare levy. Low and middle income earners will benefit also from the provisions of the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill. In addition to authorising the collection of the Medicare levy, the Bill will increase the income threshold below which the levy is not payable. Of course that has been done in the past; I believe in every year of the life of this Government we have relaxed the income threshold for the payment of the Medicare levy. As a result of this Bill, more Australian families will not be liable to pay the levy.
       </para>
       <para>
        This will further reinforce one of the primary objectives of this Government in developing the Medicare program-the development of an equitable medical insurance scheme which can provide universal high quality health services to all Australians based on their capacity to pay. I regret to say that under the previous Government there were gross inequalities in the provision of health cover because of the costs in relation to income required to purchase that cover. For example, in 1983 a family earning just above the health care card income limit had to pay of the order of 7.2 per cent of its income to obtain basic health cover. At the same time, a family on an income of $50,000-a very substantial income in 1983-had to pay only 1.4 per cent of its income to obtain the same level of health cover. So a high income family had to pay only 1.4 per cent of its income while a low income family had to pay 7.2 per cent-many multiples of the lower figure, to obtain exactly the same level of health cover. That was a grossly unfair situation and Mr Howard, the then Treasurer, and the Liberals condoned that position until they left office in 1983.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, under Medicare all taxpayers earning more than the low income threshold now have to contribute 1.25 per cent of their taxable income towards health cover. In other words, health cover costs are now more in line with people's capacity to pay. Financing Medicare on the basis of each person's capacity to pay is not just equitable, it is also a major contribution to the social wage. The social wage, of course, has been one of the keystones of the accord with the trade union movement. The trade union movement now recognises that the economic welfare of its members and their families is not guaranteed simply by cash wage payments; it is also importantly underpinned by expenditure items provided by both Federal and State governments. They come under the heading of the social wage, and the Medicare health insurance system is an important part of the social wage provided by the Commonwealth Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Reverting to the pre-1984 system-that is, before Medicare-would mean that basic private health insurance at 1987-88 prices would cost an average family something like $21.50 a week more than the roughly accurate figure of $5.50 a week that such a family now contributes. So a family now paying $5.50 a week to obtain Medicare cover through the tax system would have been paying in the order of $27 a week to obtain the same level of health cover had the previous health system operated by the Liberals, by Mr Howard, still been in operation. Mr Howard has undertaken, in the unlikely event of his becoming Prime Minister, virtually to dismantle the Medicare system. In other words, he would be increasing the cost of health insurance. That would hit low and middle income earners in Australia the most and, as the figures I have put on the record demonstrate, that would mean a significant impact on the social wage of those lower and middle income Australians.

         —If we went back to the days before Senator Patterson was here, when we had a ridiculous private health insurance system which left two million Australians without cover, people would be paying the equivalent of $27 a week for health cover which they now get for $5.50. That is what it comes down to. A return to the archaic health system which operated when those opposite were in government would devastate the living standards of lower and middle income earners. One of the most important boosts to the living standards of ordinary Australians developed under this Government, which those opposite continually ignore, is the enormous benefits of Medicare. Their continued harping about wages and taxes completely ignores the enormous boost Medicare has given to living standards. We must remember, when making comparisons about taxes and wages, that there are important social wage programs such as Medicare over and above taxes and wages comparisons which affect the living standards of ordinary Australians. The point I am making is that if we were to go back to the sort of system the Liberals had, and now seem to want again, ordinary Australians would be paying $27 a week for health cover-$21.50 more than they are now. (Quorum formed) Before I was interrupted I was talking about the effect of Medicare on living standards. The substantial improvements to equity and the social wage under Medicare have contributed to its now becoming a widely accepted and approved part of Australian life.

        According to a recent public opinion survey, Medicare now enjoys an all time approval rating of 67 per cent; that is, 67 per cent of those polled said they supported the Medicare system. This is despite persistent criticism by the Opposition, carping about the system and pretending it does not exist. I ask the Opposition, through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, whether it can boast a similar level of approval for any of its policies. Can it point to any of its policies where it has a 67 per cent level of support? Can it point to any opinion poll that shows 67 per cent support for the policies of the Liberal Party, for any of its proposed leaders or for the Party itself? Recently we saw an opinion poll in a national news magazine showing that, far from having a 67 per cent support rating, Mr Howard, the present Leader of the Opposition, had only 14 per cent support. I do not think the Liberals can point to any policy which has 67 per cent support, as there is for Medicare.
       </para>
       <para>
        Lower and middle income Australians realise that their standard of living is enormously advantaged by having a universal system of health care. It is as simple as that. That is the reason why there is such a high level of support. It would be a dreadful mistake to go back to the old days of private health insurance. It was a costly and inefficient system with very high overheads, with a large proportion of its contributions eaten up by administrative costs. I think lower and middle income Australians realise that they are doing very well under the Medicare system.
       </para>
       <para>
        The legislation before us today, along with the Government's overall reform of the tax system, will help ensure that the economic progress since March 1983 will not be put at risk. The Hawke Labor Government has already demonstrated its preparedness to face up to the hard decisions. Since coming to office in March 1983 it has worked consistently to reform the tax system. With renewed vigour, determination and imagination, we will continue to face the challenge of devising a fairer and more equitable tax system for Australians, a system that is conducive to the long term growth prospects of Australia. No doubt, and regrettably, this ongoing reform will continue to occur in the face of a hostile and belligerent Opposition.

         —I rise to speak in the second reading debate on the taxation Bills to make one point and one point only-the continuing abuse of this Parliament and the taxpayers of Australia by the Hawke Government with its penchant for legislation by press release. These omnibus Bills enshrine all manner of amendments to taxation legislation. In particular, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1988 hides one of the most gross cases of retrospective abuse that this Senate has been asked to pass. The Bill seeks to implement, subject to what the Government calls minor variations, the proposal announced on 4 February 1985-I emphasise that-to tax non-cash business benefits. This amendment was announced 3 1/2 years ago, yet only now has legislation been brought forward.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Taxpayers have been obliged to arrange their affairs for a period of 3 1/2 years on the basis of a press release by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). This is simply not satisfactory. It becomes even less satisfactory when the Treasurer finally brings in legislation which he says varies the original announcement. The question needs to be asked: What is the obligation of a taxpayer to comply with a law that is not a law but merely a statement by the Treasurer? Not only does this question need to be asked but, more importantly, it needs to be answered. What is there to prevent a government from making an announcement and calling it a law for five or even 10 years? Clearly, this Government thinks that 3 1/2 years is not unreasonable. The only thing that will stop an arrogant government like this from behaving in such a high-handed way is for the electors to toss it out. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, of which I am proud to be a member, Madam Acting Deputy President, as I presume you are, said of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) in its twelfth report of 1988:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee has consistently argued over a period of several years that legislation made retrospective to the date of a Ministerial announcement is undesirable . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee again questions how a person may be expected to know the content of a law when the terms of that law are not publicly available, but may only be ascertained from a reading of Ministerial media announcements, or, in this case, a draft bill which was modified in content before its presentation to the Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee accordingly draws the clause to the Senator's attention as it may breach principle 1 (a) (i) and, due to its retrospective effect, may be considered to unduly trespass on personal rights and liberties.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Acting President of the Law Council of Australia, Mr Alex Chernov, QC, has also issued a statement recently endorsing the Scrutiny of Bills Committee's remarks. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Law Council, like the Committee, has repeatedly urged the Government-and particularly the Treasurer-to stop using media releases to usurp the legislative role of the Parliament in a way that makes a mockery of the rule of law.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and the Law Council of Australia have indicated, this is not the first time that legislation has been made retrospective to the date of a ministerial announcement. I suppose one could read through ministerial press releases to find out about legislation but it would take a lot of reading. I have here a pile of press releases-I show them to honourable senators-by the Treasurer and Acting Treasurers of this Labor Government announcing changes to legislation that in due course are to be agreed to by the Parliament. I do not know what is meant by `due course' because in this case it is 3 1/2 years ago. Here is a pile of press releases which represent legislation by press release. If members of the public like to find these press releases and go through them they may find out what is in the Government's mind for them for the next four or five years-hopefully, they will not be subjected to this Government for that long.

         —It is outrageous. I just cannot believe this pile of papers here. I would again like to refer to what the Law Council of Australia had to say about legislation by media release. This view of the highly regarded and influential Law Council sets out accurately what is evil about this Government's habit of using press releases to usurp the proper role of this Parliament. This document is so important that I propose to quote it in full:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Law Council of Australia has renewed its condemnation of the practice of the Federal Government known as `legislation by media release'.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is the practice by which the Government announces its intention to ask the Parliament to pass a law at some future and perhaps indeterminate time-but declares that the proposed law is to take effect immediately.
       </para>
       <para>
        The practice, which is being increasingly resorted to by the Treasurer, is open to many objections, the most fundamental of which is that it involves a usurpation of the Parliament's legislative power by the Executive.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact of the matter is that once a media release has been issued stating that legislation is to be introduced and operate with effect from the date of the statement, individuals have no option but to act as if the law had thereby been changed.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is at a time when the merits of the proposed legislation have not been the subject of debate in the Parliament. It is beside the point to say that Parliamentary approval will be obtained in due course. The scope for proper consideration by the Parliament is severely limited by the media statement.
       </para>
       <para>
        The individual, with his advisers, is placed in a most unsatisfactory position. He is forced to adjust his business transactions in anticipation of the proposed legislation. He does not know, and cannot ascertain, the details of the future provisions. Nor indeed can he be sure that the legislation will in fact be enacted or whether, if enacted, it will accord with the announced details. He may not even become aware of the media statement because it does not form a part of the law of the land and is not published as if it were.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Law Council is not on its own in condemning this practice. As long ago as 1975 Mr Justice (now Chief Justice) Mason of the High Court condemned the practice in the following terms:
       </para>
       <para>
        ``There is, first, the risk that the proposed alteration will not be made by Parliament and there is, secondly, the possibility, sometimes unfortunately realised, that the law when enacted will not correspond exactly with the antecedent announcement. Above all, it is a technique calculated to encourage people to disregard and, indeed, to disobey the law.''
       </para>
       <para>
        More recently, strong criticism has been voiced on a number of occasions by two Senate Standing Committees-the Committees on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and on the Scrutiny of Bills.
       </para>
       <para>
        The latter Committee in its annual report for 1986/87 said:
       </para>
       <para>
        ``As the Committee has repeatedly stated, the practice of `legislation by press release' carries with it the assumption that citizens should arrange their affairs in accordance with announcements made by the Executive rather than in accordance with the laws made by Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        ``. . . quite apart from the debilitating effect of the practice on the Parliament, it leaves the law in a state of uncertainty.''
       </para>
       <para>
        In a recent letter to the Law Council, the Treasurer has endeavoured to justify his practice by saying ``no arbitrary fetters can be allowed to interfere with the Government's ability to deal promptly and effectively with tax avoidance''.
       </para>
       <para>
        I just interpolate that the Treasurer's statement that `no arbitrary fetters can be allowed to interfere with the Government's ability to deal promptly and effectively with tax avoidance' is the same kind of promptness he has demonstrated in getting in his tax return. In my view, a press release issued 3 1/2 years ago is not prompt. The letter continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        To the extent that this implies that the Treasurer has been confining his legislation by media releases to measures to prevent tax evasion it is wrong and misleading. The Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills has in fact in its annual report for 1986/87 criticised the Tax Office for resorting to the practice ``as a matter of administrative routine''.
       </para>
       <para>
        While basically it opposes all retrospective legislation, the Law Council recognises that from time to time the Government will see a need for urgent action to prevent unacceptable tax-evasion practices. The Council has in fact put to the Government suggested guidelines* which would take account of such matters and ensure that the undesirable consequences of the media release practice were minimised.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government, however, has declined to accept these guidelines. It has amended instructions in its Cabinet Handbook, but these instructions are quite inadequate. The Government is plainly minded to continue to `legislate by media release' on a much wider range of matters and subject to much less stringent conditions than have been proposed in the guidelines.
       </para>
       <para>
        The time has come for a halt to be called. The practice is making a mockery of the rule of law.
       </para>
       <para>
        When an organisation such as the Law Council of Australia says that the practice we are now seeing is making a mockery of the rule of law one should be very concerned. The citizens of this country should be very concerned. For the information of honourable senators I seek leave to table the Law Council guidelines referred to in the letter I quoted.

         —I thank the Senate. In addressing the Bills which are the subject of this cognate debate, I have confined my remarks to the one issue, but a fundamental issue. Indeed, it is one of the most fundamental issues facing this Parliament. If we, the representatives of the people, are deflected from our responsibilities in defending them from unreasonable actions by governments, if we fail to give proper scrutiny to proposed legislation-how on earth are we supposed to when we see half of it in this sort of form?-if we allow governments to treat as binding on citizens rules that are not enshrined in legislation, we are living in a dictatorship. Yesterday in this chamber I spoke on the export development grants scheme, expressing my concern at the lack of advance warning exporters have had about changes that will affect them. I also spoke about my concerns regarding the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the improper, and, I believe, illegal, way it originally implemented the current household expenditure survey. Today I have been compelled to speak about the totally unacceptable approach this Government has made to circumvent this Parliament and to legislate by press release. We are not living in a dictatorship-yet. However, unless we maintain our vigilance over this Government and its Ministers, who believe they can thumb their noses at the Parliament and its constitutional rights, we may yet be living in a dictatorship.

         —Since 1983, when Mr Keating became Treasurer, the average wage has increased by 40 per cent, but the average tax bill has increased by 80 per cent. These figures represent the cold, hard reality. They show that the average Australian knows just how deeply Mr Keating is dipping into his pocket or her purse. The Opposition has moved certain amendments which will highlight just how convoluted and hard to understand tax legislation has become. I believe that the legislative process should be accessible and understandable to the general public. Accordingly, Bills which are presented to parliament should be able to be understood by the intelligent layman. However, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1988 and cognate Bills are anything but that and are a further indication that the whole range of taxation legislation is in urgent need of a complete overhaul.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Members of the Liberal-National Party coalition have been urging the Government at least to take some steps towards revamping the Income Tax Assessment Act so that it can be understood. As an example of the complexity involved in these Bills it should be noted that Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1988 alone-and we are considering a package of Bills-provides an additional 54 pages to the already copious amounts of tax legislation. The Opposition does not really oppose these Bills but it would like to highlight the tax jungle into which Treasurer Keating has led the ordinary honest citizen. For example, Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) and Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) are the third and fourth major taxation Bills that have been brought forward in the 10 months of this year. When one turns to the explanatory memoranda one sees that it is clear yet again that the Government is proposing retrospectively to legislate in the area of non-cash benefits through proposed new section 21a of Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) and also by press release. For example, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1988, an amendment to the main Act, will tax non-cash benefits that are in the nature of income. This was announced on 4 February 1985-almost four years ago. It has taken four years to get that press release into some form of legislation before this Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Treasurer is yet again putting forward proposals to change laws which were announced, in some cases, two, three or four years ago. We are seeing changes being introduced, not by legislation passing through this Parliament-the Bill being presented to the Parliament, speeches being recorded in Hansard and Ministers explaining it clause by clause-but by press release dropped into the press gallery boxes by members of Mr Keating's staff. Clearly, this is not good enough. It is a sorry state of affairs and a great insult to this Parliament and the people of Australia. In fact, in its last report, the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills-an all-party committee of this place-again implored the Government to halt this undesirable practice of legislation by press release, as it had done in numerous other reports. Obviously the Government has taken no notice-it has taken no notice of its own members' requests.
       </para>
       <para>
        It has become common to say that the Hawke-Keating Government is the highest taxing government in more than 40 years, but that does not make the statement any less true or shameful. The new system of self-assessment with the associated stiff penalties requires the Commissioner of Taxation to have a very wide taxation knowledge. Unfortunately, the business community is complaining that this increased emphasis on field audits is resulting in investigations often by inadequately trained tax officers because of a lack of resources. There have also been allegations of some tax raids being psychologically brutal. In the area of complex taxation it is also important that the Commissioner continues public rulings, even though there is no statutory obligation to provide them. Unfortunately, there is sometimes a lack of suitable linkage between what we might term the Tax Commissioner's objective analysis within the ruling and his preferred position. This would indicate that perhaps the legal department of the Australian Taxation Office is under-resourced. Although I welcome the decision of the Tax Commissioner to provide public and private rulings-and sometimes these private rulings are referred to as `advance opinions'-it is regrettable that these private rulings can apply only to the taxpayer who has sought the advice. They cannot be used as a general precedent. The rationale behind that is that sometimes the facts may not be identical.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clause 25 of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) terminates the accelerated depreciation concession which allowed plant write-offs over three or five years. The loss of this concession will have a big impact on the mining and manufacturing sectors which are essentially capital intensive. Although the offset for the loss of accelerated depreciation was a lower corporate rate, the companies that benefit most are generally those which are less capital intensive rather than manufacturing enterprises. At a time when the Government places such store by technology this is a retrograde step, because we are trying to bring Australia's manufacturing capabilities and expertise into line with the more competitive companies operating overseas.
       </para>
       <para>
        It has become the practice for some operators or entrepreneurs to switch their depreciation method-from the diminishing value method to the prime cost method-at a point at which the prime cost method will give the greater deduction. The amendments before us today are aimed at preventing that practice and will remove the option of changing depreciation methods. Instead, the taxpayer will be required to make an irrevocable choice of method at the outset-that is, each year the taxpayer will be required to decide which depreciation method will apply to all his plant that is first depreciable by him in that year. Once that decision is made, the taxpayer will be required to continue to depreciate that plant by the method chosen until the end of its depreciable life. I raise this issue because it has not been given widespread publicity.
       </para>
       <para>
        In another change the Government has reversed an earlier decision to tax the remote area housing scheme. This decision was subsequently changed, again by a government press release, on 29 October 1986. This is but another example of the Government's tardiness in bringing to a legislative base a decision which was made more than two years ago.
       </para>
       <para>
        While there is some evidence of intimidation of tax agents by the Australian Taxation Office, I hope that this is not widespread. The growing lack of rapport between the Taxation Office and the professions must be reversed. The recent raids on the offices of Allen, Allen and Hemsley, Coopers and Lybrand and Citibank Ltd support this developing conflict and raise the question of professional privilege, particularly in relation to the photocopying and taking of documents and working papers. I believe the Government must take some responsibility for this situation as it continues its relentless pressure on the Taxation Office to collect more and more revenue from people. In fact, some financial journalists have suggested that one or more of the highly publicised Taxation Office raids were actually `fishing expeditions'. The Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Conwell, has been quoted as saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Taxation Office is keen to determine just how full and free access can be taken.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, the term `fishing expedition' had another connotation recently on the Central Coast of New South Wales when it was reported that taxation officials were on the piers and the foreshore with cameras photographing a recent game fishing tournament.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Taxation Office rejects the charge that those individuals who own expensive cars, boats and other such items are targets for tax investigations. However, there have been reported instances of this occurring. I quote one such incident in Melbourne where a luxury car retailer was approached by the Taxation Office to provide his company's register of all the expensive cars sold.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government takes great delight in criticising the taxation policies of the Fraser Government. Let us look at a few facts. In the 1982 Budget presented by Mr Howard, the average worker in middle class Australia was earning about $550 gross. He lost 23 per cent of this to the tax man. In each and every year since 1983, under the Treasurership of Mr Keating, the same taxpayer has been hit by a higher marginal tax bracket, ranging between 41c and 46c in the dollar. This is the truth about the present Government. It has picked on these people who represent the average Australian family with mortgages, children to educate, cars to pay off and provisions to be made for retirement. In fact, this Government is truly remarkable because it is hitting those middle income Australian families which, in its rhetoric, it claims to support. It has hit them with the highest taxes since World War II. More than two million taxpayers have been pushed into the top two tax brackets since the 1982-83 fiscal year and almost half of these have been pushed by this Treasurer into the top bracket.
       </para>
       <para>
        In all these Bills before the Senate today, the Government is continuing its plan to increase the hidden taxation liability by again raising the provisional tax uplift factor. In the House of Representatives, the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Peter Morris) said that this uplift was to take account of the expected movements in property incomes and incomes in the unincorporated business sector. I remind the Senate that property incomes include rent, interest, dividends and the like. I accept the sincerity of Mr Morris but I draw the attention of the Senate to yet another example of the prospective tax increases based on unearned income.
       </para>
       <para>
        Apart from that, there is a hidden inconsistency within these figures. The Budget predicts an inflation rate of 4.5 per cent, but the Government has determined an uplift factor for provisional tax of 12 per cent, lifting it from the previous year of 11 per cent. This is far higher than the inflation rate. Mind you, on top of this we have to add the Medicare levy to apply to that provisional income. The inflation factor is less than 4 per cent overall. Obviously the inflation factor for the ordinary pay as you earn people must have been significantly below the 4 1/2 per cent, maybe 2 or 3 per cent. We know that this clearly is quite untrue because of wage increases that have already occurred or are in the pipeline.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is further evidence that the whole Budget strategy is quite unsound, particularly in relation to the expected blow-out before the end of the year. What the Opposition has been imploring for some time is that the Government try to increase the capacity for incentive in the work force. In fact, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) has tried to do this and so has the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones). But how can their efforts be successful if small and medium business people and people thinking about acquiring a business are shied away not only by crippling high taxation but also by the threat of press release by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) being issued without warning and drastically changing their tax liability?
       </para>
       <para>
        In another place it was revealed that the Business Council of Australia survey of 16 countries with similar economic systems to Australia's showed that Australia had the second highest business taxation level. In fact, Australia was surpassed only by the Labour Government in New Zealand, a country whose economy is facing very turbulent times. Not only are lower and middle income earners in Australia being hit but also small and medium businesses, both with a record of high taxation levels. The only winners are the very rich, for instance, those earning over $3,000 a week, and the multinational conglomerates.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the Bills in this package of Bills we are debating cognately is the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1988. While we support the provisions in this Bill in alleviating the levy from the lower income earners, it is timely to remind the Government of its estimates about the cost of running the Medicare system. The Opposition has stated, from time to time, that these estimates are far too low and that the system now is becoming more and more expensive. There is no commitment to change in providing proper access to quality health care for all members of the community.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now turn to another amendment proposed in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3). Clause 46 proposes to alter the roll-over provisions on the transfer of assets between spouses following a marriage breakdown. This change is to apply only to indirect assets transfers which occur after 28 January 1988. The Government is thus in my view intervening in the role of the Family Court of Australia in changing the nature of transfers carried out by order of that court. I ask: Why should this change apply from 28 January 1988? Why should it not apply when the capital gains system was introduced in 1985? The answer which the Minister will readily give is, `Well, after all, that was the date when Mr Keating issued his press release'. This does lead to the ludicrous situation where judges of the Family Court are expected to be aware of the Treasurer's press releases which announce changes in the law even though they have no legislative base. Perhaps Mr Keating should include Their Honours all around Australia on his Press release distribution list.
       </para>
       <para>
        It has long been an important principle that, `The man is only liable to pay tax according to the law of the day'. The Government appears to be presiding not only over crippling bracket creep-in other words, while one's income goes up one's tax goes up by a very much greater amount or percentage-but also over a creeping disdain for Parliament. It does this by this practice of announcing changes to the media and many months later putting up a Bill to Parliament to ratify the press statement, as it is doing in this package of Bills before the Senate today.
       </para>
       <para>
        I must impress on all honourable senators that, while this is a technical Bill which tidies up at the edges certain taxation laws, including taxes introduced by the present Government, and we do not oppose the technical changes as such, we deplore the Government for its tardiness in bringing these measures forward. We deplore it for the convoluted manner in which it has brought them forward, adding to an already highly complex taxation Act which is not understood by the ordinary individual. It brings another professional group between the layman and his understanding of the law. This high tax regime Government must urgently address the issue of tax which is paid by ordinary middle income Australians, because until this is alleviated people's standards of living will continue to decline. This will be the issue that the Australian people will take Bob Hawke and his Ministers to task on at the next election. With these reservations and comments I do not oppose the technical changes in this Bill.

While not opposing the technical changes in the legislation-it is another collection of technical changes to add to the extraordinary volume of technical changes that have been forced upon this incompetent Government and this disgraceful tax Act-I nonetheless draw the attention of the Senate once again to the amendments moved by Senator Messner, which in fact point out the extraordinary failure of this Government to convert the rhetoric it has expressed about tax into reality.

        These are not minor complaints; these are concerns of a major nature at the style and the content of this Government's taxation law. This Government has set out to mislead the people of Australia continually on taxation and I believe has done so in a particularly disreputable way by using the Commissioner of Taxation in a political context. I presume that this is not really because he desires to be in a political environment but because he has been propelled to be a defender of the Government's tax policies in the public forum in a way that I believe has diminished the status, the independence, of the Commissioner of Taxation. The appearance of advertisements arguing the Government's highly political case for individual tax changes is an absolute disgrace. If the Treasurer (Mr Keating) wants to sign advertisements arguing a political position, that is up to him. If he chooses to use taxpayers' funds to do so, then that is a matter he can argue politically. But for the Commissioner of Taxation and his department to sign advertisements arguing a political case for a particular kind of tax, which this Opposition, for example, is opposing at the time, strikes me to have hit at the very heart of the independence and the non-political nature of the Public Service in Australia. I believe that what has happened in the area of tax in this way not only has been disgraceful but also has damaged the fabric of the system that has served us so well for so many years.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe the level of resentment in the private sector against the activities of the Commissioner of Taxation does not relate simply to his commendable enthusiasm for pursuing tax cheats. I support him on that. I endorse his very energetic chase after money that should have been paid to the people of Australia through the tax system by those people who have avoided their responsibilities. That does not mean that I can support or endorse the intrusion of the Commissioner in a political way into political issues of whether a particular tax is one that should be politically supported. The waste of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money in advertisements signed by the Commissioner is not only unfortunate but also unsupportable. I do not believe the Government really has the capacity to argue otherwise. It will certainly pretend that there has been no change-the reality is that there has been. That is only one of the many changes for the worse in taxation that have taken place under this Government. The main change is the one that every taxpayer in Australia feels through his hip pocket, and that change is, of course, the ever-increasing burden that Australian taxpayers have to pay.

        In the recent Budget we saw that the total individual tax take in the coming year is forecast to rise by $5.7 billion, or 13.6 per cent. That is more than double the expected rise in average weekly earnings, which are expected to rise by 5.75 per cent. The Government has responded, `Ah, but that doesn't mean you are going to pay more tax'. The Government is saying that the total tax collection will go up at double the rate of wages, but that that does not mean that individual taxpayers will pay more, because it has a special curious mathematical capacity which endeavours to deny reality! With the Government's extraordinary public relations operation, the National Media Liaison Service and the other extraordinarily expensive Ministerial Media Group, it has the capacity, at public expense, to spend millions of dollars in propaganda to try to pretend that one and one do not make two. The reality is that there will be a 13.6 per cent increase in the individual tax take, but only a 5.75 per cent increase in average weekly earnings.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's justification for this is, `Ah, but there are going to be more people at work and, because there will be more people at work, therefore the volume of tax will go up without each person having to pay more tax'. That sounds almost plausible, but not quite plausible because the Government does not give us the sums and does not tell us the amount by which tax revenue will be increased as a result of more people being at work. It does not tell us because it knows it will destroy its case. The Government knows that the truth is that the bulk of the increased tax take this year by this Government will come from people who are already employed and who are simply paying more tax this year because of this Government's use of fiscal creep. When I use the words `fiscal creep', I am not referring to the Treasurer himself, although I think it is a fairly apt description.

         —I thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I refer once again to fiscal creep in its inanimate form even though it has been alleged that the Treasurer does have the appearance of a mortician. Nonetheless, let us look at the situation of fiscal creep, which is the arrange- ment by which inflation pushes people into higher tax bills. The tax bill goes up at a faster rate than their wages. Every Australian knows that that happens, and that will happen to a very significant extent this year. We have heard continually from this Government that it has cut taxes and plans to cut taxes more. Every so-called tax cut that this Government has produced has resulted in Australians paying more personal income tax. On top of that we have the massive expansion of indirect taxes in this country under this Government: the introduction of a tax on ice cream, fruit juice, orange juice, flavoured milk and paddle pops. This kind of spread of taxation under this Government is on top of the fact that fiscal creep is pushing more people into higher tax brackets and they are having to pay more. The legislation we are looking at today is yet another example of the enormous volume of tax legislation which, frankly, has done nothing to diminish the burden of taxpayers in Australia and, on the contrary, has been part of the process of significantly increasing it.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We now face a much more interesting situation. The Government has promised to cut taxes significantly. It will be interesting to see how it manages to do it because the tax cut was, hopefully, to be part of a deal with the unions in which wage rises were traded off for tax cuts. But that was when the Government was pretending that there would be an inflation rate of 4 1/2 per cent this year. I say `pretending' because it was never on. The Budget, which was brought down less than three months ago, was based on a farcical forecast that this year inflation would be reduced to 4 1/2 per cent. The recent inflation figure of around 7.2 per cent clearly indicates that this financial year there is not a chance-not that there ever was-of that forecast being met.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government will face very great difficulty in convincing the union movement that the tax cuts that it will introduce will be so substantial that they will offset the negative effect on Australian standards of living of a 7.2 per cent inflation rate. I expect the present rate to be reduced, but perhaps to around 6 per cent-certainly not 4.5 per cent. What will the Government do if that wages trade-off cannot survive? It will be faced with an enormous economic dilemma which will be solved in one way: the higher the inflation this Government's incompetence creates in Australia, the bigger its tax collections. I often wonder how genuine this Government is in the fight against inflation because whenever it has budgetary problems it stands to benefit in its tax collections from the highest possible inflation rate. While it talks low inflation and low tax, it acts in a way that increases the inflation rate and increases people's tax bills. There is an enormous gap between what the Treasurer and this Government say and what they actually do. It is remarkable.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at interest rates, for example. Soaring interest rates in Australia have resulted mainly from this Government's failure adequately to cut government spending. This has now created another enormous burden on Australia. Only recently the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia said that because the fiscal measures-those that should have been taken-were no longer available there would be a very heavy reliance on monetary policy. That means that interest rates will have to go up and stay high because the Government did not face its responsibilities in cutting its own spending. The implications of interest rates going up are other costs going up. The inflationary pressures that have already mounted in many areas will be sustained.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is very keen to cut the States' revenues but very reluctant to cut its own. In many instances, cutting State revenues means that the States have to try to find other ways of raising money. State charges and costs then increase, which is then reflected in a higher cost of living. A great deal of publicity was given by the Treasurer to the fact that in New South Wales increased government costs and charges to offset, in many instances, significant cuts in Federal funding were the main factor in the big increase in inflation that has set the Government's strategy askew. In fact, the Government's strategy has not survived three months after its Budget. We are already hearing people talk about the absolute necessity of yet another May statement.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have a clear situation where the Government's strategy has gone astray. Taxes will increase even more than the Budget indicated because of the inflation factor. The cost of servicing this Government's debt will be even greater, I imagine, than the Budget figure forecast. It is inevitable that interest rates will be far higher than the Government budgeted for when it said that the interest bill on its enormous debt would be $7.6 billion. This $7.6 billion is just the interest charge on debt. That is as much as this Government spends on defence; it is more than it spends on education. This Government's activities have generated high inflation and high interest rates at a time when it is absolutely vital for Australia to compete if we are not to see our foreign debt get bigger and our standard of living fall further.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us get back to those promised tax cuts which I believe the Government has no capacity to provide. Even if it does provide some tax cuts, inflation will have pushed Australians into such high tax brackets that the tax cuts will be meaningless. I remind the Government that, if it is unable to deliver the promised tax cuts, it cannot go round pretending that it has been prevented by the Opposition from collecting the revenue it needs to provide these tax cuts. Clearly, the best way to provide tax cuts is to cut spending. That is what this Government will not do. Instead, it has been saying that it will collect tax in other ways. For example, the tax file number legislation would collect, at its peak, $300m.
       </para>
       <para>
        Last week we heard the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) say that if the Opposition did not support the tax file number it would be seen to be the friend of tax cheats and, by inference, this would prevent the Government from giving the people the sorts of tax cuts that it otherwise could give. That is total bunkum. We are not talking about just $300m to give Australians a genuine tax cut; we are talking about billions of dollars that this Government has to give back to the people-money that it has ripped out of their pockets by the insidious, sneaky, dishonourable method of simply pushing people into higher tax brackets by having an economic policy which allows inflation to proceed and the cost of living to go up. That pushes people into a situation where they have to pay more and more tax. In that sense, the Government is the Grim Reaper. I understand that this appellation has been used in respect of the Treasurer without anyone objecting, apart from the Treasurer.

One of them is 46 pages odd, another 50 pages odd, adding to the trebling of the size of the tax law under this Government. The enormous increase in the physical size of the tax legislation that has taken place under this Government is extraordinary. There was a considerable increase in the size of the tax legislation under the previous Government-we have to recognise that-but the great bulk of the increase in the tax law that took place under the previous Government was to replace section 260, which the Commissioner of Taxation believed had been knocked out by the High Court of Australia. We had to pass tonnes and tonnes of amendments, it seemed, to the tax law to make up for the fact that section 260, in the Commissioner's view-I underline that-had been knocked out. Now we find that section 260 is alive and well and that a lot of that legislation was unnecessary.

This Government is passing amendment after amendment because it has incompetently presented legislation in the first place or because it has put out so many press releases about what it is going to do that, 3 1/2 years later-or who knows how much later-it is then obliged to come out with legislation to put its ancient press release into effect. I noticed the other day that something like 280 amendments were made to company legislation within, I think, a month of that legislation having been brought into this chamber. That sort of monumental incompetence may suit the Government, but it certainly does not suit the Opposition, and it does not suit the people of Australia.

However, the press release saying what the law intended to do was released roughly 3 1/2 years ago. It is to operate from 3 1/2 years ago.

         —Exactly. People have been obliged to know not only the words of the press release but also the legal implications and potential subtleties of a law that was to be introduced 3 1/2 years later. How ordinary Australians can hope to cope with that ludicrous situation is beyond me. But this Government does not mind about that; it has no concern for the rights of individual Australians. It has no concern for the pockets of individual Australians, except a concern that as much as possible be ripped out of those pockets in order to feed an increasing government sector.

       <para>
        It is all very well for the Government to say, `But we have recently cut down the size of the government sector'. I remind the Government that in its first two years in office it set out on a course which involved a massive increase in the size of government. In its first year in office, it made immense play, in a May statement, of the fact that it was reducing government spending by, I think, a little over $1 billion. In its first Budget, it increased government spending by $2 1/2 billion. The following year it increased government spending by something like $1 1/2 billion. The cumulative effect over a full year of those increases in the role of government, to the disadvantage and at the cost of the Australian people, was enormous. Any slight withdrawal from that huge increase that may have taken place in the latest year still leaves this Government having to be the biggest taxing government in Australia's history because it has to pay its enormous bills. Its huge debt involves an interest cost of as much as we spend on defence, and more than we spend on education. That huge interest bill has emerged as a direct result of this Government's massive increases in government spending in its earlier years of office. As Australians we all now have to pay that bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is why we are moving these amendments in relation to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4). It is not that they will change the operation of these two Bills but because we are drawing to the attention of the Australian people the fact that this legislation is further evidence of continuing increases in the tax law, a tax law that has left Australians with the greatest tax burden ever in Australia's post-war history-a tax burden that is a direct result of this Government's policies.

In the relatively brief period available to me before Question Time, my remarks will initially be of a general character, relating to the Government's policies in the taxation field covered by these Bills. Thereafter they will be directed at a couple of aspects of the Bills: first, the extraordinary retrospectivity of certain provisions of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1988, in particular, clauses 38 and 43; and, secondly, by sharp and very marked contrast, what one might call the non-retrospectivity of clause 46 of that Bill, a clause which deals with the roll-over provisions in respect of assets owned indirectly by a person who might be called a `transferor spouse' by means of a trust or company, where those assets are to be transferred to the other, previous, partner in a marriage as a result of an order of, or pursuant to a maintenance agreement approved by, the Family Court of Australia. As I say, my remarks on that clause at a later point will be directed, so to speak, at the non-retrospectivity of that provision.

        I wish to commence my remarks on the more general aspects of the Government's taxation policies as related to the four Bills before the Senate today. We have been promised by this Government-we were told this most formally in the Budget Papers, as Senator Michael Baume, who has just concluded his remarks, quite properly pointed out-major tax cuts as from 1 July 1989. There was, it is fair to add, a marked lack of quantification in those promises and in particular there was no definition as to what in any case constitutes a tax cut in the vocabulary of the present Government. After all, we have had a couple of tax cuts, so-called, from the present Government during its life. What taxpayers are well aware of is that the real burden of their personal income tax is higher today than it has ever been before.

         —As Senator Michael Baume quite properly reminds me, every time we have a so-called tax cut the real burden of taxes seems to rise, or at least within 12 months it is higher than it was 12 months earlier. There may be immediately, on day one, some nominal diminution, but 12 months later one is further behind in the field than when one started. That is the first point to be noted: when this Government talks about tax cuts, what does it mean?
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        To sharpen the definitions a little, I suggest that the only meaningful definition of a tax cut is one which reduces the real burden of taxes-one which results, for example, in getting away from the present situation under which the Government has this year again, for the third time running, raised personal tax levels in this country to their highest level on record. I am talking now in terms of taxation levels as a proportion of the gross national product and by reference to other indicators of that kind. For example, if the Government is serious in talking about making tax cuts in any coherent sense from 1 July next year, it will have to start talking about real tax cuts. In particular, it will have to take note of the fact that it will have to cut taxes by at least $2 billion for 1989-90 in order to stop the real burden of such taxes rising, because that is about the extent of the degree of bracket creep which will be imposed upon the taxpayers of this country in the course of the fiscal year 1989-90 by simply doing nothing. So the Government has to `give away' about $2 billion of revenue by new measures in our next financial year in order to stop the real burden of personal income taxes rising.
       </para>
       <para>
        Beyond that point, what can or is the Government likely to do when it comes to address, as it will in the new year or perhaps even before the new year, its capacity-I underline that word-to give tax cuts, at least in a responsible manner-that is not a word with which the Government unduly troubles itself; nevertheless we must give it the benefit of the doubt-over and above just giving back the product of bracket creep, as from 1 July next year? I have covered these matters at greater length than I will certainly be able to do when I resume my remarks on these pieces of legislation next week in a paper to the bicentennial economists congress which I delivered in this city, at the Canberra Hyatt Hotel, on 2 September 1988. At that time I pointed out that the only manner in which the Government can provide real tax cuts responsibly in 1989-90-leaving aside any adventitious gains we may get from any terms of trade windfall, which we have not considered and which the Government, to be fair to it, is not considering-is either by way of cutting its expenditure, which is most important, or by way of the productivity growth of the Australian economy. Of course, the latter is not at present noted for its rapidity. What we have is a situation in which the Government is basically looking down the barrel-I should say, the two barrels-of a gun, comprising of the failure of its own economic policies--

         —Mr President, I will answer it as far as I am able. I do not know whether the Aboriginal Development Commission, in making its decision, was acting on any directive. I will certainly find out whether that was the case. The general picture that emerged during Estimates committee deliberations in relation to decisions of the Aboriginal Development Commission was along the lines that the Commission itself concluded that these particular consultations with the Aboriginal community were an essential part of any process of involving Aboriginal people, as they ought to be involved, in such an important matter which requires the fullest, most comprehensive and exhaustive discussions in a way which is amenable to the traditional modes of discussion, deliberation and consultation, peculiar perhaps to Aboriginal communities when compared with discussions that might take place within other sections of the Australian community. It was on that basis that Tranby College, with its long history of dealing with Aboriginal matters, from its early church based days if I recall the evidence, and in more recent times, was considered well qualified by the ADC to undertake this particular consultation process. I will seek answers to the other questions asked by Senator Tambling.

         —This claim is periodically made by Victorian politicians on both sides of the fence. It is one I contested with some vigour in my previous ministerial incarnation. It is one that I think has to continue to be resisted whenever it is made, as no doubt it will be for time immemorial. Claims that Qantas is a Sydney based organisation from top to bottom and run exclusively by Sydney people as a Sydney airline are plainly insupportable. For a start, four members of the 12-member Qantas board, including the Chairman, are Victorians. The company operates eight fully owned travel centres in Victoria as against 11 in New South Wales and employs almost 1,000 staff to support its operations in Victoria. Again, there is no substance to claims that Qantas has been attempting to block foreign airlines from serving Melbourne. The matter of air services agreements, including rights to foreign airlines to serve Melbourne, has been and remains a matter to be determined finally by the Australian Government in negotiation with other governments. Consequently, claims that a number of foreign carriers including Swissair Pty Ltd, Iberia Spanish Airlines and Lauda Air, are being blocked by Qantas in operating flights to Melbourne are without foundation. I can certainly endorse that from personal experience.

       <para>
        The proposition that Qantas is concerned only about the welfare of Sydney and not about the rest of Australia also does not stand up to any detailed examination. With the commencement of services to Tasmania early next year, Qantas will operate international air services to all Australian State capital cities as well as a number of key regional centres such as Cairns, Townsville and Port Hedland. Qantas currently spends in excess of $200m annually promoting overseas tourism to Australia as a whole. As such, it is probably the largest single contributor to promoting this extremely important activity which benefits all States including, of course, Victoria.

         —I take caffeine warm. The NHMRC has rejected a proposal which has been advocated by a number of consumer groups within Australia. In view of the proposal to reduce the acceptable level the NHMRC has recommended an educational campaign. Its decision was based essentially on the fact that it did not have enough scientific evidence to indicate adverse health effects from caffeine in the cola drink as it is now being sold in the Australian community. In its decision it also noted that we already have one of the lowest levels of allowable caffeine in cola drinks throughout the world and that, in terms of effects on people's intake, caffeine through cola drinks contributes only in a minor way to the level of intake of most consumers. So with those thoughts in mind, the NHMRC has rejected the proposal virtually to halve the acceptable level of caffeine in cola drinks.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It should also be noted in the context of this decision that there are a number of protections to Australian consumers. The presence of caffeine is very explicitly shown on labels-and that will continue-as opposed to many other ingredients that are listed under the general generic label of flavouring. As I mentioned earlier, if we were to reduce the acceptable level of caffeine, we would have one of the most proscriptive levels in the Western world. In fact, we would go down to about 40 per cent of what is currently allowable in the United States of America. Throughout the world at the moment the acceptable level ranges from 150 milligrams to 200 milligrams per kilogram of drink. So even at the moment we have the fourth lowest level of any country in the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, I am quite relaxed about the decision of the NHMRC; in fact I welcome it. It is very much in line with my position and the Government's position on this matter, which was stated on 19 September 1988 in Sydney, where I indicated very clearly that the position of this Government was that we did not think there was a case for reducing the level of caffeine to the level wanted by some consumer groups.

I refer to the widely publicised leaked report of New Zealand's Prime Minister Lange to his Cabinet, in which the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, are reported to have said that if New Zealand pulled out of the Anzac frigate project, Australia-New Zealand relations would suffer. I also refer to Mr Beazley's reported view that `the region required . . . a frigate force of some 20 ships', that Australia needed New Zealand's `help' to achieve this number, and that industry protection would be applied in Australia if New Zealand did not participate in the Anzac frigate project. I ask the Minister: Does he know what are the details of the industry protection referred to by Mr Beazley? In the light of the reported apparent threats by Mr Hawke and Mr Beazley, and in the light of Mr Beazley's public statements on industry protection, did Senator Richardson mislead the Senate in his statement of 11 October that `there is no question of Australia threatening New Zealand' in relation to its decision on the Anzac frigates? Will the Government apologise to the people of New Zealand for having, at least up until recently, secretly tried to pressure the New Zealand Government into sharing the burden of Australia's defence and regional ambitions? Finally, what steps will the Government take to guarantee that the Australia-New Zealand relationship will continue to strengthen, irrespective of New Zealand's decision on the Anzac frigates, and that no further attempts will be made to counteract the democratic process in New Zealand?

       <para>
        First of all, I think Senator Haines essentially asked me to comment on an allegedly leaked document and I am not disposed to do that. Of course, it is up to the New Zealand Government to make a decision on whether it will participate in the Anzac ship project. The suggestion in the leaked document is that the Australian Government might have tried to exert some influence on that decision. Of course the Australian Government is anxious for the New Zealand Government to participate in the project, but that does not mean that there was any further influence in advancing that view. Indeed, it is interesting to note that Mr Lange himself has rejected the suggestion that Australia was seeking to influence New Zealand in any heavy-handed way, and made clear that his decision to have a blue water navy preceded any talks with Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I indicated a minute ago, we see considerable benefit in maintaining interoperability here between the Australian and New Zealand navies as a way of preserving joint interest in the region. The Anzac ship project offers us a way of doing that and the Australian Government has gone to great lengths to match its requirements with those of New Zealand in terms of specifications, pricing, delivery arrangements and logistic support. If Australia and New Zealand are to maintain an effective defence relationship, I guess there is a need to maintain the military capabilities on which the relationship is based. I repeat in answer to what I interpreted to be the substance of the question: in no way has the Government sought to bring improper pressure on New Zealand on this issue.

         —When it comes to disclosure of electoral expenses, we heard a lot about it in the first half of this year, but we have heard very little over the last few weeks. The reason for that is quite explicit. There was a New South Wales election at the start of the year in which the Australian Labor Party had an embarrassing incident, and we were sought to be embarrassed. What has in fact occurred over recent weeks is that the embarrassment is on the other foot, and we have heard no question and no discussion from those opposite. Plenty of free cars have been dished out in New South Wales. The Community Polling organisation is apparently free to put in false returns and it is now investigating a situation where tens of thousands of dollars were secretly given to candidates.

        I remind people opposite of the propriety of events at the start of this year, when we said we would deal with these matters properly. They were dealt with properly, in spite of all the prejudging of those opposite, in spite of all the questions that went to Senator Tate and me. Everything was done according to Hoyle. The opinion of the Director of Public Prosecutions was sought and necessary action was taken. I think I can guarantee in these other cases that absolutely no action will be taken. If Senator Aulich wants evidence of that, I just remind him of the claims that were made in this chamber regarding fraudulent voting in the Castlereagh by-election in 1980, in which one of the protagonists he referred to made those outrageous claims. I have written to Premier Greiner on two occasions and I have been put on the long finger each time-no action will be taken on those allegations, basically because they know the result would be to disprove them.

        The honourable senator asked whether the Commonwealth Electoral Act could be regarded as covering preselection battles in as much as they can be expensive and eventually lead to someone's election. It is fairly unlikely that any drawing of a long bow could take that view. For instance, I understand that the Australian Taxation Office does not allow deductions for preselections, but only for elections as such. I do, of course, note in this morning's Sydney Morning Herald that an esteemed member of the Senate said:

Does proposed section 7 of the States Grants (General Revenue) Bill 1988, now before the Senate for debate, set down the global borrowing limits for the Western Australian State Government and its instrumentalities? Does this mean that, in the event of the Western Australian Government being called upon by the provisional liquidators of Rothwells Ltd to meet its obligation under its guarantees to the National Australia Bank Ltd for loans to Rothwells merchant bank totalling something like $150m, the State Government will need to negotiate higher borrowing limits at a future Premiers Conference? Failing this, will the taxpayers of Western Australia be called upon to meet any outgoing or shortfall in its obligations through higher taxes and charges? Further, has the Minister examined whether the global borrowing limits for Western Australia have been exceeded already following the recent investment of $175m in Petrochemical Industries Co. Ltd by the Western Australian State Government Insurance Commission, which funds were apparently financed by way of loan?

        I was also asked what would be done if Western Australia exceeded its borrowing limits. The position, as I understand it, is that the agreement of all the States and the Commonwealth Government is required if any State wishes to exceed the global borrowing limits agreed to unanimously, with the exception of the Queensland Government, at the Premiers Conference. Frankly, I do not have the faintest idea whether Western Australia is approaching the global limit at this stage. But I would be surprised if it was.

         —It is more like a free kick in the square. I do recall Mr Elliott saying, on more than one occasion actually, things like Australia is a terrible place to invest in and so on. Frankly, I never knew why he said it-whether he was trying to give his mates in the Opposition a handout or whether it could be attributed to too much Fosters. Whatever his motives may have been, the facts show that his views are not shared by the business community as a whole. The most recent figures on business investment and expectations are extremely good. The Budget Papers show that total investment spending in the last financial year was up by almost 10 per cent in real terms and a further rise of 12 per cent has been forecast for this year.

       <para>
        An article in the Australian Financial Review of 25 October referred to a survey that was conducted by the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce and the State Bank of New South Wales. That survey showed that spending on buildings and plant and equipment during the last quarter has increased. Of the 541 respondents to the survey-that is, about 29 per cent of the New South Wales manufacturing work force-23 per cent reported increased market share at the expense of imports during the last three months.

        As Senator Button has already mentioned, last month North Broken Hill-Peko announced that it was going to go ahead with a $1 billion investment in a pulp mill in Tasmania. Further to that-and this makes Mr Elliott's behaviour even more confusing if he really is moving a motion of no confidence in the Australian economy-it is a little strange that the two representatives of ERN who sit on the North Broken Hill board had supported the investment decision, according to a report in the Australian of 18 October. ERN is commonly known as Elders Resources Ltd and one of its two representatives on the North Broken Hill board is the same Mr John Elliott who, under different circumstances or in different places, moved a motion of no confidence in the Australian economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        So Mr Elliott's views about the attractiveness of Australia as a place for business investment seem to be about as confused as his views on whether he wants to get into Federal Parliament and roll the present Leader of the Opposition or not.

We condemn the brutal attack that appears to have been made on the elected government of a peaceful Indian Ocean state. There have been reports of civilian casualties. It is believed that the foreign mercenaries involved in the attack are now holding a large number of civilian hostages. The Government of India, in response to a request for urgent assistance from the Government of the Maldives, has sent paratroops to the Maldivian capital, Male. This action in defence of an elected government under attack by foreign mercenaries has the full support of the Australian Government. I emphasise the issue of foreign mercenaries here because it does, among other things, distinguish the situation from a number of others where people may be tempted to draw comparisons.

We are keeping a very close eye on the situation, to the extent that we can without resident representation on the ground. We fully expect to see the restoration of the elected Government and hope that that can be achieved without further bloodshed.

There is a section in the Migration Act that allows us to dispense with the two-year waiting period if, for good reason, an individual has served in the circumstances which Senator Chapman indicated or there are other urgent circumstances. So that two-year residency can be varied-I think on grounds of compassion and hardship. I do not recall the exact section of the Act. If the honourable senator wants to refer a specific case for my attention, I promise him that I will give it prompt attention. I do not think that it has come to my personal attention at this stage, although it may well have been dealt with by the Department.

         —There are two separate dimensions to the problem of Indonesian fishing vessels in Australian waters and they are sometimes confused in the public perception of it. One concerns the traditional fishermen in non-powered boats or boats with, at most, an auxiliary outboard for emergency situations. Their access to Australian waters is governed by a 1974 memorandum of understanding which deals with, among other things, the ability to take water on the Ashmore and Cartier Islands and suchlike. That has given rise to a number of problems in recent years, not least as a result of the passage of environmental protection legislation in Australia for areas such as the Ashmore and Cartier Islands. It has given rise to a number of problems in interpretation and enforcement. The discussions that I had on that part of the problem with the Indonesians were very productive. We have identified some areas that need to be followed through, with a further round of negotiations in order to update, and possibly revise in some respects, that memorandum of understanding. I look forward to that being sorted out over the next few months.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The more substantial and obvious problem has concerned the recently very rapidly escalating influx of commercial fishing vessels into Australian waters fishing for trochus or, more recently, netting commercial fish of one kind or another. The Australian Government has reacted in a number of ways to this: through improved surveillance activity, apprehension of the boats, legal proceedings, and proposals to destroy the boats in question. However, there is obviously a need to deter at source, rather than to rely wholly on ex post facto measures. With that in mind I discussed this matter very extensively with the Indonesians at a number of levels-the Foreign Minister and the Defence Minister and their respective officials. In the case of the Foreign Minister and President Suharto, we had quite a substantial exchange on this topic.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a result, the Indonesians decided to send a substantial team of officials, quite soon-within a matter of days-to all the relevant fishing village areas of Indonesia to make very clear the consequences of trespassing in Australian waters. Perhaps more substantially even than that, urgent action is to be taken by both sides to set up more formal and ongoing institutional arrangements, possibly in the form of a joint border committee of the kind that Indonesia has with a number of its neighbours which offers an institutional channel through which information can be accumulated and exchanged and appropriate practical measures taken to deal with a particular situation. One of the things that would be considered under such a set of institutional arrangements would be coordinated naval activity by both sides. There are some logistical difficulties associated with that, particularly on the Indonesian side, which might make that not a practicable proposition. However, that remains to be explored and it will be.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are a number of other solutions to the problem that remain to be explored. One that may be worth pursuing occurred in a letter which was drawn to my attention this morning-I presume it was in today's West Australian-from a correspondent by the name of I. Bevan, which reads:

         —Today geoscience in Australia made a massive stride forward. We have signed what many in the geoscientific community have been working towards for some time: an agreement between Australia and Canada for joint membership of the largest, most important international geoscience and marine engineering research program for the 1980s and 1990s, the ocean drilling program. Eighteen countries participate in the ocean drilling program. They pool scientific information and the financial costs of running that program and they explore the earth's last frontier, the ocean floor.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The ocean drilling program spends about $50m per annum on research into the structure and history of the ocean floor. Australia's contribution under this agreement will be $1.2m per annum over the next three years. The funds that we are contributing come from a consortium of public sector institutions: $400,000 from the Bureau of Mineral Resources; over $600,000 from the Australian Research Council; $100,000 from the Australian Vice Chancellors Committee; and $50,000 from the Antarctic Division of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. All of those bodies will benefit from the scientific information discovered through the ocean drilling program.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia will make a number of big gains because of this program. Twenty-five holes will be drilled in Australian regions over the next two years. That drilling will occur mainly in or alongside our Antarctic Territory. Some will occur in the south and south-east of Australia and some in the north-west. If that drilling were done commercially it would be valued at about $100m. In one of the holes that has been drilled in the north-west of Australia an ancient, previously unknown reef, about 220 million years old, containing promising signs of oil sediments, has been discovered. That discovery could have been made only by this type of program.

The program, as I have said, will provide essential information on the ocean floor. As well, it will provide information on the evolution of climatic change, sea level alterations and mechanisms related to the greenhouse changes that have been occurring. It is a once-in-a-generation program. Australia will benefit in another way, too, in that the supply vessels and the drill ship associated with the ocean drilling program will be supplied and equipped at Australian ports when they call there. That is estimated to be valued at about $2m per port visit. It is a very forward looking program and one to which we hope to attract private sector funds in the future.

On 28 September I met participants in the pro-Transylvania run from Melbourne and Sydney to Canberra, and conveyed to them publicly both the Government's and my concern about Romanian policies towards its ethnic Hungarian minority. We are certainly well aware of the rural urbanisation plans of the Romanian Government, which will have a quite devastating effect on a great many rural communities, including the Hungarian minority, through, as Senator Teague said, the planned demolition of 7,000 villages and the urban resettlement of their inhabitants. The Australian Government has clearly and directly expressed its concern about the human rights situation in Romania, including this rural urbanisation scheme, to the Romanian Government on 18 August to the Romanian Charge d'Affaires in Belgrade and on 31 August to the Romanian Deputy Foreign Minister in Bucharest.

        Australia's trade relations with Romania are not inconsistent with our human rights concerns. This is a matter that is constantly raised and one that always gives governments some concern. Australia trades with a number of countries whose policies we do not agree with. It is only in rare cases in which there is agreed and concerted action by the international community, such as in regard to South Africa, that trade sanctions can begin to be effective as a means of bringing about a change in a country's policies. We take the view-I think it has some foundation-that our human rights representations are likely to carry weight precisely because of the importance that Romanians attach to their commerce with us. Each of these situations must be treated in a case-by-case way. Certainly, there is no question but that the Australian Government condemns, in the strongest possible terms, what is going on in Transylvania and has communicated that to the relevant authorities.

         —I am aware of the problem Senator Jones raises. It is claimed by local tyre industry sources that slightly used tyres have been imported. Having been bought cheaply in Japan, they are sold to dealers here and are subsequently sold to motorists, and at the time of sale they are claimed to be as new. In fact, I understand the tyres are up to 10 years old and it is claimed by the industry that they are failing in service and, as Senator Jones says, pose serious risks. However, in trying to confirm the allegations, we have been able to ascertain that second-hand tyres are being imported, but are being sold as second-hand tyres and not as new tyres. As a consequence, the misleading advertising provisions of both the Trade Practices Act and State fair trading legislation do not address the problem, because, if they are in fact sold as second-hand tyres, there is no ascertainable misleading conduct.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Generally, the responsibility for tyre safety falls very much within the province of State and Federal transport Ministers. In this instance the authority the Main Roads Department in Queensland, has been approached by members of my Department to see whether we can distil any further information from it. The authority indicates that it has had no reported instances so far of dangerous accidents or serious impending problems because of the tyres being sold. However, the authority does believe that there is a problem that needs to be addressed and, as indicated, it believes that the sale of such tyres should be better controlled.
       </para>
       <para>
        In regard to the last part of Senator Jones's question, I anticipate the matter will be raised for discussion between State and Federal governments. There is in existence, under the auspices of the Australian Transport Advisory Council, which is a State and Federal body, a committee called the Vehicle Standards Advisory Committee. I anticipate that that Committee will be asked to address this problem, on the initiative of the Queensland authority.

         —I think I will let that point of order go; as Senator Cook suggests, it is frivolous. Senator Chaney asks a number of questions obviously related to an organisation in Western Australia. I think we can approach the matter of advice to investors and investment industry on a number of levels. In terms of individual consumers and investors the Government, together with consumer groups throughout the country, is looking at ways in which we can best assist those people who, because of overcommitment, have found themselves bankrupt or close thereto or who, because of bad financial advice, find themselves with problems. In regard to the latter, the Government is planning, as I think Senator Chaney would know, a rewrite of the current legislation. I think Senator Haines asked about this some months ago, and obviously at that stage Senator Chaney was not showing the interest that he shows now. The Government is looking at extending provisions to ensure that advice by investment counsellors is covered in such a way that consumers, whether they receive that advice either verbally or in writing, do in fact get some protection.

The caveat emptor philosophy that seems to dominate the other side when it comes to consumers and their place in the marketplace seems to raise its head only when one particular organisation does not seem to go as well as others are going, and in those instances we are talking about socialising losses or protecting those particular people who have embarked on investing in an enterprise where risk has always been understood to be a part of their investment. In short, the Government is addressing the problem of investment advice and its quality. It is addressing the problem of financial counselling, which is much more than any member of the Opposition has managed to do over the last six months.

If he is, can he tell the Senate, as the Federal Minister responsible for consumer affairs, what reliance consumers can place upon that label which is affixed by a government to a savings or investment institution, and what measures are taken by governments to ensure that an institution which bears the label `authorised trustee investment' is in fact a safe investment for the widows and orphans who are presumably meant to be protected by that sort of investment?

Mr Riley was, indeed, Convener of the National Coalition of Aboriginal Organisations between August 1985 and October 1986.

I think that is the subcommittee to which Senator Tambling was referring.

I have sought advice from the Minister for Transport and Communications and am able to respond as follows. I am informed that Mr Garvin Rutherford, President of the Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters (FARB), did in fact make strong criticism of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in his speech of 9 October to that organisation's annual convention. I am advised that as a result the ABT wrote to Mr Rutherford on 13 October indicating a preliminary view that his comments amounted to contempt of the ABT in terms of section 25ab of the Broadcasting Act. That letter from the ABT was sent to the Minister for Transport and Communications for his information. I understand that at this stage the ABT is awaiting a reaction from Mr Rutherford on the matter.

       <para>
        As to whether the Government considers it reasonable for FARB to criticise the ABT, I think that is appropriately a matter best left to FARB and the ABT themselves to sort out. I simply note that the role and functions of the ABT are, as Senator Lewis would know, the subject of an internal departmental review already and, moreover, examination by the House of Representatives Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. As to the article in yesterday's Australian entitled `Why the ABT must go', to which Senator Lewis made further, possibly rhetorical, reference, I understand this article is simply raising the question as to whether the ABT is still an appropriate form of regulatory authority, given the current direction of broadcasting and broadcasting technology. As I have already mentioned, these matters are the subject of an inquiry, both in the Department and by a parliamentary committee.

        —Earlier today, in the first reading debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1988, Senator Chaney took the opportunity to talk about the administration of Aboriginal affairs. By the time I tuned in, in my office, he was about half way through his remarks. It was somewhat disconcerting to hear what he said in relation to the question of whether evidence given before an Estimates committee, of which I was the duty Minister, was indeed accurate and truthful. The question really was whether certain persons had been funded by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to appear before the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. In relation to that matter, the Hansard pink reads:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       They were departmental funds, public funds. We therefore believe that the answer given by Senator Tate was not accurate. The Parliament was effectively misled.
      </para>
      <para>
       I want to say categorically that at no stage did I seek, nor would it ever be my intention, to mislead the Estimates Committee in relation to this matter. Most senators probably would not have realised that Senator Chaney would take the opportunity of the first reading of a tax Bill to talk about Aboriginal affairs and therefore they may not have tuned in to the early part of his speech, even if they were interested in that matter. Many of those members of the public listening to the broadcast would have heard this peroration which appears to suggest that I effectively misled the Senate Estimates Committee in relation to this matter.

        —In raising this matter in the first reading debate this morning, and in subsequently referring it to you, Mr President, as a matter of privilege, I certainly intended to make it clear that I was not suggesting that the Minister for Justice intentionally misled Estimates Committee E. In the earlier part of my remarks this morning, when I set out my concerns, I referred to the Hansard account and to the Minister. I said

      </para>
      <para>
       I wish to make it abundantly clear that the concerns that I have in no way touch any suggestion that Senator Tate intentionally misled the Estimates Committee E. My specific point was that advice was given by an official to Senator Tate which he then gave to the Estimates Committee and I am concerned that that advice might be wrong. I want to assure Senator Tate that I was not personally reflecting on him in any way.

        Dear Minister,
       </para>
       <para>
        At its meetings of 20 October 1988 and 3 November 1988 the Committee considered the Casino Control Ordinance 1988 being ACT Ordinance No. 72 of 1988. The Committee draws to your attention the following matters.
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) Excluded Persons
       </para>
       <para>
        Section 69 provides that the Commissioner of Police may direct the casino licensee to exclude certain persons from the casino and, under section 6, the casino licensee must keep and provide a list of such people or incur a severe penalty.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee considers that the Commissioner should be required to keep a list as it is the Commissioner's list. In addition it appears there is no provision for the person who is being excluded to be informed. The Committee notes that the Christmas Island Ordinance does require such service.
       </para>
       <para>
        (b) Inspectors
       </para>
       <para>
        Section 8 provides that the Minister may appoint any public servant or employee as chief casino inspector. No level of officer or qualifications are specified for this most important officer.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee considers that means of identification of inspectors and their powers are generally appropriate. Section 14, however, gives wide powers to require certain acts and, having specified in s. 14 (2) (a) that the inspector is to give ``notice in writing'', s. 14 (2) (b) derogates from this by providing that the notice may be given orally ``where the inspector is satisfied that special circumstances make it appropriate''. The Committee suggests that this discretion should be limited by spelling out some criteria or requiring an emergency situation or, at least, requiring a test of reasonableness.
       </para>
       <para>
        (c) Financial
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee believes that s. 17 dealing with the payment of fee and tax where the casino licence is suspended should include a reference to the licence fee having been determined under s. 15 as the tax is properly recorded as having been determined under s. 16.
       </para>
       <para>
        (d) Tabling
       </para>
       <para>
        Section 21 provides for the tabling of information before both Houses but gives the Houses no more authority. The Committee would welcome your comments on this.
       </para>
       <para>
        (e) Membership of Authority
       </para>
       <para>
        Section 25 provides for a Chairperson and 4 other members of the authority, appointed by the Minister. Section 27 (2) provides that ``If a member ceases to hold office before the end of the appointment, another person may . . . be appointed . . .'' Unless it were very near the end of a term, given the importance of the Authority's powers, the Committee considers it should be obligatory to fill vacancies.
       </para>
       <para>
        (f) Operational Arrangements
       </para>
       <para>
        Section 52 (3) provides that the Minister is to have regard to recommendations made by the authority as to the suitability of a proposed lessee. The Committee considers it unusual that provision is not made for the Authority to make recommendations in relation to the casino licensee who is more likely to be involved in the actual operations of the casino.
       </para>
       <para>
        (g) Equipment
       </para>
       <para>
        Section 60 provides that the Authority ``may'' approve equipment. The committee considers this should be ``shall''.
       </para>
       <para>
        (h) People to be removed
       </para>
       <para>
        Section 66 (3) (b) (i)-(v) list classes of people who may be asked to leave the casino. Section 68 (1) (b) (i) provides that the licensee commits an offence for ``knowingly or recklessly'' failing to remove the first four classes of people, but not people who have ``previously contravened the approved rules of an authorised game or rules of conduct in force in the casino.'' The committee recognizes that the first four classes are situations where a person ``appears'' to do something and that would be actually observable in the casino, whereas the fifth is not that situation. On the other hand, however, the offence is only committed ``knowingly or recklessly''. The Committee would welcome further information on this point.
       </para>
       <para>
        (i) Cheques
       </para>
       <para>
        Section 80 (2) provides that the period for presentation of Cheques is to be specified by Gazette notice by the Minister. The Committee considers that this may be more appropriately done by regulation, so that Parliament would be aware of the matter and it would be subject to disallowance.
       </para>
       <para>
        (j) ``Dice''
       </para>
       <para>
        Section 109 (3) (c) states that an ``illegal thing'' includes ``dice that has been marked, loaded . . .''. The Committee believes the wording should be ``a dice that has been marked, loaded . . .'' or ``dice that have been marked, loaded . . .''.
       </para>
       <para>
        (k) Review of decisions
       </para>
       <para>
        Provisions for review of decisions are included in ss. 125-127 and the Committee notes many decisions are reviewable.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee also notes, however, that certain decisions which appear similar are not subject to review. The Committee would be grateful for comments on why the following decisions are not subject to review: s. 20 (3) and (5) (secrecy and divulgence of information); s. 39 (1) (approval of developer and owner); s. 40 (development agreement and variation); s. 41 (sale of casino); s. 42 (control agreement and variation); s. 45 (grant of licence); s. 48 (suspension of licence); s. 49 (procedures); s. 50 (assignment of licence); s. 52 (lease of casino by developer or proprietor); s. 53 (casino operation agreement); s. 54 (variation of lease or agreement); s. 86 (provision of information about casino employee); s. 96 (provisional casino employee's licence); and s. 129 (directions to management).
       </para>
       <para>
        An additional point here is why the word ``owner'' is used in ss. 39 (1) and 41 (1) instead of the defined word ``proprietor'' used, for example, in ss. 42 and 43. The word ``ownership'' is also used in s. 40 (1).
       </para>
       <para>
        (l) Forms
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee notes that many sections of the Ordinance refer to forms approved by the Minister: some of these are s. 50 (4) (b) (assignment of casino licence); s. 52 (4) (application for approval of lease of casino); s. 86 (1) (b) (information relating to casino employees); s. 89 (application for casino employee's licence); s. 94 (form of employee's licence); s. 96 (form of provisional employee's licence); s. 97 (application for renewal of employee's licence); s. 98 (variation of casino employee's licence) and s. 122 (form of statement of accounts). It appears there is no provision requiring tabling or even Gazettal of these forms. The Committee considers these forms should be made by regulation which would be tabled and subject to scrutiny.
       </para>
       <para>
        (m) Annual Report
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee is concerned there appears no provision for the making of an Annual Report by anyone to the Minister or to the tabling of any such report in Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee would welcome your assistance and advice in relation to these matters.

        Thank you for your letter of 3 November 1988 regarding the Casino Control Ordinance of 1988. I have dealt with the points raised in your letter below.

       </para>
       <para>
        I will amend section 8 to set a minimum qualification for this position. I agree with the point you make about the Section 14 and propose to amend it to provide that an oral direction is only to be given where the Inspector is satisfied that the circumstances amount to an emergency.

       <para>
        (d) Tabling
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government was most concerned in drafting this Ordinance to ensure that as many aspects of the commercial transactions involved as possible were disclosed to the Parliament and, through it, to the public. This is why a tabling provision has been included. However, the reality is that the Government would not be able to successfully conclude the necessary commercial transactions if they were subject to disallowance. For this reason the Government believes that it is essential that these documents not be disallowable instruments.
       </para>
       <para>
        (e) I am prepared to amend Section 27 to make the appointment of another person mandatory, provided that the Minister may decide not to make that appointment if he or she is satisfied that it would be inappropriate to do so, having regard to the small size of the remainder of the appointment period.
       </para>
       <para>
        (f) Operational Arrangements
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that the existing provisions of the Ordinance will meet the Committee's concerns. Under sub-paragraph 23 (1) (d) (ii) the Authority is given the function of making recommendations to the Minister on the suitability of a proposed Casino licensee. Under subsection 45 (4) the Minister must have regard to the Authority's recommendations concerning such a person.

        (k) Review of decisions
       </para>
       <para>
        I agree to making a decision under subsection 20 (3) reviewable. However, it is not appropriate to make a decision under subsection 20 (5) administratively reviewable, because the resulting delay may frustrate the purpose for which the information is being disclosed to a court. Instead, I propose to amend subsection 5 to provide that the Minister shall give the subject of the information such notice of his or her intention as is reasonably practical in the circumstances, so that the person would have the opportunity of applying to the court concerned for an order that the information not be disclosed to certain (or all) persons.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not appropriate to make decisions under sections 39, 40 and 41 administratively reviewable because these decisions are essentially of a commercial and policy nature. The same applies to decisions under Sections 42 and 45. Nevertheless, a number of the decisions which you mentioned adopt a formula under which a Minister is not to approve something unless he or she is satisfied that certain requirements are met. I propose to amend each of these sections so that the Minister is required to grant the approval concerned, unless he or she is satisfied that these requirements are not met. This will have the effect of making it easier for a person adversely affected to apply for judicial review of the relevant decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        I agree to make decisions under Sections 48 and 49 reviewable, but cannot agree to this in respect of Sections 50, 52, 53 and 54, again because of the policy and commercial nature of these decisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        In respect of Section 86, providing for administrative appeal may frustrate the operation of the section by virtue of the delay involved. However, it would be open to an employee to seek judicial review in the event of an abuse of the Authority's power under this Section.
       </para>
       <para>
        I agree to make decisions under Section 96 administratively reviewable. It is not appropriate that decisions under Section 129 be administratively reviewable, again because of the time factor: a series of appeals against directions could totally frustrate the proper control of the Casino. However, I propose to amend the section to require that directions given be reasonable.
       </para>

        I agree to the Committee's suggestion about the word `owner'.
       </para>
       <para>
        (l) Forms
       </para>
       <para>
        Given the nature of this Ordinance I am prepared to make forms subject to tabling and disallowance. I propose that this be done by making forms `disallowable instruments' under the provisions of the Interpretation Ordinance 1967, but I am prepared to do this by regulation if the Committee believes this to be essential. My consent in this case is not to be taken as a general precedent that forms should be made as legislative instruments: it will depend on the circumstances in each case.

        The Opposition today raises a matter of great urgency which I believe has enormous consequences for the people of Australia both in the short term and in the long term. The recent disgraceful events involving visiting warships have already had serious repercussions with our allies. The Opposition is concerned that the long term implications for our standing in the region will also be left at risk if a clear commitment is not given speedily by the Australian Government to take all action necessary to ensure that visiting warships of friendly nations can dock and be serviced unimpeded in Australian ports.
       </para>

        I draw honourable senators' attention to the plight of the Ark Royal and her supply ship Fort Grange, denied tug assistance by the Seamen's Union of Australia and therefore unable to berth in the port to which they were invited by the Federal Government as bicentennial guests. Honourable senators will also be aware that the USS Ingersoll was unable to leave port for the same reason-union refusal to provide assistance. Perhaps less well known is the fact that this internationally embarrassing exhibition of union power followed the ships around the country to Adelaide and Perth. As a result, the Ark Royal decided not to berth in Port Adelaide and HMAS Edinburgh had to berth in Adelaide's outer harbour, rather than Port Adelaide proper, due to partial union bans. The only reason the bans were not total was that the Edinburgh carried Prince Andrew. Had it been prevented from berthing, there would have been no royal visit to Adelaide. And so on to Perth, where our national humiliation was made complete. There the Construction Mining and Energy Workers Union of Australia, in particular the port's crane drivers and operators, refused to service the Ark Royal; so gangways could not be swung into position to allow the ship's crew to come ashore. These ships were in the country at the invitation of the Federal Government.

        The episode is well known. Yet at a time when recent events such as the disputes on the Papua New Guinea-Indonesia border clearly demonstrate that we live in a volatile environment, at a time when such issues impact directly upon Australia, and at a time when the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) is laudably trying to protect Australia's leadership and strength in our region, there is a compelling need to remind ourselves of these shameful events. The first and very serious result of these actions is that we have jeopardised Australia's standing as a member of the Western alliance. All the regrets and apologies in the world are not enough in this situation. Apologies and regrets cannot guarantee that the episode will not happen again and cannot restore our tarnished international reputation. Our reliability as an ally has been called into question and we need to act now so that Britain and America will be sure that the episode will not ever be repeated again. If we need to call on our friends in a time of emergency or, heaven forbid, in a time of war, we need them to see that we have taken the necessary legal steps to ensure that it cannot happen again. If we cannot convince our Western allies of our reliability or of our Government resolve, how can Australia hope to project a vital image of strength and stability for our immediate neighbours to look to and respect? Likewise, on the world stage, how can we hope to conduct diplomatic business in all seriousness when our international honour and credibility have been severely damaged?
       </para>
       <para>
        All around us world trading blocs are being formed which may result in the isolation of Australia. Understandably, our trade and foreign Ministers are roving the world putting Australia's case to prevent this from happening. If they are to succeed, they must be able to argue from a position of strength. They must be able to speak on behalf of a Government which is demonstrably in control of its country and therefore capable of guaranteeing trade contracts. Sadly, this incident has to undermine their case.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) promised to speed up our acquisition of naval tugs. But extra tugs will not remedy the damage done, nor will they prevent a repeat performance. After all, there were tugs on hand at Perth, and they could do nothing about the crane operators. Access means nothing without the guaranteed availability and facilitation of supplies and service. That is the whole point of access. Tugs cannot guarantee supplies and service, which are still subject to the whims of unions. What we need is a strong commitment to see that these events can never be repeated and that we are prepared to fulfil our obligations. Foreign policy has to be decided upon, and implemented by governments-not only by individuals acting independently of government.
       </para>
       <para>
        The friendly visits to Australia of foreign warships are an important part of our obligation to the Western alliance, and as such are vital to our national defence and security. This is particularly relevant when we consider our own limited naval capability in the context of the current political and military instability of our closer neighbours. Not having much time, I skate over the region. We have problems in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, as I mentioned. We have had problems in Vanuatu, continuing problems in Fiji and difficulties with New Caledonia. This morning we heard about the conflict in the Maldives. We have an incomprehensible build-up in the Indian Ocean of the Indian navy. There has been trouble in the Straits of Lombok and Sunda, and continuing tensions in the Philippines over the renegotiation of the United States bases.
       </para>
       <para>
        While recognising the steps taken by the Government to re-equip our Navy, we do not as yet have any great capacity to effectively protect our shipping lanes. In these circumstances, how much more important are the naval capabilities of our friends in extending our defence capability? Given that the defence White Paper records a strong belief in the importance to Australia's defence of the Western alliance-a belief which is shared by the Opposition-it is clear that this situation cannot be allowed to continue. We criticise New Zealand for its lack of support for ANZUS and its stance with Anzac ships, but we are also letting the side down. In today's editorial in the Australian it is said that there is no doubt that Australia has every reason to take a firm stance on the matter of our military relations with New Zealand. It is true that New Zealand does seem prepared to enjoy a free lunch under the United States nuclear umbrella, and it would seem half-hearted in its contribution to the Anzac arrangement. But we must take care that the United States does not react to our treatment of its ships with bluntness similar to our reaction to New Zealand. Those who criticise other people's free lunches should make sure they pay for their own tucker.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a Commonwealth and not a State responsibility to maintain Australia's defence and international arrangements. We need to see that the Federal Government is empowered to exercise that responsibility, and to prove to the world and to our allies in particular that Australia's defence arrangements are not subject to industrial negotiation or to groups of raucous individuals who seem to be able to exercise real power regardless of the wishes of a democratically elected government. I therefore urge the Government to support this motion and to urgently take steps to see that the visits of warships from friendly nations are not impeded. After all, the policy on alliances is a bipartisan policy. I would like to remind honourable senators of the defence White Paper 1987 released by the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley). I would like to draw a number of quotes to the attention of honourable senators because they emphasise the importance of this bipartisan policy. The White Paper says.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government reaffirmed Australia's natural association with the Western Community of nations and our attendant defence interests and obligations.
       </para>
       <para>
        The White Paper also says:
       </para>
       <para>
        All of our defence relationships, formal and informal, impose responsibilities on Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Defence co-operation will continue to be sustained with the United States in peacetime.
       </para>
       <para>
        Consultations between the two countries facilitate extensive co-operative activities including military training and exercises, intelligence exchanges, defence science and technology, communications and logistics co-operation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly, the alliance is extremely important to this country. It extends our defence capability in no uncertain terms. The White Paper goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        The defence relationship with the United States gives confidence that in the event of a fundamental threat to Australia's security, US military support would be forthcoming.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a most vital statement, in my view. The White Paper goes on to refer to the five-power defence arrangement:
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the five-power defence arrangement Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom cooperate to support the security of Singapore and Malaysia.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is on the basis of all that that we have a bipartisan policy of being good allies and friends, an attitude which, sadly, we have not seen too much of in the latest visit of our friends. We believe that we also share a bipartisan view on the visits to Australia by foreign warships, although anyone could be forgiven for having believed otherwise in the past couple of months. We have to demonstrate our total and bipartisan national commitment to the Western alliance. One step which must be taken toward that end is to place the direct authority for future visits to Australia by foreign warships under the Minister for Defence. We need to ensure that tugs will always be available when needed, particularly in difficult weather conditions. We need to ensure that berthing will be unimpeded and that basic services such as power, telephone, waste disposal and resupply will all be available at the dockside. These are little enough, but they are basic to the good manners which are expected to be displayed by a host to an invited guest. We must make sure that any attempt to deny our guests these facilities in the future can be effectively dealt with and prevented.
       </para>
       <para>
        Inevitably, this has to mean that such powers must be given by legislative authority. This is particularly so because any State or Territory laws to the contrary must be overcome if the Federal Government is to exercise its defence and foreign powers. Yet those powers, and our ability to execute our obligations, have been thrown into doubt by the events of last month. The Australian people and their Government are entitled to see that no-one is able to prevent a goodwill visit by friendly warships to our ports, particularly so when they are here at our invitation. Our international reputation, our standing in our region and the willingness of friends to come to our aid in difficult times, are all affected by the ability or otherwise of the elected government to ensure that such visits are not unimpeded.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that it is only by strong and unambiguous legislation that the Government will convince the rest of the world, particularly our Western allies, that our arrangements for defence and foreign relations are run by our Government, and not by our unions, and that this episode will never happen again. This is an urgent and weighty matter of great long term importance to Australia. So I urge the support of all the Senate.

         —There is a ritual quality to these exchanges in this place on defence matters-a timeless, deathless, musty, incense-ridden, ritual quality which, I must confess, I get quite nostalgic for when I miss out on them for a few weeks in a row, as I have, it seems, recently. Because these debates have that quality and because I can, I think, deal with the issues rather succinctly, I propose to do so and to let the Opposition get on with the task of tearing at the throats of the Australian Democrats and Senator Vallentine in the way that it wants to do in the glorious irrelevance that so often constitutes debates in this chamber. I say `the Opposition, the Democrats and Senator Vallentine' because the Government really has no particular quarrel-Senator Newman might be disappointed to know-with the text of the motion before us. We have a quibble or two about particular words, but we certainly do not think the topic justifies the urgency with which it is surrounded by this procedure. Nonetheless, we do not oppose the basic sentiments that it contains. I do not say that just because I have been conned by Senator Newman's opening and rather disarming reference to my recent laudable diplomatic forays. I will be much more polite than might otherwise have been the case, but I can assure Senator Newman that that does not mean that we would otherwise have any basic problems with the motion. Let me explain why by going through the terms of it. It states first of all:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        that the recent visit of warships from friendly nations to Australia for the Bicentennial was at the invitation of the Federal Government;
       </para>
       <para>
        Indeed, it was. Moreover, it was a great success. Some 33 ships from 16 nations visited 24 different ports around Australia in what has been hailed, I think quite rightly, as a high point of our bicentennial celebration. Secondly, the motion goes on:
       </para>
       <para>
        that the Defence White Paper acknowledges the need for Australia to maintain a credible defence deterrent capability;
       </para>
       <para>
        Indeed, it does. Moreover, it needs to be acknowledged that this Government in the White Paper has put forward for the first time a comprehensive, coherent defence strategic analysis and defence policy for Australia, building on the principle of self-reliance and creating a consistent and constructively thought-through scenario for the way in which that self-reliance policy can be budgeted for and put in place over the years ahead. All of that is in quite spectacular contrast, it has to be said, with the Opposition's approach to defence policy. I am indebted to Senator Newman for acknowledging the Defence White Paper in the terms that she has because it rather suggests, as is the case, that the Opposition has no credible alternative defence policy of its own and is quite content to rest with the Government's.

I do not know whether it will do a retread as it did with Mr Beale's education policy, which was the product of the photocopier, as Mr Dawkins made so clear yesterday in the other place, or whether it does have something new to say. Whatever the case may be, we have not seen it. We are told that it has been to the shadow Cabinet but we have not heard anything more about it. It apparently having been knocked back by the shadow Cabinet-which is the only assumption one can make after tailing its history so far-it seems that the Opposition's policy and its spokesmen are in a condition of some confusion. We await with fascination the next episode in that respect.

        Senator Newman goes on to say in her motion that a credible defence deterrent capability should include the maintenance of our support for the Western alliance. Of course, we agree. I make the point that our policy includes, also for the first time, a very rigorous analysis of the essential role of the United States alliance in our defence policy. That commitment to the United States alliance is not, however, born solely of purely in-house considerations-concerns for Australia's immediate physical security; our commitment to the Western alliance is part of our commitment to larger global security issues, not only in the context of the maintenance of an effective nuclear deterrence strategy but also because alliances of the kind in which we participate with the United States are an important element in the stabilisation of the whole global order. For all those separate and interrelated reasons, we agree with that proposition. The motion goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        that the instability in our region demonstrates the need for Australia to exercise sensitive leadership and to maintain our international reputation and influence in our region;
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it overstates the situation a little to talk in terms of the instability of the region. Obviously, events have occurred in the South Pacific over the last year and a half which have given cause for concern, at least so far as the domestic situation of a couple of countries is concerned. Nonetheless, there is no evidence of any wider regional implications and I think it is possible to exaggerate again some of the things, for example, the recent border controversies between Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. All of those things have to be seen in their context. But it is, of course, the case that the Government needs to continue to maintain and, as far as is possible, enhance our defence relationships and our strategic role throughout the region, bearing in mind that our defence policy does cover and define an area of broader strategic interests than Australia's own shores, an area which encompasses the whole of South East Asia and the South Pacific, indeed a quarter of the earth's surface.
       </para>
       <para>
        What we have done, faced with that reality, is set about consolidating and enhancing our defence relationships with the countries of the region through the five-power defence arrangement, which is the subject of a good deal of renewed interest by the other regional members, Malaysia and Singapore in particular, with a view to possibly further developing that arrangement. We have consolidated and advanced our position through the joint declaration of principles with Papua New Guinea signed in December 1987, which was the subject of an extremely successful two-day ministerial forum, focused on a whole variety of defence and regional issues, which was held over the last two days in Papua New Guinea.

        The other point that is worth making in terms of regional defence relationships is the extremely interesting statements that have been made recently by General Murdani, the Indonesian Defence Minister, during my visit there and in particular publicly in the context of his speech to the Australian-Indonesian Business Cooperation Council in Bali last week, where he foreshadowed an interest in a renewed kind of defence cooperation with Australia, on essentially a basis of equality and mutual participation in ways which remain to be defined but which nonetheless recognise the reality that both countries are major, significant players in the region and need to operate in an environment of constructive cooperation, and not the converse. So all of that is true and none of that causes any particular difficulty except, as I say, I would not wish to overemphasise the instability. I think it is possible to overstate that. What is important is that we act constructively, in the way we have been, to minimise the potential of any such developments as do occur to create problems for the region and ourselves in particular.

        The question of our reputation, which is also part of the paragraph, I think justifiably deserves some reference. I do not think our reputation could stand any higher than it does around the South Pacific in defence terms with the constructive nature of the relationship we have been developing, the Pacific patrol boat program, I suppose, being the most obvious recent manifestation of that. Our relationship with South East Asia is, I think, reflected by what I have just said about the renewed interest in Australian participation and upgrading that is involved with the five-power defence arrangement by the reaction of Indonesia in the way I have just described. Our reputation with the United States could scarcely stand higher, as has been amply demonstrated by some things that have recently been put on record. Admiral Hayes, the now retired Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific forces, on 17 May at the National Press Club in Canberra said:

        . . . there is therefore an urgent need-
       </para>
       <para>

       </para>
       <para>
        for the Government to take all action necessary to ensure that visiting warships of friendly nations can dock and be serviced unimpeded in Australian ports.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reality of the situation is that the vast majority of port visits that did occur last month went ahead without disruption. I have described them-33 ships, 16 nations and 24 different ports. Wherever possible, when industrial action did deny a particular service to a visiting ship, the Navy provided the service instead. The only visit which was actually disrupted in any significant way by industrial action was the visit of the Ark Royal to Melbourne. Because of bad weather the ship could not berth without tugs and no naval tugs were available in Melbourne, which is not a base, and has not been hitherto, for Royal Australian Navy warships. The Government, as I made clear at the time, and as I certainly repeat now, does deeply regret the union action and the demonstrations, for that matter, that accompanied it which at times went well beyond the exercise of the right to express one's views-a right, of course, that we acknowledge.
       </para>
       <para>
        We unequivocally support visits to our ports by allied warships and we accept the policy of neither confirming nor denying the presence of nuclear weapons aboard such ships. I make that point because of the reported comments yesterday of the Victorian Premier, Mr Cain, suggesting that the visit could have gone ahead if the United Kingdom had confirmed that nuclear weapons were not aboard the Ark Royal. I make the point for the record-it is hardly a new one-that we, of course, continue to support a `neither confirm nor deny' policy as the only credible way of responding on this issue.
       </para>
       <para>
        The disruption that did occur-major in the case of the Ark Royal and minor only elsewhere-is, for the reasons that I have indicated, anathema to the Government. The Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) has made that clear publicly and I repeat it now. We have decided to take steps to ensure that in the future the Navy itself is able to berth its own and visiting warships anywhere in Australia. We have decided specifically, as has been announced, to bring forward the purchase of naval tugs which had been planned for the proposed fleet base at Jervis Bay and to purchase a tug as a trial and recovery ship for the submarine project in South Australia. We believe that that and other measures that may prove appropriate and necessary will be the solution.

While it might be a cause of satisfaction for the macho instincts-or whatever the female equivalent of that is-of those opposite, it would be highly unlikely, in practice, to resolve the problem. What we are about is resolving problems. The course that we have decided upon is, by contrast, a practical and effective response. The threatened trouble in Adelaide, for example, was not averted by bullying. It would not have been averted by legislative bullying of the kind the Opposition proposes. It was averted by a reasoned approach by the Government to the union. That is the way we will proceed. We will respond in a sensible, measured, reasonable and responsive way to resolve these problems as they arise. With the utmost respect, we do not need an urgency motion from the Opposition, let alone one moved by Senator Newman, to make us conscious of our responsibilities in this respect. For all those reasons, and with the odd cause for minor contretemps along the way, but not seriously, I indicate that the Government does not oppose the motion which has been moved.

        Senator Newman, and I assume therefore the remainder of the Opposition speakers, see this issue in terms of disruption of a bicentennial celebration-the spoiling of a party. That is rubbish. This issue is about life and death. It is about the potential for nuclear war. Totally and utterly it is about the survival of human kind. It is in those terms that the Australian Democrats address this urgency motion.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Newman cited the embarrassment and inconvenience resulting to some warships from the lack of servicing available to them. What a pathetic argument that was. We are talking about the most sophisticated naval warships on earth. Hopefully they can survive more than this transient embarrassment of a temporary lack of servicing in one port which they were visiting as part of a so-called celebration.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Democrats are categorically not against defence. We are not opposed to navies, service personnel, sailors, visiting warships or anything of the kind. On the contrary, it will have been apparent from the contributions that I and other Democrats have made to debates in recent times that our opinion is directly the opposite. We believe in a viable defence force; we believe in potent and viable navies. However-it is important that this be equally clear-we are anti nuclear weapons. Therefore, we are anti nuclear warships and anti any action which encourages their development or deployment, including their presence in our harbours, albeit to attend a bicentennial naval review.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will briefly address the specific parts of the urgency motion. My interest in this issue will be apparent from the fact that on 27 September, during the period of these visits, I asked a question of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Defence. I draw the Senate's attention to that question and to the reply which focused on the question of contingency plans in relation to visiting warships. I was alarmed, as I would imagine most Australians were alarmed, to find that there were no contingency plans relating to possible actions concerning visiting nuclear warships. It is for that reason that those brave people took those actions in Melbourne when they did. It is for that reason that they expressed the opinion of 66 per cent of Australians that they did not want those visiting nuclear warships-I emphasise, visiting nuclear-powered or armed warships-in our harbours. The majority of Australians do not want them in our harbours. We praise and applaud the action of those people who opposed their entry and opposed their servicing in our harbours.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, a number of obvious, soft platitudes could be uttered in relation to this motherhood urgency motion. I will not address the first few points because it is obvious that we need adequate leadership in our region; it is obvious that we need adequate defence; it is obvious that we need an adequate, well structured and potent navy. It is obvious that our Government should provide these things. I turn my attention, however, to the last part of the urgency motion which is what it is all about: the offensive, unnecessary and potentially dangerous visitation of nuclear armed and nuclear powered warships. I draw the attention of honourable senators to Senator Robert Ray's answer to my question of 27 September which centred on the question of contingency plans for nuclear accidents. The Minister, in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Defence, said:
       </para>

        An accidental nuclear detonation is essentially impossible. Secondly, the chance of any kind of accident involving a nuclear weapon is virtually nil.

         —What an extraordinary intervention! I will cite some of the nuclear accidents that have occurred in relation to nuclear powered and nuclear armed ships of the type that entered our ports. In April 1963 the nuclear reactor on the USS Thresher shut down while the submarine was on sea trials off the New England coast. The submarine plunged to the sea floor, imploding and killing all 129 hands on board. The reactor's remains lie on the ocean bottom. In January 1966 an airborne collision occurred above Palomanes in Spain between a United States KC135 refuelling tanker and a B52 bomber loaded with four hydrogen bombs. Three bombs scattered radioactive material on sea and land.

        In 1967 there was a core meltdown resulting in a major radiation leak aboard the Soviet icebreaker Lenin. This accident is believed to have killed 30 people and rendered the ship too radioactive to be used for over three years. In May 1968 the nuclear-powered attack submarine USS Scorpion mysteriously sank in the Atlantic Ocean with all hands aboard. In 1970-71 a Soviet November class nuclear-powered submarine reportedly sank in the Atlantic Ocean. In the spring of 1982 during the Falklands war four British ships-the Sheffield, Britannia, Ardent and Coventry-which were reported to have carried anti-submarine nuclear depth bombs, sank. In the summer of 1983, a Soviet nuclear-powered submarine sank in the North Pacific, and 90 crew members were killed. In October 1986 there was an explosion aboard a Soviet Yankee class nuclear- powered submarine in the Atlantic. The submarine sank with 10 nuclear missile warheads and a nuclear reactor. I would like to develop on that last accident further. The notes I have on the accident state:
       </para>
       <para>
        On 3 October 1986, an explosion ripped through an SS-N-6 submarine-launched ballistic missile aboard the Soviet `Yankee' class submarine, while it was in the Atlantic Ocean approximately 2,000 kilometres southeast of New York. At least three Soviet crewmen died from the blast. Three days later, seawater flooded the damaged hull while it was under tow and the submarine sank to the bottom of the Atlantic.
       </para>
       <para>
        A single one megaton nuclear warhead-or possibly two one hundred kiloton warheads-were probably ejected from the missile tube by the force of the explosion. At least 15 more nuclear weapons went down with the submarine, each containing several kilograms of plutonium.
       </para>
       <para>
        A complete nuclear reactor, with a radioactivity inventory of around one billion curies (twenty times greater than the amount released at Chernobyl) also went down. The impact of the hull striking the ocean floor-at an estimated velocity of 200 kilometres per hour-combined with the deep ocean pressure and the force of the original explosion, almost certainly damaged both the reactor's containment structure and the missile warheads.
       </para>
       <para>
        This incident is only one of scores, possibly hundreds of environmental disasters caused by the five nuclear navies. Because the navies evade public scrutiny, little or nothing is known about most of these calamities.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yet the Minister sits here and tells us that it is not necessary to have a contingency plan because nuclear accidents do not occur. He says that they are virtually impossible, yet I have just cited 15 such calamities since 1977.

        Of course, the potential for nuclear disaster has not gone unnoticed by the authorities of at least some of the world's leading cities. I have a detailed report of the special consultants which was handed to the authorities in New York. They decided that it was utterly unthinkable to consider the entry of such nuclear-powered ships into their harbour-the harbour of a city which has a population only a little less than that of the whole of Australia. One paragraph from the consultant's report states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Past nuclear weapon accidents have caused the dispersal of plutonium into the environment, and numerous government agencies have acknowledged that such an accident could happen again. The Navy has reported an average of 32.6 nuclear weapon accidents and incidents per year between 1965 and 1985, including 66 that occurred in port. According to Navy figures, it had 638 nuclear weapon incidents and two accidents between 1965 and 1985. At least 140 of these involved nuclear weapons-including ASROC and Terrier missiles-on board ships similar to those that will be based at Staten Island.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is, if the base at Staten Island is permitted. Yet Senator Stone sits here and says that I have not cited anything that is relevant to the carriage of nuclear weapons into ports. I find that extraordinary.

         —Senator Stone actually confirms, right now, that he is prepared to accept that that was his proposition. I find it difficult to differentiate between the degree of irresponsibility in the answer I got from the Minister on 27 September, when he said that there was no contingency plan, that there was no likelihood of accidents-in light of which I have just presented evidence to the Senate-and in fact that it was unnecessary therefore to have a contingency plan, and the level of irresponsibility contained in this urgency motion today. The motion says that it is inappropriate for courageous Australians in a democracy, in an age of potential nuclear war, to deny the access of such vessels into Australian ports. I admire their courage. I am alarmed by what I hear from the responsible Ministers in this chamber. I am alarmed by the fact that Senator Newman did not have enough perception and penetration of insight or enough information available to realise that this motion is utter irresponsible rubbish.

         —Today we are addressing the urgency motion put forward by Senator Jocelyn Newman, our shadow Minister for defence science and personnel. This motion springs out of the shameful occurrences in the port of Melbourne at the time of the recent bicentennial visit by ships of the Royal Navy, the United States Navy and the French Navy. The facts have already been clearly stated and there is no point in repeating them. The truth is that the facts are very well known because they are so shameful. They are shameful to the people of Victoria in particular and to the Australian people generally.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There is an additional reason for that sense of shame to be so deeply ingrained in the consciousness of the Australian people, particularly the Victorian people, at this time, and that is the visit to this country not so very many months ago by the Prime Minister of Britain, Mrs Thatcher. During a street walk in Bourke Street, Melbourne, she was harassed and set upon by a band of thugs and hooligans who were also expressing-and from precisely the same point of the political spectrum-their views about what freedom in this country constitutes.
       </para>
       <para>
        If I might digress for a moment on that topic, you may remember, Madam Acting Deputy President, that at that time I contributed an article to a London newspaper, the Daily Mail, in which I expressed my sense of personal shame over that incident. I expressed that shame lest the people of Britain should think that the actions of that mob were in any way representative of the attitudes and views of the decent majority of Australians. I expressed my personal shame at the appalling lack of security provided to the Prime Minister of Britain by the then and still Premier and Government of Victoria. I expressed my shame at the abject conduct of our own Commonwealth Government, including our own Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). In particular, I expressed my sense of shame at the fact that not even an apology was subsequently tendered to the Prime Minister of Britain for those actions whilst in our country on a bicentennial visit.

Not even the grace of a simple courtesy was extended at the time either by the Premier of Victoria or by the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia.

        I want to use the remaining minutes available to me to address the key elements of this matter. It is necessary today to place the Ark Royal incident-I will use the Ark Royal incident as shorthand for the similar treatment of our friends from the United States and the French Navy-in the context of the wider strategic interests of the Soviet Union. In a book published by Sidgwick and Jackson entitled We Will Bury You-a phrase originally uttered by Mr Nikita Khrushchev-a Mr Jan Sejna had some interesting comments to make on that matter. Mr Sejna was for many years the Secretary to the Military Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, and held the position of Chief Political Officer in the Czech Ministry of Defence until he defected from Czechoslovakia in 1968 after the Russian tanks had snuffed out the brief experiment with liberty under Mr Dubcek in that country. Mr Sejna quoted Mr Boris Ponomarev, who ran the Soviet Politburo's International Committee for 30 years. Mr Ponomarev said:
       </para>
       <para>
        You must understand that if we wish to control Asia, we must first control Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Soviet activity in our region at present must be analysed in this light. It is particularly important to note that the Ark Royal incident is not an isolated event. In 1983 the communist-influenced Amalgamated Metal Workers Union refused to allow the Royal Navy aircraft carrier Invincible to go into dry dock in Sydney to undergo repairs. That ship was forced to go to Singapore to undergo those repairs. It is worth noting that the Victorian Secretary of the Seamen's Union of Australia which, of course, was the union responsible for applying the recent ban on the Ark Royal, has held the position of Vice-President of the Australia-USSR Friendship Society. It was Mr Dolman, the man in question, who moved the relevant motion at the meeting of the Victorian Trades Hall Council to the effect that these actions should be taken against the visiting warships. He did so in the name of the Anti-Nuclear Warships Committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is worth noting, having in mind Mr Dolman's connection with the Australia-USSR Friendship Society, that the nature of the relations between that society and the Soviet Embassy in Canberra was spelt out by Mr David Combe during the Hope Royal Commission on Australia's Security and Intelligence Agencies. The report of that Royal Commission said, in recognition of the evidence tendered on that matter at that time, that, the Australia-USSR Friendship Society has close links with the Soviet Embassy in Canberra. The significance that the Soviet Union places on Australia-I say this despite all the material we are being deluged with at the moment about perestroika and glasnost and matters of that kind; all of which I welcome, so far as they go-is evidenced by the stationing in Australia of Mr Valery Zemskov. Mr Zemskov has been recently exposed by Mr John Barron, writing in the current issue of the Readers' Digest, as a member of Directorate R of the Soviet Union. Directorate R was apparently formed after the mass expulsion of a very large number of senior KGB and GRU officers-139 of them in fact-from the United Kingdom in 1971. That body, which operates under the cloak of being a body primarily concerning itself with trade matters, is under the direct control of General Pitovranov, who doubles in the capacity of Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Chamber of Commerce. Mr Zemskov's appointment in Australia was opposed at the time by senior officials in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). Their opposition to his acceptance by our Department of Foreign Affairs was overriden by that Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, as it is now called. Nevertheless, Mr Zemskov's membership of Directorate R is known to our ASIO and, in the light of some denials emanating from the Soviet embassy, it is entirely possible that, until at least the expose of the last few weeks, even the KGB resident in Canberra may not have been aware of Mr Zemskov's role, because indeed the role of Directorate R has been so highly secretive, even within the Soviet Union itself, that the KGB would not necessarily have been aware of the existence of this body.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is interesting to note, in the half a minute remaining to me, that Mr Zemskov in January 1987, last year, actually distinguished himself by denying the existence at that time of the Soviet naval base at Cam Ranh Bay. This is a man who, in his role as a diplomat, promotes within the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade the virtue of what I suppose would be called New Zealand's defence policy, that policy which is so eloquently expounded in this chamber by our senatorial colleagues in the Australian Democrats and by representatives of the Nuclear Disarmament Party, including Senator Vallentine, who is about to follow me in this debate.
       </para>
       <para>
        I conclude by saying that I welcome the Government's acceptance of, or non-opposition to, the terms of this motion. I can only trust that, when another episode of this kind occurs, the Government will indeed live up to the view expressed in the final paragraph of Senator Newman's motion, which calls upon the Government to accept the need to take all action necessary to ensure that visiting warships of friendly nations can dock and be serviced unimpeded in Australian ports.

         —I would like to thank Senator Newman for this very interesting opportunity to discuss the visits of nuclear-armed, nuclear-powered warships to Australia, although I note in the wording of her urgency motion the amazing omission of the word `nuclear'. I wonder whether it has not occurred to the Opposition that it is the fact that these ships are nuclear-armed that people in Australia are objecting to. Has the Opposition not twigged to the fact that that is what over 50 per cent of Australians are now opposing? The entry of nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed warships into Australian ports is increasingly unpopular internationally. This is part of an international campaign. In western Europe, in Spain and in Denmark there are clear indications of a great deal of antinuclear sentiment as far as warship visits are concerned. Some of the organisations that are involved in this international opposition are: the North Atlantic Network, the Campaign to De- Nuclearise the Irish Sea; the Greenpeace International Campaign to Disarm the Seas; the Pacific Campaign to Disarm the Seas. We have to look at the fact that the Soviet nuclear navy in the Baltic has also been protested against by Greenpeace, the international organisation. It held up the docking and barred the way of a Soviet vessel bearing nuclear weapons earlier this year. In the Pacific, closer to home, it is not only New Zealand that has an anti-nuclear position but also Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands. There are ongoing campaigns in the Philippines against the presence of nuclear weapons, and in Japan, in Australia and, of course, Belau which is a tiny nation of only 15,000 people who have a genuinely nuclear-free constitution.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There is also a campaign for the demilitarisation of the Indian Ocean. In the United States itself there are campaigns against the home porting of nuclear naval vessels, in New York and San Francisco in particular. Senator McLean referred to the New York opposition and it is indeed a very vocal opposition of people in that large city and it is the same in San Francisco where people do not want nuclear weapons coming into their ports.

       <para>
        The only point of Senator Newman's motion that I can actually agree with is point (a). They were warships of friendly nations which were invited to participate in our bicentennial naval review. That is true. They were all friendly nations and they were invited by our Government. That is about where the point of agreement would have to end. The Government was very unwise to invite nuclear vessels into our ports during this bicentenary. I want to quote from an article in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of December last year. It reads:
       </para>

        The honourable senators who presented this combined and very large petition were: Senators Bruce Childs, Paul McLean and Robert Wood from New South Wales; Bryant Burns from Queensland; Jo Vallentine and Jean Jenkins from Western Australia; and Norm Sanders from Tasmania. There were seven senators from various parties presenting this petition. That was a very clear signal to the Government that we did not want nuclear warships invited into our harbours for our bicentenary. We gave the Government fair warning a year earlier than that during the seventy-fifth birthday celebrations of the Royal Australian Navy when we congratulated the Royal Australian Navy on 75 years of nuclear-free service to the nation and we said then, `But we disapprove--

         —Neither the Government nor the Opposition should have been surprised at the protest which has already been alluded to by various speakers. If there was any embarrassment caused during the bicentennial visits, it should be laid firmly at the door of the Government and particularly at the door of the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) who has been better labelled `Minister for Nuclear Risks'. He is putting the country and the people of Australia at risk by inviting nuclear weapons into our ports. We do not like that and we have a right to say no. There are no safety plans dealing with nuclear weapon accident possibilities. Yet, Kim Beazley plays God and says that a nuclear weapon accident will not happen. I quote from the television program, the 7.30 Report, on 26 September 1988. Elizabeth Jackson asked:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        But accidents do happen?
       </para>
       <para>
        Kim Beazley said:
       </para>
       <para>
        No, they don't. Accidents do not happen on board these ships that come into Australian harbours.
       </para>
       <para>
        Later on in the interview he stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        There will be no accidents, none, no accidents, that involve a discharge of nuclear weapons or a problem with the reactors.
       </para>
       <para>
        How dare Kim Beazley play God-a very dangerous game, I would suggest, for any human being to play. It has been a very embarrassing time for the Minister for nuclear risks indeed. First of all, the USS Berkeley collided with the Coralita, a pleasure craft, in a Queensland port. Who will pay the damages for the problems that ensued? The Berkeley was not being interfered with by protesters on this occasion, it rammed into a pleasure craft which was due to take people out to look at one of Australia's great treasures, the Great Barrier Reef. There is still no decision about who will pay for that; yet our Minister has said that accidents will not happen in Australian ports. Admittedly, there was no emanation of radiation on that occasion, but the point still remains that ships do collide, they do have accidents in ports and out of port. Has the Minister forgotten the Voyager and Melbourne disasters in this country concerning our own Navy? We still have not found out who paid for the damage that the USS New Jersey caused when it rammed the Brisbane wharf a couple of years ago. So there have been accidents in our ports with warships bearing nuclear weapons.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second great embarrassment for Mr Beazley during the bicentennial naval review was that the HMS Edinburgh required repairs and had to limp back into Sydney. Fortunately, it did not require dry docking. But this reminds us very much of the 1983-84 debacle over HMS Invincible, also a United Kingdom ship. These ships do seem to get into a bit of mechanical difficulty. In that instance I am very grateful indeed for the very good work that was done by Brian Toohey when he uncovered in the Hayden papers, and reported in his magazine, The Eye, of September 1988, the outrageous situation that occurred when an earlier request was made for dry docking of the Invincible in an Australian port because it required repairs and it was nuclear-armed. I would like to table this document, the Hayden papers, from that magazine because it is too long for me to go into now but it very clearly shows that George Shultz wrote a press release for the Australian Government. It was used almost word for word. It was a very embarrassing incident indeed which could have been repeated on this visit had the Edinburgh not been patched up by underwater technicians so that it did not require dry docking. I seek leave to table the document.

This was followed by Mr Beazley's very embarrassing offer of reunion flights for the families who were disappointed not to be able to catch up with their loved ones in Melbourne. He promised to fly them to Perth for their reunion. My question in this place is still unanswered: how many people were involved, and how much money did that cost? How was it decided who was eligible or not for such reunion flights? It would have been very embarrassing indeed had the one sailor had three or four women requesting reunion flights with him. It could have created all sorts of problems. Yet Mr Beazley made that grandiose offer on behalf of Australians to cover his embarrassment. That was his own problem; he should have copped that full embarrassment.

        The Ark Royal has had a dreadful time indeed. It was kept out of Malta as well. It was kept out, incidentally, by the Labour Party which is in opposition in Malta and which orchestrated the demonstration against a nuclear weapons bearing ship in that port. It was kept out there for four days. Sailors on the Ark Royal must be thinking that there is something wrong with them; indeed, there is-it is called nuclear weapons on board, which Senator Newman's motion did not even refer to.

        I want to concentrate on the `neither confirm nor deny' policy which is political, not strategic. It is very important to note what was said in 1974 by the former United States Assistant Secretary of Defense Morton Halperin of the `neither confirm nor deny' policy which we have had espoused here this afternoon by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans). He said that the policy:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . is aimed at the public of allied countries. Many governments are prepared to let the United States have the ships with nuclear weapons call at their ports provided the people don't find out about it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The same former United States Assistant Secretary of Defense, in testimony to the United States Joint Committee on Atomic Energy in 1975, said this of the `neither confirm nor deny' policy:
       </para>
       <para>
        In part, this (policy) is at the request of nations where the weapons are deployed, since in most nations the existence of U.S. nuclear weapons within their borders is a difficult internal political issue. Thus they generally have requested that the United States not declassify the fact that nuclear weapons are located in their specific nation-even though the evidence that they are there is obvious and generally known by their population.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a quote from United States Rear Admiral Eugene LaRoque in 1974 when he was still operational in the United States Navy:
       </para>
       <para>
        My experience has been that any ship that is capable of carrying nuclear weapons carries nuclear weapons. They do not off-load them when they go into foreign ports such as Japan or other countries. If they are capable of carrying them, they normally keep them aboard ship at all times except when the ship is in for overhaul or in for major repair.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is common knowledge. Anybody can go to a public library and get a copy of Jane's Fighting Ships  to get very good information as to whether ships have nuclear weapons on board. I remind the Senate that this is what the Opposition is about. In the ridiculous motion put up by Senator Newman she does not even mention that fact. She also has a `neither confirm nor deny' policy-not even an acknowledgment policy. Jane's Fighting Ships  is in the research section of the Parliamentary Library, so I could not bring it down; but I assure honourable senators that it is a very heavy document. I have a copy of it in my office in Perth. There is a shorthand version for those who need to carry with them a ready reckoner. It is called Nuclear Warships and Naval Nuclear Weapons: a Complete Inventory. It is a Neptune paper put out by Greenpeace International. On that basis I am prepared to list the nuclear weaponry on board seven ships recently in Australia ports. Intercept Foundation Ltd, a research foundation in Sydney, put out a very good inventory of the seven ships which bore nuclear weapons: HMS Ark Royal, HMS Edinburgh, HMS Fort Grange, USS New Jersey, USS Ingersoll, USS Berkeley and USS Brewton. All those ships carry nuclear weapons.
       </para>
       <para>
        The technical means of verifying the presence of nuclear weapons is also available. We do not have to rely on book documentation. In 1981 Sweden detected nuclear weapons on board a Soviet whiskey class submarine which ran aground in Swedish waters. The Swedes used the gamma ray spectroscopic technique to do this. Operational nuclear weapon detectors are probably in use by all nuclear weapon states, and many non-nuclear weapon states too.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1985, Mr Robert Tickner, MHR, asked a question in the House of Representatives about whether it was possible to detect nuclear weapons on warships. Mr Beazley's reply was very interesting. It was along the `neither confirm nor deny' line, but it also suggested very strongly that in fact that capability is available to Australia. Mr Tickner, after the response he received to the question to Mr Beazley, said that he was certain that detectors were being used. He said that the existence of such devices showed that the United States was using a strategic myth to bully New Zealand. This was in 1985, soon after the warships ban had been imposed.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a political problem; it is not a strategic problem. Everybody knows which ships have nuclear weapons. It is ridiculous for nuclear navies-allied or not-to hide behind this `neither confirm nor deny' policy. Mr Gorbachev said very clearly at his final press conference in Washington after he signed the intermediate-range nuclear force agreement last year that the Soviet Union has that technical capability. So do the Americans. In light of this information, the New Zealanders have been treated absolutely disgracefully.
       </para>
       <para>
        I assure Senator Newman and Opposition senators that the opposition to nuclear- armed and nuclear-powered warships in Australia will continue until government policy changes. We are absolutely clear on that. This is happening not only in Australia but also internationally. When discussing the defence of Australia, it is important to realise that nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors coming into our ports add to our risk. They do not add to our defence.

         -I rise to support Senator Newman's motion. I will deal briefly with the previous speakers. Senator Evans, opening for the Government, showed his great interest in this by ridiculing it and talking about the glorious irrelevance of the debates of this nation. On a more serious note, he showed a fundamental misunderstanding as to what is going on in the South Pacific, our near neighbourhood. I know that Senator Evans is new to the post of foreign affairs and knows nothing about it, but I would have thought that he had been given some advice. Maybe he could not accept it. Saying that the regional instability had to be seen in perspective shows his lack of understanding. It is not the degree of instability which is the problem. The significance of the regional instability lies in the fact that what was formerly a very placid, very stable and, above all, very predictable region is now quite unpredictable, with revolts in Fiji and New Caledonia, uncertainty in Vanuatu, the border incidents in New Guinea and the troubles in the Philippines, to name but a few. I hope that before we get into too many problems in international affairs Senator Evans learns a little. His greatest mistake was saying that the alliances Australia has-I quote him precisely-are `impeccably well intact'. The reason why this motion is before us today is that those alliances are not intact, particularly the alliance with the United States. I will come to that later.

        Senator McLean spoke with the usual intellectually bankrupt line that we have come, sadly, to expect from him. What I say about the Democrats equally can be said about nuclear disarmers and others of that ilk. I congratulate Senator McLean on being awarded the golden logie, or the academy award, for the Chipp thespian of the year. He has graduated to the rank that all other Democrats hold-they can be sincere about anything. All we got from the Democrats and the Nuclear Disarmament Party was the usual unilateralist, pacifist, disarmament doctrine and the same sort of propaganda we get out of the Soviet-funded peace groups.

       <para>
        The reason this debate is before us is that there is a need for urgent remedial action to address Australia's seriously weakened security. Redress is necessary because of basic errors and neglect by this Government. The thing that Australia lacks under the Hawke Labor Government is a coherent, reasoned, intellectually thought through policy on Australia's security. Australia's security is not a matter of dealing with issues as they arise day by day. It is not simply a matter of having an Australian defence force. It is not a matter of having some flashy piece of equipment. It is a matter of putting a lot of thought into Australia's security. The one essential thing about Australia's security is that it is the first duty of the Government to protect its people. That is an ever present demand on the Government. It is a long term exercise. It requires all the resources of government to be coordinated and brought to bear to preserve the welfare of Australians in the years ahead in circumstances which simply cannot be foreseen. It is this lack of a coherent, thought-through policy, with all the instruments of the community brought together to give us the security that we are entitled to, that is so missing at present.
       </para>
       <para>
        What passes for policy under the Australian Labor Party is a mixture of the political mythology of the ALP in seeing things it wants to see in the region and in Australia's association with other countries and what the Government wants to spend on defence at the time. So the realities of the situation are concealed behind the facade of newspeak-`the credible contingencies'. For `credible contingencies' read `What Mr Beazley thinks he wants to pay for defence'. He writes the scenario to meet the expenditure that he makes. `Constrained establishments' is another of the buzz phrases being used at present. `Constrained establishments' means that the force structure and postings to units are reduced to whatever manpower or womanpower is available in the Services. It has nothing to do with the organic needs of the units. We have been beguiled into accepting that constrained establishments are the reality, whereas they are a fiction. Sadly, at present the constrained establishments are not even being met. We are way below them.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me come to the reason why we had to put this motion before the Senate today. The defence of Australia is concerned not only with Australia's essential interests but also with the interests of the region. We, on this side of the chamber, believe that our interests are involved very much in regional peace and security. We have to protect our trade routes. We have to be able to project power. We can do that only through a system of alliances. We cannot do it on our own.
       </para>
       <para>
        When we look at the defence White Paper, The Defence of Australia, published last year, which the Government quotes as its bible, we find that on page one, chapter one, paragraph 1.2 states:
       </para>
       <para>
        This policy of defence self-reliance is pursued within a framework of alliances and agreements.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will come back to that in a minute. In the Government's own words, the alliances of Australia are extremely fundamental to our security. What led Senator Newman to put this motion of urgency before the Senate this afternoon can be considered on two planes: first, we had a bicentennial naval review. Australia invited navies to send ships and crews to this country to help us celebrate our Bicentenary. The Government failed to honour the obligations that were binding on Australia towards our guests. At one level there is a gross discourtesy and a gross dishonour involved in inviting people to this country and then putting the crews and the ships physically at risk in the way the Government did.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second plane concerns the danger the Government did to the Australian alliances by refusing to supply support facilities for those ships when they were here. Australia is part of the Western democratic union of nations. We share their common defence policies. That gives us great benefits, but hand in hand with those benefits are obligations that are binding on us. One of the points that seem to be overlooked by the Democrats and by the disarmers is that alliances are not made between parties that are in power at the time. They are not things that can be acquired on a day to day basis as governments change. They are fundamental and long term, and they are between governments; they are not between parties. Therefore, they require the bipartisan support of the parliament as a whole and they have to be kept and worked at.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first thing of note in the ships visits was the absence of tugs. When I was in the United States and in the United Kingdom three weeks before the bicentennial review, defence officials at the highest level in both countries expressed concern about problems they might have with the Seamen's Union. And well they might be worried about the Seamen's Union because it is controlled by the pro-Soviet elements of the Australian Communist Party. It has a 50-year history of supporting the foreign affairs policies of the Soviets. Because the Government lacked the moral and political courage to take the Seamen's Union on, ships and crews were put at risk, particularly in Melbourne and Adelaide when bad weather prevented those ships docking.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's approach to buy tugs is a coward's way out. It treats the symptoms but not the problem. It does not get over the problem of the picket lines that were formed at Port Kembla, of the crews being spat on and physically abused, and all the other degradations that were heaped on them by the far Left and the pro-Soviet agents. Far more serious than that was the failure to grant dry docking facilities. This is why the alliances are awry. In 1983 the Government backed off from providing facilities for the HMS Invincible when it was in distress. This year, it failed to support the HMS Edinburgh when it needed dry-docking facilities. The facts of life are that the British Navy has a ship visit frequency to Australia of less than one visit a year. The Americans come here for at least 60 ship visits a year. They know they face the certainty that a ship will rub a propeller against a dockyard or a wall and that that ship will need dry- docking facilities. It is Australia's obligation to be able to provide those facilities. This Government has shown that it does not have the capacity to do that. So our alliances are in disarray because the Government has not honoured them when it has been put to the test. If those alliances are not honoured, we do not have the strength in our security that we should have. Owing to the fact that some Ministers have cut into the time available to debate this matter, I am now out of time, and with regret I move:

        TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (TAX FILE NUMBERS) BILL 1988
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, this Bill will implement measures to attack the last remaining area of widespread tax evasion in our economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        It builds upon the unprecedented action this Government has already taken in the past 5 1/2 years to close the net on tax evasion and avoidance.
       </para>
       <para>
        Right from the beginning of our period in office we announced our intention to act retrospectively against any new avoidance schemes that emerged, in one stroke wiping out a large part of the professional tax avoidance industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        That overriding commitment to nullify any reward from avoidance has been backed up by a host of specific measures aimed at particular schemes that threatened the revenue.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the same time we have given the Tax Office the necessary resources in staff and equipment to do its job properly.
       </para>
       <para>
        But much more than that, through the most comprehensive tax reform process in Australia's history, we have turned the whole psychology of avoidance on its head.
       </para>
       <para>
        The integrity of the tax system has been restored.
       </para>
       <para>
        Today people much more readily comply, simply because lower rates make compliance less of a burden.
       </para>
       <para>
        But if they choose to evade, they run the risk of much stiffer penalties, some of which had not previously been up-dated since 1936.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the same time the old loop-holes have been eliminated and closed off.
       </para>
       <para>
        Income derived from capital gains is now taxed on the same basis as income derived from employment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Fringe benefits are no longer tax preferred, the deduction for entertainment has been removed and people claiming tax deductions now have to maintain proper records.
       </para>
       <para>
        All of the proceeds of these and the other measures we have taken have been fully devoted to cutting personal income tax rates.
       </para>
       <para>
        The result is that we now have a genuinely progressive personal income tax scale.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is in complete contrast to the situation before, when what at first sight appeared a highly progressive scale was in reality highly regressive.
       </para>
       <para>
        Higher income people walked around it while lower income P.A.Y.E. taxpayers carried much more than their share.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, the same principle of lower rates, tougher enforcement and fewer concessions has been extended to the corporate sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        As recent publicity testifies, the Tax Commissioner has devoted a large part of his increased audit resources to a crackdown on company tax avoidance.
       </para>
       <para>
        I make it clear to the so-called `Tax Industry' that the commissioner's actions in this area receive the full support of the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, I stress that there is something much more fundamental than increased enforcement activity underlying the improvement in compliance from the company sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        By implementing the new imputation system of company tax we have changed the whole basis of company tax collections for the better.
       </para>
       <para>
        The new system allows tax-free dividends to be paid to shareholders if tax has already been paid at the company level.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, it removes the double taxation of dividends, and in doing so it completely reverses the previous incentive for companies to minimise their tax payments.
       </para>
       <para>
        Today, managers who arrange their corporate affairs so as to minimise tax will only be depriving their shareholders of tax-free dividend payments.
       </para>
       <para>
        Only now is there a growing recognition of the massive shift in favour of the psychology of compliance that has been brought about by the imputation system.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this way its impact is totally beneficial-it tips the balance of the system towards companies that earn genuine profits and honestly pay their full tax liability.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, as I said at the outset, this Bill mounts a fundamental attack on tax evasion, where people use false names, do not declare income, or fail to lodge returns.
       </para>
       <para>
        The measures contained in the Bill will attack these practices by increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the Australian Taxation Offices' income matching system.
       </para>
       <para>
        In doing that, they will return to the revenue $2,200 million over the next 10 years.
       </para>
       <para>
        All of this money will be redistributed in the form of tax cuts.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a clear need for action to clamp down on these evasion practices.
       </para>
       <para>
        To take one recent example, an inspection of the employment details of a firm with an annual wages bill of some $13 million revealed that less than $2 million had been included in returns lodged by employees with the Tax Office.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Tax Office estimates that tax properly payable was in excess of $5 million.
       </para>
       <para>
        In another case, in a firm with some 800 employees, over 400 resigned hurriedly on hearing of the arrival of Tax Office inspectors.
       </para>
       <para>
        That they were being less than honest with their tax affairs can be gauged from the fact that they have left behind almost $120,000 in unclaimed severance pay.
       </para>
       <para>
        The case for concerted action against such evasion is reinforced by the opportunity recently allowed by the Tax Commissioner for people who have not been lodging returns to do so without penalty or prosecution if they did by 31 October 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        For those who did not take up the Commissioner's invitation, the file number arrangements now being introduced will provide a trial for future strong enforcement action by his office.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, the Government fully shares the genuine concerns in the community for the protection of privacy.
       </para>
       <para>
        For this reason we have introduced into the Parliament a revised general Privacy Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        The revised Privacy Bill includes provisions relating to the tax file number.
       </para>
       <para>
        More specifically, the Government has also been determined to include very strict privacy safeguards in the present Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        There will be no requirement on people to produce a card or any other evidence of their tax file number.
       </para>
       <para>
        No other government or non-government agency will have access to the tax office file number registration system, nor will they be able to use an individual's tax file number for any registration system of their own.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition the Bill contains a range of quite specific privacy safeguards.
       </para>
       <para>
        New offences punishable by a penalty of up to $10,000 or two years imprisonment are proposed for a person who in unauthorised circumstances requires or requests another person to quote his or her file number, keeps a record of another person's file number, discloses another person's file number or uses another person's file number.
       </para>
       <para>
        While the tax office has an exemplary record in maintaining the confidentiality of taxpayer information, this Bill further toughens the law against disclosure.
       </para>
       <para>
        It doubles to $10,000 or two years imprisonment the penalties that already apply to unauthorised release of information by tax office employees.
       </para>
       <para>
        An equivalent offence is being introduced for disclosure of information obtained in unauthorised circumstances by non-employees.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commissioner will also be able to obtain an injunction to prevent unauthorised disclosure of information.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, I will now turn to the major features of the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        As foreshadowed in the Treasurer's statement in May, extensive consultations have been held with industry groups affected by the proposals.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those discussions have proved fruitful and the views expressed have, where possible, been incorporated in the arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        Before doing so I should record the Government's appreciation for the constructive way in which industry groups have approached the discussions with tax office officials.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Treasurer and tax officials have also discussed these measures with members of the Opposition, and in particular, the shadow Treasurer.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that the Opposition has approached this issue constructively, and has made a number of positive suggestions which have been incorporated in this Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        In particular, the Government has adopted the Opposition's suggestions on extending a withholding tax system to interest paid on bank accounts where no tax file number is quoted.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is in lieu of the original proposal to freeze bank accounts.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has also agreed to adopt the Opposition's suggestion that a similar provision apply to dividend payments on shares.
       </para>
       <para>
        This means that people will not be obliged to quote their file number to enter into a relevant transaction or operate an investment account.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, prior to receiving income from those investments the taxpayer would be able to quote his or her file number to avoid tax being deducted from the income by the payer.
       </para>
       <para>
        Further, the Government has accepted the Opposition's suggestion that the tax file numbering scheme be made completely voluntary.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill now ensures that taxpayers will in all circumstances retain the right to elect to have tax withheld at source rather than quote their tax file number.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another matter on which we have been able to agree with the opposition is that the tax file number legislation should not commence before the privacy legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The tax file number Bill now ensures that the file number system will commence on the same day as the privacy legislation that has the general support of the Opposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I stated, the essential purpose of the new file number arrangements is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Australian taxation office's income matching system as a means of furthering the attack on tax evasion.
       </para>
       <para>
        That system presently relies on names and addresses to match details contained in taxpayers' returns with those supplied to the tax office on, for example, interest and dividend advices received from companies.
       </para>
       <para>
        By providing for the use of tax file numbers rather than just names and addresses, the measures incorporated in this Bill will substantially improve the matching process.
       </para>
       <para>
        By way of example, the present reliance on names and addresses means that around 30 per cent of interest reports cannot be readily matched.
       </para>
       <para>
        Subject to certain extensions to ensure comprehensive coverage, the new arrangements will apply to the principal areas in which income reports are already received by the tax office.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first of these is employment.
       </para>
       <para>
        After the first phase of the new arrangements are commended by proclamation those starting a new job or changing jobs will be able to quote their file number on an employment declaration to their employer.
       </para>
       <para>
        If they do not, tax will be deducted from their pay at the highest rate, plus the medicare levy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Later the arrangements will extend to all employees who will be asked to lodge with their employer a revised income tax instalment declaration form and quote their file number.
       </para>
       <para>
        These arrangements will extend to recipients of unemployment or sickness benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        Pensioners, including age, invalid and service pensioners, will not be required to quote a file number; nor will children under 16 who do not earn enough to have tax taken out of their pay.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second phase of the implementation of the scheme will be its extension to investment uses.
       </para>
       <para>
        The investment areas to be covered by the legislation fall into two groups.
       </para>
       <para>
        First, interest income received from investments with banks and other financial institutions and with companies, government and semi-government authorities and solicitors' trust funds.
       </para>
       <para>
        Second, dividends from share investments and distributions from cash management and property trusts.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the May statement it was announced that the investment use arrangements would be phased in over two years from 1 July 1990.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, discussions with organisations have established that, provided there were adequate lead time, phasing arrangements were unnecessary and were, in any event, difficult to administer.
       </para>
       <para>
        Revised implementation arrangements now decided on will enable file numbers to be quoted for all new accounts opened or investments made on or after 1 July 1991.
       </para>
       <para>
        The quotation requirement will also apply for existing accounts or investments at that date.
       </para>
       <para>
        To assist in the administration of these, people will be able to quote their file numbers in respect of existing investments from 1 July 1990.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has also considered views expressed about the severity of the original sanction for non-quotation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has now decided to align the investment sanction with that proposed for employment.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is, where people have elected not to quote their file number at the time any interest or income distribution is payable, tax will be withheld at the maximum marginal rate, plus the medicare levy.
       </para>
       <para>
        In light of the new sanction arrangements and administrative difficulties identified in relation to the original proposals, the quotation arrangements for investments in shares in public companies will apply to pre-existing shareholdings at 1 July 1991, and not just new investments, as was originally proposed.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this way the rules for shares will apply on an equivalent basis to that for other forms of investments.
       </para>
       <para>
        The general rule is that the withholding sanction will apply to interest or income distributions made on or after 1 July 1991.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the case of shares the withholding sanction will apply on a pro rata basis to the extent that the dividend is not a franked dividend.
       </para>
       <para>
        As with employment, deductions made under these arrangements will not be a final tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        A person will be required to include total investment income in his or her income tax return, and credit will be allowed for any amounts deducted.
       </para>
       <para>
        Early access to funds withheld will only be possible in certain hardship cases.
       </para>
       <para>
        There will be a range of exemptions to these investment uses.
       </para>
       <para>
        For accounts with banks, building societies and credit unions in existence at 1 July 1991, there will be no need to quote a file number where interest is payable at a rate that is less than $120 per annum.
       </para>
       <para>
        This reflects the original proposal to exclude pre-existing accounts with a balance of less than $1000.
       </para>
       <para>
        Financial institutions have advised that they cannot efficiently administer a system that distinguishes accounts by reference to account balances.
       </para>
       <para>
        A file number will be able to be used in relation to all new accounts opened after 1 July 1991 irrespective of the level of interest paid.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr president the bill ensures that people receiving any part of an age, invalid or other pension from the Department of Social Security, or service pension from the Department of Veterans' Affairs, will have no need to quote a tax file number to operate bank or similar accounts, buy shares, or have dealings with other financial institutions.
       </para>
       <para>
        A person in receipt of any part of an eligible pension, benefit or allowance will be taken to have quoted a tax file number to a financial institution or other investment body upon the lodgment of a declaration with the investment body.
       </para>
       <para>
        This exemption will not apply to people receiving unemployment or sickness benefits, since in these cases there can be no expectation that the recipient will permanently remain out of the work force.
       </para>
       <para>
        Children under the age of 16 who do not have a tax file number will also have no need to obtain one for banking and other financial transactions, provided interest is payable at a rate that is less than $420 per annum.
       </para>
       <para>
        This exemption does not extend to dividend income.
       </para>
       <para>
        In order to ensure that financial institutions will have no need to quote their tax file number when making loans to their corporate or government customers such loans have been removed from the investment categories for which tax file numbers might be used.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a further measure designed to improve the efficiency of the income matching system, the Bill will also introduce an obligation on employers and investment bodies who store information on computer to supply information reports to the commissioner in a form suitable for processing by the tax office computer system.
       </para>
       <para>
        Organisations will not be required to establish computer storage systems where they do not already exist.
       </para>
       <para>
        For those who presently store information on computer, there will be exemptions from the requirements where meeting the commissioner's specifications for transmission of data would create substantial difficulties.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, as was announced by my colleague, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, there will be one other use for the tax file number.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is, as part of the higher education contributions scheme, students choosing to pay their contributions throughout the tax system will need to have a tax file number.
       </para>
       <para>
        The legislative authority for that use of tax file numbers is included separately in the legislation introduced for the higher education contributions scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        I stress at this point, that the same strict privacy safeguards I have outlined applying to this Bill apply to the use of the tax file number under the higher education contributions scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr President, as I said earlier, the measures in the Bill will result in retrieving substantial revenue that would otherwise remain uncollected.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is estimated that revenue will progressively build up from 1988-89 to the point where an additional $337 million annually will be collected by 1993-94.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those who choose to oppose these measures are choosing to allow those who are cheating on the tax system to continue to do so at the expense of the more honest members of our community.
       </para>
       <para>
        I present the explanatory memorandum and commend the Bill to the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        PRIVACY BILL 1988
       </para>
       <para>
        The first purpose of this new Privacy Bill is, like its 1986 predecessor, to regulate the collection, handling and use by Commonwealth Departments and agencies of information about individuals. The Privacy Bill will establish an independent privacy guardian, the Privacy Commissioner, within the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, to oversee these matters and handle complaints. In addition, the Bill provides guidelines for the collection, storage, use and security of tax file number information which all tax file number information users are required to comply with.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the present time, our privacy rights are protected by various existing branches of the law which provide limited protection. The laws on defamation, breach of confidence, copyright and passing off can be used to prevent unauthorised circulation of personal information or comment in various circumstances. Also, statutory secrecy provisions in Commonwealth legislation such as section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the vigilance of Parliamentary bodies and other community groups have been important in maintaining and promoting the individual's right to privacy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The enormous developments in technology for the processing of information are providing new and, in some respects, undesirable opportunities for the greater use of personal information. These developments have focused attention on the need for the regulation of the collection and use of personal information by Government agencies and for an independent community spokesperson for privacy. The Privacy Commissioner will ensure that some balance is brought to the debate as to the desirability of using the opportunities provided by new information technology to their fullest extent.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no doubt that with the greater range of services being provided, Governments are accumulating more personal information about individuals in order to provide those services efficiently and effectively. This, together with the ever-increasing capacity of modern computers to search and process information offers significant potential for invasion of personal privacy by misuse. Also, the legitimate needs of agencies in acquiring personal information and the use made of it must be balanced against the need to sustain personal privacy. It is now clear that legislation is necessary to meet the challenge that information technology is posing for the individual's right to retain some measure of personal privacy. Again, the Privacy Commissioner will have a role in providing advice to Government in this area.
       </para>
       <para>
        Internationally, there is an increasing trend for Governments to enact privacy legislation. The Council of Europe's Convention on Data Protection and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines on Personal Privacy have been developed to encourage countries to take privacy protection measures. Australia has formally signified its intention to adhere to the Guidelines and in so doing to take into account in any privacy legislation the principles set out in those Guidelines. Most European countries, the USA and Canada have enacted privacy protection legislation. It is now an appropriate time for Australia to enact such legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has been giving detailed consideration for some time to comprehensive information privacy protection legislation. In December 1983 a very detailed report and recommendations were received from the Law Reform Commission following a reference to the Commission in 1976. The recommendations included draft legislation which drew on the OECD Guidelines. In 1986 this Government introduced privacy legislation. There has been considerable comment and debate on the proposals contained in that Bill. The Government has taken account of those comments in formulating the current Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Scheme of the Privacy Bill is to enunciate a series of rules, called Information Privacy Principles, which are based on the Principles recommended by the Law Reform Commission in its draft legislation. Under the Principles, Commonwealth agencies must have a lawful purpose for collecting personal information, and the purpose must be related to the functions or activities of the collector. An agency collecting personal information from the individual to whom the information relates must see that that person is generally aware of such things as the purpose for which the information is being collected, whether it is compulsory to supply that information and the collector's usual disclosure practices in relation to that information. The Principles require agencies, when both collecting and retaining information, to see that it is relevant to the purpose of collection, up-to-date and complete. Before using any information, agencies must also check its accuracy.
       </para>
       <para>
        ``Personal information'' is widely defined to include anything-fact, true or false, or opinion-that reasonably identifies an individual.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Principles require agencies to store information records securely against loss or misuse. They are to provide information about the types of personal information they hold. Subject to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 exemptions, they are to provide an individual with access to his or her personal information records and to make corrections for accuracy, relevance and completeness. Subject to certain specific exceptions, notably for law enforcement and preservation of life, information may not be used for a purpose or disclosed to a person other than with the agreement of the individual concerned. The exceptions recognise that any claim for privacy by an individual must be considered against equally justified claims by other individuals and the community.
       </para>
       <para>
        This legislation also recognises the special nature of medical research in particular epidemiological research. To that end provision has been made to give the Privacy Commissioner and the National Health and Medical Research Council a role in the development and approval of privacy guidelines in the conduct of such research.
       </para>
       <para>
        Commonwealth agencies will be required to comply with the Information Privacy Principles. A breach of the Principles will be deemed by the Bill to be an ``interference with privacy''. Under the Bill an individual will be able to complain to the Privacy Commissioner about alleged interferences with privacy, who will attempt to resolve the allegations by conciliation and, failing that, make binding determinations against agencies, including determinations for compensation and costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        In effect, the Privacy Commissioner will be the means by which there will be accountability to the public on the use by Government of their personal information.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commissioner will be empowered to undertake random audits of agencies' databases to ensure their adherence to the Information Privacy Principles. To help agencies achieve compliance with the Principles, the Privacy Commissioner will be able to give advisory opinions, issue guidelines and examine proposed enactments for privacy implications. Where an agency believes that a current or proposed practice that may breach the Principles is nevertheless essential to its operations, it will be able to seek from the Commissioner a determination allowing the practice to continue or go ahead without risk of its being found to be an interference with privacy. Such a determination may be granted only if the Commissioner is satisfied that the public interest in permitting the practice substantially outweighs the public interest in adherence to the Principles. Such determinations will be able to be disallowed by the Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Information Privacy Principles in the Privacy Bill will apply to Commonwealth Departments and agencies to the same extent that the FOI Act applies to them.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since the 1986 Bill the Government has introduced the tax file number legislation which has substantial penalties for unauthorised requests for, recording and disclosure of tax file numbers. The Privacy Bill supplements those protections by providing additional privacy protections by way of requiring that tax file number users comply with statutory guidelines. The Privacy Commissioner, in consultation with the proposed Privacy Advisory Committee, will issue guidelines for the collection, storage, use and security of tax file number information to assist the Commissioner of Taxation and all bodies and individuals lawfully using tax file numbers on what measures should be taken to protect privacy interests. These guidelines will be reviewable by the Parliament which will be able to disallow them.
       </para>
       <para>
        To ensure that tax file number legislation does not come into operation without adequate privacy protection measures being in place, the Bill includes interim guidelines. These are expressed in broad and general terms, and it is expected that after consultation they will be replaced by more specific guidelines.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Privacy Commissioner will be able to investigate complaints about alleged misuse of tax file numbers and attempt to conciliate and, failing that, make determinations, including a determination for compensation or costs. Such determinations will not be formally binding as between the parties. If compliance with the Privacy Commissioner's determination is not forthcoming then either the Privacy Commissioner or the complainant will be able to apply to the Federal Court to have the determinations enforced. Where a complaint is made and the Privacy Commissioner considers that there may be a breach of the offence provisions of the Taxation Administration Act 1953, the Privacy Commissioner is required to inform the appropriate law enforcement authorities of the complaint and suspend his investigations until the relevant law enforcement processes are completed.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn to the Government's approach to privacy regulation in relation to the private sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have indicated, the Information Privacy Principles only apply to Commonwealth agencies. Unlike the tax file number guidelines they do not apply to the private sector. The Privacy Commissioner is required to encourage corporations to develop programs for the handling of records of personal information that are consistent with the OECD Guidelines on Personal Privacy. The Commissioner is required to report annually to the Government on the success of these arrangements. The Commissioner will be available to advise private sector bodies on privacy measures and it is hoped that corporations will take significant steps in the future in this regard. The Government will re-assess this approach following advice from the Privacy Commissioner. Of course, the tax file number guidelines will apply to the private sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        I mentioned earlier that the law of confidence is an important existing means of protecting privacy in some circumstances. The Bill includes some limited extensions of the law of confidence recommended by the Law Reform Commission which will further enhance privacy protection. The Bill also includes amendments of the FOI Act to extend the opportunities for individuals to have access to their personal affairs records and establishes the requirement for such individuals to be alerted to requests for access to those records by others. It also makes essentially machinery amendments to ensure that privacy complaints wrongly directed to other agencies are transferred to the Privacy Commissioner for investigation under the Privacy Bill without inconvenience to the complainant.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Office of Privacy Commissioner, to be established under the Privacy Bill, is expected to have a direct cost to the Government of around $970,000 in a full-year operation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Privacy Bill is the first legislation in Australia to establish a comprehensive code of privacy protection and to provide an enforceable right to privacy. It will provide a practical means for persons who have been adversely affected by a failure to comply with those standards to seek redress. It will also provide an effective mechanism for safeguarding the rights of individuals in relation to the tax file number scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        I commend the Bill to Senate.

         —I raise a matter of great concern to a large number of Australians, including many of my South Australian constituents, namely, the policy of cultural genocide now being undertaken by the Ceausescu regime in Romania. I intend to seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the majority of my speech so that it can be handled within the few minutes available to me.

        I refer in particular to a petition containing more than 5,000 signatures-the largest tabled in the Senate this year-which I had the honour to present to the Senate on Wednesday. The petition, which contained the signatures of 5,247 South Australians, said that the Romanian Government's rural resettlement program, which involved the brutal razing of villages with fewer than 5,000 inhabitants, amounted to cultural genocide. The petition was organised by the President of the Council of the Hungarian Associations in South Australia, Mr Joseph Garamy. Mr Garamy is also the President of the Ethnic Communities Council of South Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Romanian regime intends to raze more than 7,000 villages-Romania has about 13,000 villages in all-in order to force the inhabitants into 500 new `agro-industrial complexes' in an attempt to somehow improve Romania's agricultural efficiency. Ceausescu has promised that the `agro-industrial complexes' will provide housing with electricity and running water. But the fact is that village inhabitants are to be forced out of villages and into massive concrete apartment blocks in artificial townships. It has been reported that several villages have already been flattened in test schemes.
       </para>
       <para>
        Most of these villages are in Transylvania, a region heavily populated by German and Hungarian ethnic minorities. People of Hungarian, Romanian and German descent believe the Romanian regime's policy will destroy the culture and identity of the people of Transylvania. Transylvania was part of Hungary until 1918, and is now home to 2.5 million Hungarians. They constitute the largest ethnic minority in Europe.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Deputy President, I should note to the Senate that I have visited Transylvania and I have direct knowledge of the minority language communities, especially the Hungarian and German communities in this region. I seek leave to incorporate the middle section of my speech in Hansard.

         On his 70th birthday last January, three national museums mounted official homages to his accomplishments, film documentaries were repeatedly featured on Romanian television in which choirs sang hymns of gratitude for his existence.

         A fifth of Bucharest, a city once called the Paris of the east for its gracious architecture, is being razed and rebuilt in heroic socialist style as the ageing Ceausescu attempts to build a monument to himself.
        </para>
        <para>
         Australians had a glimpse of the Ceausescu megalomania when the Romanian government paid for full-page advertisements to be run in Australian newspapers prior to the Ceausescu visit earlier this year.
        </para>
        <para>
         That advertisement featured portraits of Ceausescu and his wife, obviously taken very many years ago. The advertisement claimed: ``Australia welcomes President Nicolae Ceausescu and Mrs Elena Ceausescu of Romania. President Ceausescu asserts himself not only as a remarkable leader of his country but also as a brilliant architect of the struggle for development in the world and the establishment of a new international economic order''.
        </para>
        <para>
         I for one could not believe the gall and crassness displayed by the Romanian government in placing this advertisement in the Australian press.
        </para>
        <para>
         How dare the Romanian regime claim to speak on behalf of the Australian people. How dare they presume Ceausescu was welcomed here by the Australian people.
        </para>
        <para>
         It may be true that he was welcomed by the Australian Labor Government, which was no doubt more interested in the size of Romania's wallet than the gross violations of human rights carried out by the Ceausescu regime.
        </para>
        <para>
         I found it outrageous, as did many other Australians, that this Labor Government played host to Ceausescu and by so doing, helped legitimise his regime in the eyes of the world.

         Huge queues form for food. Hunger is widespread, malnutrition is on the rise. Typewriters 70 years old sell for the equivalent of a month's salary-and a buyer would have to register the purchase with the police.

         One refugee said he left because of brutal suppression of the Hungarian ethnic minorities. This refugee, a 33-year-old worker from Cluj, said he left Romania ``because the mere utterance of our language is put down with truncheons''.

         —I thank the Senate. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) has said that the actions in Transylvania were a `fundamental human rights violation' and were `obviously an important issue' to Australia. But he also said:

        All we can do is hope our voice will be heard. As a trading partner, there is hopefully a better chance that we'll be taken notice of.

       <para>
        Today in the Senate, I asked the Foreign Minister what protests the Australian Government had made. He confirmed directly that the destruction of rural villages is taking place. He expressed concern in similar terms to my own at this destruction. But I did not hear in his reply of any specific protests except two diplomatic messages. I ask the Government once more to give urgent and careful consideration to more significant Australian protest.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the groups in Australia which have been active in bringing the plight of rural Romanians to the attention of the public has been the Save Transylvania Committee. This Committee has been extremely upset by the continued involvement of the Australian Government in trade with Romania. Romania is Australia's biggest market in eastern Europe after the Soviet Union. Last year, Australian exports worth $115m were dispatched to Romania, while we imported Romanian goods valued at $13m.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government will no doubt say that, by trading with Romania, Australia is in no way sanctioning the repression for which the Ceausescu regime is notorious. However, as the Save Transylvania Committee has pointed out, it is hypocritical to have restrictions on trade and cultural contact with South Africa while being happy to maximise trading and cultural links with the brutally oppressive regime in Bucharest.
       </para>
       <para>
        According to an assessment in the World Human Rights Guide of last year, Romania rates below both Chile and South Africa in its observance of human rights. I suggest that the Government should have a more consistent approach to its dealings with nations that abuse the human rights of its citizens. I recognise that Australia has a limited influence in eastern Europe. But action can be taken to join the international isolation of Romania. This Government is simply not doing enough.

         —Yesterday in the House of Representatives the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) and the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) made statements under parliamentary privilege accusing Mr George Raptis of A. Raptis and Son Fishing Co. of making a donation of $250,000 to the Bjelke-Petersen Foundation. Allegedly this was carried out in order to change a decision to award the sale of the Queensland Fish Board premises at Colmslie to Mr Raptis's company. There are other premises throughout Queensland also. The statement is untrue and was based on a statutory declaration given to Mr Wright by Mr Roland Cantley of Cairns.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Let me say categorically that Mr Wright's statement is not true. He has made incorrect statements based on misinformation given to him by Mr Roland Cantley. I have checked with Mr Raptis. I have checked with officers of the National Party of Australia. Both deny that Mr Raptis ever gave any donation to the Bjelke-Petersen Foundation or the National Party head office, as alleged.
       </para>
       <para>
        The National Party Bjelke-Petersen Foundation was wound up in 1982. The National Party books, including details of the Bjelke-Petersen Foundation, are open to examination by the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct. If any such donation was made I am sure Mr Fitzgerald will bring it out, as I understand Mr Wright has forwarded copies of relevant correspondence to the inquiry. In September 1987, five years after the Bjelke-Petersen Foundation was wound up, Mr Raptis acquired the Queensland Fish Board from the Queensland Government. It would have been impossible to make a donation to that organisation at the time stated by Mr Wright.
       </para>
       <para>
        The facts are as follows: Mr George Raptis, director of A. Raptis and Son, took possession of the Queensland Fish Board in about September 1987 after the company had tendered for the Board, with a number of other companies. Mr Raptis gave a commitment to the Queensland Government that he would process the prawn catch from his gulf and northern Australian fishing fleet at the Queensland Fish Board premises if awarded the tender, rather than at the Adelaide plant where the processing was taking place at the time. Mr Raptis outlined that he would use his Adelaide plant to process fish caught in the Bass Strait and the Great Australian Bight. His commitment to process the northern prawn catch in Queensland provided an additional 250 jobs for Queenslanders. Mr Raptis also agreed to spend millions of dollars with Queensland contractors in upgrading the very run-down Queensland Fish Board plant.
       </para>
       <para>
        Near the time of the Queensland Government making its decision fear was expressed by the Queensland fishing industry that P. Manettas and Co., the other tenderer which had large wholesale outlets in Sydney, would have been able to manipulate prices. Mr Bob Baudino, manager of B. and M. Public Affairs Consultants, who was hired by Manettas to find out why its offer was not accepted by the Queensland Government, described the reputation of P. Manettas and his information was that reports dealing with the business approach of Manettas described it as ruthless. Mr Bob Baudino in his brief to Manettas also said the decision to proceed with Raptis by the Queensland Cabinet was not necessarily based on the bottom line as money was not the overriding factor. The Queensland Government had to be concerned about what was best for the fisherman and the buyers. This was the Queensland Government's priority consideration.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe it was for those two reasons that the Queensland Government made the decision that it did in respect of the future of the Fish Board. I seek leave to table the Baudino brief forwarded to John Diacopoulos, the solicitor acting for Manettas.

         —George Raptis's company was also required to maintain the wet fish auction and to continue to supply seafood to Queensland retail fish outlets and wholesalers. This is not a profitable operation. The facts are that George Raptis's company has met every commitment made to the Queensland Government. He has spent a huge amount of money in upgrading the plant and equipment of the Colmslie Fish Board. He has provided over 300 jobs for Queenslanders. He has maintained the wet fish auction.

        Last night I contacted Mr Keith Wright and informed him I believed the accusations were wrong and ill founded. He gave me a set of documents on which his allegations were based. After reading these documents I am convinced that Mr Wright has made an error in judgment based on very questionable information he received from Mr Roland Cantley. The serious charge Mr Wright made in parliament yesterday, that George Raptis gave the Bjelke-Petersen Fund $250,000 to influence the decision made in relation to the Queensland Fish Board premises, has caused Mr Raptis hurt and embarrassment in his private and business life.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact is that the Queensland Cabinet, the then Premier of Queensland, the Hon. Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, and the Minister for Primary Industries, the Hon. Neville Harper, all acted in the best interests of the Queensland fishing industry by allowing the sale of the Queensland Fish Board to A. Raptis and Son. Mr Raptis finds himself in the position of being caught up as an unwilling player in a political game and he clearly does not deserve that. I call on Mr Wright to apologise in parliament to Mr Raptis at the earliest possible opportunity.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Yes, in its initial submission. However, following Federal Court action initiated by the Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service (QNPWS) over the issue of confidentiality of information, but which was ultimately withdrawn with costs awarded to the Commonwealth, the QNPWS resubmitted its proposed 1988 management program and background material without any requirements on confidentiality.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The 1988 Queensland Kangaroo Management Program is 8 pages including the title page.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) No. The QNPWS in its initial submission requested that the proposed management programs remain confidential until approved under Section 10 of the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982. See also (1) above.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) In the absence of indirect monitoring and assessment information from the QNPWS, the National Advisory Committee on Kangaroos made recommendations based on past records and the direct monitoring through ground and aerial surveys undertaken by the National Kangaroo Monitoring Unit of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS) and the CSIRO.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) All members of the National Advisory Committee on Kangaroos at its meeting in December 1987, reaffirmed a previous agreement that all advice to the Minister should remain confidential until the Minister had received the advice and made an announcement on it.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) (a) All State wildlife authorities that have submitted kangaroo management programs for approval under S10 of the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 have their own advisory committees which consider draft programs prior to submission to the Commonwealth. The National Advisory Committee on Kangaroos has been specifically established to provide advice to the Minister on the spectrum of community views on kangaroo management programs and quotas amongst other related kangaroo matters.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Any person or organisation that is affected by the decision of the Minister to approve a management program under Section 10 of the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Acts 1982 has the right under the Act to make application to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in accordance with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) Yes. The RSPCA (Australia) is reconsidering its withdrawal from the National Advisory Committee on Kangaroos.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) Professor Derrick Ovington, the Director of ANPWS and the Chairperson of the National Advisory Committee on Kangaroos, provided a copy of his letter of 3 December 1987 to the RSPCA (Australia) to all members of the Committee. The letter took account of comments by Committee members as a whole. The Director also suggested to all Committee members that, if they so wished, they write separately to the RSPCA (Australia) so that it would be properly informed of their views.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The Ministerial Task Force on Soil Conservation was established in May 1988 in recognition that the memberships of the National Farmers' Federation (NFF) and the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF), working jointly with the Government, could add substantial weight to existing efforts to combat land degradation. The Task Force members have been asked to:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) provide advice on further policies and programs to achieve a more effective national effort in soil conservation,
      </para>

      <para>
       (d) develop an appropriate extension and awareness campaign as a means of encouraging effective `grass roots' local, and regional efforts in combating land degradation.
      </para>
      <para>
       Professor Burton, presiding member of the Federal Soil Conservation Advisory Committee, has now also joined the Task Force.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Other functions will depend on the policy initiatives developed but are expected to involve the respective memberships in both education and an awareness campaign and in local community-based district landcare groups.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Most of the 32 recommendations of the 1975 Commonwealth-States Collaborative Study on soil conservation have now in fact been implemented.
      </para>
      <para>
       At its meeting in September 1986 the Technical Committee on Soil Conservation reviewed the recommendations contained in the report. Committee members indicated that 22 of the 32 recommendations had been implemented and that of the remaining ten recommendations, nine had been satisfactorily addressed or were of an on-going nature and required no specific action. The final recommendation, relating to training needs for soil conservationists, has since become the subject of a major study by the University of New England. The report, which was recently completed, is under consideration by State and Commonwealth Governments and tertiary education institutions.
      </para>
      <para>
       In regard to the need for follow-up survey work, it is widely accepted that an updated assessment of the land degradation status of Australia is required. A number of methodologies for such an investment have been tested on a pilot basis. These will be considered for Australia-wide applicability by the Standing Committee on Soil Conservation. Decisions on responsibilities and funding will await the Standing Committee's consideration.

       Changes by Air New South Wales and East West Airlines in their pattern of usage of Albury together with other potential future variations in airline usage stemming from deregulation will be taken into consideration.

       More details are available in the attached table.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) At the national level, the Federal Government is helping the States attract new manufacturing industry by improving the environment for business investment. Appropriate macroeconomic policies have been put in place, accompanied by structural reforms designed to increase the efficiency and flexibility of capital markets. The floating of the currency, the deregulation of the banking sector and the liberalisation of foreign investment guidelines are important examples.
      </para>
      <para>
       On the wages front, the Accord has moderated the growth in wage rises and locked in the competitive advantage stemming from the depreciation of the currency. Australian wage costs are now competitive with those in comparable developed countries.

       The overall increase in bankruptcies is attributable to the substantial increase in non-business bankruptcies, and excessive use of credit is the most consistent cause of these.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is aware of the problem and has taken a number of steps to deal with it. Significant changes have been made to bankruptcy procedures in the Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1987 which should reflect in a reduced number of bankruptcies. The most notable of these is the pre-bankruptcy moratorium or cooling off period, which is due to come into operation later in 1988. This provision should prevent ``mistake'' bankruptcies and encourage debtors to make more use of existing voluntary arrangements with creditors under Part X of the Act.
      </para>
      <para>
       Other initiatives have been taken. The Government encouraged the National Consumer Affairs Advisory Council to conduct a national forum on consumer credit in April 1988 to focus and promote discussion on broad issues in the current debate on consumer credit. The Forum agreed that there is a need for better education of potential credit users as to the implications of credit borrowing and failure to maintain repayment commitments, and that bankruptcy should not be regarded as the only remedy for credit overcommitment.
