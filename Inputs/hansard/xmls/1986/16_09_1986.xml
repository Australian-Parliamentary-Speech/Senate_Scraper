       Home Loan Interest Rates
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.
      </para>
      <para>
       The humble petition of we the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:-
      </para>
      <para>
       The high interest rates on home loans of 13.5% and above have and are placing the recipients in a financially disastrous position, as thousands have lost their homes and thousands more will do so if these appalling conditions continue for the young and established home purchasers.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your House urge all politicians that no Government or Opposition in a power position should continue to tolerate this cruel, vicious procedure that shatters the very structure of family life, from the farmers to the city dwellers.
      </para>
      <para>
       We need a five year period to reduce this absurdity by tackling it at its source. Firstly, interest repayments on home loans to be reduced by 2% annually for the next five years or until it is down to 8% or less.
      </para>
      <para>
       This would, or should diminish union demands, and cause no hazard for investors, who could reinvest in Government projects, or other worthwhile ventures and also ease the burden on Social Securities.

       We, the undersigned, plead that Parliament will legislate, or act in accordance with the present legislation to replace the current members of the Film Censorship Board who have admitted to Senator Harradine on 12th December, 1984 as reported in the Senate Select Committee on Video Material, (see attached extracts), that they are not applying either the blasphemy or obscenity tests as required under the provisions of the Customs (Cinematograph Films) Regulations, and that these persons be replaced by persons who will apply these and the other related tests in accordance with the said Regulations.

       Family Allowances

      <para>
       To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned shows:
      </para>
      <para>
       Graduated family allowances are of important assistance to families with more than one child.
      </para>
      <para>
       All family allowances, whether for one, two, three, or more children, have not kept pace with inflation.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are suggestions that all family allowances should be paid at the one flat rate. This would severely disadvantage families with more than one child.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should reject any suggestion that family allowances be paid at a flat rate and instead should ask the Federal Government to increase the value of existing payments.

       1. The Watsonia Army Barracks contains electronic communication facilities, operated by Australian and American personnel, that give the United States the ability to pin-point Soviet nuclear submarines, hidden in the Oceans.

      <para>
       2. This would make it possible for U.S. killer-submarines to destroy all Soviet nuclear submarines, while the U.S. nuclear submarines launch their missiles in a `first strike' attack. This makes Watsonia a potential nuclear target. A nuclear attack on Watsonia would have disastrous effect on Melbourne.
      </para>
      <para>
       3. The `joint U.S.-Australian' bases in Australia endanger rather than protect us. They also add a new menace to nuclear arms race, that must be stopped.

      <para>
       Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled should close the `Joint Australian-U.S.' electronic communication facilities in the Watsonia army barracks.

       1. That the Bill of Rights will have the power to override and negate our Common Law within five years of its enactment.

      <para>
       That whereas the Commonwealth of Australia ratified the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in 1983, the Government of Victoria in passing the Planning (Brothels) Act 1984 is in breach of Article 6 of the Convention which says that ``States Parties shall take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to suppress all forms of traffic in women and exploitation of prostitution of women''.
      </para>
      <para>
       That the Victorian Planning (Brothels) Act 1984 provides legal authority to brothel operators to traffic in and exploit the prostitution of women and to live off the earnings of prostitutes.
      </para>
      <para>
       That whereas the Federal Minister for Health has counselled citizens to shun promiscuity (The Australian 26.1.85) because of the serious and sometimes fatal health hazards, the operation of legalised brothels encourages promiscuity and the spread of diseases, including AIDS.

       the failure to index family allowances which has resulted in an erosion of more than 50 per cent in their real value since May 1976;

       the abolition of family allowances for dependants who have turned 18, even those still at school;

      <para>
       the abolition of concessional tax rebates for education and other expenses.

       That this erosion in horizontal tax equity has placed an intolerable financial burden on many larger families, particularly those on middle incomes who fail to qualify for means-tested benefits such as TEAS but whose living standards are now well below average due to heavy expenses on necessities such as education, housing, food and clothing.

         —It is, of course, very important to determine what fiscal year one is talking about. Twice since we have been in government we have had so-called May statements in relation to expenditure. Under the previous Government there were statements in relation to expenditure at various times. For example, I recall the activities of the now famous so-called razor gang which went on for many months. Those things have to be determined by governments at particular times. In looking at fiscal year 1987-88, it may well be that the Government has to bring forward some expenditure reviews into the second half of this financial year. The expression `mini-Budget' was used by Senator Chaney and by the journalist concerned in relation to the comment I made. Perhaps it was open to misinterpretation in that some people attach particular significance to the expression `mini-Budget'. The point I was trying to make was that it was not my expression but hers, and it would be called that, whether one liked it or not, by some journalists.

        As the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and others have said, and as I have said, there is the possibility, as there has been in previous years, of an expenditure statement in the first half of calendar year 1987 which would relate to the full financial year starting on 1 July 1987. To that extent I stand by the statements I have made.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Chaney also specifically directed my attention to the question of whether further expenditure cuts might have been possible in the current Budget. If one goes back even two or three weeks, the community and indeed the Opposition were somewhat surprised by the extent of the constraint exhibited by the Government in the Budget, particularly in respect of outlays. From that point of view it was and is regarded as a very tight Budget. That does not mean that there cannot be an ongoing review of Commonwealth expenditures. There may be areas of Commonwealth expenditure which can be further examined, but that is for future Budgets or future expenditure reviews, if the Government decides that is desirable.

In response to a later question about whether he was perhaps pushing for these to culminate in some sort of mini-Budget within the next six months, he said, and I quote in part from his answer, `I think it might be a desirable course'. I ask the Minister again the question he did not answer: Will he seek from the Government a mini-Budget because it is better to do these things sooner than later and he has indicated that that is his personal view?

         —In August 1986-the most recent month for which figures are available-Queensland's unemployment rate soared to 9.4 per cent. That is the fifth consecutive month that Queensland has recorded the highest unemployment rate of any State. So since April Queensland has had the worst unemployment record of any State. Moreover, in only three of the 35 months since the last election in Queensland has Queensland had an unemployment rate below the national average. So for 11/12ths of the time since the last Government was elected in Queensland, the unemployment rate has been above the national average. When the Queensland Premier made his policy speech in 1983, less than 15 per cent of Australia's jobless were living in Queensland, and that figure has now risen to almost 19 per cent. That is what the Bjelke-Petersen Government has done to the Queensland work force in the past three years-it has concentrated an extra 5 per cent of the nation's total unemployed in that State. Indeed, we have now reached the point where there are more people in Queensland receiving unemployment benefit than there are in the State of Victoria, notwithstanding the fact that Victoria's population is 65 per cent greater than that of Queensland.

        The response of the Queensland Premier to this-and it is pretty hard to get a new idea into his head-is to trot out the hoary old chestnut that the high unemployment rate and the high rate of unemployment benefit recipients in Queensland are due to what he calls `southern dole bludgers' moving up to Queensland to bask in the sun.

The latest official information is that for people in the prime working age group-that is, the 20- to 34-year-old age group-some 5,200 persons have migrated from Queensland to other States where employment prospects are brighter. The population increase in Queensland is concentrated in the non-working age group. In other words, workers in Queensland have voted with their feet; they have moved out of Queensland and into one of the Labor Government States because they know that they have a significantly better opportunity of getting employment there than they have if they remain in Queensland.

         —My question is directed to the Minister for Resources and Energy. I refer him to an interview which he gave yesterday morning on the program AM about mining in Kakadu and proposals that he confirmed he had put forward to clear the way for mining-other than uranium mining-in Kakadu, subject to environmental constraints, as he put it. I particularly quote his words:

        He went on to talk about the fact that the economic health of the nation required that in some cases mining should proceed. In the light of the statement that the Minister issued this morning, with his colleague Mr Cohen, I ask him whether that statement means that the vast areas of stages 1 and 2 of Kakadu National Park are now completely locked away from any assessment of their resources, that only very limited exploration will be allowed in the remaining stage 3 of the park and that mining is to be allowed in only one area-at Coronation Hill. Does this statement mean that the Government has rejected the proposals of the Minister and presumably also those supported by the Prime Minister? Can the Minister say whether the Government has made any assessment of the loss of potential earnings from this decision and the impact that this decision will have on, to use his own words, the `economic health of the nation'?

         —The decision made by the Government and announced today is that no mining or exploration for any mineral will be allowed to take place in the present Kakadu National Park-that is to say, stages 1 and 2 that have been declared. That means that as a result there will not be any resource assessment flowing from normal exploration activity. The decision has been made to ensure that no such activity-exploration or mining-takes place. As Minister for Resources and Energy, I have regarded my responsibility as being to ensure that all relevant points of view are put to and considered by the Government when issues of this kind arise. As far as I am concerned, that objective has been completely achieved by the very careful consideration that has been given to this matter by the Government over the last two days.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The particular assessment that probably most crucially governed the final decision to treat stages 1 and 2 in that way but to leave the door open for further resource assessment in the proposed new stage 3 extension area was the assessment-it is part of the Press statement-that has been made by the Bureau of Mineral Resources on the basis of all known existing information, which is reasonably substantial so far as stage 2 is concerned and not quite as substantial so far as stage 1 is concerned, but still substantial enough to enable a general evaluation to be made. That assessment is that there is a very high level of prospectivity in the existing national park for uranium, but only a moderate level of potential prospectivity for gold, platinum, base metals and other minerals. The converse is true of the Gimbat and Goodparla pastoral lease areas to the south, where there is only low to moderate prospectivity, relatively speaking, for uranium, but a very high degree of mineral potential for gold and platinum.
       </para>
       <para>
        Given the Australian Labor Party's position on the mining of uranium and given also the obvious need in the country's current economic circumstances to actively pursue nationally significant deposits of other minerals, subject to environmental constraints, it was, I believe, a perfectly rational decision to distinguish as we did between the two areas. The enormous significance of the natural and cultural heritage of the existing national park has never been properly acknowledged by the Opposition, which has made it only too clear that it is willing to dig up everything in sight in the existing national park, as long as there is a buck in it for some of them. Unlike that particular perspective, we have adopted the view that the natural and cultural heritage significance of stages 1 and 2 outweighs any likely economic benefit that might flow from mineral development there. The same is not necessarily the case for stage 3. I believe that under those circumstances a decision has been now made which is not only in accordance with the views and feelings of the great mass of the Australian people but also one that is a model of economic rationality.

         —The Senate would be aware that over a number of years both the previous Government and, indeed, this Government have pursued a policy of cost recovery in respect of the airline industry, and the Government did make some decisions recently that have been interpreted in certain quarters as creating difficulties for the commuter operators. The Government is aware of the difficulties which commuter operators are facing during the transition period of the new charging arrangements. It is in recognition of these difficulties that the Government has provided a subsidy of $2m which will halve the charges of commuter operators during the current Budget year 1986-87. While operators have faced large percentage increases in charges, this began from a low base and the impact on air fares has been small. Nevertheless, the Government has recognised that its decision does require a transitional stage in its application. Those increases were approved by the Independent Air Fares Committee.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As a result of the new charges it can be substantiated that 1.5 per cent will be available for Sunstate Airlines, which I think has some particular application for the honourable senator, and one per cent for Skywest Aviation Ltd. There will be an increase in flag fall for Hazelton Air Services Pty Ltd of $1.20 and for Kendell Airlines of $1.40. For Aeropelican Air Services Pty Ltd, 2.4 per cent is available. The figure for Airlines of Tasmania is 3 per cent. The increase for these two operators also takes into account the effect of the national wage decision. I point out also that there has been a subsidy of $1.80 for Rottnest Airlines.
       </para>
       <para>
        General aviation operators will remain on a fixed annual charge arrangement for this financial year. Consultations are therefore being pursued with the industry to develop the most appropriate charging arrangements for general aviation. Annual air navigation charges were increased by 17 per cent on 1 July 1986. The Government's decision to credit the departure tax revenue to the aviation industry and recent increases in aviation fuel excise will lift the cost recovery rate to around 100 per cent in the year 1986-87. So the Government is aware of the difficulties and is taking what practical steps it can, having regard to the economic conditions facing this country, to ease the burdens on the commuter operators.

       MINING IN KAKADU NATIONAL PARK

         —Like Senator Durack, I refer the Minister for Resources and Energy to today's statement issued jointly by himself and the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment which announced, amongst other matters, the extension of Kakadu National Park to include the Gimbat and Goodparla pastoral leases, but excluded from the new national park area Coronation Hill, where BHP Noranda Pty Ltd and EZ Industries are currently exploring for gold and platinum. When was the decision to exclude Coronation Hill made, and by whom? What evidence, if any, does the Government have of platinum being present in commercial quantities at Coronation Hill? If there is no evidence of platinum being present in commercial quantities, why was Coronation Hill excluded? What evidence was considered of the effect of mining at Coronation Hill on the Alligator Rivers area, in view of the fact that Coronation Hill is located within the Alligator Rivers catchment area? Does the decision to exclude mining from stages 1 and 2 of Kakadu represent a backdown by the Prime Minister, or is the decision based on the expedient ground that, as noted in the joint statement, no commercially viable mineral deposits are contained within stages 1 and 2? Finally, do the recent decisions regarding the sale of uranium to France and the assault on the environmentally fragile areas of Kakadu National Park signal a departure from the Hawke Government's previous environmental commitment as demonstrated by its actions over the Franklin issue?

         —The decision relating to Coronation Hill was made by the Cabinet at about 8.35 this morning and endorsed by the Caucus at about 9.53. In both instances it was a decision in principle that was being endorsed because the Coronation Hill joint venture has not been fully proved up and the final formal decision by the joint venture partners to go ahead has not been made. Nonetheless, on all the evidence which has been made available progressively to my Department and to the Bureau of Mineral Resources, it is apparent that there is a very major gold deposit there which is clearly not merely of commercial viability but also of a nationally significant scale. Similarly, it is evident that there is a very substantial platinum resource there. Just how substantial it is is a matter for current assessment by the joint venture partners. It would be inappropriate for me to say anything more about that given the commercial character of these matters. All that can be said is that clearly the deposit is already discernible as a deposit of national economic significance and as such is appropriate to be earmarked on this occasion for exclusion from the park. Obviously, as stated in the announcement this morning relating to Coronation Hill, the project will go ahead only if it can pass muster against the provisions of the environmental impact legislation, which includes reference also to Aboriginal heritage considerations and matters of that kind.

         —I have lost the thread. The honourable senator has succeeded to that extent. The point I want to make about the environmental constraint is that what is crucial about the Gimbat-Goodparla pastoral lease area is the protection of the ecology of the South Alligator river system. That is the attraction of the Gimbat-Goodparla pastoral leases for the national park. It is not because of anything that is particularly dramatic or exciting about the rest of the pastoral lease areas as such. All sorts of comparisons could be made between that area and the existing stage 1 and stage 2, not least the existence of a great deal of prior mining activity having taken place up and down the South Alligator River valley. I think that sufficiently answers the first question.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The second question was whether the decision on stages 1 and 2 amounts to a backdown by anybody. The answer is no, for the reasons that I explained earlier in answer to Senator Durack. I am sorry that Senator Haines is so churlish as not to acknowledge the magnitude of the decision made on stages 1 and 2. It is a decision which is path-breaking in that it completely excludes the possibility of mining and exploration. I believe that is something that the Australian Democrats have regarded as devoutly to be wished. That having now been accomplished, they are unable to acknowledge with any grace the nature of the decision made.

        Finally, I was asked whether this amounts to any kind of departure from the environmental commitments that this Government has made and honoured in the past. Clearly, that is not the case. The Government remains infinitely more sensitive to these issues than are its opponents opposite.

The other aspect of this decision that ought to be acknowledged but has not been in the honourable senator's question or anywhere else is that this morning we also decided to proceed immediately to the nomination of stage 2 of the Kakadu National Park for the World Heritage List. That again is something for which people have been calling for quite some time. That decision has been made without equivocation or qualification. That will happen.

         —The article was brought to my attention only this morning. I have not yet been able to check out all the facts and am therefore not able to answer fully the last part of the honourable senator's question about what action I propose to take. This would have been an extraordinary story if the events had occurred anywhere else but in Queensland. It appears that Mr Behan had a debt of about $702,000 and applied for an additional $145,000 loan-$60,000 of which was to be used to reduce his debt to the Elders pastoral company, the remainder to be added to the pre-existing debt. In a memo dated 3 March, the General Manager of the Agricultural Bank, Mr Dellit, wrote:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Despite the budget that Mr Behan has drawn up (assuming a run of good seasons), I do not believe it is possible to service borrowings of this magnitude even when the property is fully stocked. I note that Mr Behan anticipates a surplus of $70,000 (less June interest) in October. However, with interest accumulating at in excess of $100,000 per annum, there is very little for debt reduction.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the final sentence of the memo Mr Dellit wrote:
       </para>
       <para>
        The applications for further advances of $60,000 to reduce debt to Elders, $45,000 for carry on and $40,000 for restocking are declined.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Behan, however, is no ordinary person. He is a failed National Party Senate candidate and currently an employee of the Queensland National Party, being employed as a northern district organiser. No doubt it was for that reason that Mr Dellit in a memo dated 21 March wrote:
       </para>
       <para>
        This case was discussed this morning with the Honourable the Minister for Primary Industries who directed that the sum of $145,000, as applied for from the bank, be approved.
       </para>
       <para>
        Moreover, on 24 April, Mr Dellit reportedly wrote:
       </para>
       <para>
        Early this afternoon I was called by Mr A. Hegarty, Deputy Director General to the Department of Primary Industries in regard to the Behan case. Mr Hegarty showed me a letter from Mr Behan to the Minister giving his version of a discussion at the bank on the morning of 22 April.
       </para>
       <para>
        To cut short all the details, it is clear that the Rural Reconstruction Board, the Elders pastoral company and the Agricultural Bank each recommended that no loan be granted on the grounds that there was no chance that Mr Behan could be viable and therefore repay his existing debts, let alone further debts. However, into that scene was intruded, in typical Queensland National Party fashion, the `getting public money mixed up with National Party money' philosophy for which Queensland has become notorious. The Minister for Primary Industries directed the bank to make the advance to Mr Behan. I understand that the Premier has described the $145,000 as a `lousy' amount. I remind him that another former associate of his is now in the slammer for having misappropriated an even lousier amount. I remind him also $145,000 might seem to be a `lousy' amount to Queensland National Party apparatchiks who are accustomed to sticking their fists in the public till but to other Queenslanders it is not a lousy or inconsequential amount, and it is not a lousy amount as far as the Commonwealth Government is concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        In response to the final part of Senator Black's question, I will be initiating inquiries through the Department of Finance. If I may interpolate, a number of Commonwealth governments have had difficulty dealing with the Queensland Government and the Queensland bureaucracy because it is at all times necessary to be diligently looking over the shoulders of Queensland officials to make sure they are not misappropriating or misusing Commonwealth funds, but it is impossible to do this with absolute certainty. I will be asking the Department of Finance to determine the facts insofar as it is possible, firstly, to see whether Mr Behan was in fact the victim of a natural disaster. I suppose in a sense he is the beneficiary of an unnatural windfall gain through his membership of a Queensland branch of the National Party of Australia. We have to determine whether there was a natural disaster which would have given him some provisional entitlement to a loan. Secondly, we have to check out the facts regarding the gross breach of normal procedures, clearly instigated by the Government of Queensland, if not by the Premier himself. When I receive that report I will consider what further action is necessary for me as an individual Minister to take or refer the matter to Cabinet for decision.

        The New Right-as we know, it is quite close to John Howard-is very hostile to women, services provided to low income people through the public purse and welfare payments to individuals.

One measure that Senator Walters would really like is the abolition of bulk billing in the health system and the reduction of the Medicare rebate to 60 per cent of the schedule fee. Other measures include the cutting of grants to advanced education in technical and further education colleges; the abolition of the participation and equity program, which is a program aimed specifically at disadvantaged groups in education; the abolition of the first home owners scheme; a cut of funding by half, under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement; and the abolition of all job creation and training programs.

        It is interesting that Senator Walters and her cohorts shout and scream when the New Right's Budget cuts are proposed. It is useful, especially to those who have organised themselves outside Parliament House today, to complain about aspects of the Budget that did not fill their aspirations. They pay attention to what those on the other side of the chamber and their front runners, the New Right, really would do. Those who are concerned, as we are, about women on welfare, single parent families and people who need bulk billing in the Medicare system, should pay attention to the draconian cuts and the destruction of virtually all major welfare initiatives that would take place if the New Right managed to bamboozle the public and help John Howard, its real leader, into office.

That is a matter for the commercial arrangements that are entered into between QML and Electricite de France, which is the French purchaser, subject, of course, to the necessary export clearance being received from the Government. I do not believe that any shipment has been made. However, I do not have that information. The honourable senator asked whether any money has been received. The basis of the arrangement between the Government and QML is that the moneys in question will be paid in full by 30 June 1987; in other words, this financial year. I do not have full details about whether there will be any progressive payments before then. The extent to which that can appropriately be put on the public record might be addressed in an Estimates committee later this week.

        The amount will be repaid in full-that is, the $41m that the Commonwealth has paid QML for the uranium already transferred in the past couple of years from QML to the Commonwealth and put in stockpile. There will be a saving regarding the $25m or so that was to have been paid out this financial year, but which will no longer be necessary. The past stockpile amount of about $40m or $41m will be repaid in full.

         —My question, which is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, is posed against the background of a somewhat incomplete historical focus on the Higgins Harvester judgment by a member of the H. R. Nicholls Society. Is it not a fact that the Harvester judgment arose not from a wage case but from an application by a manufacturer for exemption from paying excise duty equivalent to import tax; in other words, a tariff application? Is it not a fact that, inherent in his consideration of the application, Judge Higgins had to consider the entitlement of a worker to a fair and reasonable income sufficient to sustain his family in reasonable comfort? However, besides addressing that question will the Government consider the burden that an equivalent tariff increase of 30 per cent or 40 per cent because of the drop in the value of the dollar is placing on the family? Will the Government also consider the fact that, in the last 10 years, the disposable income of a family with four children on average earnings has dropped by 11 percentage points and will drop a further one percentage point by this time next year?

         —I am not quite sure why this question was addressed to me. A part of it is relevant to my portfolio and the other part perhaps is not. The first part of the honourable senator's question was very learned and erudite and it sounds right to me so I do not have to do more than agree with the honourable senator about the circumstances in which the Harvester judgment came about. Certainly the criterion adopted by Henry Bournes Higgins in that case was one of a fair and reasonable income for a worker with an average family. I think it is probably true in aggregate that there has been a tariff increase of some 30 per cent or 40 per cent arising from the devaluation of the Australian dollar, but I would just caution against that figure being accepted in respect of a wide range of commodities and goods because there has been very variable behaviour across industries in respect of the effect of the devaluation and the tariff equivalent concerned.

        I can neither confirm nor deny the figure the honourable senator gave in respect of household disposable income but I accept the figure which he put to me. I do not know what conclusion he is asking me to draw from all that, whether it is that tariffs should be lowered on certain goods or whether the Government should be concerned about the other end of the equation, which is disposable family income. I will consider that further and provide the honourable senator with a more detailed answer in due course.

I can only conclude from that that he would prefer economic irrationalists to be in control of policy; in other words, people like himself and a lot of the others with whom he seems to surround himself and to whom he panders. Dealing with the financial aspects of the uranium decision, it is very rare that a specific policy has these effects: To take amounts off outlays-expenditure in this case of $66m-off the Budget deficit and off the current account deficit. Very rarely does any single decision have all those positive things going for it, and that was certainly one of the factors which the Government considered.

Senator Sanders is insulated in that cocoon of middle class trendies, where he normally finds himself, who think that there is a bottomless bucket and that governments can go on spending money everywhere and economies can go on providing money for all sorts of good works without ever having any wealth generating process either within the government or within the community as a whole. He probably would not have noticed it there, but a large number of Aboriginal leaders are, in fact, in favour of mining.

         —I must begin by conceding that I am not nearly as good as the people who dream up these questions. If the honourable senator is asking me questions about the net economic costs in a variety of hypothetical situations, I suggest he spend his time trying to work out the answers rather than asking me to do so. The question of wage reductions, as the honourable senator puts it, is not something within the purview of the Government in respect of the textile, clothing and footwear industries. The industries' workers are not highly paid. They are not only not highly paid workers by Australian standards; they are not highly paid by many international standards, in terms of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Government's wages policy is determined in the context of the prices and incomes accord and decisions and submissions are made to the national wage cases.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Insofar as work practices are concerned, the honourable senator can peddle that sort of line around as hard as he can go. There is not much complaint from textile manufacturers about work practices in the textile industry. In fact, I think the industry is very much more free from complaints about work practices than are other industries. So those are two areas to which I will not be giving much attention in respect of the textile, clothing and footwear industries. In any event, the question of work practices, apart from a general indication of government concern about matters in some areas, is essentially a matter for management and the work force to work out between themselves. That is what has happened in this country. That is why work practices in some industries are bad and in other industries they are not, because bad management has allowed them to develop in a number of places. That is not true, I believe, in the textile, clothing and footwear industries. Insofar as the general level of assistance which will be accorded to the textile industry is concerned let me say this: The so-called 75 per cent option was adopted by a wide range of people long before the recent devaluation of the Australian dollar. There has to be some consideration of the value of the Australian dollar in determining the final level of assistance. That level will also be affected by factors such as the period over which a phase down of tariffs will take place. It is also affected by what assistance, or otherwise, the Government might give in respect of a whole range of issues, including export assistance, labour restructuring and retraining assistance, marketing and things of that kind.
       </para>
       <para>
        I make these points at some length because very rigorous attempts are being made in certain sections of the community, particularly sections of the community which have made a squillion out of the textile, clothing and footwear industries, to reduce these matters to simplistic issues. They are not simplistic. The disappointing thing is that the honourable senator in his question makes the most valiant attempt to reduce them to simplistic, ideological and idiotic assumptions about wages and work practices, which are not issues in these industries.

In some cases members of the Opposition and, in other cases, members of the public have not understood the changes as they were written up. I think it is a pity that they have complained about those changes and in fact believe that many people will be worse off. The changes will result in a more efficient scheme and will give greater protection to chronically ill taxpayers. In fact, the changes do retain the assistance to pensioners and other disadvantaged people which existed in the previous scheme.

        The raising of the maximum charge from $5 to $10 does not mean, as many people apparently interpreted, that prescriptions will now cost $10. In fact, it is estimated that the average cost of a prescription will be around $7.30, as the cost of a large number of items will lie between $5 and $10. Under the safety net built into the scheme to protect the chronically ill, no individual or family, including concessional beneficiaries, will have to pay for more than 25 pharmaceutical benefits scheme prescriptions in one year. After that number is reached, the prescriptions will be free. The net result of that is that those people who have to have more than 25 prescriptions will be better off under the new scheme.

        The scheme has been clarified in the post-Budget period and I think that there has been a general acceptance of it by the pharmaceutical industry, pensioner organisations and others. It is time that we all settled down to ensuring that people know the facts and know their rights so that they can get the full benefit of the new scheme. We should do this rather than indulging in misinformation and therefore disadvantaging the very people whom the scheme is designed to help.

But if one wants to look at the prime working age group, the 20 to 34-year-old group, we do know-this is recorded, because there is a valid purpose in collecting such information-that in the last financial year there was a net loss of 5,000 people in that prime working age group from Queensland to other States. The reason that 5,000 people decided to move was that in the last three years, when the employment situation has generally improved in Australia and has dramatically improved in many States, in Queensland it has not improved at all. Queensland, for 32 of the last 35 months, has had an above average level of unemployment, and for all of the last five months Queensland has had the highest level of unemployment of any State.

        An organisation that calls itself the Institute of Public Policy, represented by Mr Brian Buckley, one-time staff member of a former Treasurer, the late Sir Phillip Lynch, went so far as to say that the Department of Veterans' Affairs should be abolished. I gather what he meant was that it should be absorbed. There is obviously a school of thought in the conservative areas of our land that believes that there is no longer a valid reason for maintaining the Department of Veterans' Affairs-a view that is not shared by this Government or by the veterans' community. There would be an uproar if any such suggestion were to be made with any support from the Government or the Opposition. However, there has been a call by Opposition members for savage cuts in public spending and it is clear that there is a school of thought in their party which suggests that Veterans' Affairs would be a vulnerable department in relation to saving public funding and also public servants. As far as my Department is concerned, we see it as having a future at least until the turn of the century, and the Government is committed to maintaining it.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Government has no evidence to support reports that the Catholic Church in Australia has given funds to the Communist Party of the Philippines. Secondly, the categorisation of the FLNKS as a `terrorist group' is not accurate. The FLNKS is an independence movement with broad-based popular support whose leaders have been democratically elected and accepted as responsible spokesmen by the French Government. The question of funding between private organisations and the FLNKS is not one in which the Australian Government feels it should involve itself.
       </para>
       <para>
        I might add, Mr President, that it appears that Senator Sheil's question had no more substance than the gibberish that has been recently uttered by the Queensland National Party Premier on the subject of alleged terrorist activities being based within Australia.

        The speech read as follows-
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government strongly opposes the dumping at sea of radioactive waste and other radioactive matter. The purpose of the present Bill is to give effect to this policy, by amending the existing legislation which controls dumping in Australian waters and by Australian citizens.
       </para>
       <para>
        The principal Act to be amended is the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981. The Act provides for protection of the Environment by regulating the dumping into the sea and the incineration at sea of wastes and other matter. It was supported on both sides of the Parliament and received assent in 1981. The present Government brought the Sea Dumping Act into effect in March 1984.
       </para>
       <para>
        In August 1985 Australia ratified the convention on the prevention of marine pollution by dumping of wastes and other matter, which is commonly referred to as the London Dumping Convention. As a contracting party to the convention, Australia subsequently co-sponsored a resolution adopted at the ninth consultative meeting, held in September last year, which provides for an indefinite suspension of the dumping of radioactive wastes at sea pending further studies and assessments. Several other international conventions are also relevant.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conformity with the Government's policy of vigorous opposition to the dumping of radioactive waste at sea, the Prime Minister signed the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone (SPNFZ) Treaty on behalf of Australia on 6 August 1985.
       </para>
       <para>
        When it comes into effect the Treaty will, amongst other things, prohibit the dumping of radioactive waste at sea within the treaty area, including the territorial sea of contracting parties. Parties to the SPNFZ Treaty will be required to prevent the dumping of radioactive matter in their territorial seas and not to assist or encourage the dumping of radioactive matter at sea anywhere within the Treaty area.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another international agreement, the convention for the protection of the natural resources and environment of the South Pacific Region, ``SPREP'', is currently at an advanced stage of drafting. This Convention would, amongst other things, regulate the dumping of wastes at sea and preclude the sea dumping of radioactive matter anywhere in a defined South Pacific region. The SPNFZ Treaty places a legal obligation on its parties to work towards agreement upon a SPREP Convention which will ban the sea dumping of radioactive materials.
       </para>
       <para>
        The present Bill will amend the principal Act to enable Australia to give effect to prospective obligations under both the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty and the SPREP Convention.
       </para>
       <para>
        As it presently stands, the Sea Dumping Act prohibits the dumping of high level radioactive waste and other high level radioactive matter at sea, but, paralleling the London Dumping Convention, it allows dumping under permit of other radioactive wastes and materials. I should add that no such permits have been sought under the provisions of the Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn now to the substance of the amending Bill. The purpose of the Government is to prohibit the dumping at sea of radioactive waste.
       </para>
       <para>
        As honourable senators may know, all substances are to some extent radioactive, although, for most, their activity is negligible. It is thus necessary to make a definition which will clearly distinguish the radioactive substances whose dumping is to be prohibited under the Act from all other substances. This is to be done by establishing a threshold radioactivity level of 35 becquerels per gram, which is just marginally above the natural level of activity of the common element potassium.
       </para>
       <para>
        The unit of measurement of radioactivity, the ``becquerel,'' relates to the rate of radioactive decay of a substance. One becquerel represents one spontaneous disintegration of the nucleus of an atom per second.
       </para>
       <para>
        So that honourable senators may be assured that the proposed 35 becquerels per gram threshold limit is very low. I can advise that the activity of ordinary granite may range up to 15 becquerels per gram or more, Australian beach sands, which are mined for their mineral content, may have an activity of about 30 becquerels per gram, whilst potassium chloride, a common constituent of fertilisers, has an activity of about 18 becquerels per gram. For comparison, the uranium yellow cake produced from uranium mines has an activity of about 22,000 becquerels per gram.
       </para>
       <para>
        There should be no environmental effects attributable to the trivial radioactivity of dumped materials which are below the specified threshold level of activity. This definition is, in the view of the Government, fully consistent with the draft definition adopted for the purposes of the SPREP Convention.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Act does not apply in relation to a vessel, aircraft or platform belonging to one of the Defence Forces, reflecting a similar exemption in the London Dumping Convention. However it will continue to be the practice that the Defence Forces will observe the requirements of the Act, as amended. The Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment has initiated an exchange of letters with the Minister for Defence to this effect.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another proposed amendment to the Act clarifies that disposal of material into the seabed, or subsoil beneath the sea, by the dropping of containers designed to penetrate into the soft sediments of the sea-floor, amounts to disposal at sea. The technical possibility of such a method of disposing of radioactive wastes has been raised overseas.
       </para>
       <para>
        Consistent with the Government's view on the respective roles of Commonwealth and State authorities in offshore areas, the present Act provides a mechanism for disapplying its provisions to the extent that equivalent State legislation applies in relation to the coastal waters of a State.
       </para>
       <para>
        (``Coastal Waters'' are essentially the territorial sea within the three mile limit.) This mechanism is to remain, but it will not apply to sections of the Act which prohibit the dumping, loading for dumping or incineration at sea of radioactive materials.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having given thought to the prospective implementation of complementary Commonwealth and State legislation to control sea dumping, the Government has concluded that there will need to be some kind of memorandum of understanding between the Commonwealth and individual States to ensure that administration is made as simple and efficient as possible for permit applicants and the administering authorities. The Commonwealth must also be satisfied that the obligations it has under the London dumping convention, and those it will assume under the SPNFZ Treaty and the SPREP Convention, will be fully met. Accordingly the wording of the relevant section of the present Act is to be amended to provide a discretion in its disapplication in favour of equivalent State legislation. The Commonwealth's intention is to exercise that discretion in favour of suitable State legislation provided that an appropriate memorandum of understanding on administrative procedures is also entered into with the State concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, a minor amendment to the Act will ensure that where State legislation does apply, it will not be necessary for the Commonwealth to issue a permit for the loading of waste in addition to the permit for dumping of that waste in coastal waters issued under State legislation.

        I commend the Bill to the Senate.

       That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death, on 30 August 1986, of the Honourable Dame Annabelle Jane Mary Rankin, DBE, Senator for the State of Queensland from 1947 to 1971, and a Minister of the Crown from 1966 to 1971, places on record its appreciation of her long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to her sister in her bereavement.
      </para>
      <para>
       Dame Annabelle Rankin was born in Brisbane on 28 July 1908. Her career is probably most notable for having attained a series of firsts in Australian public life, and I just illustrate some of those firsts which she attained. She was elected to the Senate for the Liberal Party of Australia in the 1946 Federal election; the first woman from Queensland to enter Federal politics. She was a pioneer in the involvement of women in Australian public life. In October 1947, a year later, she was appointed Opposition Whip; the first woman in any Westminster-style parliament to hold the office of Whip. In June 1951 she was appointed Government Whip, a position she held for 15 years. She served, as most senators do, on various parliamentary committees. She was created a Dame of the British Empire in the Queen's birthday honours in 1957. She was Australia's second woman to hold Cabinet or ministerial rank after Dame Enid Lyons, but she was the first woman responsible for an executive department when she became Minister for Housing in the Holt Government on Australia Day 1966. She held that portfolio until May 1971 when she retired from Parliament. On her retirement from Parliament she was appointed High Commissioner to New Zealand, being the first Australian woman to be appointed to a diplomatic post in another country, and she held that position with distinction until September 1974. In addition to her public career in the parliamentary sense, she had a record of considerable community services before she entered parliament, as a teacher, with the Girl Guides Association, the Young Women's Christian Association and various other bodies of that kind. Her community concerns were very important to her throughout her 25 years as a parliamentarian.
      </para>
      <para>
       Dame Annabelle Rankin was a long-standing and respected member of this chamber who served her country and her Party, the Liberal Party of Australia, with distinction. Her parliamentary achievements were recognised in 1984 when the new Federal seat of Rankin in Queensland was named in her honour. On behalf of the Government I extend to her sister our sincere sympathy at the passing of a fine Australian.

        —On behalf of the Opposition, I wish to express our support for the motion of condolence which has been moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) and to support his expressions of sympathy to Dame Annabelle Rankin's sister. Senator the Hon. Dame Annabelle Rankin was not known well to me. I met her only as a visitor to this place, but it is clear from anything one can read of her or, indeed, hear of her from her contemporaries that she was an outstanding contributor to this place and an outstanding person. There is a small biography of her which is entitled A Woman of Distinction, and I found in a critique of that book an article headed `A thoroughly nice lady'. On what I know of her I think she will be long remembered in both those terms-as a woman of distinction and as a thoroughly nice lady.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       She had an outstanding career, which has been outlined by the Leader of the Government, and that career seemed to have left her kindness, her calm and her good cheer untouched. I think that alone is a matter of some distinction in this place. Born in Brisbane, she was the child of a politician, and that makes her one of the many people who have chosen to follow in the footsteps of a parent. One of the present female senators in this place, Senator Shirley Walters, is one who has followed her father into politics, and Dame Annabelle Rankin was another. Her work during the war was distinguished. After her experience with the Girl Guides Association prior to the war she did welfare work with the armed forces and travelled extensively doing that work. She was in the end responsible for the welfare of all women's services in Queensland. She was, as Senator Button has told us, elected to the Senate in 1946 and she held the various positions that he has outlined. As an ex-Whip, I would have to say that remaining Whip for 15 years shows a strength of character that I think is beyond the capacity of any other Whip I have met in this place and, again, it is quite remarkable that all who speak of her say that she left that experience the same nice person that she entered it. As I said, as an ex-Whip, and looking at the Whips in the chamber at the moment, I regard that as an outstanding achievement.
      </para>
      <para>
       Dame Annabelle Rankin was not married and one of her anecdotes touching on this is, I think, a reminder of the kindness and ease that she showed. She described in an interview in this biography-she obviously gave a series of long interviews for it-an incident when during a campaign speech a very irate women interjected: `I wish you would get married'. Her response was: `Madam, thank you so much for thinking so kindly of me. A number of people have said that to me but they have always been men'. It was the sort of gentle but very effective response that all of us would wish we were able to emulate.
      </para>

       Dame Annabelle was a colleague of some honourable senators who are here still and, of course, was well known to some of the Queensland senators who are not her contemporaries in this place. I know that they wish to contribute to this motion of condolence.

       It is obvious that Dame Annabelle Rankin inspired affection and respect among her colleagues. She inspired the same feelings among her staff. I am pleased that two of them are able to be in the Senate today. They are Trish O'Connor, who is well known to many of us because of her work with not only Dame Annabelle Rankin but also subsequently the late Senator Ivor Greenwood, and Mr John Partridge who served her as a private secretary. It is a tribute to her that they wish to be in this place on this occasion.

       The Opposition is proud of the many firsts that were achieved by this notable senator from Queensland. She was a woman who in more difficult times for women made her achievements appear almost easy. We know that that cannot have been so and that she would have run up against the barriers that one always comes up against in political life. But she seemed to surmount those barriers with great grace and apparent ease. It is a matter of great regret to us that she has died but we are very grateful for the life that she led and for the contribution she made to Queensland and to Australia.

        —On behalf of the National Party of Australia I too support the motion moved by Senator Button and supported by Senator Chaney. As has already been indicated, Dame Annabelle Rankin was a woman of many firsts. I will not go over that ground. She came into the political scene at the end of World War II. Significantly, that was also a time when women were coming into the work force. I suppose one might say that that was out of necessity. Throughout World War II women were in the armed forces and were taking the place of men who had to serve in the armed forces. Once that had happened there was no going back. When she came onto the scene it was a time of retraining, rehabilitation and an acceptance of the fact that women were in the work force and were there to stay. From her point of view it was a time to make sure that, among many other things, there were better facilities for working women in this nation.

       The post-war period was also a time of assimilation of displaced persons who came here from other countries. That was a priority. Dame Annabelle took a personal interest in that and in the problems of migrants. In the book A Woman of Distinction, to which Senator Chaney referred, she mentions how when she was out shopping once she came across a young migrant girl in tears. It turned out that the girl could not make herself understood to the shop assistant. Dame Annabelle sat the girl down and asked her what she wanted. The girl said: `I want a thing to hold the cauliflower so that the water runs out and the cauliflower stays in'. Very shortly they were able to go and buy a colander. But then Dame Annabelle, in her inimitable style, said to the girl: `Why don't you come and play shop with me?' A time was then arranged for the girl to go to Dame Annabelle's house and there, in what soon developed into riotous play acting, the girl indicated the things that she would want in a normal household kitchen and these were taken from the shelf. From that play acting a bit of education in everyday English was achieved.

      <para>
       Dame Annabelle also worked in support of handicapped people, particularly for facilities in their homes so that they could use whatever strengths and skills they each had in order to live as independent a life as possible. She also gave great encouragement to Dame Enid Lyons when she was fighting for child endowment for the first child. As a senator she was able to pursue these concerns at the highest level in our land. But that did not detract from her parliamentary duties. When she was elected in 1946-47 she and her Queensland Senate colleagues constituted the entire Opposition, which meant that she had a pretty heavy work load on top of the normal duties of a senator representing a State. As has been said, Dame Annabelle was a Whip. She described it as an interesting job but not an easy one. Indeed, in the book A Woman of Distinction, in relation to the history of the Whip, she stated:

      <para>
       In England, in the days of one of the early Georges, and I can only give you this as I was told it, and purposely do not give the date because I am not sure, he was anxious about certain legislation which was going through the House of Commons. Knowing that the numbers were so vital for the government, he said to the member responsible for getting the numbers (he was not known as the Whip at that point), `Whip them from the hunting fields of England and the pleasant haunts of Paris', and so from that day onwards the term Whip became well known and the official term.
      </para>
      <para>
       She then stated:

       I can assure you that when I whipped I had nothing as exciting to contend with as the hunting fields of England or the pleasant haunts of Paris.
      </para>
      <para>
       I interpolate here that some of us who have had the job of Whip here have had some of the more pleasant restaurants of Canberra come in the way of a successful count. She also said that Whips trust each other. I suppose that is something that those of us who have been part of that exclusive group have all learned. If the whole House is in uproar, the Whips can sort it out and get the show back on the road provided they trust each other.

       Dame Annabelle was a contemporary of many people who are now famous names in our politics-Fadden, Menzies, Calwell and Hughes. Speaking of Hughes, she said:

       He, like everybody else, has failings. At times I am certain he was difficult and hard, but these failings make us more human.
      </para>
      <para>
       Dame Annabelle saw everybody as a human being. She did not look for faults in people but just accepted their make-up and the fact that faults are part of being a human being. She came into politics at a time when it was not as easy as it is at present. Quite rightly, many of us believe that it is not an easy job now. In those days travel was a lot harder. Most of the travel that she did around Queensland was by train, and it was before the time of diesel engines and air conditioning. She recalled that over and above the gold pass senators were allocated about #30 for travel which could be used on odd occasions for air fares. Of course, accommodation in the outback towns was not very good. As I have said, with only a few coalition members in the Senate, the work load was burdensome and constant. But she took her place and played her part. It has been said by the two previous speakers that she went on to become a Minister and then High Commissioner to New Zealand. I was privileged to represent my Party at her state funeral and, along with you, Mr President, to be one of the official pall-bearers. She was a great Australian and a great representative of my State of Queensland. Along with my colleagues, I offer my sympathy to her sister, Jean.

        —On behalf of the Australian Democrats I support the condolence motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button). I think we all agree that the death of Dame Annabelle Rankin brings to a close a remarkable life and career. It has already been mentioned that she was a trailblazer in many areas and a significant role model in others. Born in 1908, she came from a politically conscious family. It is perhaps because of that that she was spurred on and better able to take on the tasks that she set for herself. Her father, Colonel C. D. W. Rankin, was for many years a member of the Legislative Assembly for Burrum in the Queensland State Parliament, and he was also Minister for Railways.

       Dame Annabelle first entered Federal Parliament as a Liberal senator for Queensland in 1946. As Senator Button has already mentioned, a brief resume of her parliamentary career shows that she was Liberal Whip when her Party was in opposition and again when it took over government, and she was appointed Minister for Housing by Harold Holt. She retired from Parliament in 1971 and was appointed Australian High Commissioner to New Zealand. While for any individual this represents a remarkably distinguished career, it fails to reflect the really significant aspects of Dame Annabelle's career-her strength and the role that she played not only in the Parliament but elsewhere.
      </para>
      <para>
       In her 25 unbroken years in politics, Dame Annabelle, as has already been mentioned, was the first Queensland woman senator, the first woman Government Whip in any British Commonwealth Parliament and one of the few women Ministers in the Australian Federal Parliament. She was also the first woman appointed an Australian High Commissioner. This analysis of her career shows how significant a trailblazer she was. It is something that few of us today are likely to emulate but, I suspect, many of us would envy. We would certainly envy her strength of character. We would envy the purposefulness of a woman who was able to take all those things in her stride. Even today, women in politics are underrepresented but when Dame Annabelle Rankin began, she was one of the first female senators and the first woman incumbent of many important offices.

       Dame Annabelle, apart from contributing in the parliamentary and diplomatic spheres, was active in many community organisations, including the Girl Guides and the Red Cross. Throughout her life she maintained a particular interest in the welfare of young people, the disabled and the aged and was a regular advocate of their causes. Overall, Dame Annabelle was a pioneer, a significant role model for women, a magnificent contributor to Australian public life and community-minded in a way that we could all emulate. We much regret her passing and extend our sympathy to her sister.

In my lifetime, no Queensland senator has been better known, better loved or more respected than Dame Annabelle Rankin. Other honourable senators have spoken of her long parliamentary career. To me, she was a permanent part of Queensland political life. I first met her when I was a small schoolboy during the late 1940s shortly after she entered the Senate.

I would particularly like to express my sympathy to her sister, Jean, and to her other relatives. I pay tribute to a remarkable person whom I was privileged to know from 1946 over the three decades of her public career. This Parliament has produced some remarkable women of achievement-Enid Lyons, who comes immediately to mind, Dorothy Tangney and, of course, Annabelle Rankin. One must think of Annabelle Rankin with happiness because she had the gift of happiness and friendship. When I think of her in the immediate post-war years, I think of a titian haired woman of considerable attractiveness, both of personality and of presence. I think of her twinkling, sparkling eyes which always managed to capture the happiness of the day and of the smile on her face, yet she had an ability to lead and command on both sides of the Senate. As other honourable senators have said, she attracted warmth, affection and love.

Trish O'Connor and John Partridge have travelled great distances and at great inconvenience to come here and to participate. We welcome their participation in this tribute.

       As you would know, Mr President, from your long experience here, that signifies the kind of comradeship and bipartisanship that Dame Annabelle expressed in the Parliament. We often recite people's physical achievements, thinking that those are their monuments, rather than looking at their inherent personalities. It is remarkable that Dame Annabelle was a senator for 25 years, that during that time she was a party Whip for 17 years and was enormously respected as such, that for five years she was a Minister of the Crown-as Senator Button said, the first woman Minister; my memory is that Dame Enid Lyons was Vice-President of the Executive Council-and that she went on to be High Commissioner to New Zealand for four years. Those are great achievements but they are not the measure of the person. The measure is that those who walked and associated with Dame Annabelle are immensely the better for having known her. We are immensely the better for her friendship, the affection which she gave to us and the plain common sense which she brought to bear as a Senate Whip. We are the better for the fact that she was the best of colleagues. One could not have a warmer friend.

       That the Senate express its deep regret at the death, on 7 September 1986, of the Honourable Leslie Harry Ernest Bury, CMG, a member of the House of Representatives for the division of Wentworth from 1956 to 1974, and a former Minister of the Crown from 1961 to 1962 and 1963 to 1971, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and the members of his family in their bereavement.

       Mr Leslie Bury was born on 25 February 1913 in London and was educated at Queen's College, Cambridge. He was elected to the Australian House of Representatives for the New South Wales seat of Wentworth, representing the Liberal Party of Australia, in the by-election that was held following the resignation of the Rt Hon. Sir Eric Harrison. He gave 17 years continuous service to the Parliament and held various ministerial portfolios to which I will refer without specifying the dates. He was Minister for Air, Minister for Housing, Minister for Labour and National Service, Treasurer and Minister for Foreign Affairs until the government of the day was defeated. He also had non-parliamentary involvements, in the same sorts of areas, I suppose, as Director of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Australian representative on the International Monetary Fund in Washington. He had senior Public Service posts in Canberra and was the President of the Australian Institute of International Affairs from 1949 to 1951. Mr Bury served in the Second World War in the Second Australian Imperial Force from 1943 to 1945.

       I have only passing or slightly dim recollections of Mr Bury as a Minister, but I think it is true to say that from everything that was said about him at the time and subsequently he was a very workmanlike and decent Minister in the way in which he performed his role. He was a long-standing and respected member of the House of Representatives and of the Parliament. On behalf of the Government, I extend to his widow and family sincere sympathy in their bereavement.

       I think the same comments could have been made in speaking to the condolence motion for the late Dame Annabelle Rankin because, in effect, in her duties she worked with the forces in Queensland. Of that group of people who saw war service very few are left in this Parliament. I can think of Senator Sir John Carrick, Senator Gietzelt, Senator Kilgariff, the Opposition Whip, and Senator Withers. When the Parliament was peopled largely by that ex-service generation, it was a place of far greater certainty and was, in a way, very much more attractive. It may be a difficult way in which to learn one's certainties about life, but I think those Australians who served in that way knew what they wanted for the country and brought an attitude and an approach to politics that I for one found very attractive. In many respects, it was superior to what we have been able to re-create with the next generation.

       Mr Bury was born in England, but he made a notable contribution to the country of his adoption. He came to Australia with a private bank. The Army took him away from that. Subsequently, he joined the then Department of External Affairs and then the Commonwealth Treasury. While working with the Treasury he became Executive Director of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and Australian representative on the International Monetary Fund. Therefore, he entered this Parliament with a substantial background and experience across a range of areas. That helps to explain the considerable contribution he made to government during his period as a member of parliament.

       Mr Bury succeeded Senator Shirley Walters's father to the seat of Wentworth. That is yet another of the personal threads that run through Australian political life and remind us what a numerically small society Australia has. He held a series of ministries, although his early ministerial career was broken by the fact that he contradicted Sir John McEwen in his concerns about the entry of Britain into the Common Market. It is one of my early recollections of politics that Mr Bury had to stand down from the Ministry and did not return to it until after the next election. After that time, he continued his ministerial career and held major portfolios.
      </para>
      <para>
       His return was to the difficult task of establishing a new department. He was the first of the Commonwealth Ministers for housing, and organised a new department. Again, it is a reminder of the smallness of the society in which we move that he handed over that Department to Senator the Honourable Dame Annabelle Rankin to whom we referred and whom we remembered earlier in debate. Mr Bury's contribution in all of those positions was of the nature indicated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. He was a most workmanlike politician. He was, in the view of his contemporaries, a man of great integrity. I know that he had the warm regard and respect of my father. When he was a candidate for Prime Minister, it was written of him that he would be firm in his judgments, uncompromising, but essentially fair and probably more humane than any other likely candidate. All that rings very true to me of the man I knew, although I did not know him well. I express to his widow and children the sympathy of the Opposition for the loss of a fine husband and father and a man who had the respect of his colleagues.

Significantly, as has been said, he came to us from what was known then and still is a little as the old country, and we adopted him. More than that, he adopted this country. He did not just come out to Australia. He served this country in many fields as the opportunities arose, although I do not suppose that one saw World War II as an opportunity necessarily to serve one's country as one would wish. However, he played his part in that respect. He held various positions in the Public Service and had a long and distinguished parliamentary career. My Party and I wish to be associated with the motion of condolence and express our sympathy to his widow and family.

        —On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I support the motion of condolence moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) on the death of Leslie Bury. Like the death of Dame Annabelle Rankin, the death of Leslie Bury brings to an end a very distinguished career in Australian public life, both in and outside the Parliament. As has been mentioned, before Mr Bury entered Parliament he was the Executive Director of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Australian representative on the International Monetary Fund in Washington. He held various senior posts in the Public Service in Canberra, including with Treasury and the Department of Foreign Affairs. Along with Mr Bury's two-year presidency of the Canberra branch of the Australian Institute for International Affairs, his background and war service equipped him well for the parliamentary career that followed.

       As Federal Treasurer in the Gorton Government and later as Minister for Foreign Affairs, Leslie Bury was highly regarded. His earlier roles as Minister for Air, Minister for Housing and Minister for Labour and National Service show how versatile a parliamentarian he was. I join with other senators who have expressed their sympathy for his wife, Anne, and for their family in noting that we regret the passing of Leslie Bury.

       When I think of the times concerning Leslie Bury, my memory goes to two events, especially the one when Sir Eric Harrison went to London. A person came to me and said: `A young economist representing Australia at the World Bank is called Leslie Bury. I wonder whether you would meet him and talk to him. He might be interested in Wentworth'. That is how we met. That was a journey of friendship that we come to know in this profession.
      </para>
      <para>
       More importantly, as has been mentioned today by the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Chaney), I recall the incident when Leslie Bury sought to comment with difference from John McEwen regarding the European Economic Community. I recall vividly walking up and down Martin Place with the then Prime Minister, Mr Menzies, trying, in my amateur way, to talk him out of doing anything radical about Leslie Bury. We walked up and down Martin Place for about half an hour. I can still hear Mr Menzies-those honourable senators who knew him know of the cocked eyebrow and the thumb forward-saying: `You are very persuasive, my boy, but back to the surgery'. I knew that I had lost. But I had not lost, and this Parliament had not lost, because the quality of the man shone through. It was his integrity that led him to do that. It was his integrity that restored him to the Ministry afterwards. Perhaps it is a reflection on our standards that today that incident would not have been mentioned other than as a minor rebuke or perhaps a comment from some of us behind on the independence of spirit of the man himself.
      </para>
      <para>
       In my experience, Leslie Bury was a quiet man. I do not mirror that, sadly. He was a man to respect, a man to measure, and a man to judge. Most of us tend to be noisy. In every sense, he was a gentle man, yet with the firmness of his convictions and a very high intellect. He was a man of great compassion and concern for people. Therefore, he was admirably suited to an era in which post-war reconstruction tried to take away the harshness that had been of the depression years and the war years.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Bury achieved a great deal in his various portfolios. Sadly, in recent years, his health was poor. He was limited, therefore, in his ability to enjoy the fullness of life. I can only say that no man could have been luckier than he was to have had Anne as a wife, alongside him, and his four sons. I have benefited greatly from the friendship of Leslie Bury. This Parliament and the people of Australia will remember him as one of their outstanding members of parliament and citizens.

Those were the times when Albert Monk was President of the ACTU, Sir Harry Bland was Secretary to the Department of Labour and National Service and Leslie Bury was the Minister responsible for that Department. There is no doubt that, during discussions, it was perfectly clear that Leslie Bury had a very firm command of the potential importance of international labour institutions, such as the International Labour Organisation. Of course, at that time he was very much preoccupied with the other aspect of his portfolio-the national service aspect. That must have been a very worrying aspect. Nevertheless, honourable senators who were about at that time will recall that there were significant industrial problems as well, such as postal, transport, waterside and stevedoring problems. Of course, ultimately the portfolio responsibility for all of those problems rested with Leslie Bury. He gave his services to this country. His dedication to his task has been noted. I join other senators in this condolence motion and in conveying condolences to his wife and his family.

        —The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The potential for residues of organochlorine pesticides in food was recognised by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) as part of the Survey of Pesticide Residues in the Total Diet commissioned at the sixty-eighth Session in May 1969. The report of the Survey presented to the seventy-third Session in October 1971 resulted in a recommendation to the States for control of certain organochlorine pesticides. Subsequent Market Basket Surveys have shown a decline in the residues of organochlorine pesticides in foods, indicating that action taken to restrict use of these chemicals has been successful in this regard.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The NHMRC has supported the policies of the Australian Agricultural Council since its inception in the 1960s. At its seventy-third Session in October 1971, the NHMRC noted that steps had been taken by State Departments of Agriculture to prevent contamination of food by organochlorine pesticides.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) My Department has collated information which will be deposited in the parliamentary library. Information provided by State authorities indicates that none of these pesticides has been totally phased out; it does show that the majority of agricultural uses have ceased. Information on substitute chemicals is difficult to obtain and would require considerable additional efforts by the States.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The current NHMRC review of organochlorine pesticides began in December 1985. Recommendations of relevant expert committees were considered by the Public Health Committee of NHMRC in March 1986. Whilst the current information on aldrin, dieldrin, chlordane and heptachlor suggested that further restrictions on the use of these compounds are warranted, it is insufficient to justify precipitate action. It was further felt that any future actions should be scientifically based on hazards estimated from actual exposure data. Accordingly the Public Health Committee proposed the following action:
      </para>
      <para>
       a. Agricultural Uses
      </para>
      <para>
       The Australian Agicultural Council will be requested to provide justification for continuation of the specific uses of these products in agriculture which could give rise to pesticide residues in food directly or indirectly.
      </para>
      <para>
       b. Household Uses
      </para>
      <para>
       All State and Territory Governments will be asked to investigate the domestic uses of these compounds with a view to curtailing or further restricting their availability to the general public through relevant State and Territory legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       c. Urban Uses
      </para>
      <para>
       State and Territory Governments will also be asked to investigate the uses of these compounds in the domestic pest control industry and the resultant human exposure which could arise from such usage.
      </para>
      <para>
       The National Occupational Health and Safety Commission will be asked to investigate the occupational aspects of use of these compounds, particularly by the urban pest control industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       Information on current uses and their needs, resultant human exposure and the hazards of alternative products has been requested and will be evaluated as soon as possible.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Public Health Committee believes that when this information is available, the expert NHMRC committees would be well placed to reach sound conclusions and provide further advice on the necessity for further regulation of these compounds.

       (4) and (6) The Attorney-General's Department has advised that, unless an authority is statutorily protected, it is liable for the torts of its servants committed in the course of their duty. Where employees, acting in the course of their duty are incompetent and, as a consequence, loss is suffered by a member of the public, it will commonly be found that the act or omission which was seen as incompetent was also tortious. For example, incompetent driving would probably be tortious. In the absence of a denial of liability the negligent giving of erroneous advice is tortious where the advice is given by a person having a duty of care to one who suffers foreseeable damage as a result of reasonably relying on that advice. Many other forms of incompetence would also be tortious, but each case would need to be considered on its own facts.

       The members of the statutory authorities marked with an asterisk in the list given in (2) above, have some degree of statutory protection from suit.

The original design competition documents did contain a requirement for 400 square metres to be allocated to a National Civil Defence Shelter to safeguard personnel and documents in the event of a natural disaster or Act of War. The Joint Standing Committee on the new Parliament House deleted the requirement in 1981.

      <para>
       (1) I have not recently received from the Association any submission concerning parental accommodation fees in hospitals, although I have seen and previously considered a submission, of July 1983, entitled ``Submission on Parental Accommodation Fees''.
      </para>
      <para>
       Benefits in accordance with the basic tables operated by private health insurance funds are only payable in respect of in-patients, that is, generally speaking, persons who occupy a bed in a hospital for the purpose of hospital treatment. The same principle applies to the Commonwealth bed day subsidy applicable to persons accommodated in private hospitals overnight. Parents accompanying their children in hospital are not in-patients and, therefore, are ineligible for benefits. There is no proposal to change this long standing position.
      </para>
      <para>
       However private health funds are free to offer a benefit under their supplementary or ancillary tables in respect of parental accommodation fees in hospital if they wish.
      </para>

       (2-3) Reports in the health and medical literature confirm that children are helped to overcome the trauma associated with hospitalisation and treatment by having a parent constantly present.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) While such a scheme would appear to have potential for saving money I am not aware of any evidence to support this or to show that savings offset increased costs. I do not believe the main rationale for such a scheme is cost savings, rather it is, and should be, better care.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) This matter was raised at the Second Meeting of the Australian Health Services Council held in Darwin on 19 July 1984. Council agreed that the level or waiver of hospital charges for parental accommodation was a State matter and noted that the States had a policy of waiving charges in cases of hardship and would continue to do so.

      </para>

       These figures are not regarded as reliable because of the confusion surrounding many incidents of unrest and because many people who are injured do not seek treatment at government clinics and hospitals for fear of being reported to the police. Figures are not available on a racial basis but it is generally accepted that few whites have been injured.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The Africaner Weerstandsbeweging (which means ``Afrikaner Resistance Movement'') was formed in 1972 by disaffected members of the governing National Party. The particular issue which prompted the formation of the AWB was the dialogue with other African states which was then being pursued by the Prime Minister, B. J. Vorster. Its members also believed that the National Party was generally becoming too accommodating towards blacks. The AWB has never attracted a large following but it has risen to occasional prominence because of the extreme and racist views of its members and because of the involvement of some of its members in violence. In 1983 two former members were convicted of offences under the Terrorism Act and sentenced to 15 years jail each. In the same year the leader of the AWB, Mr Eugene Terreblanche, was given suspended sentences after being convicted of two offences related to the illegal possession of firearms. The AWB has become more prominent during the last couple of years. It has held public rallies to protest against the government's reform program and to advocate the greater use of force in suppressing black unrest and black political dissent.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The Government condemned in strong terms the South African attacks on Zimbabwe, Zambia and Botswana. The Government was particularly concerned because the raids effectively ended the efforts of the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group to promote dialogue and negotiation in South Africa. A number of possible measures against South Africa were considered at the time, including the temporary withdrawal of the ambassador, but the Government decided to wait until Commonwealth heads of government had considered the report of the Eminent Persons Group before making any decisions. The meeting in London agreed on eleven measures which should be applied against South Africa and the Government is now considering their implementation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) The Government is prepared to support comprehensive mandatory economic sanctions against South Africa in the United Nations context. Australia has voted in favour of such sanctions in the Security Council because this is the best way to ensure that they are applied universally. Pending international agreement on mandatory economic sanctions the Government has imposed a broad range of voluntary measures in concert with other members of the Commonwealth.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Minister will be aware of the report given wide publicity in the media on the day the Builders Labourers' Federation was deregistered that $1.5m was withdrawn from the union's bank in Melbourne. I am reliably informed that assets of the BLF in New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory total approximately $10m. Will the Minister inform the Senate what steps the Government is taking to ensure that these funds are returned to the persons who were financial members of the union at the time the union was deregistered and not used by the members of the Executive of the BLF for their own benefit or to fund industrial disputes within other unions and within industry generally, to the detriment of the Australian work force and its employers?
      </para>
      <para>
       The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
      </para>
      <para>
       The legislation passed by the Parliament during the last Sittings cancelling the registration of the Australian Building Construction Employees' and Builders Labourers' Federation (``the Federation'') does not contain any provision expressly dealing with the disposal or redistribution of the assets of the Federation. Sub-section 4 (1) of the Builders Labourers' Federation (Cancellation of Registration-Consequential Provisions) Act 1986 provides, however, for sub-section 143 (6) of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 to continue to apply to the Federation. That sub-section provides that, subject to certain circumstances, the property of an organization which has had its registration cancelled shall be held and applied by the unregistered association in accordance with the constitution and rules of the organization insofar as they can be observed after deregistration.
      </para>
      <para>
       At this stage, the assets of the Federation remain with the Federation and under its control. Moreover the Commonwealth has no power in respect of the assets of the Federation located in the States. The Commonwealth could legislate in respect of those assets of the Federation located in the Territories, but the need to do so has not arisen. The Government will continue to monitor the situation and will determine what action it should take if necessary circumstances arise.
      </para>
      <para>
       Legislative action in respect of the assets of the Federation located in the States is a matter for the respective State Governments.

      <para>
       The Commonwealth Government announced on 3 March that it has agreed to provide $1 million in financial assistance to small scale tin producers within Australia who are experiencing difficulty in rationalising their mining operations in the wake of the collapse in world tin prices.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commonwealth assistance scheme is in the form of an interest subsidy on commercial loans and leasing arrangements for mine relocation and restructuring, and should assist small scale tin producers to maintain their viability through restructuring and diversifying their mining operations. The assistance provides for a 50 per cent interest subsidy on a loan of up to $20,000 to a maximum subsidy payment of $8,000 per eligible tin producer.
      </para>
      <para>
       Following representations from the small scale tin mining industry and discussions with the Queensland Government, the Government considered the arrangements for this scheme and on 6 June announced a number of changes. The Government agreed to delete the initial requirement that, to be eligible for assistance, small scale tin producers undertake to relinquish their tin leases by 30 September 1989. The Government's decision recognises that the original provision to relinquish tin leases would prevent miners from diversifying/restructuring without the added security of existing tin leases and associated assets, and that some diversified/restructured operations would not be commercially viable without access to existing tin leases.
      </para>
      <para>
       A further change to the scheme is that, in view of the continued uncertainty in the tin market, and the time delay since the scheme was initially announced, the Government has agreed to backdate the subsidy on relevant borrowings and lease payments to 24 October 1985.
      </para>
      <para>
       The scheme will be administered by State Governments who currently have before them draft Financial Agreements to provide for the allocation of Commonwealth funding for the scheme. Once the States have agreed to these, it is expected the scheme will be in place shortly thereafter.
      </para>
      <para>
       In Queensland, where the majority of Australia's small scale tin producers are located, the Commonwealth's assistance package is designed to complement a package of concessions announced by the Queensland Government on 4 February 1986 which provided for the deferral of royalties and mining lease rentals until 30 September 1986, and the writing off of interest and penalties associated with the deferral of these payments. The Queensland Government recently announced an extension of the period for deferral of royalties and lease rentals to 30 September 1987. The concessions offered by the State also provide that existing tin producers who leave the industry before 30 September 1987 will not be required to pay royalties on tin produced after 24 October 1985, and if mining leases or claims are surrendered the rental due for 1986 and 1987 will also be written off.

      <para>
       (1) On 3 March 1986 the Commonwealth Government announced it had agreed to participate in a proposal aimed at resolving the international tin crisis (the ``TINCO'' proposal), subject to similar action by the 22 member countries of the International Tin Council (ITC) and its creditor banks and brokers. Australia's share of the funds required to implement the proposal would have been about  #Sterling 5.3 million. However, the proposal was not successful owing to the ITC's subsequent failure to arrive at a consensus on the proposed rescue package.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) No. The funds allocated by the Government to provide for Australia's contribution to the ``TINCO'' proposal were appropriated for that purpose. However, the Government has agreed to provide financial assistance to small scale tin producers within Australia experiencing difficulties as a result of the international tin crisis (see 3 below, and the answer to Senate Question on notice 740, for details).
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The Commonwealth's assistance scheme, which offers a 50 per cent subsidy on the interest on a loan of up to $20,000, to a maximum subsidy payment of $8,000 per eligible tin miner, is designed to assist small scale tin producers by facilitating debt reconstruction and assisting them to achieve viability through restructuring and diversifying their mining operations. It will complement a package of concessions being offered by the Queensland Government by way of deferral of royalties and lease rentals.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) In relation to de facto relationships, the Department of Education implements policy determined by the Government. Specific provisions concerning de facto relationships are included in most of the schemes of educational assistance to individuals administered by the Department of Education, as described in (2) below. With respect to departmental staff there are also provisions in the various Personnel Management Manuals, which are common to all Commonwealth Departments.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) In two student assistance schemes governed by legislation, namely the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme (TEAS) and the Postgraduate Awards (PGA) scheme, and in the non-legislated Adult Secondary Education Assistance Scheme (ASEAS) there is a common definition of ``spouse'' which includes acceptance of de facto relationships where there is a child of the relationship or two years' cohabitation. Such relationships may enable a recipient of assistance to qualify for certain allowances, namely dependent spouse and fares allowances under TEAS and ASEAS, and dependants, travelling and establishment allowances under the PGA scheme. In addition, under TEAS and ASEAS, the independent rate of allowance is paid where a student is living in a de facto relationship and there is a child of the relationship. In all income tests where a spouse's income is taken into account (including the parental income test for the non-legislated Secondary Allowances Scheme (SAS) and the Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme) the term includes a de facto spouse.
      </para>
      <para>
       For the assessment of benefits under the Aboriginal Study Assistance Scheme (Abstudy) no distinction is made between married students and those living in de facto relationships, in recognition of differing social patterns within Aboriginal society. The relevant benefits are living and dependants allowances. Students who are 18 years or over or ``married, living in a de facto relationship or widowed, divorced, single, separated but with one or more dependants'' attract a higher rate of living allowance payable. Students also receive a dependants allowance in respect of a dependent spouse or de facto spouse.

       (1) What measures are in place, or will be considered to protect Australian wheat farmers from a reported prediction by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation that the world's wheat trade will decline in the remainder of 1986 because of a variety of economic circumstances, particularly in view of the crippling anti-Australian trade practices and marketing techniques in which the United States and the European Community are already heavily engaged.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The Government is particularly concerned about the potential impact on Australian farmers of adverse world wheat trade developments, especially depressed prices and the predatory nature of US and EEC agricultural policies. The Government has been very active in seeking to protect Australian wheat interests.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) With respect to measures currently in place to protect Australian farmers, the guaranteed minimum price scheme for wheat, introduced in 1979 and continued in the Wheat Marketing Act 1984 for the five year period ending 30 June 1989, provides a mechanism that ensures Australian wheat farmers' returns are not fully affected by sudden unexpected downturns in world prices.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Recent Government action on this issue includes the Joint Party delegation lobbying on behalf of Australian wheatgrowers in Washington DC, the Foreign Minister, Mr Hayden raising the matter in his recent presentation in ANZUS talks and the meeting of international fair wheat traders in Cairns convened by the Minister for Trade to consider US and EEC trade moves. Future action includes the Australian presentation at the forthcoming Multilateral Trade Negotiations.

      <para>
       (1) Victoria has had an unemployment rate consistently below the national average in recent years. The Victorian unemployment rate has been below the national average for 58 consecutive months (from October 1981 to July 1986) and Victoria has had the lowest unemployment rate of all the States for 38 consecutive months (from June 1983 to July 1986).
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) A combination of factors contribute to Victoria having an unemployment rate below the national average.
      </para>
      <para>
       Industries have been affected to varying degrees by poor economic growth over the decade to 1983 and differences in industry composition of the State economies are reflected in differing State unemployment rates. Victoria's unemployment rate in the decade to August 1983 has for the most part been below the national average and the peak unemployment rate for Victoria was 9.7 per cent in May 1983, 0.6 percentage points below the Australian unemployment rate of 10.3 per cent at that time. Full-time employment growth in Victoria in the last three years of economic recovery has been slightly higher than the national average, at 8.4 per cent in the three years to July 1986 compared with 8.0 per cent for Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       Differences between States in their labour force participation rates may also give rise to different unemployment rates, although this has not contributed significantly to the lower unemployment rate experienced in Victoria.
      </para>
      <para>
       Long-term unemployment is also not at present as great a problem in Victoria as it is in Australia as a whole, due to the impact of the 1982-83 recession on long-term unemployment being greater for other States than for Victoria. In June 1986 the proportion of the unemployed within the 12 months or longer duration category was 24.1 per cent for Victoria and 29.2 per cent for Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       To the extent that long term unemployed may be less attractive to employers due to loss of job skills and work orientation, the lesser problem of long-term unemployment in Victoria may have enabled its overall unemployment rate to be reduced both faster and more easily.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) and (4) Various `barriers' exist to a common unemployment rate across States. One of the most important relates to the varying employment performance of respective States and the direct influence this has on unemployment outcomes, abstracting from labour force participation changes. Given the pattern of growth of aggregate demand, the composition of industry within States influences the extent to which employment can benefit from economic growth. Mismatches between jobseekers and available job vacancies may be another reason why the unemployment rate in certain States may be higher than the Victorian level. Through the Relocation Assistance Scheme (RAS) which aims to reduce geographical mismatching of jobs and jobseekers, and Government support for skills training (eg. the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training, the Adult Training Program, and the Community Training Program) the Government is directly attempting to improve the matching of jobseekers and job vacancies.
      </para>
      <para>
       The uneven distribution of very long term unemployed across the States may present a `barrier' to reducing unemployment rates in some States to the Victorian level. For example, those unemployed for two years or more represent 0.9 per cent of the labour force in Victoria compared with 1.7 per cent in New South Wales. This may prevent the New South Wales unemployment rate being lowered to the Victorian level.

       The Government does not currently support an operational role for the Bureau which would involve field work to verify or assess intelligence. The Commonwealth supports the concept of co-operation and liaison through the participation of AFP, Customs and State/Territory Police in the exchange of intelligence through the ABCI.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Management Committee of the ABCI, which is comprised of all the Commissioners of Police in Australia, has decided that the Bureau should not at this time have an operational role other than in support of police operations. There is provision in the Intergovernmental Agreement which established the ABCI for Commissioners of Police to provide operational field units within their respective organisations to respond to tasks and priorities required by the ABCI. This approach, coupled with the constant interchange of information between the ABCI and the Bureaux of Criminal Intelligence of the Australian Police Forces, provides a satisfactory and practical solution.

      <para>
       (1) The Extradition Task Force established by the Attorney-General in February 1985 has conducted a complete review of Australia's extradition arrangements. A program for the negotiation of modern extradition treaties to replace the inherited treaties and to put in place extradition arrangements where they presently do not exist is well advanced.
      </para>
      <para>
       Since February 1985 modern extradition treaties have been signed with Ireland, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Norway. Protocols up-dating existing modern treaties have been signed with Sweden, Finland and Austria. The respective processes for bringing these treaties and protocols into force in Australia and each of those countries is now in progress.
      </para>
      <para>
       By 30 June 1986, negotiations had resulted in the initialling by officials of treaty texts with France, Greece, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Monaco, Morocco, Portugal, San Marino, Spain, Switzerland.
      </para>
      <para>
       Negotiations are in progress with Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Philippines, South Korea, Tunisia, Turkey, United States of America.
      </para>
      <para>
       Negotiations are due to commence shortly with Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombo, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay.
      </para>
      <para>
       Expressions of interest in negotiating modern extradition treaties are being sought from other countries. In addition, since February 1985 the Extradition (Foreign States) Act 1966 has been applied, pursuant to Sub-section 10 (4) of that Act, to Japan, Denmark, South Africa, and the Federal Republic of Germany, thus enabling Australia to make requests for extradition of, and consider requests for extradition by, those countries.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (a) Under the treaties now being negotiated, extradition may be granted of a person accused or convicted of any offence punishable under the laws of both countries by a term of at least 12 months imprisonment, or by a more severe penalty. In the case of convicted persons, a minimum term of imprisonment, usually in excess of three months, must remain to be served. Extradition may be refused on a number of internationally accepted grounds, for example, that the offence of which the person is accused or convicted is an offence of a political character.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The procedure for extradition under the treaties negotiated by Australia since February 1985 is simpler than the procedure under the older treaties. The modern procedure for extradition involves the making of a request in writing, accompanied by documents in support of the request. Section 17 of the Extradition (Foreign States) Act 1966, the provisions of which are reflected in the modern treaties, specifies the minimum documentation which must be produced to a Magistrate to enable the making of an order. For example, the documentation comprises, in the case of an accused person, a copy of the warrant for the arrest of the person issued in the requesting country, a statement of the offences for which extradition is requested, a statement of the acts or omissions alleged against the person, particulars of identification, and a statement of the relevant provisions of law. The documentation must be authenticated in accordance with the treaty.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) A model treaty which was settled by the Extradition Task Force has been used as the basis for the negotiations which have been completed or are in progress. As a result, a substantial degree of uniformity has been attained. The procedures envisaged by the model treaty reflect the requirements specified in the Extradition (Foreign States) Act 1966.

       (1) In response to the Government's escalation of the attack on organised crime, my Department is at an advanced stage of developing draft Commonwealth legislation for international mutual assistance in criminal matters which I hope to introduce in the 1986 Budget session. A model bilateral mutual assistance treaty has also been developed. This model treaty will be used as a basis for negotiations with non-Commonwealth countries. A scheme for mutual assistance between Commonwealth countries (including provisions relating to the forfeiture of proceeds of criminal activity) was also considered at the Commonwealth Law Ministers meeting in Harare, Zimbabwe in July-August 1986 and has been adopted by Law Ministers.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mutual assistance treaties or arrangements will provide for reciprocal provision of assistance in the prevention, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences. The informal assistance already provided by Interpol in the investigation of offences will not be affected.

       (2) and (3) As the legislation required to underpin a scheme of mutual assistance in criminal matters has not been passed by the Parliament, no formal treaties or agreements have been entered into.

       The Environmental Resources Study recently initiated by the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council will examine the sensitive environmental resources in the Basin in relation to future management practices. It will take into account the various factors influencing the long-term integrity of the Basin's environmental resources, including tourist and recreational activities.
      </para>
      <para>
       The study will be carried out by officers of the four Governments drawing on expertise within their agencies. This will include consultation with government and non-goverment experts and organisations, as appropriate.

      <para>
       The study will determine what actions should be taken to safeguard the different environmental resources while taking into account the community's significant interest in tourism and recreational activities.

      <para>
       (1) to (8) As indicated in my answer to a question without notice asked by the honourable senator (Hansard, 13 June 1986, page 4058), it is not possible to provide an accurate and meaningful comparison between various countries of the cost and period taken to obtain patent and trade mark registration because of the differences which exist between countries in the procedures followed and the number and types of fees levied at different stages between application and registration of a patent or trade mark.
      </para>
      <para>
       The industrial property offices of each of the OECD countries have, however, been asked to provide information on the cost and period taken for the registration of patents and trade marks in their country on the following assumptions:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) in relation to (3), that the average cost would be computed in relation to ``average'' patent applications that follow a ``normal'' path through the system and would include only the costs of filing, examination and search, grant and maintenance fees up to grant, or equivalent fees which may apply in the country concerned;
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) in relation to (7), costs would be the normal costs up to registration for an ``average'' trade mark application which follows a ``normal'' path;
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) an ``average'' patent application would have an average number of pages and claims;
      </para>
      <para>
       (iv) an ``average'' trade mark application would be what normally applies in the country concerned for registration of a mark in relation to goods or services of a single class;
      </para>
      <para>
       (v) a ``normal'' path would exclude such matters as applicant-requested delays, oppositions, interferences, etc; and
      </para>
      <para>
       (vi) in relation to (4) and (8), the ``average'' period would be that which applies to applications that are currently being granted or registered and should be in respect of ``average'' applications which have followed a ``normal'' path.
      </para>
      <para>
       While many industrial property offices have noted points which illustrate the difficulties in achieving valid comparisons, the following, often approximate, data understood to refer to official fees only, has been provided by 18 August 1986.

      <para>
       In June 1984 the Organization launched a project to develop a new state of the art Payroll/Personnel system using a fourth generation language (NATURAL) and database management (ADABAS) approach. It was necessary that this project be completed and implemented in early 1985 to enable the existing payroll system, operating on the CSIRONET Cyber 76, to be replaced prior to the decommissioning of the Cyber 76.
      </para>
      <para>
       As operating costs of the Cyber 76 were in the order of $1m per annum, CSIRONET did not wish to retain this computer simply for administrative work once the scientific computing was transferred to its replacements, the Cyber 205 and Cyber 840.
      </para>
      <para>
       At that time the scheduled decommissioning of the Cyber 76 was targeted for May 1985 (although it was not ultimately decommissioned until November 1985). The Organization therefore faced a very stringent deadline for the introduction of a modern Payroll/Personnel system if it was to avoid the cost penalties of retaining the Cyber 76 in operation.
      </para>
      <para>
       Following an extensive review of its administrative requirements it had been decided to replace all existing administrative computing systems, which were outdated batch systems and difficult to maintain, with new on-line interactive systems using ADABAS/NATURAL. The development and implementation of the Payroll/Personnel system, being the first of these new systems, involved not only the development of the necessary program software, but also the establishment and operation of interactive databases with all their security complexities, the setting up of a network of administrative terminals for on-line operations and the training of both computer systems staff and users.
      </para>
      <para>
       The project was undertaken with emphasis on economy and against a stringent timetable. With hindsight, its introduction might be seen as having been premature, as all the necessary security features had not been put in place at the time of its introduction. While this resulted in audit criticism at that time, considerable progress has continued to be made since this audit review. Although refinements and developments in these areas will be an ongoing process to meet potential weaknesses that may be identified in the use of these new technologies, the concerted effort made by CSIRO to rectify problems which were identified after introducing the new system are believed to have remedied the deficiencies highlighted in the report of the Auditor-General.

       Will the Government consider introducing a provisional taxation system for this type of mineral exporter (referring to the Swiss-based Aluminium company Aluswisse) so that considerable funds would be held by the Government while any taxation appeals took place.

       The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
      </para>
      <para>
       It is not entirely clear from the question what the honourable Senator meant when he referred to a provisional taxation system. I have presumed, however, that he had in mind a system whereby a withholding of tax is made at the time a payment is made.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government recognises that deduction of tax at source can be a most cost-effective means of collecting tax. However, it is impractical to apply such a system in many instances, particularly where the relevant payments are for the sale of goods. The rate of withholding necessary from gross income to approximate the final tax liability on taxable income would be virtually impossible to calculate because of the many and varied circumstances of each individual taxpayer. Also, where income is received from a foreign source the withholding measures may not be able to be enforced.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under existing law, a company that is unsuccessful in an appeal against a tax assessment, and which has not paid the tax which on appeal it is found liable to pay, is obliged to pay penalty tax at the rate of 20 per cent per annum. This tax is not an income tax deduction.

       The term ``public benevolent institution'' is not defined in that legislation but takes its meaning from common law.

      <para>
       Trade unions offer a wide range of benefits to their members including denticare, home loans and holiday homes. Do these benefits arise out of employment? If so, will they be subject to fringe benefits tax and who will pay the tax? If not, does the Government realise that benefits paid through an association allied to employment would provide a tax loophole?
      </para>
      <para>
       The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
      </para>
      <para>
       Fringe benefits tax is a tax payable by employers on the value of certain benefits provided, either directly or indirectly, by the employer to an employee in respect of the employee's employment. The benefits referred to by the honourable senator arise in consequence of membership of the union and do not arise in consequence of the member's employment. Such benefits are therefore not subject to the tax. If, however, a union provided benefits to an official employed by the union in respect of the official's employment, the union would be liable to pay fringe benefits tax on those benefits in the same way as any other employer.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government does not accept that the situation as described represents a loophole in the fringe benefits tax law. The tax is not intended to apply to benefits that are not related to an employee's employment. In particular, the tax is not intended to apply where a person who is a member of a club, co-operative or other association that is not linked with an employer is able, by reason of his or her membership, to purchase goods or services at a lower price than if those goods or services were purchased by a non-member.

      <para>
       My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer to a pamphlet published by the Australian Sports Aid Foundation which is headed `Australia Bound for Edinburgh '86'. Inside the flyleaf it has a message from Mr Hawke imploring us all to support financially the Australian Commonwealth Games team which goes to Edinburgh this year in July. The pamphlet includes the statement:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Australian Government has incorporated the Australian Sports Aid Foundation with the intention of making your donation to the team tax deductible.
      </para>
      <para>
       Does this definitely mean that the money paid to the Australian Sports Aid Foundation is tax deductible? Secondly, is any other money paid to support the Australian Edinburgh team also tax deductible?
      </para>
      <para>
       In a supplementary question, the honourable senator asked whether the Government is allowing people, through one of its own corporations, to make something tax deductible that would not otherwise be tax deductible.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Taxation Laws Amendment Act 1986 amended the gift provisions of the income tax law to authorise deductions for gifts of $2 or more, made on or after 18 February 1986, to the Australian Sports Aid Foundation. The Government established the Foundation to raise funds for the development of Australian sport generally.
      </para>
      <para>
       Funds raised by the Foundation may be directed to those sports or sporting bodies considered by the Foundation to be most in need of assistance. It is not a requirement of the law that the bodies that receive funds from the Foundation qualify, in their own right, as organisations gifts to which are tax deductible.
      </para>
      <para>
       Moneys paid in support of the Australian Commonwealth Games team may, in certain circumstances, be deductible under the existing general deduction provision of the income tax law. For expenditure to be so deductible, there must be a positive nexus between the incurring of the expenditure (the gift) and the production of assessable income or the carrying on of a business for that purpose. Where a taxpayer carrying on a business is able to demonstrate that a gift in support of the Australian Commonwealth Games team has been made to enhance the public image of that business, the expenditure would have the character of a business expense and be tax deductible.

This could occur where the law is unclear and a decision of a court is necessary to decide the proper basis of assessment. The courts have recognised that in appropriate cases this multiple assessment action is open. In such cases, the Commissioner takes steps to avoid double taxation of the income by seeking payment only in respect of one of the relevant assessments until the matter is clarified. Once the correct basis of assessment is decided, any other assessment of the same income is withdrawn.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Has the attention of the Minister representing the Treasurer been drawn to an article in today's Age that indicated that the Commissioner of Taxation is intending to raise 10,000 assessments against taxpayers involved with so-called bottom of the harbour tax avoidance schemes.
      </para>

       (2) Can the Minister confirm that report.

       (3) If so, can the Minister advise on what basis such assessments will be raised.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Are these assessments likely to be based on the same grounds as was the Hawke Labor Government's unreasonable legislation which has already been twice rejected by the Senate.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Treasurer has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's question:
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Commissioner of Taxation has confirmed that approximately 10,000 notices of assessment will issue to vendor-shareholders in respect of the sale of their shares in companies stripped of pre-tax profits.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) and (4) The assessments are being issued in reliance on section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Section 260 operates to make void, as against the Commissioner, a contract, agreement or arrangement made or entered into on or before 27 May 1981 to the extent to which it has or purports to have the effect of altering the incidence of income tax or of relieving any person from liability to pay any income tax.
      </para>
      <para>
       The effect of section 260, in the context of pre-tax company profit stripping, is seen to be that the purported sale of the company shares is void as against the Commissioner so that the amount received by a shareholder that represents profits of the company of one kind or another is assessable as a dividend. Notices of assessment and adjustment sheets will reflect the inclusion of a dividend in assessable income.

      Fringe Benefits Tax

        —On 2 June 1986 (Hansard, page 3137) Senator Messner asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, a question without notice regarding the concerns expressed by the Prime Minister recently at Canowindra about the impact of the fringe benefits tax on the rural community, and in particular as it affects accommodation provided on farms. The Treasurer has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I am aware of the issues put to the Prime Minister at Canowindra and the Government sees no need to amend the fringe benefits tax as it applies to farmers. Many of the farmers' concerns were based on a misunderstanding of the intended application of the tax.
      </para>
      <para>
       Certain lobby groups have sought to misrepresent and inflate the complexity and financial impact of the tax upon rural-based employers. The suggestion that farmers will have to pay fringe benefits tax on accommodation provided to children who work on the farm is just one of the more extreme suggestions put forward by these groups. I have also pointed out that the family homes of farmers will not be subject to the tax except in those circumstances where farmers claim tax deductions in relation to that home on the grounds that the farmer is in some sense an employee rather than the owner of the property. In fact, the concessions applying through the valuation principles built into the legislation would leave farmers with only a modest fringe benefits tax liability in most cases. Further, accommodation and power provided to employees in remote areas will attract a 40 per cent discount in recognition of the difficulties associated with remote area employment.
      </para>
      <para>
       It should be remembered that the fringe benefits tax is intended to improve the fairness of our tax system. Without the fringe benefits tax those employees who can contract with their employers to receive a substantial part of their remuneration in the form of fringe benefits bear a proportionately smaller share of the tax burden than other employees.

       The Commissioner of Taxation has informed me that he is aware of the arrangements to which the honour- able senator referred. Generally speaking, there is nothing in the income tax law to operate against the making of interest-free loans. Parents make interest-free loans to children. Club members make them to clubs. Associated companies make them amongst themselves. The interest-free loans in the present case do not attract any income tax consequences to the members.

       (1) There are only two United Nations Covenants to which Australia is a party, namely the Covenants on Civil and Political Rights, and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. There are, however, a number of other multilateral treaties, sometimes termed ``conventions'', for which the Secretary-General of the United Nations performs depositary functions or which have been drawn up by specialised agencies of the United Nations, and to which Australia has become a party by ratification or by some other step provided for in the treaty concerned, such as definitive signature, accession or acceptance.

       (3) I understand that the device has been developed to prototype stage so that research and development funding is no longer relevant. An approach for support through the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) would receive normal consideration for support.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The United States Navy has acknowledged that during the period 1965-1985 its nuclear weapons accident reporting system received 630 reports of ``mishaps''. The United States uses a stringent system of reporting all mishaps, however small, including those involving dummy weapons used in training.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of the 630 mishaps, only two could properly be classified as nuclear weapon accidents; both involved the loss of weapons at sea. One was the loss overboard of a nuclear armed A4E fighter in the Western Pacific. The other occurred in 1968 in the North Atlantic.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of the other mishaps, 364 involved dummy weapons used for training purposes. The remaining 264 mishaps were minor, consisting of such events as flat tyres on trailers, and sprinkler systems in magazines being inadvertently activated. None involved leakage of radioactivity.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) There have been no nuclear weapons accidents in Australian waters nor any, as far as the Australian Government is aware, in South Pacific waters.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Nuclear powered warship (NPW) visits to Australia only take place in accordance with the Australian Government's general conditions of entry. In accordance with these conditions, NPWs are permitted to visit only those ports which have been assessed as suitable in terms of strict environmental and safety criteria. Within these ports, the conditions of entry require that NPWs and other shipping be subject to special navigational controls designed to minimize the likelihood of any mishap. Any port to be visited by an NPW must have in place an operating port safety organisation which includes a suitable radiation monitoring program.
      </para>
      <para>
       Details of these port safety plans vary in accordance with local conditions and administrative arrangements. However, they cover arrangements for routine and emergency radiation monitoring and protection, co-ordination of emergency services, evacuation, public information and the removal of the vessel to a remote location.
      </para>
      <para>
       Arrangements for other types of accidents are covered in the general emergency plans for harbour accidents which exist for every Australian port. These plans utilise the resources of the port emergency services, including fire brigades, police and health agencies, along with State, Territory and Commonwealth support as appropriate.
