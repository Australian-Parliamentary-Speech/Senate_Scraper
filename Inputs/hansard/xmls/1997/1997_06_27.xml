        This motion requires an absolute majority of 75. So, whilst government members may leave the chamber, they would be advised not to go too far as their support for the motion will of course be necessary. I move the motion because, I do not know about everybody else in this place, basically I am ready to go home. With the exception of a number of matters, it is important for the parliament to complete its consideration of the matters before the chamber. For example, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) will shortly be addressing the House on the excellent aged care legislation for which she has been responsible.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is important that that legislation goes through today. We have amendments that the House needs to consider. I understand that the Labor Party would be embarrassed by further debate on the aged care, given the shameful scare campaign being run against the government by the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), who shamefully used the concerns and anxieties of older Australians for her own cheap, personal political benefit—a disgraceful performance by the shadow minister. Not surprised was I to hear her the other day start to back&amp;hyphen;pedal and to apologise for the disgraceful campaign she has been running.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That legislation needs to come back from the Senate. These matters need to be dealt with today. In fact, some aspects of the
        <break page="6529" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         program will come into effect on 1 July. On that basis, the legislation needs to go through the chamber today.

        Whilst for the rest of Australia today is Friday, 27 June, in the technicalities of the parliament, today will be recorded in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Hansard
        </emphasis>
        as Thursday, 26 June. I know you are often a day behind things, but the reason for that is the sitting today is not a new day but an extension of the sitting of the parliament from yesterday. The reason that we do that, in accordance with the convention and the practice, is so that the House in its sitting today can deal with any final amendments coming across from the Senate so that matters are completed by the end of the session. For that reason, we have followed past practice—we do not have a question time today because in fact today is an extension of yesterday.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As I demonstrated to the House, what the government is doing in its management of the House today is exactly what the Labor opposition did when it was in government. As I demonstrated yesterday with many examples, this is the conventional manner of conducting the House's business on this Friday being an extension of yesterday's Thursday sitting.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As far as the motion that I have moved is concerned, the motion to suspend standing order 399, again, this is a conventional approach by this government. We are following the precedent and practice of the former Labor government. In fact, on a number of occasions they threatened standing order 399. Former member Mr Wal Fife used to say that he was responsible for first threatening the use of it, although I have a suspicion it was the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair).
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        However that may be, the fact is that it was used on a number of occasions by the previous Labor government when it was in power—for example, on 19 August 1993 and at the end of a session on 19 December 1991. They gave notice of it on a number of occasions when we, as a responsible opposition, took account of any such notice given and, under those circumstances, did not act unreasonably, nor did we act in the feral way in which this opposition today acts. Given that the purpose of this motion is to facilitate the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         orderly conduct of today's business, I will not use the full time allocated to me, which will not, of course, stop the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean), but the approach I adopt for him is the sooner we get him over and done with, the better.

        Members would be interested to know, as far as the sitting hours for the balance for today are concerned, there are noises coming from the Senate that they may not sit until midnight. With that, there is, therefore, some prospect of our adjourning earlier, but I do not want people to start packing their bags as yet.

        The Senate standing orders would normally see them rise at a quarter to four. If the Senate so decides, it will sit on beyond that time to deal with outstanding matters. If it were to rise at around 4 o'clock, you could expect the House to sit probably until 6 o'clock or 7 o'clock in the expectation that it often takes some hours for the paperwork to be transmitted from the Senate across to the House for us to deal with matters. I am told by Deputy Speaker Nehl that one of the longest transmissions was six hours. So there is a transmission period between when the Senate gets up and when the House can deal with matters.

        That is the best information I have. Obviously we will advise the House and all members of any developments. We appreciate that people would like to be able to get home tonight, if possible. But people should be mindful that, if necessary, to deal with important matters to ensure that legislation is in place by 1 July, we obviously have to continue sitting today as long as it takes, as long as it is necessary, for us to fulfil our duties in that regard. I have moved this motion in accordance with longstanding practice. It does thereby ensure that we can actually do that which we need to do today to complete the business of the House. I do not do it for any other reason.

The breeze is not even giving it the appearance of life. This is a minister who is so dead even the maggots are dropping off.

         But where is he being defended from? The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is defending him from the other side of the world. We have a Prime Minister who avoids press conferences on the issue and who has been so caught out by his misjudged and ill&amp;hyphen;timed trip, being in all the wrong places at the wrong time.

         this morning where he said that we had to do one of two things yesterday for Geoffrey Prosser: we either had to have a full explanation or a cover&amp;hyphen;up.

         That is because more is emerging. The reason we have tried to move censure motions this morning, following insisting upon the minister coming into the House to explain himself, is that what was not included in the statement yesterday—damning as it was in terms of the minister continuing having day-to-day activities and the minister admitting using public office to curry private favour—was today's new revelations—things that were not contained in his statement yesterday.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The two new revelations come from two additional councillors from Bunbury—not Councillor John McCourt, who has sworn a statutory declaration saying that the minister has lobbied him. Would the minister himself be prepared to swear a statutory declaration? We know he will mislead this parliament, but will he swear a statutory declaration saying that he has not lobbied for his development site? I doubt it. Would he be prepared to have his claims tested in a court of law, as Councillor John McCourt is prepared to do? I suspect not. That is why he is not here today, and that is why this government is using every device possible to prevent him being brought before the House and required to explain himself.

          The two new pieces of information that have come today are from two additional councillors—Councillor Major and Councillor Comito, both of whom have said:

         <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">

          This is the direct discussion with Minister Prosser. Minister Prosser was lobbying them to make sure that the development site did not go ahead for parking reasons. Councillor Major said:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          . . . councillors associated with Mr Prosser had questioned car&amp;hyphen;parking for the rival city development so that Target would be forced to go to the Eaton site.
          <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
           Cr Frank Comito said Mr Prosser spoke at a separate meeting about parking.
          </tab>
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          He went on to say:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          If parking was a problem then Target would have most likely gone to the Eaton site.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          Let us understand what we have here. We have a minister who has admitted ringing Nick Greiner—a Liberal mate, a former chairman of Coles Myer—and asking, `Can we get the Target site on to my Eaton development—me, Minister Prosser?' Nick Greiner presumably said something like, `We've got a problem; we've already committed it to the CBD—Bunbury, eight kilometres away.'
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          So this inventive mind of the small business minister says, `I've been involved in a lot of these things. We know how we can nobble the opposition. We will get the council to up the ante for parking spaces. We will get our supporters on that council to insist upon additional car parking spaces.' Then the lobbying campaign begins. But it is nothing formal; no formal presentation. Who would be stupid enough to run a campaign like that in writing? Informal? Yes—the phone calls, the social gatherings, the meetings of people. All these councillors are now fessing up that Geoff Prosser lobbied them to up the ante for the car parking site.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This was no unsuccessful lobby, because on 25 February the council had approved the Crosslands Shopping Centre, the opposition shopping centre, for development, with, I think, 65 car parking spaces. One month later they amended the approval to require an additional 200 car parking spaces. In other
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           words, they lifted the ante three times—this was a pretty effective lobbying campaign—in the space of one month.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I would like to know, and I am sure the public would too, when Geoff Prosser made the call to Mr Greiner. I suspect that it was between 25 February and 26 March. I would suspect that it was closer to 26 March because we are told that out of the blue came the request from the developer, under pressure from Coles, to increase the number of parking spots.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          So what we have here is a minister who has lobbied Nick Greiner and others not just to get a Target store onto his site but to make sure that the opposition site, which has already secured the Target tenancy, gets nobbled. That is why he was so evasive this fortnight in the parliament in detailing the question. Remember the dissembling responses—no formal presentations, only in relation to the Eaton site. He did not want to tell us about the little games he was playing at Bunbury, but we flushed him out.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The work that was done by the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) has been outstanding in this exercise. He has ferreted this information out and as a result we have people coming out of the woodwork everywhere. These people are the enemies that Geoff Prosser has made, because they want his carcass to be cut down too. It will not stop here, because these are the revelations that have come out less than 24 hours after this so-called comprehensive statement by the minister.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The government members try to say, `Oh, you know, it was just a phone call to Nick Greiner.' This was no ordinary phone call. We all know that the reason Geoff Prosser's site in Eaton has not gone ahead is because it has not got its lead tenant. The idiotic Acting Prime Minister thinks that engaging in everyday business means that you have to be engaged every day. Presumably that means you have to be working Christmas Day too. This is the dictionary definition—Tim Fischer's version. How ridiculous! How ineffective and incompetent was that defence! But that is what Prosser left him doing.

We know that the shopping centre that gets a lead tenant like Target is a guaranteed cash cow. We know that if it gets that tenancy, it means millions of dollars more to this multimillionaire.

         These amendments give effect to measures relating to activity test exemptions announced in the 1997-98 budget and make minor technical changes to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Activity Test Penalty Periods) Bill. The Social Security Act 1991 and the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973 are amended as follows. First, amendments are made to enable newstart allowance and youth training allowance customers to be exempt from the activity test for longer than the currently permissible period of 13 weeks in special circumstances. These circumstances would include, for example, empanelment of a jury and temporary caring duties. Second, a new activity test exemption is introduced for expectant mothers. Under the new rule, expectant mothers would be exempt from the activity test from six weeks prior to their expected date of confinement to six weeks after the birth of the child.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These amendments introduce greater flexibility in the administration of the activity test for certain customers who, due to special circumstances of a temporary nature or pregnancy, cannot reasonably be expected to satisfy the requirements of the activity test. The new rules will provide for a better service for people who are unable to look for work or otherwise meet requirements of the activity test because of pregnancy or other special circumstances by removing the need for them to transfer to special benefit. The special benefit has a dollar for dollar reduction income test that is less favourable than the income test applicable to newstart and youth training allowance customers.

         These amendments are to commence on 20 October. They are very welcome. In a sense I am surprised that, after Labor having been in office for 13 years, these amendments were never thought of or actioned before, because they are obviously very evidently required.

           down and negotiate a much better system of activity testing than the government first proposed. Given the comments by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), it might be useful for us to just have a brief look at the history of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Activity Test Penalty Periods) Bill, because we have not got to this position without a little bit of trauma.

         The government announced their proposal for a new activity test regime in the 1996-97 budget. That consisted of a six-week non-payment penalty for the first breach and a 13-week non-payment penalty for second or subsequent breaches. We did make our point clear at the time of this debate on the Social Security Bill 1996 in the Senate in December 1996. While we do support tough measures with regard to fraud and compliance, we do not believe that people should be cut off payments without good reason or for inordinate or indefinite periods. We believe that the government's initial activity test regime proposed was excessively harsh and unreasonable, particularly in the absolute absence of positive measures by the government to assist the unemployed to return to the labour force.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am pleased to say that during the debate the government did withdraw the provisions that would have given effect to that proposed penalty regime and they made an alternative offer: five weeks non-payment for the first breach and eight weeks non-payment for the second or subsequent breaches, as I recall it. Senator Newman did undertake to negotiate with the opposition and minor parties an agreed position. It is pleasing that we have come to an agreed position. But we have not come to that agreed position because of the generosity of the other side. In the 1997 budget, the government announced a revised penalty regime which was actually more
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          severe than the offer made by Senator Newman in December, especially for the third or subsequent breach. The penalty for this reverted from eight weeks to 13 weeks non-payment—no money, nothing.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Subsequent negotiations, which could have taken place before March this year and avoided all this toing and froing had the government been reasonable, have led to the breach regime that we have before us today. The government amended the bill in the House of Representatives to give effect to a much more reasonable penalty regime: an 18 per cent rate reduction for 26 weeks for the first breach—and, as the government knows, fortunately it is the case that most people breach only once—a 24 per cent rate reduction for 26 weeks for the second breach and eight weeks non-payment for third and subsequent breaches.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We do recognise and appreciate that the government has seen the strength of our arguments. The result will be less need for the unemployed to beg, borrow or steal. That is what we were facing. We are also pleased to support the other government amendments that are before us today. They give effect to a beneficial measure announced in the 1997-98 budget, which will allow prenatal and postnatal women relief from meeting the requirements of the activity test in some circumstances. I am very pleased to support the amendments before us today.

         These amendments relate to three areas. One group is to clear up the tax position where assets move into or out of trading stock. The second group removes from the bill rewritten provisions that deal with the exemption of education and training payments. This is being done because of the changes to be made to those provisions by Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997. The government proposes to remove the rewrite of the current provisions at a later date. The provisions of the 1936 act will be rewritten to reflect the law as of 1 July 1997. The third block of amendments ensure that the rewritten provisions that allow deductions for tax related expenses correctly reflect the existing law.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Requests Nos 1 to 12 relate to the change of the use of trading stock. This group of amendments is by way of requests. They comprise specific rules to deal with assets that are put into trading stock and, conversely, with trading stock that is taken out for non-trading use. When this bill was introduced in the House of Representatives, it contained provisions dealing with these events. However, as a temporary measure, the government moved in the House to remove the provisions. This was done so that there could be further consultation about the technical expression needed to give effect to the proposed treatment. There is now broad agreement on the appropriate wording to implement the proposal.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The requests pick up recommendations on the change of use provisions made by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in its report No. 348. One of the committee's recommendations, to add certain clarifying words to the definition of trading stock, has been modified in a positive fashion as a result of a suggestion which emerged from the recent consultations.

          the rewritten provision allowing deductions for tax related expenses will continue to allow a deduction for expenditure, even if it is related to a tax issue that did not involve capital expenditure. Amendments Nos 2 to 17 relate to exempt income for educational training payments. The bill rewrites the exempt income provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and transfers them into the new Income Tax Act 1997.

         A number of the provisions in the 1936 act are the subject of changes by the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997. For this reason, the rewrite of the relevant 1936 act provisions are being removed from the bill. This means that the 1936 act provisions in relation to the exemption of educational training payments will continue to apply. A number of other amendments are necessary to give effect to the removal of those rewritten provisions. Each of the alterations that I have just commented about is explained in more detail in the supplementary explanatory memorandum.

          —The Tax Law Improvement Bill is the second tranche of the complete rewrite of the income tax legislation which was embarked on by Labor through the tax law improvement project in 1994. The passage through the Senate of the first package of three bills commencing the rewrite occurred on 17 March to take effect on 1 July. This legislation, which also commences on 1 July, has been lying in the Senate since 26 March and is being passed at this hour to ensure that it is not retrospective. The bill has been amended by the government in the Senate and the Senate has also made a series of requests for the House to amend the legislation.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Labor supports this legislation and the object underpinning it, as it is essential that the enormously voluminous and complex income tax legislation be simplified. Hopefully, this will reduce compliance costs for taxpayers and administrative costs for the tax office. In addition, the rewrite will also improve certainty in some cases where there is currently considerable uncertainty in the operation of the law.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          This whole process is necessary because the old legislation, the 1936 act, has been amended and expanded so often that it has lost an overall coherent structure. It is surely the most complex piece of Commonwealth legislation on the statute books and it is continually being amended, quite properly, by governments of both persuasions. Because of the sheer enormity of the task, the rewrite has to occur in tranches. This partial ongoing rewrite process provides its own challenges, as it is not possible to repeal the 1936 act and replace it in its entirety.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Labor does not criticise this process. We understand that it was the only realistic option. The particular tranche being rewritten in this bill includes assessable and exempt income, deductions, trading stock, depreciation and gifts. The more specialised areas include entertainment expenses and primary production. It runs to about 550 pages.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The government, with opposition support, amended the bill substantially in the House. In addition, the government now has agreement from the relevant stakeholders on some contentious matters, such as the trading stock provisions, and has further amended the bill to implement the agreed position. Labor supported these changes in the Senate and will be supporting this amended bill.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I acknowledge that there continues to be some criticism of the tax law improvement process from the tax profession. These views are noted by the opposition. However, we do not think they warrant the termination of the process. It should be put on the record that there is also a substantial body of opinion which supports the rewrite process.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In closing, I mention that this legislation has been dealt with as a non-controversial bill because some of the contentious provisions relating to taxation arrangements for some educational payments were removed by the government. I acknowledge their actions to enable the swift passage of the legislation through the Senate earlier. The opposition supports the rewrite of the law and the amendments and requests made by the Senate.

          The last time aged care was run by the states, pre&amp;hyphen;1985, we saw an appalling system in place in this country in terms of the quality of care, differential access to standards of care and varying differences in the way in which people could actually get into nursing homes. It is very important that this matter not proceed. So I am very pleased that the government has agreed to these amendments.

         The second group of amendments, Nos 4 to 11, actually go some way—not, in my view, all the way that is necessary—to recognising the critical need for there to be an adequate number of nursing staff employed in nursing homes. You would be aware that the opposition's argument against this bill has  very much revolved around the fact that people who live in nursing homes are frail and ill. We have continued to have considerable concerns about there not being any requirement in this new bill for nursing homes to employ nurses.

         Unfortunately, the opposition has only been successful in getting some of its amendments on this matter agreed to by the government.

         I think the government will rue the day that they did not agree to that amendment, because I have, unfortunately, no doubt that without strong controls over the quality of staffing we will see a decline in the quality of care in our nursing homes.

          We have to recall the appalling standard of care that existed in nursing homes before 1985. The reason the government at the time introduced changes to insist on a proportion of the government subsidy being spent on care rather than on whatever else the nursing home might have decided was its priority was that care was the fundamental issue. That is what people go into nursing homes for.

          It is very sad that we see those regulations removed from this legislation, because we cannot be sure that adequate levels of nursing care will be provided by nursing homes in the future. Nevertheless, we will support the amendments before us today. They are a small step in the right direction, but certainly do not go anywhere near far enough.

The amendments that have just now come forward have been grudgingly supported by the government. It has taken a lot of hard work, and I commend our shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), for the hard work she has done in getting at least some changes to this piece of legislation.

         I do believe that in the 15 months that this government has been in office this would have to be the most mean&amp;hyphen;spirited piece of legislation introduced by them. They have sought to do nothing but divide the community. I believe the minister at the table now, the Minister for Family Services (Ms Moylan), and her government have nothing at all to be proud of in this legislation. The elderly of Australia will certainly not thank you and their children are not going to thank you for it. The only people who are rubbing their hands together this morning are the Doug Morans of this world. The government has handed the sick and the frail elderly of Australia to them on a silver platter.

         Rather than coming back to some of the things I said when I first spoke in debate on this bill, I would like to deal with a couple of obvious points. What we are really talking about in this piece of legislation, even with the amendments before us now—which still leave it as a bad piece of legislation as far as the frail aged are concerned—is that it is a
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          money bill, really. In its 1996 budget this government took $577 million from aged care over four years. They took $244 million out of capital commitments in the bill. They removed $253 million from subsidies to nursing homes. The user&amp;hyphen;pays system they started to introduce under the home and community care program was another $72 million saving.

           So what they have had to do now is to try to put into operation something that is going to make up the shortfall because of their own actions. The people out there are not going to be fooled by this.

Maybe the minister had not conveyed to him that there was a delay because she was not sure of the bill and there were certain groups that she had not met, groups such as the people who are running the nursing homes in this community, who were queuing up outside this parliament, and outside every other place which might be an avenue for them, to put their point of view forward. There was not consultation to the depth that we were led to believe in this parliament. There was not adequate consultation with some of the church groups who run about 54 per cent of nursing homes around Australia. They did not even know, as of last week, how this bill is in the end going to affect them.

         What do we see? We see a measly little payment of $5 a day that this government proposes to give to the people who are looking after those who would have to go into a nursing home with no other income but their pension. They have increased that by a miserable few dollars. That is not going to be enough.

         One of the things I do agree with the minister on—she might find it hard to believe that I would agree with her—is that there are nursing homes out there where capital works are needed, and possibly urgently needed. But it is not the role of the people who need those nursing homes to start paying for it. It should be a government responsibility to look after the frail aged of our community. We are talking about Australians who have contributed to their country for 70 or 80 years of their lives. We are talking about Australians

          who do not go into a nursing home by choice; they go into a nursing home because they are unable to look after themselves; they are ill; they have just come from hospital; they have no way to make a provision on who is going to care for them. These are the people who use nursing homes.

         It is not some panacea for the problems of public housing—from which you have cut another $400 million, by the way. What we are talking about is people in the community whom we have an obligation to look after, people in the community who are now saying, `What is going to happen to me?' And what is this government saying? They are saying, `If you have got no money, bad luck, because we are going to introduce a two&amp;hyphen;tiered system into our nursing homes and it is going to be the haves and the have&amp;hyphen;nots. So, if you have got a quid, you can have a bed; if you haven't got a quid, tough luck.'

        <para first-indent="16">
         What we are also going to see in our community is a division between the aged and the young. Instead of proudly having older people being adequately looked after in nursing homes, you are going to have a divide where they are going to try to be kept at home.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Worse still—and I would hate ever to see it occur here—go to America and look at some of the places where elderly people are literally dumped. They are being treated like bag people without money. Do we want our elderly to have nowhere to go, lying over heat vents in the winter and sleeping in parks in the summer? Is this what we want to see for the people in our community who have now reached a time in their life when they need government to step in and say, `We will provide adequate services for you. We will provide the facilities in which you can now spend the last of your days at least with adequate provisions and at least with adequate care'? This is a ridiculous bill.

         Politics being what it is, I understand that members on the other side will rail against these amendments in particular. But they need to understand that, at the moment, the aged dependency ratio in Australia is 5.3:1. That is 5.3 Australians between the ages of 15 and 64 for every person over the age of 64 or under 15. In 40 years, it will be 2.6:1. The National Commission of Audit report states that, over the next 40 years, we will have to spend 10 per cent more of our GDP on the health and welfare costs of ageing alone above and beyond real growth from where we currently are to maintain the level of care that we currently have.

         The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) says that the bill ought to mandate nursing care levels. The fact is that the Aged Care Standards Agency and the standards that will be developed by the industry and consumer organisations with the support of the department will mandate standards. How those standards are achieved will be the subject of discussion between providers and consumer organisations. It is a nonsense for the government to mandate levels of nursing or other care from Canberra and the department. Unlike just about every member on the other side, I have spent a long time working in nursing homes. I have looked after a lot of people in them. I have been to nursing homes with hot and cold running nurses in which I would not want my mother to be living.

The member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) essentially runs the Labor Party dogma line, which is that the government should pay for the care of all people. The fact is that the government cannot afford to pay for all things for all Australians. The same people who are here today arguing about people who can afford to make some contribution to their care and who are opposed to them doing so are the very same people who refuse to examine the income or taxation base of the Australian government. They rail against taxation, industrial relations, communications and transport reform, which are the very things that create the wealth the government then distributes to people in need. They then come in here and tell us that the government, 20 years from now, ought to be paying for the care of all Australians.

We are now moving to a system where nursing home care will be given on the basis of wealth and not health. Older Australians will be forced to sell their homes to get the care they need and, when older Australians go into nursing homes and are told that they have to sell their family home, that will tell them that they are never going to return.

In anticipation of the windfall profits to come from the forced sale of the houses of older Australians, he is in big time expansion mode. I have here a press release dated 25 June 1997. It is headed, `Moran awarded Victorian aged care privatisations.' It points out that the Moran group has been selected to privately develop Victorian state government operated nursing homes—and the Moran group get to keep the profits. There are to be five new purpose built homes with 295 beds in them. Three homes will be in the Melbourne suburbs of Altona North, Broadmeadows and Mill Park and two will be in Warrnambool and Mildura in regional Victoria.

          —I would like to cut through a lot of the rhetoric I have heard in this debate on the amendments to the Aged Care Bill. The fact remains that the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) has struck a deal with the Australian Democrats which, by any judgment, makes these sound amendments. Community Services Australia, Anglican Australia and the Australian Catholic Health Care Association have signed off on the amendments. Today we are just finetuning one of the amendments to satisfy the requirements of the government.

         A fortnight ago I attended a `hypothetical' in Orange. All the heavyweights of the health care industry were there. They chose to disagree strongly with the act as it stands at the moment. They have now signed off on these amendments. I have studied the legislation from every angle, particularly as it pertains to my electorate, and I have no problem with the concept of a users&amp;hyphen;who&amp;hyphen;can&amp;hyphen;pay philosophy in the delivery of aged care services.

         The reality is that we are not talking about Doug Moran or about doing special favours for anyone. We are talking about a proportion of our population that, by the year 2030, we cannot afford to sustain from the public purse. That is what this legislation is all about. At the end of that function in Orange a couple of weeks ago, the representative of the Uniting Church said to me, `The government should find $250 million per year for the nursing home sector.' That is going to push out to $1 billion per year before 2020&amp;hyphen;30. We cannot sustain that from the public purse.

It would have meant that those nursing homes with a majority of concessional residents could only hope to get $9,250 over five years, which would be way short of the $13,000 you could draw from a bond. That has been rectified at that $12 rate. I still have some problems about the $7 figure—perhaps it should be $12 for all.

         The one area I do have problems with is multipurpose services in rural areas, which I have spoken to you about. There are some people in the House from Yeoval Community Service Centre today hoping to see you at some point. They entered into a recurrent funding contract and I would like you to address that point if you could because they have committed themselves to a spending program which still has a couple of years to run. They really do require the ability to access that contractual arrangement because 90 per cent of the people they care for are concessional clients and they fear that they will not, in any way, meet the aged care spending needs of that little community. It is a gem of an aged care facility. So I urge you to think seriously about the proposition—

          —The thing that irks me about this most of all, and what also irks the callers who contact my office on average some two or three times a week, is the fact that homes owned by potential nursing home patients and clients will need to be sold. One can only ask once again those opposite, who have been afforded to this day many opportunities to state clearly and categorically that homes need not be sold, to state that for the first time because to date, despite vague homilies about economic responsibility of the act and the Aged Care Bill, no concrete statement has been made to the effect that there will be no requirement of individuals to sell their homes.

         In terms of the requirement to sell homes, one really only has to observe the facts of this matter and they are that service providers can charge some $2,600 per annum from the bond and in addition they get to retain the totality of the bond that they earned from the deposit of that bond. In reading from section 57&amp;hyphen;18 from the bill entitled `Approved provider may retain income derived', subsection (1) of that section states:

         There is no obligation to account for it in nursing home care. It is overwhelmingly and purely and simply profiteering. So one can only ask: who are these profiteers—the nursing home service providers—really going to let in their doors? Are they going to allow in their doors those people who do not get that $2,600 draw down and for whom they can subsequently earn profit on the interest? Of course they will not let those people in the door. The less privileged who cannot come up with that kind of money will not get in the door. Contrary to even our own assertions early this year of there being different levels of care in terms of orange juice, orange drink or orange cordial depending on standard of the wing that you occupy in a nursing home, we are talking now about people who will not be able to get in the door to get basic cordial let alone freshly squeezed orange juice.

         The undisputed evidence is that the market will prevail. Given that demand overwhelmingly exceeds supply it will be the frail and the aged, who clearly are in the majority in terms of seeking nursing home care and who will be required to negotiate on their own behalf in terms of financial arrangements before entering the home, who will have the least opportunity to determine the amount of money that they pay and therefore the quality of service that they receive.

         As the member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) said, those opposite have put to the House that we on this side of the House are being overly dramatic. In fact, we would contend that that is not the case because 60 per cent of people enter a nursing home after what we might deem to be a reasonably serious illness such as a stroke. So in that context it is not being dramatic at all. People are forced to go into these homes, sit down and ask: what do I have to pay? That is basically the first and foremost question asked. The answer to that question is that you have to pay everything except $22,000.

         If the government were fair dinkum in this regard they would give nursing homes the ability to charge $13,000, which would be the

          $2,600 for a year over five years. Why should they not simply impose a bond of $13,000 and let the nursing homes draw down on this particular amount of money rather than impose a much larger bond determined by the provider, the interest reaped from which will be totally retained by them as an up&amp;hyphen;front profit. I condemn this bill as being a mean and miserly attempt to recoup money from those who can least afford to pay.

          —It is nice to hear that the Labor Party supports the accommodation bonds; it is only the level that is now in argument. There are a couple of points I would like to make. The first is that we have just heard about the $2,600 draw down which amounts to about $7 a day. What does the opposition believe the $7 a day concessional payment minimum, if not the $12 concessional payment subsidy from the government, in total a cost of $100 million a year, is going to do? You might well argue it will make sure that there is now as much if not more incentive to take in financially disadvantaged people than there would be incentive to take in those who are eligible to pay an accommodation bond. In other words, the amendments to which the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) and the government have agreed are negating the very spurious argument which you put up earlier when the Aged Care Bill 1997 was being debated.

         The member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) used some intemperate language. He talked about nails in coffins and things like that. I suggest that, as the years pass and he gains a bit more wisdom, he will not use that language. He said that what we are doing as a government `is telling them that they will never return'. At the moment about four per cent of people who go into nursing homes leave those homes. For 96 per cent of people going in, it is the last resting place, the last residence in which they will live. Of that four per cent who leave, almost all of them leave to return to their own families or to the family home, which is usually empty, to die. The fact is that the home does not have to be sold. The arrangements will work in the same way
         <break page="6549" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          that the arrangements—which you developed in opposition—work for hostels. At the moment, about 40 per cent of those who are eligible to pay an entry contribution or accommodation bond to hostels do not pay one at all, although that is likely to decrease under these arrangements.

         One significant consequence of the entry contributions has been a marked increase in standards and the capital that has been available to people who are living in hostels. I challenge the opposition: if and when the opposition do regain government, will they repeal this? I am less concerned about the view of the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin). I am much more interested to know whether the Leader of the Opposition—it is easy for us to have cheap shots about this across the chamber, but this is about our future—will stand at the dispatch box, perhaps today, and guarantee that in government you will not repeal this. I guarantee that you most certainly will not repeal it because in your hearts—and certainly in the hearts of members on the other side, whose chairs are vacant—they know that this is sensible policy.

Her husband asked her son, `What do you intend to do with the family home after we have gone?' The son said, `Well, of course I will sell it. I'm going to have an overseas trip, pay off my car and put the rest in the bank,' to which she replied, `If my husband and I are now required to spend a very small part of what we have on seeing that we get better care when we need it most, then I am prepared to support this.'

The member for Calare signs off on the Aged Care Bill 1997 and the actions of the government, even though the government is withdrawing half a billion dollars. I say to the honourable member for Calare: tell me how you can go back to your constituents and guarantee that these dollars are going to be spent on extra beds.

         When you go back to your constituents, explain to them how you are going to guarantee that one dollar of these accommodation bonds is going to be put into improving nursing home accommodation.

         That is not going to guarantee that this death money that you are imposing through this bill is actually going to go through and improve nursing homes.

         Again, I ask the member for Calare: what is the penalty in this bill when a couple are faced with an awful dilemma—that is, they do not have the accommodation bond money and they know one of the spouses needs to go in but there is no available bed? Do you have a penalty in this bill for proprietors who accept
         <break page="6550" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          an accommodation bond under those circumstances? Is it gaol? Is it a fine? Do they lose their licence, or is this merely another accreditation issue? Again, the member for Calare has signed off on this bill.

         What is the prudential supervision of this money?

What are the prudential requirements of the nursing home? Are they like the solicitors trust fund? Is the minister guaranteeing that, if any proprietor skedaddles with $1 of an accommodation bond or money put in, it will be fully restituted like the solicitors fidelity fund? Is that what you are saying, Minister? Can you guarantee that about the aged Australians? Are you guaranteeing that, Minister? If some proprietor runs off with $2&amp;half; million of frail aged people's money, are you guaranteeing that that money will be replaced, that they will be recompensed? Of course you are not.

They cannot even guarantee the safety of the money of the frail aged. What hypocrisy! There is no guarantee. I ask the member for Bradfield to tell me what the penalty is. Is it a gaol sentence?

We are not going to let the Democrats forget it.

         I do not doubt the sincerity of the member for Calare (Mr Andren), who raised a number of issues about ensuring that financially disadvantaged people are looked after in multipurpose facilities in his electorate. No doubt we might happen to disagree with him about the effectiveness of the up-front accommodation bond, but we do appreciate some of the concerns he is raising on other issues. He will have to accept that we will have to agree to disagree on the accommodation bond.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The reason why we believe the government has misled the member for Calare and the Australian people about this issue is that it is not about trying to improve the quality of nursing homes. That has been the mantra of the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) day after day as this debate has been raging since it was announced in last August's budget. It is not about improving the quality of nursing homes around Australia because this government with this package is taking $500 million out of aged care. It is reducing the federal government's effort. That is why we say this is really an attempt to punish people.

          If it were just about hitting people who are well off, as the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) argues, the government might have a stronger case, but people forget that the means test cuts in when a pensioner earns only $50 a week. That is part of the reductions that are part of this package, and that is one of the reasons why we believe this package is flawed, despite the amendments that are before the House at the moment.

          The other point to remember is that we do not yet have an answer from the government as to what happens under Australian Corporations Law. If a publicly owned company happens to own a nursing home and it has one bed spare and two people are competing to get that bed, if one person is able to pay the $88,000 up front and the second person either cannot pay as much or cannot pay anything and they get the financially disadvantaged person subsidy, under Australian Corporations Law the directors are bound by law to give the bed to the person who can pay the highest up-front fee.

          Minister, you know we have raised this question occasion after occasion. As yet, we do not have an answer. Perhaps in today's debate you can tell us what your legal advice has been. I would be very surprised if your legal advisers can tell you that Australian law does not apply to the directors of companies who own nursing homes. As each month passes, we are going to see directors of companies having to enforce Australian law, which will mean we will end up with a two&amp;hyphen;tier system in Australian nursing homes: a better system of nursing home care for those people who can afford the higher entry fees and a lower level of quality for those who are in the other nursing homes.

          There are two messages this government is sending out to the people who are participating in this debate. The first message, which this minister repeats like a mantra, is that you will not be forced to sell your home. The other message we get from people like the member for Bradfield is that it does not matter if you have to sell your home because your children should not get an overseas holiday if your home is sold. We have had other people in this House saying that, when

         ATSIC has been subject to both audits and slurs about its use and, in some cases, alleged misuse of public money. Yet this bill proposes to afford nursing home proprietors the opportunity to reap absolute bucket loads of money—and private money—without any clear requirement to determine how it is being spent. The member for Dobell (Mr Lee) has gone into that matter in some detail. This money may be placed in, for example, a trust fund run by a solicitor. We can only cringe at the fact that, almost daily, we read in our newspapers that solicitors are before our

         We cannot be expected to support a bill which, in its current form, does not guarantee safe staffing levels and quality of life in nursing homes. As long as there is no requirement for the up-front payment to be used in any way, shape or form for capital improvements and as long as there is no requirement for establishing levels of nursing staff which are appropriate to providing quality care, then this bill ought be opposed.

        <para first-indent="16">
         One other group in our society who I believe are adversely impacted on by the application of this bill are the 40 per cent of residents who move into nursing homes for stays of no longer than six months. For example, where a person enters a care facility and stays for less than six months, that same facility is entitled to a total—I stress total—amount equal to three month's retention, an amount equal to three months worth of income on the accommodation bond, and resident fees for the actual time spent in the facility.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Based on a bond of $50,000—which the member for Chifley (Mr Price) has quite rightly stated is a conservative estimate—the minimum fee for a person who stays from one day to three months is a total of $650, which equals up to three months retention; $1,225, which is equal to three months income on the accommodation bond; and a $147.70 per week minimum. Consequently, a one week stay could cost $2,022.70—or more, depending on the amount of the negotiated bond.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I also put to the House the fact that this bill is a tragedy. The tragedy is that we seem to be returning to the days when those who can most afford to pay, those who can most afford to purchase the best, are those who are going to get the best. Clearly, those who are disadvantaged and who need aged care are those who are going to suffer. This can only be described as an unfortunate reality, as the member for Barton (Mr McClelland) so succinctly submitted in his speech on a matter of public importance earlier this week.

There are a couple of points that we are dealing with in the amendments that are before the House at the moment. One of them deals with the transfer of power to the states. I hope the minister, in her reply to the numerous debates on the amendments that are coming forward today, will congratulate the hard&amp;hyphen;fought for and hard&amp;hyphen;won amendment which we are now discussing, as the government has agreed.

         With this bill the Commonwealth government washes its hands completely of aged care, passing it all over to the states. In other words, `Let's transfer it. We don't want anything more to do with it. It's a bit too hard. We will now put a bill in place where all those who have the ability to operate these nursing homes can do so at a far greater profit than was ever expected in the past. But, in case it goes wrong along the line, we want to make sure that we, as the Commonwealth, now give those responsibilities to the states.' Fortunately, one of the amendments that we are debating today says that that cannot happen without any reference to this parliament. I commend the movers of that amendment.

         Another point I want to touch on, particularly after the comments made by the member for Bradfield, is that these amendments, which were hard fought for, should also contain the obligation that a nursing home at least have in it a person with nursing qualifications. I found it offensive that the member for Bradfield, a failed member of the doctors'

         Mr Prosser, the minister for small business, said that he does not really get involved in his businesses. He only goes to pick up the rubbish from his shopping centres every weekend when he is in town, but he does not really run the place. You cannot do that with a nursing home. Nursing home residents need professional care. At least the amendments that we are debating now have included that the obligation is on the nursing homes to at least have a qualified nurse in attendance. The number of nurses present should really be as a proportion of the number of patients you actually have in the nursing homes.

         A number of my colleagues on this side of the House have raised the problem that we are also experiencing with regards to those bonds. I appreciate the member for Chifley (Mr Price) stating that there is nothing in the bill in this regard. The member for Bradfield wanted to make out that there was. I can assure him that there is not. I often wonder why, because, as the minister would say, even real estate agents have to have proper trust accounts and have to be accountable for the rents they collect on behalf of their clients; and a reference was also made to lawyers.

The main concerns in my electorate were from aged care deliverers who had grave doubts about the poor communication of this legislation out in the marketplace. That has been addressed rapidly over the last few months. The feedback I am getting now is positive—apart from, as I said, concerns of smaller communities such as Yeoval and such as Carcoar with their Uralba nursing home that the $40 million set aside for regional and remote care will not be enough, because our rural communities are ageing at a far greater rate than the rest of the nation. We must support what, in many cases, is about 90 per cent of concessional residents in these remote and rural aged homes. As I said earlier, I think we must look at the grants provisions of this bill to see if we cannot review the specific and unique requirements of the smaller communities. But for the larger communities in my electorate—such as Orange, Bathurst and Lithgow—I have no grave concerns with this process.

          —As the shadow minister points out, to have teeth and to have them cared for—that is a pretty low effort. Whilst the practical effect of this bill is not as obvious as the nasty, mean-spirited removal of dental care for aged people, it is dramatically more disadvantageous to those elderly people. The introduction of up-front fees—in the way in which it is proposed in this bill and through the government's decisions not to support other amendments to this legislation—will produce only one outcome; that is, it will dramatically increase the charges to those people going into nursing homes without any guarantee that one cent of those additional funds will go to improving the quality of care for elderly Australians.

         The member for Calare (Mr Andren), I think quite rightly, pointed out that, when people go into nursing homes, that is very often the last home they have before they depart this earth. Sadly, that is the fact. That is also one of the reasons why nursing homes need to be treated differently by the government from the situation in hostels. For some people, hostels are a lifestyle choice. Nursing homes are not a lifestyle choice; people go there because their medical circumstance requires them to do so. When elderly people go to nursing homes, they are now going to be confronted with the requirement to pay a fee which is not capped. The people operating these centres will have the total freedom to determine what fee it is they think they should charge.

         Again I want to put to the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) the proposition which has been put by some other speakers on this side of the House, and I would be interested to hear her clear rebuttal of this when she sums up. When a nursing home proprietor who charges $50,000 up&amp;hyphen;front is confronted with a limited number of beds and with many more people wanting to get into that nursing home and those people wanting to get in have differential income rates—that is, there are some people that can afford to
         <break page="6556" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          pay $50,000; there are some that might offer $70,000; and there are some that might struggle to offer $20,000—what is there in your legislation to prevent that nursing home selecting not according to need but purely on the basis of income?

        <para first-indent="16">
         Moreover, what is there in your legislation that would allow the directors of that company to do anything but that? The directors of the company are obliged by law to ensure a maximum return on the investment to their shareholders. That is their obligation under law and to do otherwise is negligent on their part. If there is a clause in this piece of legislation that somehow absolves those directors of that responsibility they have in company law, then state it clearly and refer to it directly in your response to this debate. But, in the absence of a clear statement to the contrary, that is absolutely the responsibility that the directors have. The result of that will be that access to nursing home care will go effectively to the highest bidder. It will be selection by wealth, not health.

         A number of speakers have referred to the concessional places, including the member for Calare, who places some weight on that. The simple fact of life is that I understand those concessional places are going to be determined by region; that is, certain nursing homes will have no obligation whatsoever to provide concessional care. You will establish without doubt a two-tiered system. It will be the `for profit' private providers who will say to the people coming in, `We want $50,000 up&amp;hyphen;front' or `We want $80,000 up&amp;hyphen;front' and they will not be obliged to have any concessional care. People on low incomes will not get a chance to get into those places.

        <para first-indent="16">
         When this bill went through the House of Representatives originally, I made a number of comments in support of an increase in the payments to concessional care places. I received a phone call that afternoon from someone who had been listening to the debate to tell me how wrong I was, because he is involved in a very substantial nursing home which has a large number of concessional places and they run a very handsome profit without having to charge any up&amp;hyphen;front fee whatsoever. He pointed out to me that those
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          people who want to charge the up-front fee are the ones you will see having $500 lunches at Conrad's or at the Sheraton or at the Hilton. This individual has a long record of involvement in this industry and in public life, and he knows the people directly—he is probably at lunch with them. But he has the good decency to run a nursing home without charging a cent in up-front fees and operating more than 90 per cent occupancy for concessional places.

          —The Aged Care Bill 1997 has probably been the most deceitful and dishonest piece of legislation not just in this current parliament but in my experience in parliament. I have not heard an issue argued so badly, so wrongly and so falsely in my time here. People out in the community are being led to believe that this legislation is going to unleash access to a massive amount of funds to help upgrade, repair and extend our nursing home systems. That is absolutely dishonest, and it is wrong.

         To even get square, to just catch up what the government is ripping out of the budget, $130 million a year is required to be raised for starters; that is, to stand still requires $130 million a year to be raised under this legislation. But the fact is it will not even raise that. Yet we have had member after member of the government falsely—and knowingly falsely because if you talk to them privately they will admit they are doing it because they have to; they think it stinks but they have to support it—trying to pretend that this is all about improving what they inherited, this dreadful system.

          We all know that what John Howard as Treasurer left us in 1983 was a nursing home system with no controls and no accreditation. As I have said previously, one of my constituents who was a pensioner was eating dog food because he was paying $40 a week out of his pension for his wife in a nursing home. She had been there for eight years, and he was paying the extra costs. That was in 1983. We are going back to that 14 years later.

         The second part is that we hear a lot about social engineering. This is probably the most substantial and massive bit of social engineering that we will ever see, because it is going to the very heart and the very nature of our society. We as a country have long prided ourselves on substantial home ownership. More than 70 per cent of our community own their own homes or are paying them off. It has been an absolute cornerstone of our domestic relationships. In recent years we have been going through trauma, as have other countries, with large numbers of family breakdowns and marriage separations, but the family home has been kept on.

         Let me tell those opposite what constituents are saying to me in case they are not hearing it themselves. They are saying, `I will die first,' because so many of them see their visit to a nursing home as temporary. I had a constituent telling me the other day how his wife has gone into a nursing home and he said, `But she is only there temporarily. She is coming back home.' You tell her that there is no home to come back to before she even goes in. The whole nature of that family home will change. It will now be transitory; it will be a temporary home because at the end of the day it has to go. What people are saying to me is: `I will die first. I will die in my home.'

People go to hospital because they have to. Many die there not wishing to; they expect to go home again from hospital. So many people expect to go home from nursing homes. This legislation is social engineering. It is changing the nature

          —Another couple of concerns I would like to raise in the debate here today and dealing with the amendments are in relation to comments that were made previously by the member for Calare (Mr Andren), when he said that most of the organisations coming up to him were saying they are very satisfied with the Aged Care Bill. Can I assure him, in words directly from the Australian Catholic Health Care Association, that, `Health care is a right, not a commodity offered for sale.' There are many other comments I could read to him to really let him know how the groups which are now running our nursing homes feel about this legislation.

        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am also concerned that the member for Calare feels everything is going to be all right because the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) has given us assurances that at least 27 per cent of the beds will be provided to those who have limited means or no means whatsoever to enable them to get a bed in a nursing home. The member for Calare said that he is worried about some of these smaller areas, while the larger towns like Lithgow or Bathurst may be all right. We know the minister is going to get up and say, `But, wait a minute. This is going to be dealt with on a regional basis.'

         I do not know about the rural areas as much as I know about my own area. If we are talking about a regional basis, the regions are all different.

         The electorate I represent has now gained the unfortunate title of being the largest unemployed electorate in Australia. This electorate of mine is very similar to the electorates of my colleagues who represent south-west Sydney. When we talk about a regional basis and an allocation for nursing homes of 27 per cent, are we going to say to the aged in my area, `You may have to get to the end of the queue. You may have to go to the North Coast if there is a bed allocated there. You may have to go down to Wollongong'?

         The minister says, `If you happen to have an elderly son or daughter who wishes to visit you and they are also on a pension'—and do not think this is not happening, because I will give you some examples of where it has come about—`you should forget about that, because we have said it's going to be allocated in the region. Unfortunately, the couple of beds in the nursing homes available to you have now gone to the highest bidder. Therefore, the allocation in that region has reached its 27 per cent, and we're terribly sorry that we cannot meet our true commitment we gave as a government.'

        <para first-indent="16">
         There are another couple of points I want to raise. What concerns me not only with this legislation but with some of the legislation coming through this House is what I label the drip effect. In other words, this legislation was announced in August 1996 so, if we keep talking about it for long enough, people in the end will say, `Not that again. I don't want to worry about it.' All of a sudden now, it is starting to hit the electorate at large that they had better start worrying about it because it is about to come into force.

         We are seeing the same type of thing now as we saw in the situation where 18&amp;hyphen; to 20&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds will be denied unemployment benefits because our government wants to call them children who should still be dependent on their parents—but again that does not come into effect until July 1998. So if we keep talking about it now, it will start penetrating and people will say, `It's really not going to happen because it's not in force at
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          the moment.' As for this drip effect of legislation of bad news, the electorate at large will wake up to this, because within the next 12 months or so this government has to go back to the people and get their confidence to see where it is going to go in the future.

The average price that anyone will have to pay will certainly be no more than $26,000.' All and sundry have now come out with indisputable facts that the beds are going to go to the highest bidder.

          —Just to finish our contributions on these amendments, I want to draw the House's attention to amendment No. 13, which now will require an annual report on the operation of the act. I will just make some remarks about the importance of the specific issues that we have now agreed with the government will be reported on.

         It is going to be extremely important that the parliament and the people—particularly the older people—do know the extent of unmet demand for nursing home and hostel places. We will particularly be looking at the number of beds allocated to concessional residents to make sure they do get access to nursing homes, as the government has promised.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Just as importantly, we will be very interested to see when the annual report comes out what the adequacy of Commonwealth subsidies looks like when we are talking about meeting the care needs of residents. It is the case that there has been a major change to the classification instrument, and it is very important that we see the details of how that care instrument is working.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Not surprisingly, this side of the House and the vast majority of older Australians who only have one asset—their family home—will want to know the amount of accommodation bonds people will have to pay to get into nursing homes. What we will know when we get the first annual report is how much in actual fact people have had to pay. Associated with that, we will get information about how long people have had to wait to get into a nursing home.

          As the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) said, what we want to know is, if you have $88,000, how much faster you will get into a nursing home compared with someone who has $50,000, $20,000 or nothing. That is exactly the purpose of this amendment—to make sure we will have that information and older people will have that information so this government is held accountable for this appalling legislation.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This amendment also will require the government to actually describe the extent of building, upgrading and refurbishment of aged care facilities because, as other speakers on this side have said, that has been the whole reason for this disastrous change to aged care arrangements in this country. What we want to make sure is that this bill does see some improvement to aged care facilities.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Finally, this amendment will actually require reporting on the imposition of sanctions. I do understand it is a very difficult issue because the care of older people is at stake. It is, nevertheless, going to be extremely important that information is provided to the community about the imposition of sanctions and that we know that the care of our elderly is properly maintained.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We do welcome this amendment that was moved by the opposition in the Senate. It will see a decent reporting system about the operation of this act to the parliament. There are very, very radical changes being proposed by this bill and we want to know what their implications will be. The parliament has the right to know. Australians have the right to know.

          We believe it will be the case that those without a lot of money will have to go to the back of the queue.

          —I wish to continue my remarks but particularly focus on this amendment. The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) is aware of at least one nursing home in my electorate—and I do not doubt there are others across the country—which received grants in previous times. The case in question is the Maroba Nursing Home at Waratah. They received a $400,000 grant two years ago to extend and upgrade their existing nursing home. The grant was to be payable over 10 years, but the total expenditure was to be $1
          <break page="6561" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           million. In other words, there was $400,000 of Commonwealth funds and $600,000 of their own funds payable over 10 years, and that has been done. They have spent the money.
          </break>
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         They were told late last year that, with these changes that have now come forward, they can take the money or the gun. They can take up&amp;hyphen;front fees or the outstanding eight payments to come. So having spent their $1 million to upgrade and extend their nursing home, they are now being required to forgo up&amp;hyphen;front fees if they want to get the rest of their grant; or if they take up&amp;hyphen;front fees, then the expectation will be that those fees will be used to extend and improve the nursing home, which they have already done. This whole situation is one of breach of faith. It is a breach of contract, and it is just appalling that the government can sit and tell us how they are improving the system.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Another example is Learmonth Lodge, a privately owned nursing home in Newcastle which has closed down. Its residents were all required to leave by 30 June, and something like 25 nursing home residents needed to find a bed. Some of them had been in the home for years and years; some had family and some had no family. It is very difficult to suddenly find 25 beds for people who were in some cases long&amp;hyphen;term nursing home residents. Of course, what has happened when these people and families have approached alternative nursing homes is that the nursing homes are saying, `Have you got any money, because it will make it easier?'
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This leads me to my final point, about social engineering. What this means for people is that, if there is a family home in the possession of the family, the spouse or the carer, they do not have to sell it; they will get a place. It is not legally required. But people are asking me—and I do not doubt they are asking members of the government: `If we had the money, could we get a place faster, because we are being asked by nursing homes how much money we have and whether we can put in up&amp;hyphen;front fees or not?'
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This means that the children and spouses of aged people are now faced with the choice of selling their house, moving in with their kids
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          or renting somewhere so that they can get their aged parent or spouse into a nursing home faster. That is what is happening right now. The pressure is now being put on carers and spouses to be prepared to sell the family home to raise the money for these so&amp;hyphen;called bonds to get access to a nursing home. Legally they do not have to do so.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have heard that all that nonsense and all those fabricated figures about how many beds will be available for people who do not have the money or who have a spouse or carer living in the family home. But the spouse or carer is facing a very stark choice: sell the house, find alternative accommodation for yourself and you will get a bed; stay in the house and you will not get a bed. That is social engineering of the very worst kind, because it means the commercialisation of a family relationship. It means that pressure and guilt is being placed on those family members, because if they do not sell the house the aged relative does not get a bed. That is the kind of criteria, that is the kind of society, this government now sees as being normal—the commercialisation of the family relationship.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What is happening here is social engineering of the very lowest and worst possible kind from those opposite, who pretend to stand for the family and who pretend that they care about family values and keeping families together. This bill tears families apart.

         One of the questions that keeps going through my mind—and after reading and re&amp;hyphen;reading this bill, I have become so cynical about it—is: what protection is there to say that the approved provider will not use it for running costs? In other words, surely to God the government's obligation should be to look into the care of people in these homes and to ensure that this money is not the first step of the way and they will gradually go out of this altogether.

         We already saw that they want to pass it all over to the states and now we have prevented that. Now this amendment was forced upon the government; it was not willingly accepted. This amendment will now make sure that the provider will use the income derived from the accommodation bond and retention amount in specific ways set out. It does not have a fourth or a fifth clause saying, `If you do not do that, you will loose your licence, and if you do not do that, we will make sure that the accreditation,' et cetera. I feel sure that all of these reasons will be given by the minister. But, as I said before, reasons given in the past by the minister have amounted to zilch, because the bill has come up with one thing and yet it really says another.

Finally, it took years of delving to find out that it was done by a little trick of the hand. Four more staff were supposed to be working on a night shift, but they did not exist.

As a result of this amendment we will see the quality of care being completely different depending on your wealth.

           —That is a shameful situation and one which we would never want to see in our hospitals. At the election we had 18 months ago the government said, `We will stand firm for Medicare. We believe in access to health care on the basis of need.' It was a fairly recent belief, of course. Now we know the truth. Now we see the first inkling of truth from this government, particularly in this amendment.

          It does not matter what your wealth is as far as we are concerned. Quality of care and access to care, nursing care or medical care should be based entirely on your health needs; not on the basis of how much money you have, how many cars you own or how wealthy your home is. The member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) might have plenty of people in his electorate who can pay $150,000, who can secure a decent and better standard of care and who can afford to have roast dinners every night. The people in the electorate of the member for Prospect are not in that position. I want them to know that they will get the same standard of accommodation and care as the people in the electorate of the member for Bradfield.

         <para first-indent="16">
          We will be opposing this amendment because we want to maintain an equal standard of care and access to nursing homes. This government will rue the day that it introduced this bill, because we will continue to argue in the community what this legislation will do to the access of older Australians to nursing home care. It is a very sad day for older Australians—a very sad day indeed.

This is because the legislation with regards to Vietnam veterans and their ability to take up work and have options in life arises from the previous government, as the minister well knows.

         The minister has got on the phone to a few veterans groups and attempted to misconstrue the situation by saying that we are undermining these very necessary changes. The minister talks about hurting veterans and how ignoble it is of us to work against them, but the reality is that this legislation does stem from the previous government. It was our initiative. We are in total support of the vocational training changes, and he is indeed very well aware of that.

         Coming in here today and trying to put forward the proposition that veterans organisations support the desirable parts of this legislation is not dealing with the fundamental problems with the legislation. Amongst those is the issue of rental assistance. It is interesting to note that the minister has said at various RSL conferences around the country that the gold card is not in the too&amp;hyphen;hard basket for him and that he will fight in relation to
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          that issue. One has to question his ability to persuade this country's Treasurer (Mr Costello) to go anywhere down the line of having a gold card for veterans or widows when we see in this legislation the government trying to victimise a mere 340 veterans in this country. They are bringing in a special provision in this legislation to hit a mere 340 veterans to save a mere $21,000 by changing rental assistance arrangements for single veterans.

         When the minister talked about the opposition and the Australian Democrats standing in the way of this vocational measure for veterans and standing in the way of simplification of payments between the veterans' affairs department and the social security department, he left out the downside of this legislation. As I say, it is very questionable why so many resources, so much activity and so much verbiage is put into trying to slash a mere $21,000—and not $21,000 a year but $21,000 over four years. One has to assume that this government's mean mindedness and its victimisation mentality leads them to try to push this measure through the parliament.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The government are also attempting to change the superannuation arrangements applying to people between 55 and 65 years of age. We know very well that the government have undermined, in a very real sense, superannuation as a concept in this country ever since they came to power. They are attempting to include superannuation entitlements for the purposes of social security income and assets tests where the person concerned is, as I say, between 55 and 65 years of age. People getting the service pension or income support payments for at least 39 weeks after reaching 55 will have their superannuation and rollover fund assets included in income and assets test.

         Once again, it is all right for the minister to say that we are standing in the way of the very noble measures in regards to training for Vietnam veterans, but included in this bill, as I say, are very substantial attacks on veterans. The minister gets up here like Pontius Pilate and says we are against the RSL and veterans and how dreadful that is, but the fact of political life is that there are measures in this bill that are going to hit veterans.

The responsibility clearly rests with the minister and the government. They are the ones who make the ultimate decision. Because they want to ram through these very undesirable measures in regards to rental assistance and superannuation, they are saying that, if we will not roll over for them in relation to these two measures, they are going to throw all the measures out. Quite frankly, it is very clear it is their responsibility.

Both parties have very substantial objections to the measures.

You can't go on to a training program. You can't keep looking for work, because if you do your unemployment benefits will be reduced or your disability payments will be reduced.' This is yet another outrageous attack on older workers who want to continue to participate in this community, whether or not they are veterans.

These 340 people, who have served this country in armed conflict and have worked in the armed forces, are the targets of a measure to reduce their rental assistance.

         If we had a government that was actually doing those kinds of things—trying to help industry, trying to help job creation—then it would not be so scandalous that here today, in this legislation, it is saying to those people, `You are part of the process of sacking, of being pushed out the door and being forced onto the unemployment scrap heap. As well as doing this, as well as having policies to put you on the scrap heap, we are also going to make sure that, when you are on the scrap heap, you cannot get access to unemployment benefits because of the changes we are going to make to superannuation.'

         The legislation also, quite obviously, undermines this country's ability to marshal savings. What it is going to essentially do is make sure that people who have saved their superannuation money are forced to spend it earlier. It is thereby going to undermine the country's ability with regard to financing its infrastructure and undermine its need to borrow money overseas.

         In conclusion, it is absolutely ridiculous for the minister to come in here today and selectively say that there is an attempt by the opposition to defeat the good measures that are in this legislation.

          out the door if we do not agree to these measures. Fundamentally, we very strongly oppose the superannuation changes. We very clearly oppose the rental assistance changes.

         The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 provides for two ways a grant of unalienated crown land can be made to an Aboriginal land trust that holds title on behalf of Aboriginal people.

         This bill provides for the inclusion in schedule 1 of the act of three parcels of land which were the subject of the Bauhinia Down land claim, the Brumby Plains land claim and the Western Desert (North) land claim in the Northern Territory.

          —The opposition enthusiastically supports the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill. It will pass through the parliament in record time. It was introduced in the Senate yesterday and has been expedited by the government with the consent of the opposition. This bill involves three handbacks under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act in the Northern Territory. It is the way forward. It shows and stands in stark contrast to other matters that the government is bringing forward, which I will talk about later.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 provides a mechanism whereby traditional Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory, referred to in schedule 1 of the act, may be granted to Aboriginal land trusts to hold title on behalf of Aboriginal people. Since the act came into operation in 1977, a total of 60 separate parcels of land have been scheduled under the act.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The amendment arises from three settlement agreements reached in relation to land claims. They are: firstly, an agreement between the Northern Territory government, the claimants to the Bauhinia Downs land claim No. 150 and the Northern Land Council; secondly, an agreement between the Northern Territory government, the claimants to the Brumby Plains Station land claim No. 149 and the Central Land Council; and, thirdly, an agreement between the Northern Territory government, the claimants of the Kartangurruru, Warlpiri and Walmejeri Repeat land claim No. 27 and the Central Land Council. Each of these agreements includes a clause in which the Northern Territory government agrees to
         <break page="6573" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          request the Commonwealth to effect the grant of an estate in fee simple in the land which was the subject of the land claim.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think it is worth while to go to each of the land claims and give a bit of an outline in relation to each one. Bauhinia Downs is located in the Gulf region of the Northern Territory. It is some 110 kilometres from Borroloola and 520 kilometres south&amp;hyphen;east of Katherine. Darwin is around 700 kilometres away by road. The property is accessed by 80 kilometres of formed gravel road from the sealed Carpentaria Highway.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The lease occupies an area of 1,450 square kilometres. The western boundary is contiguous with the eastern boundary of Broadmere pastoral lease. In the north it bounds Nathan River and Lorella pastoral leases. To the east and south it shares boundaries with Billingarrah and Carpentaria Downs pastoral leases respectively.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Numerous tracks connect the homestead with various yards, watering holes and watering points. One main track connects the homestead and watering areas&amp;hyphen;yards in the lease's centre and north. The most convenient northern access is the Roper Bar&amp;hyphen;Borroloola road, which crosses the lease's north&amp;hyphen;eastern corner. The few tracks in the south and the south&amp;hyphen;west are vague and are restricted to four&amp;hyphen;wheel drive use. The north&amp;hyphen;west corner is accessible by helicopter only, as is much of the mountainous eastern area.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The claim area's outstanding topological feature is the mountain escarpment which dominates the north&amp;hyphen;west and eastern parts of the lease. This area contains many springs and waterholes, a result of the Limmen Bight River&amp;hyphen;Eastern Creek drainage system. The permanent waterholes and spring&amp;hyphen;fed creeks that dissect the lease here were the foci of traditional Aboriginal occupation and cosmological interest. The west and south&amp;hyphen;west of the lease have fewer Aboriginal sites and water sources.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The region's climate is monsoonal, with hot, humid summers and mild, dry winters. Average rainfall is between 700 and 800 millimetres a year, mostly falling in the summer months. Average relative humidity is a major factor in determining the level of
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          comfort by the people in the area. Humidity is high for over half the year.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The lease's pastoral potential is hampered by the terrain, even though it is classified as the most economic of the small Gulf pastoral properties. Forty per cent of the lease is considered to be good pastoral land, that is, the majority of the northern half. The south&amp;hyphen;west corner has some grazing potential but is of little use due to its inaccessibility.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The lease has a strong potential tourist attraction through the sandstone column foundations in the north, thermal springs and pools, waterfalls and pools adjoining the escarpment and flora and fauna areas of interest. The lease was an area traditionally associated with Alawa, Mara, Kurdanji, Wilingara and Binbinga people. Some have stressed Alawa interests above others. Usually the lease is described as a region where people of different tribal language affiliations meet up for ceremony, holiday et cetera and then go back to major centres like Roper River, Tanumbirini and the old McArthur River homestead. A particularly noted ceremony and camping area was the Manaburru site complex, where ritual bosses would send out men with message sticks inviting various groups and individuals for ceremony. The anthropological sources support the assertion that the lease was associated with a number of different tribal groups.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The next one I will deal with is the Brumby Plains land claim No. 149. The Brumby Plains pastoral lease of 1,170 square kilometres is located adjacent to the Western Australian border in the north&amp;hyphen;west region of the Northern Territory. A land claim over the area was lodged in August 1994 on behalf of traditional Aboriginal owners. Anthropological research and field work began in 1995 in preparation for the land claim. Many Aboriginal people who gave strong evidence in the Mistake Creek land claim were also involved in the preparation of this claim, as the area lies immediately to the north of Mistake Creek station.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The land claim was set down for September 1995 but just prior to the hearing the Central Land Council and the Northern Territory government reached agreement regarding
         <break page="6574" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          settlement of the claim. The terms of settlement provide for the land under claim to be granted as Aboriginal land by way of addition to schedule 1 of the land rights act. They also deal with a number of practical matters, including the maintenance of existing give and take fences with adjacent pastoral leases.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In relation to the Western Desert (North) locality, that land claim is the Kartangurruru, Warlpiri and Walmejeri (Repeat) land claim No. 27. The area represents the last portion of vacant crown land available for claim in the Tanami region. It is some 2,400 square kilometres in size. It was an area of land not recommended for grant in the original Western Desert land claim.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         At the beginning of 1996, negotiations were begun with the Northern Territory government with a view to settling the claim without the need to proceed to a full rehearing of the matter. Negotiations revolved around accommodating the interests of the Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory in the region. These negotiations were finally concluded in May. Terms of the settlement provided for the land to be scheduled in the land rights act as Aboriginal land with traditional owners and the Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory forming a joint committee to oversee flora and fauna surveys, feral animal control and bushfire management within the region. Additionally, traditional land owners agreed not to run cattle in the area for at least five years.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The terms of settlement represent a sensible and practical conclusion to the claim. Traditional land owners will obtain title to the land at an earlier stage than could be expected if the claim had to be fully heard by the commissioner. Both the Central Land Council and the Northern Territory government were spared much expense. The Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory and traditional owners both stand to benefit from each other's land management expertise. Exploration companies active in the region gain certainty in that the title to the land is determined now rather than at some later date.

         In Milirrpum v. Nabalco, Justice Blackburn rejected the claimants' arguments that their traditional laws and customs pertaining to their land were capable of recognition by the common law. Twenty-one years later, the High Court, in Mabo, corrected that view. However, Justice Blackburn's comments on the system of traditional laws and customs give us the philosophical basis on which the land rights act was built. It was only after Justice Blackburn wrote these words that the Woodward royal commission into Aboriginal land rights was commissioned.

         The land rights act was drafted by the previous Whitlam government following on from the Woodward commission into Aboriginal land rights, the report of which, as I said, was tabled in 1974. The freehold tenure provided by the act offers traditional owners the greatest security of tenure of any form of land title available in Australian law. It also allows them to control developments on their land. Under the act, Aboriginal people have regained ownership of approximately half of the landmass in the Northern Territory.

Despite claims that the act would lock up land and be detrimental to the Northern Territory economy, all Australians, and particularly Territorians, now benefit from the act. More than 80 per cent of the value of minerals extracted in the Northern Territory comes from Aboriginal land. This is more mineral exploration activity on Aboriginal land than on non-Aboriginal land in the Northern Land Council region. Almost 16 per cent of Aboriginal land in the Northern Land Council region is now covered by exploration

         The act provides certainty for business through established processes for dealing with traditional Aboriginal landowners and native title holders.

They have lost almost every legal challenge they have lodged. This money would have been better spent on addressing the chronic state of Aboriginal employment, health and education in many parts of the Northern Territory.

         The trade&amp;hyphen;off offered to Aboriginal people for the imposition of a sunset clause in the act was the enacting of the Northern Territory's community living areas legislation which would allow Aboriginal people to negotiate small areas of land as excisions on pastoral leases. This law, aimed at providing living areas for Aboriginal people displaced by the pastoral industry, has largely failed Aboriginal people, with the Northern Territory government again obstructing the process. Many Aboriginal people—and, for that matter, most other Australians—are locked off pastoral leases. Successful claimants usually win only small parcels of land on huge pastoral operations.

         On 19 June 1997, the Government presented its response to a schedule of outstanding Government responses to parliamentary committee reports tabled in the House of Representatives on 12 December 1996. The Government affirmed its commitment to
         <break page="6579" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          respond to relevant parliamentary committee reports presented during the present Parliament within three months of their presentation and to clear, as soon as possible, the backlog of reports arising from previous Parliaments.

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Government's commitment follows the undertaking by successive Governments to respond to parliamentary committee reports in a timely fashion. In 1978 the Fraser Government implemented a policy of responding in the House by ministerial statement within six months of the tabling of a committee report. In 1983, the Hawke Government reduced this response time to three months but continued the practice of responding by ministerial statement. The Keating Government generally responded by means of a letter to a committee chair, with the letter being tabled in the House at the earliest opportunity.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The attached schedule lists Government responses to House and joint committee reports made since the last schedule was presented on 12 December 1996. It includes actual Government responses to ten reports of the Procedure Committee tabled between 1988 and 1996. These were included in a document presented to the House on 19 June 1997,
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          and are shown in footnotes to this schedule under the heading `Government Response, 19 June 1997. It also lists reports for which the House has received no Government response. It is intended that a Speaker's schedule of outstanding responses will continue to be presented at approximately six monthly intervals, in the last sitting weeks of the winter and spring sittings.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         The schedule does not include advisory reports on bills introduced into the House of Representatives. The Government's responses to these reports is apparent in the resumption of consideration of the relevant legislation by the House. Also not included are reports from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, the House of Representatives Committee of Members' Interests, the Committee of Privileges, the Publications Committee and the Selection Committee. Responses to reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts are usually made in the form of Finance Minutes, which are tabled by the Committee. Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered.

In addition to the usual duties and responsibilities of the serjeant, on one memorable sitting day Lyn found himself called upon to demonstrate his dexterity with a pair of bolt cutters when a group of demonstrators chained themselves to the railings of the public gallery. He tackled this unusual task with the same deftness and proficiency he applies to the numerous and different challenges that come his way and, as usual, he achieved a splendid and successful outcome.

          before a further promotion in June 1983 to Deputy Clerk of the House, level 4. He was appointed Registrar of Members' Interests in 1985. On 25 March 1991 Lyn was appointed Clerk of the House of Representatives.

         He was awarded membership in the General Division of the Order of Australia in the Queen's Birthday honours list in June 1995. Over the years, Lyn has made a continuing valuable contribution to the House in particular and to the parliament in general. He was very closely involved with the planning and building of new Parliament House, at times needing to employ all his diplomatic skills and to use his vast experience and knowledge of how this place operates to steer the project through some very turbulent waters. He undertook this role in addition to his normal responsibilities.

         Lyn will leave an indelible mark on the procedures of the House. He brought the 90&amp;hyphen;second statements idea back from Canada and persuaded the Procedure Committee of its merits. He was also instrumental in the establishment of the Main Committee.

He is held in the highest esteem by his peers in the United Kingdom, Canada and other Commonwealth nations. His views are widely and keenly sought on matters relating to parliamentary practice and procedures, as well as all aspects of parliamentary administration.

          By the very nature of their duties, senior officers of the House do not seek to be noticed; in fact, they go to considerable lengths to ensure they are effectively hidden in the backdrop of parliamentary life.

          Time and time again, the assignments Lyn has been given, the challenges he has confronted and the responsibilities he has quietly shouldered, have been far beyond those that could be reasonably expected. No matter what the magnitude or difficulty of the task or the personal strain imposed on him, the underlying strength of his character, his personal sincerity, his unfailing courtesy and patience and his unequivocal loyalty and dedication have remained evident. It is not surprising that he enjoys the confidence of and is held in the highest regard by members on both sides of this House.

          Finally, I want to acknowledge the role of Beryl Barlin, who, with some of her family, is here in the gallery this afternoon. For the majority of his many years service to this parliament, Lyn has enjoyed the support and understanding of Beryl, his wife for almost 37 years. They have three sons—Philip, Russell and Mark—and a daughter, Colleen, and are elated at the prospect of spending so much more time with their four lovely grandchildren. With his approaching retirement, Lyn will have more time to spend with Beryl and their family and to pursue his other interests, including trout fishing—and I understand his stocks of trout fishing equipment have been augmented this day—field and clay target shooting and gardening.

        In moving this motion, it is important to note that this is an important occasion in the life of the parliament. We today mark with respect the retirement of Lyn Barlin. As we do so, we celebrate the traditions and values of our democratic inheritance. We do so jointly because it is a fact that, as our democratic values are shared, it is in the sharing of those democratic values that gives strength to the democracy that we all enjoy. It is the shared nature of those democratic values which ultimately provide the practical reality of our democracy for all citizens.

        Lyn has not only added and contributed in his own inimitable fashion to this process and to these values; he is also a living link to the very traditions that we refer to today. When he started, Menzies was in government and Frank Green was the clerk. In fact, Frank Green had been the Clerk of the House of Representatives before its move to Canberra in 1927. Lyn was here in August 1954, aged 22, a young whippersnapper, and he has seen a hell of a lot since.

In the 1960s, he was

         Serjeant-at-Arms; in fact, he was promoted in March 1969 to the position of Serjeant-at-Arms. In that capacity, he was Clerk of the Committees—the only secretary to the committees. The evolution of the committee work in the House of Representatives has been something which Lyn has participated in and contributed to for a long time to give us the committee structure we have today.

So a few of the heavies on the Labor side sat around him as the Serjeant-at-Arms tentatively went across to require his removal. As he got closer, he thought to himself, `The best policy here is to cajole Gordon outside.' So he said, `Come on, Gordon, let's go for a drink,' to which Gordon loudly responded, `I don't drink!'

        He was on the sort of forerunner of the committee involved in the establishment of this parliament, the new Parliament House, and that work was very important in the establishment and the building of this place. On 25 March 1992, he was appointed to Clerk of the House of Representatives. In June 1995, on the occasion of the Queen's birthday honours list, he was awarded membership in the general division of the Order of Australia. Of course, he was here for the changeover of government in March 1996.

        He was particularly responsible for the new procedures which you, Mr Speaker, have mentioned. He also oversaw the introduction of the Main Committee. The smooth introduction of that was a tribute to the work that the clerks, led by Lyn Barlin, had done. It would be fair to say that he has experienced some of the disappointments of the parliament as well. Whilst today is not a day to dwell on such things, I do say that he has been with us through the good times and the not so good.

We thought that the opposition might have been running a filibuster on the Aged Care Bill, the bill of the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan). I talked to him about what we might do and thought of a short-cut proposition, which I advanced to Lyn. He said, `I don't want to be any trouble to you. I don't want to be difficult. In fact, I apologise for being difficult.' I said to him, and I am sure he will not mind me saying this, `It is not being difficult to give good advice.

         This is a chamber governed by standing orders. It makes law, and it provides a sounding board for the great issues of national life. All members of this place are pretty good at the third of those aspects of this parliament. We, as parliamentarians, are pretty good at airing in this place the great issues of national life. We are not necessarily as good at making law. Indeed, most of us know very little about it in a legal, technical sense. When it comes to standing orders, basically we know nothing at all. The position of the Clerk on those latter two elements is extremely invaluable.

         I had occasion to know that early when I became Leader of the House. Lyn Barlin's predecessor said to me, `There are really only 10 standing orders that you need to know.' That was news to me; I thought there were only about two. The fact that there were 10 was an advance for a Leader of the House. Of course, the Clerk has to know them all. He can be absolutely certain that the Leader of the House will know no more than 10 and that the Speaker will know no more than 12. The role that is therefore played by the Clerk is absolutely essential.

         We absolutely have to be certain in this place that we pass laws correctly and that the affairs of this House are conducted within the traditions of this House and the framework of the orders put in place for that to be done. I know that most of the things that a Leader of the House does on many occasions probably stretch those standing orders to the limit to suit the convenience of the government of the day. When Leader of the House, I spent most of my time with Lyn discussing these situations. I suspect that that is not dissimilar in the experience of the current Leader of the House (Mr Reith).

         This is one of the great Westminster parliaments, the Australian parliament, with a lot of innovation in it, as well as a lot of tradition. The role that is played here by the senior officers of the parliament, including the clerk, is one which is bankable elsewhere through the system. Over the lengthy years of his service, the qualities which Lyn has evinced have seen him in advisory roles, have seen him involved with some of the other great parliaments, including the mother of them all, the UK parliament, and have seen him as an adviser to people who are embarking on the course of membership of the Westminster system.

         Lyn has also contributed to the latest version of the bible by which we are governed—that is, the green book, which, when I first became a member in this place, was handed to me as something that I must read. It is actually a much more fascinating read than a lot of people think, but it is so important that it be right. The fact that it is authored effectively every few years—in fact, probably a little longer than that—by the clerk makes it a compendium of the wisdom of the very few officers who have served in that position in this place. I think the latest edition of it is the best, and certainly the most interesting, and I have read every single one of them on the way through.

         I think Lyn has had more of a sense of innovation than most clerks.

Nevertheless, an awful lot of the advice, and certainly its translation into standing orders, is most important too.

         Apart from the usage of the guillotine and the fact that Leaders of the House turn their backs on him, there has been nothing that has given Lyn more grief than the changing role of the Senate over the course of the last few years.

         Suffice it to say, while he has not died in the ditch about it, it has not gone through without protest.

It is going to be difficult for the Speaker in circumstances in which there is a considerable amount of turmoil and volatility now in the structure of the parliamentary administration to have to make the changes that he will have to preside over and on which he will have to negotiate with his counterpart in the Senate over the course of this next little while without Lyn Barlin being there.

          was one of your predecessors, Jim Odgers, who told colleagues when he left the Senate that he was certain that he had been impartial because over 42 years of service he had been accused of being a supporter of every political party in the parliament and that guaranteed absolute independence.

         —They did not have the One Nation party in the parliament at that stage. What takes on additional skill, of course, is that at moments of great humour and great wit in the parliament you, as the Clerk of the House of Representatives, are also forbidden from laughing. To actually laugh at particular occasions would of course show a kind of partiality. One of the things you learn when you come here whilst in opposition and one of the government ministers makes fun is that you should never laugh or appear to laugh at an opposition jibe on camera. I suppose in clerk training this advice is always given as well because I can say that, even in your comments and your demeanour and your smile and your laughter, you have taken great pains to be impartial, if I may say so. You a very impartial person when it comes to wit and witticisms in the House as well.

        This has been not only a role which has been performed in our country over the course of the century but a role which has been performed in parliaments dating back to Westminster for nearly seven centuries. You are the keepers of the flame; you are the keepers of the tradition; you are the keepers of the propriety; you are the keepers of the process. And you are, in many respects, the keepers of the constitution because, if we should miss the procedure, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, at some particular point, then the law could be a nullity or it could be void or it could be irregular. It is the clerks that ensure that we keep within the letter of the law in the constitution. In that way you have a very deep constitutional role to play in the parliament as well.

          —I will make a couple of observations on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1), referring to three areas of the bill which relate to the Senate amendments. The first of these relates to the tax exempt status of scholarships. This exemption has come under threat as a result of a tax office draft ruling. We sought to remove this threat by simply removing the provision of the act under which the ruling was made. The government opposed us on this, raising the question as to what the government's agenda might actually be. Indeed, the minister in the Senate referred to amendments to remove this threat as `offensive'. I can only hope he was joking.

          degree of protection to the tax exempt status of scholarships, a deal the Democrats carefully neglected to consult relevant education organisations on. The reason for this behaviour by the Democrats is unclear. That, however, is where the matter lies. It is to be hoped that the expressed intention of the Senate of removing this threat to the tax exempt status of scholarships is in fact achieved.

         A second set of Senate amendments rejected the government's attempts to weaken the status of employee share schemes by lowering the threshold of qualification for tax concession status from 75 per cent of all employees to 60 per cent of permanent employees. What has the government got against casual workers? Why shouldn't they be included in employee share schemes? I would have thought that the logic of the argument for tax concessions for such schemes would apply equally to casual employees as to other employees. Many casual employees do in fact work for long periods, sometimes many years for the one employer. Indeed, I would have thought that raising the status of casual employees would get bipartisan support in this parliament.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If the government wants to encourage employee share ownership schemes, as it says it does, why does it want to reduce the number of people in an enterprise that the scheme applies to? This signifies an elitist approach on the part of the government. It talks a lot about reducing fiscal deficits, but it always seems to find fiscal room for elitist, regressive tax concessions. The Senate's rejection of this change is to be welcomed.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Finally, I mention the amendment made to the bill to change the $5 million net business assets test on access to capital gains tax rollover relief into a net assets test. Labor amendments have ensured that the private wealth of an individual, as well as the business wealth, is taken into account in determining access to the rollover provisions. Once again, we have acted to help the government with its fiscal task in a way that is much more socially acceptable than the government intended.

He looked at me surprised and said—and I do not think I am breaching a confidence here—`We were delighted that you got the task because you were one person that we really thought did take the place seriously and did understand the standing orders.' I said, `Well, I take the place seriously. But learning the standing orders is something, in essence, that comes from experience not just from the written word.

I have been here for nearly 13 years now. I enjoyed a period of three years as the Speaker of the House of Representatives in the last parliament.

If you happen to have been a Speaker, you would like to think you are going to be remembered for some wise and just ruling you have given from the chair at some time. You would also like to think that everyone out there—whoever reads that book—or people who subsequently come to this place believe that you arrived at that wise and just decision on your own.

        In the two weeks in which the Prime Minister of the day decided he was going to defend the member for Fremantle in this place, the very early morning meetings that Lyn and I used to have to discuss what was coming in the course of the day became a little longer than usual—and occasionally, I might say, a little more heated than they might ever have been—when discussing whether matters could be introduced into this place or whether the sub judice principle applied.

        The funny thing was—I know it really irks Lyn to hear me say this—that I actually agreed with the Clerk of the Senate on his interpretation of sub judice. Lyn and I had many discussions, both during that time and subsequently, about my interpretation of the sub judice principle at the time.

        I also would like to say to Lyn that, whilst much has been said about Lyn the Clerk, there is also Lyn the person. In that very close relationship that we enjoy, I have come to know him and Beryl for the people that they are. His one great failing in that respect is that he is a Raiders supporter. In my time here I have never been able to convert him to supporting the Illawarra Steelers or an alternate team. He has been fiercely loyal to the Raiders—I might say among a dwindling band of Raiders supporters in this town, but Lyn is still there. I certainly commend him for his loyalty in that respect.

You are then coming back to tidy up some loose ends before you finally get him at home. As Lyn has remarked in your presence, Beryl, you are not quite sure what having him at home will mean for you. We have tried today to give him a couple of little things that might get him out of the house for at least a short time via fishing and whatever else. Lyn, enjoy your retirement. We will miss you.

        You have been a truly remarkable figure in Australian parliamentary history. In a parliament where issues can change at a moment's notice, extraordinary pressures can erupt without warning and members are required to make crucial decisions affecting the long-term future of the nation, Lyn Barlin has been for nearly 30 years a veritable foundation stone of strength and stability.

We enjoy a remarkable stability and unity of purpose as a nation, for all our current uncertainties. We cannot underestimate the importance in that of a consistent, predictable system of government. Lyn has contributed more than perhaps we may ever know to the smooth operation of the House of Representatives consistent with the myriad of legal obligations arising under the Westminster system.

        Many of us have had input in this parliament by offering our views and opinions and then assisting others to reach a collective viewpoint. The Clerk's role is quite different, requiring a most thorough understanding of procedures, standing orders and parliamentary history to facilitate immediate decisions on the floor of the House. I have often sat in various seats in this chamber and wondered, Lyn, how on earth you do it. I have wondered how on earth you know so much, retain it all and then convey information, advice and knowledge with such quiet dignity, so reliably and in such a non-inflammatory way every time.

Frank Green might have been the person who found Lyn Barlin, but I was the person who appointed him as the Clerk of the House of Representatives.

As the minister for agriculture said, there are many Australians who watch television and reckon that that bald bloke obviously knows the best thing about this place and he makes the best contributions in the House.

         I found Lyn and Beryl to be people whose company is enjoyable. When I was the Speaker, I had great difficulty encouraging Lyn to travel. With most of my colleagues, there was not much difficulty encouraging them to travel whatsoever and encouraging other people who work for the parliament to travel, because they would queue up to do it. But you could never get Lyn to go on a trip. We finally talked him into going to Africa first, to Namibia. Lyn and Beryl, and Janice and I are probably four of the few people in this parliament who have ever been to Swakopmund. We can always say that we went to the hard places—not Paris, London and Rome but Swakopmund and Tokyo. But you seem to have got the bug after that because you have travelled a lot since then. So, obviously, after being to Swakopmund once, one decides that one must see all the other places that are on the circuit.

I must say that, when I was the Speaker, he used to come in here and say to me, `I have given that Mr Beazley some advice but I hope he doesn't take it.' Beazley would come in and wreak some terrible disaster on the parliamentary system, and all the government members would say, `We have knocked the opposition over now.' Lyn would say to me afterwards, `Do you think that was the best thing that we did there today?' I would properly nod with him and say, `No, no, it wasn't.' But the truth was they made him think it up.

        It became far more apparent to me when I entered this chamber that the rules were different but that the integrity of the clerks was something that remained constant. As I came to know the Clerk more and more and be advised by him, which I quite frequently needed in the beginning, the one thing I realised in coming into this chamber here was that all members of the House of Representatives had a rather, shall we say, different view of the worth of senators. When they came down from one chamber to the next, it was necessary to learn the ways in which this House was conducted and not try to say that one was knowledgeable in the ways of procedure and try to make comparisons. So it was to the clerks that I frequently went for advice. I can only say that I was always treated in the most courteous manner—not `shouldn't you have learned that by now?' but really in a way that helped me to adapt to a chamber which I dearly enjoy serving in.

        The clerk of this place is somebody with whom I have been associated in many ways for a good part of the 43 years that he has served here. I wanted to speak, but briefly, on two aspects of his career. The first is the office itself. I know many have spoken of his role and the current parliamentary practice. When I first arrived it was Erskine May that was the fount of all wisdom. While the clerks were there at the table to provide solace, it was to Erskine May and the current standing orders to which we were referred if we wanted to know the practices and the procedures and, ultimately, how we should behave. Lyn was part of the generation that saw that that was inadequate and that it was necessary for us to have our own.

         three editions. While it is true that Jack Pettifer, the then clerk, was one of the prime authors and the instigator—and ultimately it was his name that the publication bore—Lyn and his colleagues, the assistant clerks, all played an important part in its preparation. In terms of the office, what Lyn has advised each of us in the daily process of this place is very significantly replicated not only in this third edition of
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          House of Representatives practice

        Of the second aspect, the manner of the execution of his duty, much has been said both in the way it has been administered and of the occasions when it has been really so much on the clerk; the tone, the manner and the decorum and indeed the standards have followed. It is not an easy role and much has been said of that. Having been both Leader of the House and Manager of Opposition Business over a protracted period of time and having been at the bar of the House when many of the major events of the last 35 or 37 years have occurred I can assure you that on all occasions they have been very much dependent on the advice that the clerk provides.

        For those outside of the chamber the role of the clerk is a little uncertain and unknown. I suspect that it is only on this occasion that you have been the centrepiece, clerk, in the presentation of the television images of the place; normally it is on the Speaker behind you or on the speakers on either side of the chamber where the emphasis rests. There is a requirement that the forms of the parliament be preserved. If we believe in democracy, it sounds an ethos to which we can all aspire. But it means little if it is not carried out in a manner prescribed within the standing orders, which are designed to ensure that the processes are allowed to evolve and that everybody is given an adequate opportunity to express their point of view. Lyn has been outstanding in the advice he has given and in the degree to which, after the advice has been given, if you transgress he quietly admonishes you as to how it should have been conducted. I know on the several occasions in which I have been involved in the escapades of this place he has inevitably told me afterwards how I should really have conducted the affair.

Lyn, like all others who have spoken before me I wish you and Beryl a long life, happiness and obviously excellent health. I am only sorry that the arms and the man have been separated. We learnt earlier today that Lyn did have two very excellent shotguns that regrettably, under the present laws that he saw pass through this place, are no longer his to hold.

         —True. For those who have frail wrists, perhaps a smaller paperback version could be prepared. Lyn Barlin was clerk assistant in 1977, when I was first elected. For much of 1978, he was serving in the House of Commons, so I only came to know him either later in that year or early in 1979. I think he has been one of the very great figures I have known, either sitting at that table or within Parliament House itself. His contribution has been remarkable.

I do not gloat about my own period of service, but I suspect I am probably the most senior Liberal now. In that context, I have served in many roles.

        In relation to the Committee of Members' Interests, for most of the time I was associated with the committee, Lyn was the registrar, even before he became the Clerk. In that context, he was advising the committee. We were dealing with difficult issues that did go to members' personal affairs and personal interests, where disclosure has some sensitivity and where at times one needs to look with some care at what factors ought to be brought forward and what the implications of those might be. His advice and counsel were very sage and important to us. The way in which we could approach him with a good deal of confidence on matters that did involve one's personal affairs is a measure of the man, and it is what we expect of all those who are involved in this role.

Whenever I see Sir Humphrey in that program

         who carries the responsibility to see that the proper procedures have been followed and that the right amendments and votes have been taken at the right time.

Apparently, he has researched digital and analogue video photography to the nth degree and is almost a font of knowledge on it. I certainly hope that in your retirement years, Lyn, you get a chance to shoot a bit more big game with your video cameras now that you have lost your shotguns, which is obviously a shame.

        The question which arose at the beginning of this particular parliament was in relation to the record number of Independent members in the House of Representatives. I think it is the largest number since about 1912. There was a need to resolve the problem of how one came to settle the way in which the speaking opportunities were arrived at, and questions and the like. Knowing that Lyn Barlin felt that he did not have a role to play in the question of the actual resolution of those particular issues, his advice was nonetheless

         very useful and helpful. At a stage when we had a large number of Independents, a number of whom were new to the place and who obviously were unfamiliar with the procedures, that advice was very helpful indeed.

        I also reflect on one other issue that the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) and a number of other members were touching on—that is, the question of the role of the Clerk in relation to the development of the parliamentary democracy or our institution of parliamentary government. One of the great dilemmas or conflicts in this place over, I suppose, all of its life has been the conflict between the executive and the parliament. We have seen more and more in recent years the way in which the executive, under either side of politics, unfortunately, has come to view parliament as being a bit of an inconvenience in its program of legislating.

        There has been a tendency on both sides, although it is not quite as bad under this particular government as under the previous one, for the executive government to try to trammel over the rights of individual members in its pursuit of what it considers to be the interests of governance in the nation's interest. I am sure—and I am more and more convinced now after seven years in this place—that had it not been for the fact that Lyn Barlin was the Clerk of the House of Representatives, that process would have accelerated. I mean that in the sense that I am sure that the unbiased, independent, calm and wise advice provided by Lyn Barlin to both sides of politics has ensured that, in fact, both sides have been better informed to be able to prevent the greater trammelling of the rights of individual members by the executive.

While those of us who are in the Speaker's chair often want in one way or another out of party loyalty to participate in the debate and are unable to do so, we would not know whether or not the clerks wanted to participate because there has been no indication from any of them that they felt any particular passion at all about the debate.

I note with interest that I have never seen the clerks smile, participate, be at all amused or in fact be prepared to be engaged in any of the sorts of exchanges that involve the scorn and derision that we all wish were not part of the chamber of the House of Representatives.

I think that is important. We have to understand that we operate in a society that develops and is changing, that we are continually challenged to make what we do here relevant to the people who observe us. We have had to do a lot of things. Perhaps Lyn, like a number

Part of my life experience before here was to be the principal private secretary to the former Attorney&amp;hyphen;General of Western Australia, Joe Berinson, who is a former member for Perth, a former Deputy Speaker of this House and a person whom I know the Clerk has a warm and high view of. One of the things I had to do in that capacity was to deal with parliamentary counsel and issue instructions for the drafting of legislation. If you find a quality parliamentary counsel, you find a person who is clear thinking, has sharp intellect, is committed to high professional standards and, at a personal level, is a fundamentally decent person full of integrity, dignity, confidence and calmness. They are also committed to the sanctity of their process, which is the law. They are committed to the sanctity of the

I have been here since 1993, a relatively short period, in two capacities: from 1993 to 1996 as a government backbencher and since 1996 as a member of the opposition's frontbench. My contact with Lyn as a government backbencher, as has no doubt been the experience of government backbenchers today, has been somewhat limited—the odd piece of advice, which was always clear, always precise and always well worth following.

I would often say to him, `Lyn, all I need is an arguable case,' to which on many occasions the Clerk would say, `I know, Stephen, but, I'm sorry, it's not arguable.'

        The book has been mentioned. Very many of us, when we got the book in our rooms, went to the footnotes to see whether we were in the footnotes. In my case, I was. It required that, together with the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), I blew up the Main Committee and ran two dissent motions simultaneously in the Main Committee and in this House. I do not think I am breaching a confidence when I say that, on one occasion, when I went to seek advice as to what I should have done next, I left the Clerk with him having

        Most of us in this place end up as footnotes. It is the rare individual who gets to write the book or to help write the book. Lyn Barlin has helped write the book. That is a measure of his contribution as a fundamentally decent human being, a man of great integrity and dignity, a person whom this institution will miss and a person to whom this parliament and our nation owes a great deal of gratitude. We wish him well in his retirement. I personally thank him for the contribution that he has made in helping to turn me from being a politician into, hopefully at some point in the process, a parliamentarian.

The member for Paterson has now caused me some difficulty because of his interjections. I now need to explain something that was not clear. The Commonwealth government, with the member for Paterson, announced a $2 million program about a month ago for long&amp;hyphen;term unemployed based on tourism. The biggest tourist attraction in my area, the Hunter, is fishing. Fishing is the major recreation in that region. We draw literally tens of millions of dollars of income from the fishing industry and the tourism industry combined. That $2 million was turned down this week by the Hunter Regional Tourist Organisation because the government has made the program non&amp;hyphen;viable by reducing the amount per person and by the way it is paid. I needed to explain that because the member for Paterson has now taken this a step further.

          The point I was trying to make was that we in this House can agree on the need for fishing security, and we have. Speakers on both sides—and I have read all their speeches—have spoken of the importance of managing our fishing stocks well. We all understand what happened with the orange roughie and we all understand what happened with a range of fish stock which were not well managed. We understand that. We had enormous difficulty, off the coast of Newcastle and further north, with the gemfish problem. My electorate's fishing fleet suffered greatly with that. We had enormous difficulty with the issue of prawning licences. My fishing people suffered greatly from that. So we are aware of those things and we agree on those things.

Here we are at the end of the session and I am now being told that members have dropped off the speakers list to go home early or whatever. I did not know that, to be honest.

One of the people helping to push it off was the member for Paterson, a member of the committee who did not come to one hearing other than the one in Parliament House which he did not know was a hearing. He did not come to a committee meeting for six months, and his lack of support for small business, as shown by his performance in that inquiry, is appalling.

           This legislation is important. My fishing fleet has just relocated from the harbour foreshores around Honeysuckle. There is a new fishing fleet and a new property being built there that I am sure will be extremely successful. I want to make sure that the people in this government and the department understand and appreciate how critical these issues are. We can all agree across the chamber, but it is what happens on the ground and under the water that is more important. Issues of environmental degradation, pollution and fishing management and the way that the department operates are vital.

It is important that tourist operators and fishing communities across the country write to their federal member, particularly if that member is in government. They should write to them, ring them or go and see them. They should tell them, `We are pleased that you agree on the legislation for fishing, but we also want you to agree on the complete recommendations of the fair trading inquiry.' They should tell them that they want them adopted soon, because, with every week that goes by, small business people are going broke. Fishermen are going broke because they do not have the protection that they need. It is available, and the formula is there.

           —Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order under standing order 277, which relates to unresolved questions having to come back to the chamber for consideration. The Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill was subject to an unresolved question yesterday. The report was considered 24 hours ago, which allowed for the second reading debate. It is my understanding that there are seven outstanding reports from the Main Committee, which include unresolved questions. One of them goes to the report that appears to be contentious, which is the fair trading report. I am aggrieved that I have not been able to discuss that report, but that is not my point.

          As part of that debate, there is an unresolved question relating to a dissent motion about a ruling of Deputy Speaker Mossfield. I believe that it would be wrong for us to have that dissent motion hanging and not resolved over the winter recess. I had hoped that there would be an opportunity at least to endeavour to have those who sponsored the dissent motion to reconsider it and withdraw it, because I do not think anything is served by continuing with it. There will be a great difficulty if we do not resolve those questions that have been returned for deliberation by the chamber from the Main Committee, especially when we have this one, which is a dissent motion—a very serious motion—before the Main Committee that is not yet resolved.

         This bill provides for the separation of Medibank Private from the Health Insurance Commission, HIC, and the creation of a new Medibank Private corporation. Through the separation, the government will ensure that Medibank Private cannot be perceived to have any competitive advantage over other private health funds through its association with Medicare or other government program functions of the HIC. It reinforces the government's commitment to the principle of competitive neutrality.

          The bill therefore provides for the HIC initially to hold shares in the nominated company and to seek registration of that company as a registered health benefits organisation under the National Health Act 1953. The HIC may not transfer any of its shares or voting rights attached to the shares before the date on which the shares are transferred to the Commonwealth.

         The new company, once it is operating as Medibank Private, will not be limited by the current provisions of the Health Insurance Commission Act to determine the range of activities that may be carried out by the company.

The bill provides for the transfer of the fund and its business to the

         Staff affected by the transfer will be treated fairly. Where an employee is transferred under these provisions, their terms and conditions of employment, and other rights and entitlements defined in the bill, have been preserved.

         Transferred employees will not be entitled to any termination payment by leaving HIC employment, but re-transfer provisions will give considerable flexibility for staff transfers back to the HIC for a period of 12 months from the date on which the Commonwealth assumes ownership of the Medibank Private company.

         In order to meet the requirement for Medibank Private to operate on an equal footing with its competitors, these enactments will not apply to Medibank Private thereafter, other than in this transitional sense. The company will, however, continue to operate within the spirit of these regimes—as it does today where the Medibank Private business is not prescribed under these enactments. Medibank Private will, like its competitors, remain subject to the complaints investigations powers of the Private Health Insurance Complaints Commissioner.

         The bill also makes a number of consequential changes to the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973, other acts and the Health Insurance Commission Regulations. The government stresses that the provision of Medicare services will be maintained as a core HIC function, and the HIC will be expected to continue to strive for excellence in delivering quality claims and related services to the public. Other existing government programs functions, including the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, will also continue to be performed by the HIC.

         Additionally, the bill also recognises a widening role for the HIC in the delivery of health payments services and information to support health sector initiatives. The HIC may, in future, provide health information and payments support services to state governments as well as to the Commonwealth. For this reason, the bill permits consultation with the states and territories as to their possible representation on the HIC board. Other minor corporate governance changes and transitional arrangements are also made by the bill.

         The Health Insurance (Pathology Services) Amendment Bill 1997 gives effect to several government initiatives relating to Medicare benefits for pathology services. This bill would allow the Governor&amp;hyphen;General to make regulations to give the Health Insurance Commission power to directly impose penalties for the less serious infringements relating to pathology. It is envisaged that the proposed system of penalty notices, operating in a similar manner to traffic infringement fines, would enable the Commission to deal more efficiently and expeditiously with these infringements.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill also makes an amendment to the licensing scheme for the collection of pathology specimens. It introduces a requirement that the owner of a licensed collection centre must at all times display a notice clearly visible from the outside, to let the public know that the centre is licensed. The bill increases the maximum penalty for infringements from $100 to $1000, to be in line with other penalties relating to collection centres. The intention of this is to provide a deterrent to the operation of unlicensed collection centres and to protect consumer interests.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Currently, the act restricts pathology providers from entering into arrangements for the occupation of premises with medical practitioners or entrepreneurs, except for the establishment of licensed collection centres, accredited laboratories or the rendering of professional services. The aim is to prevent arrangements that constitute inducements to medical practitioners. An amendment in this bill clarifies the wording of the provision to establish beyond doubt that professional services must be performed by the pathologist in person. In other words, the arrangement cannot be one where the medical practitioner receives payment for providing, for example, storage space to a pathologist.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          The bill also seeks to streamline administration of approvals for accredited pathology laboratories, approved pathology practitioners and approved pathology authorities. These are renewed annually, or every three years in the case of the laboratories. Currently, Medicare benefits are not payable where these approvals lapse simply as a result of administrative carelessness on the part of the pathology provider, for example, posting the application forms a few weeks after they are due. This can result in major financial losses to the pathology provider and in patients being deprived of Medicare benefits. The amendment will allow backdating of approvals in limited circumstances to ensure that Medicare benefit payments are not disrupted in instances that do not warrant it.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The measures we are introducing in this bill are important to the maintenance of the pathology agreement, which was introduced in the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 budget and which limits pathology expenditure under Medicare to pre&amp;hyphen;determined levels. They will strengthen the agreement by reducing inappropriate practices which undermine its basis. They have the support of the pathology profession.

         This bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to create a new class of licence—a temporary community broadcasting licence. The legislation will empower the Australian Broadcasting Authority to allocate the licences for a maximum period of one year with
         <break page="6622" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
          out recourse to the act's planning provisions. The bill also provides for consequential amendments to the Radiocommunications Act 1992 to enable the new Australian Communications Authority to issue transmitter licences to these licensees.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         No provision exists under the act for temporary community broadcasting licences. The ABA has, instead, provided for test transmissions of 90 days per aspirant per year, by making spectrum available to providers of open narrowcasting services and issuing temporary apparatus licences, a power delegated to it under the Radiocommunications Act. The situation is far from satisfactory. The ABA has not been able to impose conditions that apply to community broadcasting licensees, for example, community access provisions, and sponsorship announcements limited to four minutes per hour.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Test transmissions have done much to foster the overall development of the community broadcasting sector. There are  currently over 140 aspirant community broadcasters seeking a long&amp;hyphen;term licence. But limited periods of test transmission have meant that it has become increasingly difficult for these non&amp;hyphen;profit aspirants to maintain support from volunteers, sponsors and the local community. Some aspirants may be forced to disband before the ABA has completed the planning process, and allocated long&amp;hyphen;term licences.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am aware that honourable members from both sides of the House have registered growing concern at the delays in the planning and allocation process. Indeed, I have complained myuself. The ABA expects that licence area planning will not be completed before 1999—a 3&amp;half;&amp;hyphen;year slippage. Many markets have no long&amp;hyphen;term community broadcasting licensees and many markets have aspirants who have been seeking long&amp;hyphen;term licences for over a decade.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The amendments proposed are consistent with the objects of the act: to promote the availability of a diverse range of services; and to promote the role of broadcasting services in developing and reflecting a sense of Australian identity, character and cultural diversity.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          The integrity of the current planning process will be maintained. Long&amp;hyphen;term licenses will not be allocated to community broadcasters before the formal planning process has been completed. After each licence area has been planned, the amendments will ensure that aspirants can continue broadcasting, in accordance with the new provisions, ahead of any further process of varying the licence area plan which may result in more long&amp;hyphen;term licences. The primary purpose of these amendments is, however, to enable the introduction of continuous transmissions by aspirants ahead of formal planning.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Many aspirant groups will have the opportunity to commence full&amp;hyphen;time broadcasting. It is anticipated that the majority of suitable aspirants will benefit, with access made available to as many as possible. In areas where there is competition for limited spectrum, it is intended that continuous transmissions be made possible through spectrum sharing.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The conditions, content rules and remedial and enforcement mechanisms which apply to long&amp;hyphen;term community broadcasting licensees will apply to temporary community broadcasting licensees. The ABA will also have the power to specify the times and the total number of days during which broadcasting will be permitted by the terms of the licence.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Under this bill, temporary licence holders will not have enhanced rights to the allocation of a community broadcasting licence—there will be no mechanism for converting a temporary community broadcasting licence into a community broadcasting licence. The likelihood of an aspirant eventually gaining a long&amp;hyphen;term licence will vary from area to area, depending on a number of factors, including both the spectrum made available by the ABA in the planning process and the subsequent evaluation of the merits of applicants in the allocation process conducted by the ABA in accordance with part 6 of the act.

          —I will make up for the omission of the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment (Mr Warwick Smith) by actually discussing the bill. The Environment, Sport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill is a technical bill which amends some 15 acts of this parliament. It improves some administrative processes under the act, brings Commonwealth legislation into line with resolutions of the 16th Consultative Meeting of Contracting Parties to the London Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping Wastes and Other Material and corrects a number of drafting areas.

         The opposition will support the bill, but only after the government amends clause 40—which it has done—dealing with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act. In its original form, the bill sought to amend that act to remove the Australian Defence Force or the defence force of a foreign country from the application of an offence of waste discharge on the Great Barrier Reef. We opposed that amendment and had the government not indicated that it would amend the bill to delete clause 40—so our own defence forces and those of visiting countries would not be able, without penalty, to discharge waste on the reef—we would have been moving amendments. But that has been done by the government. I am pleased it has taken that course, because the Great Barrier Reef is a highly sensitive world heritage area that demands strict environmental controls on waste disposals, whether they be from commercial, private or defence vessels.

Therefore, this time has been put to good use, and the employment base and the economic base of that firm in Tasmania has been maintained but without environmental cost.

         This is one of four bounties abolished by this government, despite election promises to the contrary, and we have succeeded in the restoration of three of them. Unfortunately, the Senate has not continued to insist the computer bounty be retained, but we will persist with the issue of the computer bounty when we finally get released to us the Goldsworthy report into the information technology industry. So this is a great win for the people in the book publishing industry. It is a great win for the people of Maryborough. It is a great win for the people of Adelaide.

         It is interesting that, in relation to this issue, the Productivity Commission recommended that the bounty be retained to the end of the year. Finally, that is the position the government has adopted. This is a position that the Productivity Commission recommended but which the government ignored. It is also interesting to note that the Productivity Commission is yet to release its final report on machine tools and robots as well as its final report on book bounties. It is very interesting that this is a government that chooses to hide the Productivity Commission reports and keep them away from this parliament for debate.

          The Productivity Commission report on the textile, clothing and footwear industries is another case in point. It is going to be released on Monday, but it is something that we know should have been debated in this House. The future of the textile, clothing and footwear industries is going to be a major issue, one on which a new battle ground will be opened up. Why Monday? Because parliament is not sitting. Does this sound familiar? It is exactly what the government did in relation to the car industry. It did not release the report of the Productivity Commission until after parliament got up, and it is doing the same here. In relation to machine tools and robots, it has done exactly the same thing.

          Only last week the report for the textile, clothing and footwear industries was due for release today, but that was when it was considered that parliament would have got up yesterday. So the intention was always to have the report come out the day after parliament got up. Why? Because the Treasurer (Mr Costello) leaned on the Productivity Commission to delay the release of the report. The Treasurer is clearly hiding the report and, once again, he will not allow it to be released until parliament rises, just as he did in the case of the car industry.

          We have this Treasurer carrying on about a charter of budget honesty, but he will not release the Productivity Commission reports which are in his charge. I think that PC, in relation to the Productivity Commission, is now about Peter's concealment. There is this so-called new openness of government and the waxing lyrical by the Treasurer about how we are going to introduce new standards and new access, and they hide the Productivity Commission reports. They do not want the debate in this place.

          This report holds major concern for the workers within the textile, clothing and footwear industry. If it turns out that this report of the Productivity Commission into the textile, clothing and footwear industry has learnt nothing from the decision in cars, then its recommendations will place at risk thousands of jobs within that industry. It will put at great risk the people in that industry, who, from all the studies that have been done, are

          Let me just say this: Labor will be responding to the outcome from the report of the Productivity Commission into the textile, clothing and footwear industry to make sure that there is a commitment not just to securing existing jobs but to new jobs, new investment and increased exports. We would like to have had the opportunity for debate in this House rather than have the report hidden from us. This is a government that wants to hide everything of significance.

The Hyatt has advised that its policy is to obtain the best possible product at the best price, with preference for Australian products. This is consistent with the Commonwealth's commitments under the government procurement agreement.

          Value for money is a prime determinant for evaluating purchases, and the Hyatt has a commitment to Australian products wherever possible.

Despite the fact that the local produce is more expensive, the Hyatt now provides an all&amp;hyphen;Australian fruit salad mix.

          —The push for a national drug summit keeps growing stronger with each day, and as each day passes the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) begin to look more and more out of touch with public opinion and with the opinions of experts in the field of drug addiction, law enforcement and medicine, who are all in favour of a summit.

        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When I asked the Prime Minister in early June whether he would consider convening a national drug summit he said that such a gathering would be `unnecessary' and `wasteful of resources'. A few days later the same answer came back from the minister for health—in fact, almost in the same terms. In the following days, as calls for a summit
         <break page="6631" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          continued to grow, the minister for health was forced to repeat his negative words. The minister's spokesperson said a summit would mean `zilch' and would be nothing but a `talkfest'. In his answer to my question in the House, the minister said a summit would be a `cheap stunt' which would only amount to `window&amp;hyphen;dressing'. Strong words but foolish words, I believe, spoken too soon.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would like to read to the House just some of the names of individuals and groups who in the last few weeks have given their support to the idea of holding a national drug summit: the Australian Medical Association; the Royal College of Physicians; the directors of public prosecutions in New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia; the premiers of Western Australia and New South Wales; and members on both sides of this House, including the minister for health's medical and party colleague the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson). I only wish he would put a bit more pressure on the minister instead of talking in the community about it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The list goes on, and with every name that is added to the list, the Prime Minister, the minister for health and their cabinet colleagues begin looking like `yesterday's men'. The sad thing—that is, apart from the fact that, the longer we prevaricate in making dramatic changes to the national drug strategy, the more people will die on our streets—is that the government's stubborn attitude on a summit is just so unnecessary.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It seems the minister for health cannot imagine a summit amounting to anything more than just premiers, chief ministers and possibly their ministers for health and police sitting around a table and having yet another meeting—that is, if the ministers themselves turn up and do not just send their representatives. This is exactly how the national drug strategy is run at the moment, and I do not have to tell members how ineffective this method has proven to be.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is not what I or anybody else has in mind when a drug summit is mentioned. I am talking about a summit where the politicians are joined by experts in drug addiction and abuse, law enforcement and judicial authorities, spokespeople from health and welfare
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          agencies, religious groups, family members of addicts—even reformed addicts themselves.

         I would like to see a summit where the politicians cannot just put off making their decisions until next year's meeting. I want a summit where the politicians are confronted by the wretched stories of heroin abuse and about the heroin on our streets and how it is destroying ordinary, happy Australian families. I want the politicians for a change to come face to face with the stark evidence of the failings of the national drug strategy. Above all, I envisage a drug summit where the Prime Minister uses his position, his authority, to press the gathering into putting forward some definite proposals for change—the same way he pressed those who attended the guns buy-back summit in the wake of the Port Arthur tragedy.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         Perhaps, when Dr Wooldridge hears talk about a drug summit, his instinctive reaction is that it would be just another meeting. But a summit need not be an empty talkfest. The example of 1986 provides a caution against expecting that there are simple solutions to a many&amp;hyphen;layered problem—it does not prove that a summit might not be still the best means of educating and galvanising public opinion so that (a new direction) becomes a matter of urgency for policy makers . . .

         This is not a stunt. It is not a mickey mouse sideshow we are after. We are after the minister for health and the Prime Minister of this country giving at least serious consideration to the idea of holding a national drug summit. The minister serves nobody, least of all himself, by quickly dismissing the idea of a drug summit as a `cheap stunt' when some of the most conservative organisations and politicians, including members of his own political party, think it is the right direction in which to head.

          Nobody wants another talkfest. The police do not, the health authorities do not, those working with drug addicts on our streets every day certainly do not and the families who have lost loved ones to heroin abuse or who are watching them suffer do not. And many of the addicts themselves do not want to go on in the way we have been. The only people who do not want action are the drug barons and the pushers on the streets. We have had inquiry after inquiry on drugs, drug abuse and drug reform. The time has now come for action. A drug summit does not mean inaction. A drug summit, if handled correctly, can mean real change. I urge the Prime Minister, his minister for health and his cabinet colleagues to give consideration to this.

          I might also say that when the member for Bradfield went walking through the areas of my electorate the other day with the President of the AMA it was finally brought to his attention how dramatic and drastic this lack of attention is. I am glad that he went there. Maybe now when I come into this House and talk about what is factually happening on the streets people will start to listen. People are dying, and action needs to be taken.

          —Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, through you, I would like to take the opportunity before the adjournment of the House in this session to thank the Speaker for the response to the matter regarding dried fruit. I reiterate your remarks about what a delightful platter it can make, taking advantage of the wonderful dried fruit products of our nation. Mr Deputy Speaker, I even forgive you for not responding to that whilst I had here yesterday school students from Sunraysia, which is very much the central focus of the dried vine fruit industry in our country. My electorate shares this wonderful dried fruit industry with the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), the member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) and the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks).

          the dried fruit industry and citrus growers. We have made a very significant ask of these two industries, in the move towards freer trade, to accept dramatically lower tariffs. They have responded marvellously and accordingly. They have made adjustments in order to compete. I think it is only fitting that the House provides them with every assistance and, particularly, to use the catering facilities in this place to boast their wonderful products.

         I am very pleased with the response from the Hyatt. I hope they continue to note my interest in the way that horticultural products are used. I have made a great thing about the use of fresh fruit, especially oranges. I am always alert to ensure that there is no orange juice in this place that is made from reconstituted concentrate. The only way to guarantee that it is genuinely Australian orange juice is to drink it fresh, otherwise there is no guarantee that it is not reconstituted concentrate imported from Brazil.

         The Hyatt are conscious of my views on that matter.

I highly recommend that honourable members take the opportunity to enjoy that soup before the House completes its activities tonight. I thank the Hyatt for advancing the cause of Australian horticulturalists and using Australian products in this place so that when visitors come—be they from New Zealand, or Europe or delegations from all around the world—we can show them genuine Australian products.

          —I rise in this adjournment debate to draw to the attention of this House the absolutely marvellous support scheme being conducted for small business by the Blacktown Business Enterprise Centre. This centre has been in operation in Blacktown for only two years. I will shortly refer to its successes. The centre is part of Business Enterprise Centres New South Wales Ltd, which is responsible for the cohesive and constructive program of representations to government and the overall marketing of the BEC network. The New South Wales scheme has been in operation for 12 years.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I recently received a copy of the New South Wales BEC annual report. I propose to quote extensively from the manager's report, as the figures highlight that the successes are quite outstanding. The BEC network in New South Wales and the ACT has assisted 9,754 existing businesses to develop or to resolve problems by providing professional advice, guidance and support; has provided professional advice and support to 5,020 new business start-up ventures; was involved in the creation of 4,240 new jobs; has dissuaded 1,216 people from entering a small business venture because of the likelihood of failure; and has provided telephone and/or face-to-face client service in 27,950 initial contacts and 13,778 repeat client contacts. Along with these facts, I note that the manager of the Blacktown BEC, Christine Gough, states that it was conservatively estimated that the investment value of the small to medium sized businesses assisted by the BEC network in New South Wales and the ACT was at least $108 million—a remarkable figure, indeed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I now turn to the success of the Blacktown BEC. Up until June 1996 this BEC assisted 291 `intending' and `new start' clients and assisted 102 existing businesses to develop and/or resolve difficulties, which resulted in 73 jobs being created. Also, 393 businesses
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          were assisted in the Blacktown local government area. I was impressed to read that in January 1997 there were a total of 145 client contacts, compared with 39 in January 1996. Obviously this increase is based on the greater awareness within the small business community of the availability of this service and the very healthy respect for its professionalism and expertise.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The BEC has an excellent group of directors and I outline these as follows: Paul Matthews, chairman and managing partner in a local firm of solicitors; Bev Norton, until recently the CEO of the chamber of commerce; Greg McDonald, owner of Greater West Insurance Brokers; John Simmons, general sales manager with western radio station One&amp;hyphen;FM; Michael Foley, a partner in a firm of chartered accountants; John Camp, regional training marketing consultant at the Blacktown chamber of commerce; and Jim Taggart, a very talented and professional individual who brings great expertise to the board.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Blacktown BEC has also recently conducted a free small business seminar to clients assisted by Business Training and Management Pty Ltd. This was simply the first of many seminars that the BEC are planning over the next 12 months, and it proved very popular. I am delighted that, in such a short time, the Blacktown BEC has been able to show such dramatic results and take its place with great pride amongst the other BECs around New South Wales and the ACT.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Clearly, the BEC is going to become a real force to be reckoned with and will add greatly to the enhancement of the prestige of this very valuable service being conducted for the benefit of small business. The inaugural national BEC network conference was held in Canberra last month. I am advised that the conference was very successful. One of the outcomes was a desire to create a more formal approach to the national body and to strengthen the relationships within the BEC network.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I congratulate the conference on its work, as the BEC network is the catalyst that is

         For the benefit of the House, I will just point out that, of the 41 meetings of the House's Committee on Industry, Science and Technology in this current parliament that we have held since it was formed, the member for Paterson attended three of the first four and has attended five since then. There was a period between 12 September last year and 27 February this year when he did not attend at all. He did not attend any of the report considerations on the fair trading report and, to my recollection, probably only one of the hearings.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The comment I made about him was in fact very accurate and very disappointing, because he had led people to believe he would be very active in that inquiry. I think we all understand the burdens of office. We are all aware of our responsibilities and how difficult it is in terms of our workloads, but we also make decisions and choices about that.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Regarding the matter in the Main Committee, I think it is important to place on record very clearly what happened with this fair trading report. We were told, when we first tabled it on 26 May, our time in the chamber would be 15 minutes each. Most of the committee wanted to speak. Most of those who had been involved, including government members, missed out on speaking on it: the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), the member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro) and others. The member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) I think also wanted to speak.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We were optimistic that we would deal with it in the Main Committee in the first week. Then it was going to be the second week, then it was going to be the next week, then it was going to be last week, then it was going to be last Wednesday, and then it was going to be Thursday. When we got Thursday's business paper of the Main Committee, it was scheduled all right—at the bottom of the page. And not one government member was listed. Not one government member was listed to speak, yet they had all wanted to speak on it before. The member for Petrie was in the

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When the government did schedule it, it made sure it would not get dealt with. We wanted to speak to that report. I can understand government members not wanting it discussed because they were concerned about their minister. We gave an undertaking that we would not talk about the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser), and that should have been enough. I suggest the innuendo to the remarks of the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) are more offensive than anything anybody else has done because those people who came down came down for a function somewhere else. They simply met here by coincidence. I was not aware they were coming. They were not aware that we were even speaking.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What the member for Adelaide did not say was that I had started my speech much earlier. It was interrupted by the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) walking out of the chamber and collapsing the quorum. In other words, the government collapsed the quorum when I was simply talking about the report. After a quarter of an hour to 20 minutes of no quorum, the government then resumed the quorum and let me continue my speech, which was simply about the report. At the end of that, as you are aware, the then Deputy Speaker, looking at the business paper, gave the next person on the list, the member for Scullin, the call. We then had the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) spend 20 minutes on a dissent motion which was an absolute filibuster.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These people have simply walked in—an absolute coincidence—and discovered that issues they had come down to hear somewhere else were actually being discussed. They could not believe their luck of that being on. They expected to hear both sides of the chamber discuss it because they had been told by me and everybody else that this report was bipartisan—and it has been. They assumed there would be government members speaking as well. They wanted to hear the report being discussed because we were all in agreement on it. They walked into a fiasco

         The fact is that you can try to protect the minister. He is unprotectable. He has been dead for a fortnight. One single incident—the fact that he actually told his brother to write to Nick Greiner—proves that. You cannot protect him, so do not destroy a good report. That is what you are doing. What you have told small businesses in this sitting is that you will not discuss it, you will not debate it and you have gagged it.

          —I would like to report to the House that the first contract was finalised this week for the construction on Sun Metals' Stuart zinc refinery in Townsville. The zinc refinery is the largest Korean investment outside Korea in the world. Golding Contractors, a Gladstone company, has secured the $15 million plus earthworks contract, signalling the imminent commencement of work on the multimillion dollar project.

         According to Sun Metals corporate construction manager, John Dodson, construction work on the $530 million zinc refinery will start next month, involving a peak work force of about 130 people. Sixty to 70 per cent of the staff are expected to be drawn from within the Townsville area both during construction and in the refinery's operational life.

         , Chief Executive Officer of Townsville Enterprise Ltd, Mr Richard Power, said that a study conducted by the Centre for Applied Economic Research and Analysis showed the annual regional benefits during the refinery's initial operating days will include a $467 million increase in gross regional output, a $192 million increase in value added products, an annual injection of $84.5 million into local pay packets and the creation in North Queensland of about 1,670 direct and indirect jobs. Mr Power also said the flow&amp;hyphen;on industrial and commercial development arising from the pro

         The twin cities of Townsville and Thuringowa are at the beginning of what will be a long period of considerable growth and economic development. Unemployment in the region, taking in Townsville, fell a massive 3.5 per cent over the last month according to data released last week by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The unemployment rate in the north&amp;hyphen;west statistical region now stands at just 6.3 per cent—the lowest rate of regional unemployment in 18 months and the lowest result for the month of May since 1990. This compares with a regional unemployment rate of 11.9 per cent at the time of the last election. I just repeat that: at the last election there was 11.9 per cent unemployment; right now we have 6.3 per cent unemployment.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Only last month the Townsville ALP President and former federal member said the Howard government had failed the region because unemployment in our area was running at 9.8 per cent—2.1 per cent lower than at the time of the last election. The unemployment rate has now fallen a further 3.5 points to 6.3 per cent and is now 5.6 per cent lower than at the time of the last election. If that is a failure on my part, I guess I have to plead guilty.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The ABS regional figures follow the release of Department of Social Security figures for May showing the number of unemployed recipients in the Townsville and Aitkenvale area falling by 381. The number of people claiming unemployment benefits locally has fallen 878 since February this year. It is a great result for the Townsville region.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Regional unemployment figures are very volatile and subject to strong seasonal influences. Therefore, I certainly should be careful not to place too much emphasis on one month's figures. Nonetheless, the current downward trend is very positive and I welcome it. It is clear, however, that this trend needs to be maintained over the following months before we start to see the level of local unemployment back down around what I believe are acceptable levels.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The prospect of this trend continuing is good. Besides the imminent start of construction work on the zinc refinery, construction work on the Woolcock Street upgrade has started. That will create about 100 jobs between now and its completion. Townsville's Department of Social Security Teleservice Centre will be taking on 50 new staff between now and the end of September, meaning more jobs and wage earners in the city heart.

          The government also continues to invest heavily in the Australian Defence Force in Townsville. In the next 12 months, these investments will increase troop numbers in the city, creating and sustaining a wealth of subcontracting opportunities for local businesses and inject millions of dollars into the Townsville and Thuringowa economies.

          Townsville is a city and a region that is on the move. No amount of opposition spokespeople flying in and out of Townsville spreading their doom and gloom can dispel the fact that at the time of the last election the regional unemployment rate was 11.9 per cent and now, I am proud to say, it is 6.3 per cent. In the remaining few seconds that I have, I am pleased to be the last speaker of—are these the srping sittings or the autumn sittings?

        Unit cost comparisons between funding periods and projects must be treated cautiously as the funding arrangements varied in each of the periods in question. Prior to January 1995 SkillShare projects were funded on a calendar year basis under arrangements whereby these projects could receive core grants and a mixture of targeted services funds. From 1992 to 1994 projects could obtain additional funding to upgrade premises. While not linked directly to job seeker commencements this funding is included in the attached tables thereby distorting unit cost for the periods in which the one&amp;hyphen;off funds were granted. From January 1995 a streamlined funding approach was introduced. Funding was negotiated with sponsors primarily on a cost per commencement basis.

The Administrative Building in Canberra is vacant with the move of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the new RG Casey Building. The building is vacant pending refurbishment. Scarborough House was also vacated to allow for refurbishment. This refurbishment has since been cancelled due to the lack of a committed tenant.

        The public comment received was reviewed by the NRTC. The response to the report demonstrated that there is a considerable divergence of views over both the costs and benefits of fitting Anti&amp;hyphen;Lock Braking systems on heavy vehicles. There was also concern about the high prices vehicle manufacturers currently charge for fitting ABS as an option.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        In view of the uncertainty surrounding the net benefit of ABS from this study, there is no plan to recommend ABS be mandated on additional categories of heavy vehicles.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        The NRTC's approach was that, based on the current costs, the decision to install ABS should be evaluated by transport operators on a commercial basis. The NRTC's recommendation will be sent to the Ministerial Council for Road Transport for voting.

        (1) The Port Phillip Region Airport and Airspace Study did not specifically recommend that the airport management advisory committee meet to discuss any changes to the number of aircraft movements at Essendon Airport, but the Study did make the following recommendations with regard to aircraft movements at the airport:

        Recommendation (14) of the Study states that the "maximum all up weight of aircraft using the airport on an unrestricted basis be limited to 25,000 kg. The number of movements of aircraft with a maximum take&amp;hyphen;off weight exceeding 25,000 kg be determined in consultation with the Essendon Airport Consultative Committee.

        (2) The Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) has advised the Airport Advisory Committee has not formally met since 1995. When the councils of Essendon and Keilor, which represented the local rate payers on the consultative committees, were amalgamated into the City of Moonee Valley, the Councillors were replaced by appointed Commissioners. The amalgamation of the relevant councils removed the need to consult with multiple local councils in a formal committee.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Essendon Airport management wrote to the newly appointed Chief Commissioner in February 1995 extending an invitation to himself, fellow commissioners and officers to visit Essendon and continue the line of communication and consultation that was in place with the previous councils.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        As a result of this invitation the Commissioners and officer level staff visited the Airport, which included a presentation and tour, in March 1995. Since that time the FAC advises that it has held a series of meetings with both commissioners and officers of Moonee Valley to discuss Airport related issues.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Additionally, both before and after the amalgamation process the FAC advises that it has continued to consult with representatives of the State Government with regard to activities on the Airport.

        While the Committee has not met on set occasions, the FAC considers that the co&amp;hyphen;operative arrangement established has enabled the discussion of issues.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        However, now that there are elected Councillors, the FAC has agreed to re&amp;hyphen;establish the committee formally, and has invited other nearby local councils to attend.

Any person, including the operator of an aircraft, who contravenes a direction given under CAR 92 may, if convicted of that offence, be subject to a fine of up to 25 penalty units ($2,500).

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        1 (a) Under the Actual Means Test (AMT), a student's rate of entitlement is assessed on the basis of a family's or independent student's and/or his or her partner's combined expenditure and savings in the year of study. The actual means of a family or independent student are then compared with a cut&amp;hyphen;off point known as the `benchmark'. The level of the benchmark depends on the individual circumstances of each applicant and their family, such as whether the student must live away from home to access education and/or the number of dependents in the family. If the actual means of an AMT family or independent student is below the benchmark applicable to the applicant's circumstances and the applicant meets all other Austudy eligibility requirements, the applicant will be eligible to receive an Austudy allowance.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        1 (b) In order to use actual means in the entitlement calculation it is necessary to convert it into a "taxable income equivalent" or what is known as the "Equivalent Family Income" (EFI). This is because actual means is equivalent only to the after&amp;hyphen;tax income of a PAYE family or independent student. The Department calculates the EFI of a family's or independent student's actual means by adjusting for Family Payment and adding back tax. The EFI determines the entitlement amount of an AMT client in the same way that the "Adjusted Family Income" determines the entitlement of a non&amp;hyphen;AMT client. The formula for calculating the after&amp;hyphen;tax income of a parent, partner or independent student is contained under Regulation 12M of the Austudy Regulations.

The Government subsequently reviewed this decision and decided that all students would gain independent status at age 25 if they did not qualify earlier on other grounds. It is estimated that this amendment will reduce the savings accrued from that Budget measure by about $4.5 million to $23.8 million in 1996&amp;hyphen;97.

The Office of Australian War Graves recommended that engraved bronze provided the best available solution. On the basis of its extensive experience of the bronze commemorative industry, the Office of Australian War Graves concluded that Arrow Bronze was the company most able to deliver the service required.

        (1) Pollution of the Georges River has had a devastating effect on the local oyster industry. This effect has manifested itself in two ways. Firstly, the negative public perception of the quality of NSW oysters has impacted on sales of oysters generally in the state, regardless of source. Sales of oysters from South Australia and Tasmania have thus also been affected. No quantitative data is available in regard to lost sales. Secondly, the Georges River industry infrastructure has in the past been a major
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         market for immature oysters from other estuaries. The loss of this market is worth around $1.5 million per annum.

        (2) Approximately 70 ha of leased area, or 45 leases, representing 12 oyster farming businesses have been affected by the pollution and removed from production. This area, had it still been in production, would have represented approximately $3.5 million worth of production value to the industry.
