         and associated bills is to provide a legislative framework to facilitate the move from statutory to new company structures and operational arrangements for the Australian red meat and livestock industry. The new arrangements are a major step forward, advancing industry towards management of its own affairs and, importantly, increasing efficiency and competitiveness in structuring this industry to continue as a world leader. This reform is focused on the future needs of industry.

         Background
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government is committed to improving the overall international competitiveness of all Australian industry. We are particularly keen to do so in our important agricultural industries. Unless we continue to improve productivity and cost efficiency throughout the food supply chain, we will lose ground against our international competitors and will not be able to maximise our national wealth, export opportunities and value enhancing potential.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The meat and livestock industry earns Australia, on average, about three billion export dollars per year. We need to set our targets for achievement at a higher level. As a single agricultural commodity export earner for Australia, red meat and livestock ranks third after wheat and wool. The potential of the industry is considerable. However, to
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          realise this potential, we need to deal with a range of inefficiencies, including high costs in the processing sector.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In 1994, the Industry Commission inquiry into the performance of the meat processing industry confirmed the importance of achieving and maintaining improvements and competitive efficiencies. No&amp;hyphen;one can contest these simple objectives. The commission found that Australia was not able to capitalise on its comparative production price advantage because the industry's processing sector was operating at significantly higher cost levels than the processing sectors of our major competitors.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The commission, at the time it put forward its report, found that Australia was losing market share in almost all its major export markets. It is not just these barriers in the processing sector which are impeding the meat industry's capacity to be competitive in world markets, but other costs associated with Australia's labour market, waterfront, quarantine and meat inspection processes are also being addressed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Honourable members will no doubt agree that we must have a vision for the future and that reform in these key areas is vital to the long&amp;hyphen;term viability of Australia's meat and livestock industry. This government is tackling these necessary reforms, and significant initiatives are already under way. For example, in the key area of industrial relations, the government has put the Workplace Relations Act in place and, as a consequence, award simplification test cases have been formulated for examination by a full bench of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. One of the test cases includes the red meat processing industry and the particular issue of the tally system. The outcome of these cases will have particular importance for the industry.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The response to the Industry Commission's 1994 report was the establishment of the Meat and Live&amp;hyphen;stock Industry Act 1995 which allowed for some institutional restructuring, particularly in relation to priorities and policy direction. The act was designed to commence the process of engaging industry to accept a greater role in self&amp;hyphen;determination. This bill, in effect, takes the major final steps towards em
         <break page="8846" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
          powerment by providing the industry with a structure which offers ownership and management of its own affairs.

         Review of current arrangements
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         By the end of 1995, it was clear that beef producers were suffering from the effects of a major drought and other significant international market factors which forced saleyard prices down to very low levels with consequential reduced returns to producers. Furthermore, other red meat producers and other sectors of the industry were also facing problems.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government instigated a review of the current institutional arrangements to determine whether early action might address at least some of the meat and livestock industry's problems. To that end, a joint industry and government meat and livestock industry reform task force was established in 1996. The task force reviewed the structural arrangements, the financial management and operational effectiveness of the present statutory bodies. It also pinpointed key industry policy and program issues for early action by government and industry.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The task force found that market and industry circumstances had changed since the establishment of the Meat and Live&amp;hyphen;stock Industry Act 1995. The task force found that the current statutory arrangements, which had worked well in the past, needed to be adjusted to deliver what industry required for the future. Prevailing and future commercial realities demand a structure which can deliver more flexible and focused commercial programs and operations. A sense of industry ownership and deeper involvement by levy&amp;hyphen;paying stakeholders is also required.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Working from these findings, the task force report offered a wide range of recommendations based on two underlying principles. The first was that the meat industry in Australia must move towards a more self&amp;hyphen;regulated, responsible and market driven operation. The second was that the role of government must move to one side, with a more clearly defined set of core functions for industry, while at the same time improving strategic alliances with and within industry for the delivery of these functions.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          The report also suggested that significant savings could be achieved by changing the current structures and levy&amp;hyphen; funded functions and making the provision of services fully contestable and transparent to the industry stakeholders. Finally, the report advanced proposals for government on joint industry&amp;hyphen;government policy and program actions. These proposals cover a broad range of joint actions that, in large part, cross state&amp;hyphen;Commonwealth responsibilities and those of industry. Many aspects of these proposals are already being addressed by Commonwealth and state agencies in direct consultations with industry.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          A number of recommendations were made on the need for uniformity in regulatory legislation and administration across Australia. A whole of government approach is essential to ensure an integrated and consistent basis for meat safety and other regulations and to provide a national regulatory underpinning for industry driven quality assurance and self&amp;hyphen;regulation schemes. I intend to continue to advance these issues with my colleagues on the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand, ARMCANZ.

          New arrangements
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The government decided on new arrangements following extensive consultations with all parts of Australia's vast and divergent meat and livestock industry. Full consensus has not been possible and is not possible. In an industry as diverse as this one, this is not surprising. I am pleased to say, however, there is broad agreement on major issues and each sector is in the process of implementing the changes sought. These included the need for a non&amp;hyphen;government, commercially based organisation; the necessity for industry to manage its own affairs; a more hard&amp;hyphen;headed approach to how levy&amp;hyphen;payer moneys are spent; and separately accountable beef and sheepmeat marketing and promotion divisions and separately accountable research and development divisions, within a commercially based organisation.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Another key area of agreement is that joint industry functions, such as research and development, food safety and quality, market
          <break page="8847" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           intelligence and market access issues, animal health and welfare, crisis management, eating quality standards, and Ausmeat should be dealt with cooperatively and collectively, and be adequately funded and serviced. The industry is now focused on their collective responsibility in scoping projects and programs within each of the joint function areas. This is fundamental and very important.

          The new structures will consist of a new producer&amp;hyphen;owned service delivery company, limited by guarantee under the Corporations Law, to provide a range of services to the industry, including professional guidance. The role of the company needs to be recognised, more so than the fact that it will be producer owned. The company will replace the statutory authorities of the Australian Meat and Live&amp;hyphen;stock Corporation (AMLC) and the Meat Research Corporation (MRC).
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The company will be accessible to all sectors within the industry in every sense, including service delivery, professional guidance and advice. All sectors will independently enter into contracts with the company for specific services. Importantly, the company will be a fully professional organisation which will be able to develop initiatives and proposals and advise industry and government on key issues. There will be separate companies, limited by guarantee, for the meat processors, livestock exporters and for the red meat advisory council, which I will discuss shortly.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There will be a memorandum of understanding between industry sectors and government to ensure cooperation in the overall interests of the red meat industry. There will be a commitment to the principles of a meat industry strategic plan and collective activities under genuine partnership arrangements.

             The legislative package consists of this, the principal bill, and sixteen associated bills. The principal bill makes provision for some staging by proclamation of implementation. This is critical because many of the mechanisms which will underpin effective and efficient industry management, the creation of representative corporations, the development of industry contractual arrangements and negotiations by industry leaders, must be completed before the current legislation is repealed and levies adjusted.

All sectors have assured me that they accept the decisions taken and that they will get behind them to ensure their effective implementation. Above all, industry has recognised that the new arrangements are offering a  necessary opportunity to bring about a fundamental cultural change. Rather than relying on government involvement and legislated instruments, the package offers industry control and ownership of its own destiny.

         The purpose of this bill is to impose charges payable by beef cattle producers on the export of cattle to fund the new industry service delivery company, disease eradication and animal health. The levy is only payable if levy under the Cattle Transaction Levy Act 1997 has not been paid and is not payable, or if cattle for export are held for times in excess of those reasonable to cover any quarantine requirements. This bill replaces the charges imposed by the Cattle Export Charge Act 1990. I commend the bill to the honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum.

         The purpose of this bill is to impose levies payable by producers on transactions involving sheep, lambs and goats. This bill will replace the levy imposed on the sheepmeat and goat industries by the Live&amp;hyphen;stock Slaughter Levy Act 1964, which provided for levies at the point of slaughter and was paid for by processors. The levies will be used to fund the new industry service delivery company, disease eradication and animal health for the sheepmeat, wool and goat industries.

         In the light of decisions taken for processors and live exporters to move to non&amp;hyphen;statutory levies, and for reasons of simplicity, equity and transparency, the Sheepmeat Council of Australia and the Goat Industry Council of Australia proposed a transaction levy be introduced in lieu of a slaughter `pass&amp;hyphen;back' levy. The Sheepmeat Council of Australia has demonstrated this is clearly the majority industry decision, including support of this approach by the Wool Council of Australia.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The transaction levy under this bill will closely parallel the existing transaction levy that has operated successfully in the cattle sector for many years. By aligning industry collection mechanisms with those already existing for cattle, meat industry levy collections are effectively standardised. It is this standardised approach that has assisted in gathering strong support.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill also makes provision for exemptions in such circumstances as are prescribed by regulation to provide the flexibility in the future to cater for industry decisions in relation to levy exemptions. Such regulations will be disallowable instruments and the industry, in seeking levy exemptions or concessions, will need to clearly demonstrate that the proposal has majority industry support and meets all the requirements of the government's levy principles.

          requested an exemption from levy for sheep, lambs and goats sold for $5.00 per head or less to cater for cases of genuine hardship.

I commend the bill to the honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum.

          Mr Deputy Speaker, this bill also makes some minor but important amendments to the National Health Act 1953 governing the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, PBS. Firstly, it introduces a system which will enable a private hospital or residential care facility to be reimbursed for the administration of some pharmaceutical benefits to its patients or residents from the institution's own stocks, in order to obviate the need for a prescription for the pharmaceutical benefits. The system will apply to pharmaceutical benefits determined by the minister to be appropriate for these arrangements and will come into operation on 1 May 1998.

          I was sitting here contemplating the terrible damage that has been  done by Sydney airport to the people in my electorate and to the people of my previous electorate of Grayndler. I was first elected to public life in 1971 as a councillor on Marrickville Council on a policy of reducing aircraft noise. It is appalling that 26 years later I am still in parliament talking about the atrocious effect that Sydney airport has on the people of my electorate.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Unfortunately, that airport was never really planned. When it became the principal airport for Sydney, no&amp;hyphen;one looked ahead to the day when air transport might be the usual way of moving people between Australian cities and overseas. Nobody looked ahead and nobody listened to the growing complaints of residents.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This lack of interest can largely be attributed to one factor: the residents of the suburbs around the airport were, for the most part, working class. They did not carry the weight of being in marginal seats. They did not have access to the media. They were not the rich and powerful. The airport kept growing and evolving and the planes kept getting bigger and noisier and, unfortunately, far more frequent.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The growth of a very centrally and conveniently located airport was in the interests of all who could afford to use the facility and in the interests of the owners of airlines and the bureaucrats responsible for building and maintaining the airport. This very powerful lobby group won hands down every time.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The airport only emerged as a major issue once the planes became of such a size and frequency that they started flying low over suburbs which were of upper or middle class. These people had access to the media and lived in marginal seats. Suddenly the noise
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          and pollution became an issue and suddenly governments started focusing on the problems caused by Sydney airport.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I do not expect miracles and the people of my electorate do not expect miracles. There is no expectation on my part or, I think, on the part of most of my constituents that Sydney airport will one day be packed up and taken away and that the site will be turned into parkland or a marina development. Indeed, many of my constituents work at the airport. It is a very significant local employer and should remain that way.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But what the people of my electorate do expect is a fair and just outcome for the noise and pollution that they have put up with over the years. I speak particularly of my current electorate and the residents of the suburbs of Earlwood and Kingsgrove, who are suffering under the new flight path regime instituted by the Howard government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I cannot gloss over the decision of my own party to construct the third runway at Kingsford Smith airport. I was vocal in my opposition to this decision as were a number of other Labor members whose electorates surrounded the airport. That decision, however, was carried out with the full support of the then opposition, the now government. The current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the former Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr Sharp, were the ones who were saying we should expand Sydney airport and we should do it quickly.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         They fully endorsed that course of action until it became obvious that the optimum flight paths for using parallel runways at Sydney airport would take the traffic over their electorates. What a turnaround! From espousing the virtues of a third runway and even being supportive of raising the airport curfew, the Liberal Party and its members of parliament went full circle.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         By the time the election came around we had the Prime Minister saying to the electors of Lowe, `If you vote for Mr Zammit'—the current member for Lowe—`you will have no more aircraft noise. If you want aircraft noise, you should keep on voting for Labor's candidate. If you want your property values to go up, you should vote for Mr Zammit.'
        </para>
        <break page="8859" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          Unfortunately, the people of Lowe took the Prime Minister on his word and they voted for Mr Zammit. They believed the Prime Minister when he said that there would be no planes flying over the electorate of Lowe under a Liberal government. They were sucked in. The Prime Minister has not stopped the planes flying over Lowe. But I do note that he has stopped them flying over his own electorate—self-interest will always out.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The Prime Minister has just moved the noise around so that more people suffer from the effects of the airport. Those suffering at the moment include the residents of Earlwood and Kingsgrove in my electorate who now have a great many flights skimming over their rooftops any time from 5.30 a.m. until midnight seven days a week.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Even more alarming to all those people living around Sydney airport was the decision to go back to basics over the location of a second Sydney airport. For over 20 years we have been looking at a site for a second Sydney airport. The Fraser government in the long distant past instituted the major airport needs of Sydney inquiry to look at where we should have an airport. Finally, after the Labor government made the disgraceful decision about the third runway they decided on Badgerys Creek as the preferred site for the second airport for Sydney as part of that package.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Without any forewarning after the last election, particularly to the voters of Hughes, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development suddenly dragged out a Holsworthy option and put it forward as a possible airport site. This sop to a group of Liberal Party supporters and the Lawrence Hargrave project delayed yet again any real progress towards a second Sydney airport. It was another red herring thrown into the ring to distract anyone who was interested from the real game—the game of getting a second airport into the Sydney region and thereby ameliorating the effects of aircraft noise and pollution on the people of the inner west and south-west of Sydney.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Finally, a few weeks ago the government came out and confirmed what everybody already knew—Holsworthy was a stupid
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           proposition and Badgerys Creek was the only viable site left in the Sydney region for a second Sydney airport. This was the position we had come to in the Labor Party many years earlier. Badgerys Creek will provide a solution for the increasing problems with Kingsford Smith airport that is just and fair to all Sydneysiders. It will also, like Kingsford Smith, generate a great deal of employment where it is needed out in the western suburbs.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          But in the same way that justice delayed is justice denied, the delaying of the construction of Badgerys Creek will deny the people of my electorate and those surrounding Sydney airport any hope of an improved quality of life or even a halt to the deterioration of their current quality of life.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          While we await a longer term solution, Kingsford Smith should be managed to ensure that the least possible noise and pollution to the fewest number of people is achieved. One key aspect of such a management plan is to limit the number of take-offs and landings to ensure that there is not continued growth at Sydney airport.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The plan put forward in the  Sydney Airport Demand Management Bill 1997  simply revisits the proposals in the Sydney Airport (Regulation of Movements) Bill 1996, which was put forward in this House last year by my colleague the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) and me. The member for Grayndler and I proposed a cap on aircraft movements of 80 movements an hour into and out of Kingsford Smith airport. This would hold traffic at Sydney airport at around its current levels.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Many of course would tell you that such a cap is not necessary—those people who advocated the third runway and those people who advocated lifting the curfew. They believe that the airport should be utilised to its limit—and that limit is being talked as being up to as many as 120 movements an hour, two movements a minute, one movement every 30 seconds. They also suggest the lifting of the curfew. The more bizarre of them even suggest a fourth runway.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          These same people are quick to advocate no second airport for Sydney. They seem convinced that, if they keep ignoring the prob
          <break page="8860" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
           lems associated with Kingsford Smith airport, these problems will go away. They are happy to see the difficulty experienced by those in the inner west exacerbated by increasing the use of this site, which I might say is one of the smallest site areas of any large international airport in the world.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Without some artificial limit being placed on the number of aircraft movements, there will be no pressure to address the real aviation needs of the Sydney region. Already we have seen the projections passed that were made some five years ago about when Sydney airport would saturate. With the exponential growth that you are seeing in this country—both international tourism into and out of Australia, and the attitude of Australians of moving around the country via aircraft rather than via cars, buses and trains as people used to do—there is going to be more and more demand on Sydney airport. The deregulation of the airline industry put in place by the previous Labor government has seen aircraft fares reduce and come within the range of ordinary working people. This has seen the use of aircraft skyrocket.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Yet another set of short&amp;hyphen;term fixes would be put in place if the people who have the attitude that Sydney should get bigger and bigger are the ones who win. There is a real danger with the approach to the 2000 Olympics—when the facilities at Sydney airport will be pushed to the absolute limit—that people will say, `We have coped with Olympics. Let's leave it there and let's do nothing.' If the government had shown some leadership on this issue rather than dangling the Holsworthy red herring, which is something that amazed everyone, we would have seen a start on the facilities at Badgerys Creek and probably seen them in place to deal with some of the overload in the year 2000. But we saw nothing. We saw the government cause 18 months of delay once again.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          On behalf of my constituents, the people of Watson, I support this legislation wholeheartedly. I think the government should have been a little bit more generous and dealt with the legislation of the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) and me last year, or indeed done what the minister said he would, which was
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           introduce legislation last year to do just this. But better late than never. This legislation will go some way to assisting the residents of the electorate of Watson, and particularly those of the suburbs of Earlwood and Kingsgrove, to at least maintain some standard of comfort rather than have it further eroded.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          But the government should not stop here. The government should announce that it will be starting work on a second airport at Badgerys Creek immediately. If the government was fair dinkum it would provide an injection of funds from the Federation Fund to kick&amp;hyphen;start this project and thus assure the people of Sydney an aviation infrastructure capable of taking them into the 21st century and reassure the people of my electorate their problems will not continue to escalate. If the government has money available to build a railway from Adelaide to Darwin then surely there should be money for a genuine infrastructure program which will be used and of benefit to Australia rather than a bit of cargo cult for the voters in the Northern Territory.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Enough is enough! The government must get on with building Sydney's second airport. This legislation goes some way to at least making that a more urgent matter because, by capping the movements at Sydney, we will ensure that people have to focus on the future rather than continuing to have ad hoc decisions at Sydney which will cause that airport to get bigger, noisier and nastier. It would be stupid, as I said earlier, for any member who represents the airport to say that it should be closed. It is a very significant generator of work for the people of my electorate and I have never argued that Sydney airport should be closed. We should tame this beast, and we should tame it now, but we should ensure also that the work that it provides stays there for the people who live around it.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I also think that those people out in the western suburbs who were originally proponents of Badgerys Creek, and have now all of a sudden become opponents of it, should start to think about the people that they represent who need jobs, as well as the nimby approach, because as the Mayor of Liverpool has said, Badgerys Creek airport will become the single most significant generator of jobs
          <break page="8861" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           in the western suburbs of Sydney that we have seen in the last 50 years. It will provide work and it will provide work for ordinary working&amp;hyphen;class people, which is what is needed out in the western suburbs.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          But we must tame Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith. This legislation goes some way to doing it. I commend the government for that, but I condemn the government for taking so long to get to this piece of legislation. I condemn the government for not starting on Badgerys Creek yet. By condemning the current government I also do not give any comfort to my colleagues who held this project up either. The previous Labor government was wrong in building the third runway. The previous Labor government was wrong in not getting a start on Badgerys Creek, although it did make the final decision to build the airport, and it did acquire the land. The current government has sold a large site adjacent to the airport which will make it very difficult to keep up with some of the plans that should occur at Badgerys Creek.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          To conclude my remarks, this legislation will at least say to the people of my electorate that the beast has been tamed a little, and there will be some certainty put back into their lives. I could make some remarks about the government's phoney program of sharing the noise, but I do not think that is all that constructive.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I will just complete my remarks by picking up on a matter regarding the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit), who the government has sold out with great distinction. The member for Lowe, in his remarks, mentioned a stunt he got up to by writing to all the local councils and members about his press release. All I will say to the member for Lowe is: stop the stunts, get out there and try to exercise some influence on your government. You got elected on the phoney promise of no planes over Lowe. When there are no planes over Lowe, then he can hold his head up high. He has been sold out by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), he has sold out his own people and all he can get up to is stunts. I think that probably shows about the level of the member for Lowe.

          delivers on another commitment that has been made by the coalition. Certainly we accept the support that we have been receiving from members of the opposition, although I noted there has been a little bit of a division in the opposition camp with regard to the development of Badgerys Creek. I acknowledge the contribution of the member for Watson (Mr McLeay) in support of that option and would say in defence of the government's actions on the EIS process that at least we did that.

         We went through that rigorous EIS process with Holsworthy to make sure that the decision to exclude it was a justifiable decision and to make sure that the decision on Sydney's second airport was justified on solid grounds. We can move forward now to the completion of that process with Badgerys Creek. In listening to the debate last night, I noted that there is still some division between some members of the opposition with regard to the proposal to build Sydney's second airport at Badgerys Creek, but I note the very positive comments of the member for Watson.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill that we are debating is a delivery of a coalition commitment. It provides certainty for operators. Everybody knows what is going on. It establishes a maximum limit on aircraft movements at KSA to 80 movements per hour while introducing a slot management system. I suppose in discussing these matters everybody has their own individual concerns and most of them are born out of representing their constituencies. The opposition speakers we have been listening to obviously have strong feelings one way or the other. We know that the development and management of the KSA airport has been a very vexed issue for the Labor Party and the seats around it. We heard the member for Watson say that he never agreed with the establishment of the parallel runway.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As a representative of regional Australia I, too, was keen to see in this slot management system an acknowledgment of the important role that regional airlines play in New South Wales. I understand that they have been given
         <break page="8862" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          a regional airline slot pool, which has been introduced in this bill as well.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The opposition are complaining about the time it has taken the government to make more progress or to get the development of a second Sydney airport started. The Labor Party in government had 13 years to tackle this problem. They could not sort it out internally. It is public knowledge that there are concerns from some of the members in the government about the EIS process with Holsworthy, but the decision was taken as soon as the results of the EIS were out.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government promised to open the east-west runway if elected to government. We have done that. The government promised a more equitable distribution of the aircraft noise problem. We have done that. The government promised a review of the flight paths for Mascot airport, and we have done that. In opposition the coalition was committed to capping aircraft movements to 80 per hour and in government the coalition is implementing this promise. Eighty movements an hour equates to approximately 500,000 movements per year. This is in excess of Sydney's 353,000 movement limit which is specified in the long-term operating plan.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Under Labor, 50 per cent of the movements were over the suburbs north of the airport. These residents never got a break at all. The coalition has already cut these movements by 33 per cent. The target is to cut it further to around 17 per cent. Under the coalition, 17 per cent of aircraft movements will be to the north, 15 per cent to the west, 13 per cent to the east and 55 per cent will be to the south and over water.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What is being done here is exactly what we set out to do—that is, to create a more equitable situation not only for the movement of aircraft in and out of KSA but also for the distribution of noise. We are a government that has inherited a problem that we are dealing with. To be criticised for not dealing with it more expeditiously, I think, is a bit disingenuous of the opposition. There has been positive action to deal with the surrounding suburbs around KSA in an equitable way. We have put those measures in place.

          The slot system is the means by which the cap can be monitored. The implementation of the slot system will be beneficial to all users of the airport. It is designed to alleviate congestion in a non-discriminatory way. While the bill sets out the general framework for the slot system the detail, to be determined by the slot manager, will be contained in a disallowable instrument. The slot system will be fully operative by March 1998. The slot system is consistent with worldwide practice.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The slot management system is used at approximately 130 airports around the world. The system being implemented in Australia is based on the IATA model with some modifications that reflect the particular conditions that exist at KSA—for instance, as I alluded to earlier, protection for regional services, better access to slots for new entrants, and the introduction of compliance mechanisms. They are all important elements of what we are attempting to achieve here, and I think it should be recognised. It is important to recognise the right of those regional operators to also have access to KSA. All those commuters have an expectation and a right of quick access to the business community in Sydney and should not be penalised because of their smaller aircraft. It is an important element of this bill.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The slot system forces airlines to move away from cluster scheduling where flights are scheduled to arrive and depart and are beyond the capacity of the airport to support. Cluster scheduling can be claimed therefore, particularly at peak times, to be the root cause of the delays experienced at KSA, which is the flip side of the problems. It has been criticised over the years for the low number of hourly movements in comparison to international standards.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The 80 movements per hour is not presently being met at KSA. There will be opportunities for new entrants to obtain slots during all operational hours. This includes peak times. There is a general expectation that there will be a degree of competition for any slots available during peak periods. Potential new entrants will have equal access with their established competitors on a fifty-fifty split.
          <break page="8863" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           KSA is one of the fairest airports around the world in this area and is consistent with a deregulated aviation industry. At most, other airport incumbents get first go at the slots available.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The bill establishes a slot manager, which is envisaged to be a company formed by Sydney airport and Australian airlines or operators using the airport, which will administer the allocation and compliance. As I have already noted, special arrangements are going to be put in place by the government for regional airlines. We are committed to providing services to regional New South Wales.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The needs of regional New South Wales will be preserved by the use of ring fencing whereby KSA regional airline services have their own slot pool. Existing regional services will be guaranteed a regional slot. These slots cannot be sold or swapped to interstate or international services. So that is locking in the opportunity for continuity of regional services in and out of KSA so they do not get elbowed out, so to speak, by the larger operators.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It would be difficult to put a cap on aircraft movements without some sort of effective compliance mechanism to ensure that it was not abused or misused in other ways. This is the crucial element of the slot management system. The aim is to promote efficient scheduling performance. There will be steep fines for non-compliance. Delays at KSA will be now more open to scrutiny as the slot system introduces a clear set of criteria for flight movements. The maximum penalties are fairly hefty—for a no&amp;hyphen;slot movement and an off&amp;hyphen;slot movement, the penalty is $220,000 and $110,000 respectively.
         </para>

I remember a number of meetings that Labor members from the western suburbs of Sydney had during 1995. There was complete agreement that, when we went into the next election—that is, the 1996 election—the three studies that we had promised would be completed, the flight paths would be available, there would be a high degree of community consultation and every citizen would know exactly how that airport would actually affect them. History shows of course that this was

Also in the EIS are the figures that show, under the various options, the dramatic decrease in the value of houses to people.

          bill is symptomatic of the lack of leadership from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that we have seen on a range of issues. Ever since the coalition came to government, it has been delaying action on the Sydney airport problem. Despite Holsworthy being a clearly unsuitable site—coming second last in the last EIS process—the government set up a process so as to delay the decision about the second Sydney airport for yet another year.

         Despite clear election promises to introduce a cap of 80 movements an hour, the government did not raise the issue until this month, 18 months into office. It took a private member's bill from the opposition to put this issue on the agenda. For a whole year, the government has tried to avoid having a debate on my private member's bill before this House. Its delaying tactics take a toll not only on the credibility of this government but in more real ways on the people who have to live under Sydney airport's flight path. These people have been kept waiting over this period by this government's indecision.

         I first made the demand for a cap in my private member's bill, the Sydney Airport (Regulation of Movements) Bill 1996, which was introduced and had its first reading on 4 November 1996. The second reading was on 18 November. After the government failed to respond to this challenge and decided to delay the decision, I made repeated calls for the cap, including in the grievance debate on 10 February 1997 and in a speech concerning the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997 on 18 March 1997. On 19 June 1997, the member for Watson and I tried to suspend standing orders to bring on the debate regarding the Sydney Airport (Regulation of Movements) Bill. I raised the issue again in the debate on the  Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997  on 26 June 1997.

         Why were we so concerned about pursuing this? Because Kingsford Smith airport accounts for 49 per cent of all passenger traffic in Australia, and this level of passenger traffic is on the increase. In 1965&amp;hyphen;66, 2.6 million passengers passed through this airport; in 1995&amp;hyphen;96, 20.3 million passengers passed through the same airport. This figure is expected to double by the year 2009, with an

          estimated 40.4 million passengers expected to pass through Sydney.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Currently, residents who live around Kingsford Smith airport experience up to 753 aircraft movements per day. By 1999&amp;hyphen;2000, they will have to experience an average of 866 aircraft movements per day. Added to this, as we all know, Sydney airport—and my electorate—is surrounded by the most densely populated urban area of Australia. A recent Airservices Australia report stated that the number of people living in the 20 ANEF contour range has increased from 68,380 to 116,860. That is over 100,000 people per day putting up with a substantial level of aircraft noise. By and large they are not the people on the far North Shore of Sydney, I might remind my Labor colleagues; by and large they are working people in inner city electorates who have voted Labor their whole lives. That is why we need a solution to this issue.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         No doubt aircraft noise will continue to increase until a second Sydney airport in the Sydney basin—which is the only place it can be—is built. Kingsford Smith airport, of course, is continuing to expand. This government's decision to delay the building of the second international airport has also been taken in a period when they have supported the expansion of international facilities at Kingsford Smith airport. Ironically, the decision to expand KSA has been the only decision the government has made with regard to the airport issue that has not involved delaying tactics.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         On 19 June 1997, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works announced that the international terminal at KSA should be upgraded at a cost of $350 million. On 29 August 1997, Senator Robert Hill, Minister for the Environment, concluded that an EIS for the expansion of the international terminal at Kingsford Smith airport was not required. So I say to my colleagues on both sides of the House: let us not have any of this nonsense about people being concerned about people around the inner city and not being concerned with Sydney West; we are getting an expansion of facilities and an expansion of flights without an EIS. Interestingly, however, the
         <break page="8868" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Public Works Committee noted in their final recommendation that:

        <para first-indent="16">
         The committee also noted that, because no decision had yet been made on the location of a second Sydney airport, the expansion of KSA had to occur. Why has a decision not been made about the second Sydney airport, despite the commitment of the government, prior to the election, to build a second Sydney airport, despite the fact that there was an obvious growing need for a second Sydney airport and despite the fact that the previous Labor government had already allocated $306 million for airport development at Badgerys Creek, $21 million for a control tower and firefighting services, $23 million for environmental safeguards, $480 million for roads, $17 million for a rail corridor and had already spent $152 million on land acquisitions around Badgerys Creek?

        <para first-indent="16">
         Despite all this, what we had was a delay in the EIS process because of the Holsworthy fiasco. That delay has meant an expansion at Sydney airport. We all know that Holsworthy was never seriously a contender. It had already been considered and knocked over. However, the government proceeded with the sham and told us all it considered Holsworthy a potential site. The government was becoming famous for its delaying tactics when, in the budget of 20 August 1996, it allocated $21 million for the EIS for the Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy second airport options.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When the draft EIS was released, of course we all knew that Holsworthy had been excluded, but at a cost of delay to the second Sydney airport, at a cost of an ever increasing expansion at Sydney airport and at a cost of millions of dollars to the taxpayer. We are now back at the point at which we were in March 1996. All this has achieved is the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          alienation of thousands of people in south&amp;hyphen;western Sydney around Holsworthy airport. How can we trust this government's commitments to solving the problem at Kingsford Smith airport when the only real, concrete action we see is the expansion of facilities at Kingsford Smith airport?

         The other issues which have come before the Sydney Airport Community Forum—chaired by the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey)—unfortunately have also been ignored by this government. We have seen the movement of the threshold on the third runway where a clear decision by the Sydney Airport Community Forum was knocked over by the previous Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the member for Hume (Mr Sharp).

        <para first-indent="16">
         We have seen the long&amp;hyphen;term operating plan proceed. I do not argue that everything in the long&amp;hyphen;term operating plan is bad, because clearly it is not. Clearly, aircraft noise has been an ever increasing problem over decades at Sydney airport, and clearly no government, Labor or conservative, can say it has a proud record on these issues, because I do not believe any of them have.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let me say that the main problem I see with the long&amp;hyphen;term operating plan is the number of take-offs to the north, which it clearly favours, rather than take-offs to the south. They are clearly favoured for one reason and one reason only: if a plane takes off to the north, it can veer to the west all over the western parts of my electorate, the Ashfield municipality, and all over the electorate of Lowe whereas if it lands from the north it has to fly over the electorate of Bennelong. It seems to me that the priority of this government has been to protect the residents of the North Shore of Sydney at the expense of the residents to the immediate north of the airport.

         There have been a number of other issues brought up by the Sydney Airport Community Forum which are yet to be addressed. There is the issue of those people closest to the airport. I say to the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson), who spoke last night about the terrible noise that people in Turramurra suffer, that those same planes are a hell of a lot
         <break page="8869" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          lower when they are over Sydenham than when they are over Turramurra. And hearing is not related to income. People who cannot afford to live at Turramurra—they would probably like to but have to live in weatherboard houses in Sydenham—do not have different hearing from the people in Turramurra. They are the same planes; they are just 10 times noisier when they are over the residents of Sydenham and St Peters.

         The member for North Sydney and others to their credit have visited Sydenham and shown a genuine sympathy for the residents around the Sydenham&amp;hyphen;St Peters area. I congratulate the member for North Sydney and thank him for his efforts on behalf of those residents which I believe have been very genuine. But the fact is that the residents of Sydenham are still waiting for two major questions to be answered. They are waiting to hear about the issue of those people who are living in weatherboard houses which cannot be insulated. They live in weatherboard houses because they are living in the suburb with probably the lowest income in Sydney. The average income is certainly a lot lower than the electorates of Prospect or Greenway. They have the cheapest houses in Sydenham.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I can assure honourable members that in the inner west housing boom that is going on prices are not increasing in Sydenham and St Peters. What is happening is that the houses cannot be insulated and they are just being left as a result of the government's failure to make a decision. The government should make a decision regarding those residences. We have a buy&amp;hyphen;out program that has been approved unanimously by the Sydney Airport Community Forum and those residents deserve certainty.

If you acquire a whole suburb of 151 houses, you knock them over literally—demolish the houses—and you are left with a park, it is not surprising that the newsagent,

I will even give them TA—which the government is concerned about—out of my own pocket to live there for a week and argue that those houses should not have been demolished and that people should not have been given compensation and allowed to live in first world conditions.

To give one figure from the draft EIS, the maximum number of people who will be living in the 20 ANEC range around Badgerys Creek is 3,000. There are over 120,000 people around Sydney airport.

         The one thing that needs to be remembered in this debate is that we went to the last election with a policy of a cap of 80 movements per hour and, as with every election promise that we have made in relation to Sydney airport, we have kept to it. We have developed an agreed means with industry about how to give effect to that cap of 80 movements per hour. With the greatest respect to the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese), who was playing catch&amp;hyphen;up politics with his private member's bill, I suspect that it might actually have been a bit of a preselection ploy—that is what we reckon on this side of the House—that he needed to be seen to be doing something.

So he had a bit of paper, which was our election policy, and he said, `Right. I've got that through. I'll put it on the table and I'll walk away.' Where was the mechanism? Nowhere at all. He avoided the hard issue: the mechanism for the implementation. It was catch&amp;hyphen;up politics. He took our election campaign policy but did not have the means or the wherewithal to put in place the mechanism for the implementation. At the end of the day, that meant that it was a first come first serve basis, which was going to be absolutely inappropriate and disastrous for the Sydney airport.

          The point to remember about our long&amp;hyphen;term operating plan for Sydney is that it meets our commitment to maximise flights over water and non&amp;hyphen;residential land and to more equitably share the noise generated by the airport. It is a fair policy that has been implemented by this government. Indeed, the assertion that there would be no flights over Bennelong was just a bit more cheapjack politics from those on the other side. The member for Grayndler knows that it is not true. It was absolutely untrue, a bit of a gee&amp;hyphen;up to keep the pot boiling but with no basis at all. Indeed, this plan is about sharing aircraft noise and about getting away from the funnelling across specific residential areas that was done by the previous government.

          The targets for the plan should be known by those opposite. They made no reference to it. They wanted to avoid the issue. They did not want to make the acknowledgments. The targets for the plan are 55 per cent of movements to the south—basically Botany Bay—17 per cent to the north, 15 per cent to the west and 13 per cent to the east. It is sharing the noise. But what did the Labor Party have? They had over 50 per cent of movements over suburbs north of the airport. As the member for Grayndler knows acutely, the residents north of the airport never got a break under the Labor Party. We have already cut it to 33 per cent and, as he well knows, our target is to cut it to 17 per cent.

           It is just extraordinary. We had the member for Melbourne pleading the case for the people of Sydenham: `I have been there, and I have heard it, and I have seen it.' Do you know who caused it? The Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party destroyed Sydenham, and here we have the shadow minister crying crocodile tears for the people of Sydenham. He went on to criticise the long-term operating plan, which is providing relief for the very people that he was talking about.

         At the heart of our attitude to the bill before the House today is the desire to make native title processes more certain, to make the act

          more workable, to make sure that the act is fair, and to make sure that the act is predictable. They are the hallmarks that the Leader of the Opposition has set down for our consideration of this bill. We want to see a native title process which is more certain, fair and workable.

         In my own case, I take part in this debate as a member of the parliament when the Native Title Act 1993 was passed by this House; as a Western Australian whose state, in practical terms, is the state most affected by the provisions of the Native Title Act; and as the shadow minister for resources and energy.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The starting point for this debate is the Mabo No. 2 decision of the High Court of June 1992. The essential element of that decision by the High Court was that native title was recognised as a common law property right—a legal property right. That raised fundamental property and constitutional questions for the parliament to respond to. The subsequent High Court decision in the Wik case, which made the point that native title is not extinguished by pastoral leases, has seen this set of amendments come to the House. The key starting point is native title being recognised by the High Court as a fundamental property right.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the difficulties that the then government and this parliament faced in 1993 was that this recognition came a couple of hundred years too late. In comparable jurisdictions such as the United States of America, Canada and New Zealand, the notion of a native title property right had been recognised much earlier. What this parliament and the previous government had to do was to grapple with the insertion of a legal property right into our property law framework 200 years after the event, and try to grapple with that in a much more compressed timetable.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The High Court also made the point in the Mabo case that, whilst it was open for native title to be extinguished by valid government activity with an intention to so extinguish, there was no right of compensation at common law. However, any extinguishment had to be consistent with the Racial Discrimi
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          nation Act. That was a view that the High Court took by a majority of six to one.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is interesting to make the point that it was only by a four to three majority that the High Court in Mabo No. 2 said that compensation was not payable for any extinguishment of native title from inception. In other words, the High Court was one vote away from saying that native title, however so extinguished from the first moment of European settlement in this place, was compensatable. That is an important point which I will come to subsequently.

         So what the parliament had to do then and what the parliament has to do now is to work through a fundamental property right. There is one of two ways that the parliament or a government can go: either you can say, `Let us leave it to the courts,' or you can say, `Let us try to find some statutory process to manage this fundamental property right.' That was the attitude that the previous government took and that saw the enactment of the Native Title Act of 1993 through this parliament.

         If this parliament wants to legislate, this parliament can legislate only if it finds a valid head of power. In this area, given that until the decision of the High Court in Mabo No. 2 property rights had effectively been managed by state and territory jurisdictions, you need to find a Commonwealth head of power. There are only two Commonwealth heads of power that this parliament can resort to in this matter: the external affairs power and the race power as a consequence of the referendum change in 1967.

         So what are the limitations that the parliament then and the parliament now finds upon itself? It is dealing with a fundamental property right. It has got limited Commonwealth power and, therefore, constitutional limitations and implications. And, in a practical sense, it has to find a statutory regime which is attractive enough to the parties concerned to use it, because it remains open to any party to go to the courts to pursue a common law claim for native title.

         The Native Title Act of 1993 has seen some good outcomes and some bad outcomes. I think the best outcome is the Yandicoogina agreement entered into between Hamersley Iron, a company operating in the north-west of Western Australia, and three local Aboriginal tribal groups who formed a corporation, the Gumala Aboriginal Corporation, to represent them. The end result of the agreement between Hamersley Iron and the Aboriginal communities represented by that corporation sees a $705 million iron ore development go ahead, a maximum $60 million royalty stream to that Aboriginal community and, most importantly, commitments to ensure that the investment which goes to that Aboriginal community is an investment by way of jobs, by way of training, by way of community infrastructure and by way of improvements in education.

         I think that is the best example of a regional agreement that we have. On the other hand, you have the worst aspect of the Native Title Act of 1993, which has seen only one out of 600 claims proceed through the tribunal. In reference to a visit that I and the Leader of the Opposition made recently to Kalgoorlie, the Leader of the Opposition made the point in his speech that Kalgoorlie is perhaps the worst example where we see multiple claims, overlapping claims and an uncertain process.

If you have a look at what the High Court has recently said on compensation for property law entitlements, and a case that it has currently before it, it is clear that the High Court is in a mood to view very seriously the extinguishment of property law entitlements and to apply a very rigorous test so far as compensation is concerned.

          It does give me a great deal of pleasure to rise this afternoon to discuss this very important piece of reforming legislation. The amendments will fix the diabolical mess left by the Labor Party in relation to the state of the land tenure system in this country. We all know that in 1992 the High Court ruled in the landmark Mabo case that indigenous Australians' native title to land has always existed under common law. The High Court declared that native title held by indigenous people may survive, regardless of new laws enacted by a colonising government. Of course, the Mabo case specifically related to the Murray Islands. However, the court noted that common law is the same across Australia and, therefore, native title may still exist on the mainland as well.

          This judgment by the High Court threw all existing land tenure systems in Australia into total disarray. Confusion reigned as to the status of leases held by pastoralists, miners and indigenous people, and there was concern about the ruling's impact on future development and access. The High Court's Mabo ruling dictated that the parliament issue an urgent and comprehensive legislative response in order to restore certainty. The Labor government acted when it introduced the Native Title Act in 1993, the most ill-conceived piece of legislation I think Australia has ever seen.

Those who are tasked with these responsibilities by government—the Biological Diversity Advisory Council and the Law Reform Commission—are having their work suppressed, and the Australian community is prevented from hearing what they are entitled to have put before them so they may put their views on these important public matters.

          The government is not prepared to deal with matters that we in opposition have been talking about for a long time, which they have been criticising as coming from a partial commentator, whereas the fact is the impartial commentators who would otherwise have spoken have had their mouths silenced, quite improperly, by this government in a way which smacks of cover&amp;hyphen;up. Indeed, particularly given the pecuniary interests of certain frontbench members of this government, it almost suggests the smell of corruption.

         In 1992 the Mabo decision was brought down by the High Court and they went on to say that native title may exist on mainland Australia. In December 1996, the High Court brought down what is known as the Wik decision whereby they said that native title may exist on pastoral leases, and that was a surprise to everybody. Even the present opposition did not factor that into their original native title bill.

         Up until now there has been an expectation out there—especially amongst Aboriginal people—that native title, including on pastoral leases, virtually equates to ownership. It does not, of course. But as a result of this the Aboriginal industry has hurled money at making claim after ridiculous claim. There has been no limit on the size of the claim and who may be registered. We have overlapping claims. One poor fellow with a mining lease in Western Australia has 26 overlapping claims on his mining lease.

Six hundred and twelve claims have been registered, over $100 million in legal fees has been wasted and we still do not have one square centimetre of native title land owned by Aboriginal people in Australia. In fact, there has only been one of the 612 claims resolved and that was for a few acres of land at Crescent Head on the North Coast of New South Wales and that was immediately sold back to the people who occupy the land.

But they have gone totally berserk on paying lawyers to chase frivolous native title claims. The Cape York Land Council is spending in excess of $12 million doing that now. The Kimberley Land Council has spent in excess of $12 million. Even in New South Wales, up to 30 June this year, the New South Wales Land Council has spent $4,433,475, including $2 million last year—a total waste of money in the main.

         The red soil country around Brewarrina, Bourke and Wanaaring in my electorate where claims have been put in is selling for an average of $8 an acre.

Even if native title were granted—and it will not be on the claims that have been put in so far—all they can do is go onto the land and hold a corroboree, which nobody is interested in doing in New South Wales, throw a line in the Darling River to fish or spear a goanna or something like that. Whereas if the money had been spent to purchase the land like every other Australian, they could own the land outright. Money is being wasted.

         There is a myth afoot in this country that Aboriginal people own little or no land. The 1996 census showed that there are 353,000 Aborigines in Australia—that is, 2 per cent of the population—and they owned 15.3 per cent of the land mass or 117 million hectares of

         On top of this there is a certain amount of private land ownership. They own 341 properties and the last 200 that were purchased had an average value of $454,000 for the land alone. For example, that alone is more than double the land value of the property that I own. So we are not talking about insubstantial properties.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In addition to all this, the New South Wales government puts aside 7&amp;half; per cent of land tax collected to purchase properties. On those properties they also own all mineral rights, except for gold and silver, as well as oil and coal, and they get royalties from any mining conducted on those properties. There is also the indigenous land fund which is worth $1,289 million in 1994-95 dollar terms. The money put aside from that alone would purchase 100 farms for Aboriginal people every year forever—farms worth twice the value of my own property, for example. There have been other sources of funding. For example, the Northern Territory mining royalties to Aboriginal people now amount to more than $350 million.

         My point on this bill is that the High Court decision was supposed to deliver something beneficial to Aboriginal people. So far it has delivered virtually nothing—certainly nothing on mainland Australia. In fact, it has wasted many millions of dollars. It has become an instrument of divisiveness. If you look at it objectively, it has become a curse to Aboriginal people in diverting these large sums of money to chasing ephemeral rainbows.

         I want to talk about pastoral leases, particularly those in New South Wales. The High Court said in the Wik decision that unless you have exclusive possession on leasehold land then native title may exist on leasehold land. This has caused much angst in New South Wales, but there has been a total misunderstanding of what the High Court said by both sides of the argument—Aboriginal on one side and pastoralists on the other.

         The New South Wales Farmers Association has attacked the coalition quite unfairly, I think, in calling us `spineless, gutless, shallow' and just about every other colourful adjective that you can think of. I believe that they have whipped some people into an unnecessary frenzy on this. They have been asking for the grazing leases in the Western Division of New South Wales to be included in the schedule. They have done that almost to the exclusion of all other debate about the bill.

        <para first-indent="16">
         There are a couple of points I would make. The schedule never existed until the coalition invented it, and it is attached to this bill. Of course, if the grazing leases are listed in the schedule, there is the belief that this makes them exempt from native title claims. That is true only if all sides of the debate accept that they should be in the schedule for proper reasons.

          Wales government's legal advice on two occasions said that they should not be scheduled. The Commonwealth took its own legal advice from Professor Butt, an expert in property law who works in the law department at the University of Sydney, and Grahame Tanna, who is the Principal Solicitor of the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's Department.

         We asked the New South Wales Farmers Association to get some legal opinion on this. They have eventually come before us with four opinions, but those four opinions have some doubt about them. For example, the first opinion from David Bennett QC said in the conclusion:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In these circumstances it is simply not possible to express with anything resembling certainty what view the High Court will take in relation to leases under the Western Lands Act.

         Further on in his conclusion, when talking about granting exclusive possession, he said:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . the prospects of the High Court taking that view must be regarded as fairly evenly balanced.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         The second opinion that they obtained was from Peter McEwen QC. Regarding the conclusions he had come to, he said:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         I have done so on the basis of relatively limited information.

         The third opinion they put to us was from Dennis Rose QC who said that the leases should be scheduled but the arguments he seemed to use were the very arguments that were rejected by the High Court majority judges in the Wik decision. To some extent, that is also valid for Sek Hume's opinion, who was the fourth QC that the New South Wales Farmers Association put before us.

         On balance, with all this conflicting legal advice, it would have been quite silly for us
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          to schedule those leases, as the New South Wales Farmers Association wanted. I can understand and appreciate why they would want them scheduled. However, to do so would have destroyed the credibility of the schedule. It would have invited the other states who did not try this on to also have their leases which were excluded from the schedule included, and that would have collapsed the schedule. You may as well have taken out your Tippex, whited out whatever it was that was listed there and written in `Australia', if that was the attitude.

         Also, it would have given the Labor Party a classic case to vote against everything in the Senate. Even if it had passed the Senate—which it would not have—you would have immediately had a High Court challenge on the validity of the schedule. That would have delayed getting certainty into Western Division pastoral leases for many months, which is against the good interests of the people who occupy grazing leases in the Western Division who have been subject, in many cases, to a great degree of anguish and uncertainty.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The New South Wales Farmers Association have said that we are going to need 5,000 test cases in the Western Division to resolve this. I believe that that is a gross exaggeration and not true. They have also said that we will see paralysis of agricultural production. Again, I do not believe that is true at all. They have said that, if it can be shown that the grazing leases should be added to the schedule later on, it cannot be done. Again, I believe that is not true. If it is shown that grazing leases do extinguish native title, as I believe many of them would, then they can be added to the schedule later on.

        <para first-indent="16">
         They have also used a Queensland comparison, saying that Queensland leases were included on the schedule where New South Wales comparable leases were not. Again, that is not quite correct. The small number of grazing homestead perpetual leases—small in area; I think it amounts to about 12.7 per cent of the state—are quite different from Western Division grazing leases. They have the right to apply to freehold the leases. They have the right to turn them into cultivation leases
         <break page="8890" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          without permission. Their rents are calculated on the unimproved capital value instead of the livestock carrying capacity and so on. They are quite different leases from New South Wales grazing leases.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Having said all that about the schedule—because it has been such a contentious area—I do say that the bill, which is based on the 10&amp;hyphen;point plan that we present to the parliament today, will fix everything that the New South Wales farmers want. There will be certainty returned to grazing because the primary production rights of the leaseholder predominate 100 per cent over the native title rights, even if they are shown to exist on some New South Wales grazing leases. No&amp;hyphen;one can come on to your property and interfere in any way whatsoever with your legitimate activities. Even if you want to do other things in the future—if you can get permission, as you have to do now, to carry on cultivation activity, agricultural activity, tourist activity, or even running a helicopter flying school base if you wish—if that conflicts with the native title right, then we have made provision in this bill that the native title right can be bought out and compensation paid to the native title holders. The cost of the compensation will be picked up 75 per cent by the Commonwealth government and 25 per cent by the state government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So the farmer, the pastoralist, the grazier will have no expense whatsoever. In fact, we will pick up 100 per cent of the cost of legal aid, if it is needed at any stage, for test cases to be run. I believe you would probably want only one or two and you could just about solve the problem in the Western Division in the future.

         I do believe that if we can get this bill through virtually unamended and have it all finished by Christmas then this time next year all the difficulty and sorrow and everything else that has been associated with the present native title bill will have evaporated, because most of the claims in the Western Division, if not all of them as I have seen them, just cannot stand up. They will fail the registration test. Under our registration test you have got to have a proper identification of the area and proper maps. You have got to have a proper
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          identification of the native title claim group under section 190 and you have got to have a proper description of the native title you are claiming for. It must be presented on a factual basis and you must have a prima facie case. Mineral rights are not included. Also, the physical connection with the land must be established. I will just read this:
         </break>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Registrar must be satisfied that at least one member of the native title claim group currently has or previously had a traditional physical connection with the area covered by the application.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         This connection must amount to more than a transitory access or intermittent non&amp;hyphen;native title access. In other words, your grandfather cannot just have held a picnic there in 1920, or your relatives cannot have come in on a motorbike from South Australia, or you cannot just claim you have had a spiritual connection with the land. You must be able to establish a physical connection. I would have liked to have seen that a bit tighter, but I believe it is far superior to what exists in the present act and it will largely solve the problem. Overall, I do believe this legislation reflects accurately what the High Court wanted and it respects both sides of the debate.

It is the only way forward for Australia—a sense of

         Yes, the ruling might be inconvenient to the coalition government. That is why they are prepared to ignore the High Court decision as they run off to church and profess that they want to do something about the disadvantaged in this country. But, when it comes to making hard decisions and taking decisive actions, the real problem is that they will go missing in action in the same way that they have historically gone missing in action when it comes to leadership, commitment and a willingness to do something.

         Mr Deputy Speaker, I suggest to you that there are solutions. But the biggest problem confronting indigenous Australia is employment. In some localities, the unemployment rate exceeds 50 per cent but, in the early 1990s, employment opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people grew more rapidly than non&amp;hyphen;indigenous employment. This was largely due to the major expansion by the Labor Party of the community development employment projects scheme, under which participants have the

The government is absolutely determined to make sure that Aboriginal health and other disadvantage are redressed. The former government spent taxpayers' dollars and loads of this parliament's time talking about the problems of Aborigines and talking about native title but, at the end of the day, Aboriginal health, housing, infant mortality and educational standards remained as they always have been, and that situation is totally unacceptable.

When one listens to speakers from the Labor Party, one would think that that particular piece of legislation is a paragon of virtue. We, in opposition, pointed out that the Native Title Act 1993 was not going to work.

            These proposals currently before the parliament seek to achieve a number of outcomes. Those outcomes include legal validity for acts done between the commencement of the Native Title Act in January 1994 and the Wik decision on the assumption that pastoral leases and other tenures extinguished native title. The proposals also seek to restore certainty to pastoralists so that they can carry on primary production activities.

            The Prime Minister has shown exemplary leadership in relation to Wik. It would be very easy for us to rush off and urge wholesale extinguishment of native title by pastoral leases. It would have been easy for us to be populists and to go out there and say what many people wanted to hear. But the Prime Minister on this issue, as on the guns issue, and as on so many other issues, has shown himself to be a statesman. He has been prepared to spend an inordinate amount of time working out a position which is fair and equitable to all sides. That is why I am particularly proud to support this legislation which is currently before the House.

            Also, one really has to be practical in politics. Life is not the art of the possible, it is the art of the attainable. While we achieved a massive majority in the last election—the people of Australia resoundingly voted for the Howard coalition government—regrettably, owing to vagaries in the Senate voting system, we did not obtain a similar majority in the upper house. As a government we had to be aware that we must bring in reforms to the Native Title Act but it was important that, if they were going to be workable, if they were going to come into effect, we get them through the upper house. It was made very clear by the Labor Party and by the minor parties in the Senate that, were we to go down the wholesale extinguishment road, our legislation would be unlikely to be passed by the Senate and there would be an indefinite continuity of uncertainty.

            There are very many proposals in this legislation of a technical nature which substantially improve the workability of the Native Title Act, and there was no point in our making a great big noise and bringing forward proposals for wholesale extinguishment which would have resulted in increased legal cases. It would have resulted in an enormous amount of financial outlay, even if we could have got the proposals through the parliament.

            Also, there were downsides for the Australian community generally if we were to go down the road of wholesale extinguishment. It would risk the reconciliation process. The honourable member for Batman said that we were not committed to reconciliation. That is absolutely untrue. This government and ministers have pointed out that we are committed to the reconciliation of Aboriginal and non&amp;hyphen;Aboriginal Australians, and I think the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) would agree that this is a bipartisan approach.

            To sum up, as time is short, this is a very important piece of legislation. We are seeking through this legislation to fix up a problem which was left to us by our predecessors. This bill is balanced, it is fair, it is workable, it is equitable and it will be to the benefit of the indigenous people of Australia. It will also be to the benefit of miners; it will be to the benefit of the tourist industry and also of pastoralists. So this bill is a win/win/win/win situation. Those opposite stand condemned for their negativity, for their failure in government to do anything about Aboriginal people and for their bringing to Australia the Native Title Act, which has proven so far to be absolutely and completely unworkable.

We must extinguish native title, without penalty to the Australian taxpayer, through an amendment to the Australian constitution. This should be put to the Australian people in the form of a referendum to be held concurrently with the next federal election.

          That evening in Canberra in l993, I pleaded with the parliament to understand that the ideas and the concepts they were playing around with were highly dangerous. The legislation that the government was supporting would divide this nation and the Aboriginal people of Australia would not gain one iota from the passage of that bill. Unfortunately, and I say this with no sense of pleasure, I believe that I was right. That evening my arguments were intended for the ears of Labor's then regional members. One characteristic shared by those honourable members at that time is that at the subsequent election they were unceremoniously thrown from office partly because of, I believe, the betrayal in that summer of l993.

Let us look at the native title impact on Australia today. The facts are obvious. Seventy-eight per cent of Australia is potentially subject to native title claim. That is undisputed. There has been only one negotiated successful claim in five years despite $88.8 million worth of funding through the representative bodies. I understand that is something like 600 claims and that everyone is aware of the overlapping claims issue. For instance, in my own electorate of Grey there is more native title claimed than actually exists.

This is equivalent to around $486 million flying out of Australia in a single year.

Would they have had such disregard for the people of the north of South Australia if there had been a Labor member for Grey at the time? Regrettably the answer is yes for even the protestations of the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) who was dumped by the ALP for his efforts was unable to shift the Keating&amp;hyphen;Beazley mind&amp;hyphen;set.

Why then did the Prime Minister's parliamentary secretary, Senator Minchin, involve the commission in discussing native title amendments from early 1996—a period of over 12 months—including by writing to the commission on 3 July this year on the bill? Exactly when, and in what circumstances, did the Attorney-General first learn that Senator Minchin and the government have been using the commission as a source of advice on amendments to the Native Title Act?

Mr Rose, the President of the Australian Law Reform Commission, does not seem to think that that was what was occurring. There was no direction given.

          of some criticism made of Australia's position by Denmark. I will take the opportunity in replying to the honourable member for Hindmarsh to mention to the House that Denmark's environment minister, Mr Sven Auken, has criticised Australia's claims for what he describes as `special consideration'. Let me start by saying that Australia is not seeking special consideration; Australia is merely seeking fair consideration. I notice the Labor Party is once again siding with foreign criticism, as they always do. They always side with foreign criticism. Whenever the Australian national interest is at stake they always agree with those who criticise Australia. But may I take the opportunity of saying that, of all those who might choose to criticise Australia's position, Denmark is in a particularly vulnerable position.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The reason that Denmark is in a particularly vulnerable position is that Denmark herself is part of some special arrangements that exist. For example, Danish statistics relating to CO2 emissions claim that emissions of CO2 fell by 0.5 per cent in 1996. However—and this is the interesting part, Mr Speaker—this was achieved by deducting 13 million tonnes of emissions from energy exports to Norway and Sweden. Denmark's electricity, therefore, went into a black hole. While they talk about Nordic power sharing, neither Norway nor Sweden counted the emissions either. So, somehow or other, some of the European countries who, with Labor Party support here,
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          adopt this self&amp;hyphen;righteous position and point the finger at Australia and say that Australia is asking for special treatment, themselves have some extraordinary special arrangements. According to my advice, if we adopted the Danish method we could all get our figures down but the environment would be no better off. Mr Speaker, can I say to Denmark, can I say to the energy minister of Denmark, and can I say to all the supporters of the Danish position who sit opposite that we are sticking up for the Australian national interest.

         What is involved in this greenhouse gas debate is a threat to 90,000 Australian jobs. What is involved in this greenhouse debate is an attempt by the Australian government to stick up for the Australian interest. Those who criticise our stance and those opposite who support the critics of our stance are doing the Australian national interest in the eye. What I am arguing for, what I will continue to argue for and what my government will continue to argue for is a fair deal for Australia: not a special deal for Australia, not a Labor deal for Australia but a fair deal for Australia; a deal that will protect Australian industry and, even more importantly, protect and generate Australian jobs.

The honourable member will be aware that retail turnover figures for August released yesterday were better than expected following a very large 2.6 per cent rise in July. Although there was a 0.4 per cent fall, the trend growth rate in August was 0.6 per cent—the highest monthly growth rate for two years.

           Trend retail turnover was particularly strong in South Australia—0.7 per cent for each of the last three months. Throughout Australia only the ACT has performed better. The pick&amp;hyphen;up in imports in August also points to strengthening activity. Total exports of goods and services reached a record high in August, growing by three per cent in the month.

         Building approvals in August also showed a strong 13.5 per cent rise, suggesting that underlying conditions in the housing sector remain firm. Strong increases in approvals were recorded both for houses and medium-density buildings. On Monday, I also referred to the fact that housing affordability is at its best for years. I suggested that some senators and members who did not own houses could perhaps think about getting back into the housing market. I suggested that the Bedouin from Burnie, Senator Sherry, might be somebody who should buy a house.

          We now find out that Senator Sherry does have a house—it is his office in Burnie. Senator Sherry both lives and works in the building, which is both his home and his office. That means, according to Senator Sherry, that if he is not at the office he is away from home. He can claim an away from home allowance every time he leaves the office. Most people claim pay to go to the office. Senator Sherry claims pay to leave the office.

Can you imagine the kind of welcome he gets? He gets paid $300 to go home to mum's. Can you imagine the welcome? `Oh Possum!' she says; `Oh Possum, you're home!' On Sunday, the Leader of the Opposition said, `If Labor people are rorting, Labor people go.' It is time for Senator Sherry.

          —I thank the honourable member for his question. I know it is of great importance to him and to many other members. The gifting arrangements are a new policy and they are part of Agriculture—Advancing Australia. It sees the government delivering on a longstanding commitment to address a very real need: the welfare need of aged farmers and the very difficult circumstances which have confronted Australian farmers over the last decade or so. The fact is that there are thousands of older farmers living on farms with the next generation, and sometimes the generation after that—their sons and daughters, and sometimes their grandchildren—where that farm can no longer provide what ordinary Australians would regard as a decent standard of living for more than one family. And certainly not for two or three, as is sometimes the case.

         Many of those farms once would have been able to, but relentlessly declining terms of trade have overcome many farm families, despite the sector's legendary reputation for improving productivity and doing the job more effectively. Many of these people find that they are just unable to live decently, yet they cannot access the age pension because of the way in which the asset tests impacts on them. Our policy will enable farmers in this situation to transfer ownership of the family farm to a younger generation who are actively involved in running the business and then to receive the age pension immediately instead of, as currently applies, five years down the road. This will benefit not just those older farmers but also the younger generation taking over. They will be able to pick up the reins, relieved of a substantial financial pressure. They will be in a better position, so will those farms and so will the national economy. This is a carefully targeted package which is not available to wealthy farmers but which will be of real value to those many, many hard&amp;hyphen;pressed farmers out there in real need.

          I would be particularly interested to know just what conclusions about this gifting provision my opposite number, the shadow minister for primary industries, has now reached. His reaction to this package, which was so widely welcomed by the farm leaders in this country, was that it was a cruel hoax and constituted a few things which were a pale imitation of what they had in place. It would be interesting to know what his attitude is now.

          I think it is time we started to gain a bit of an impression for the benefit of rural Australians as to where he is up to in his policy formation. It is 19 months since they lost their position. I think Australia's farmers would like to know a bit about it. We know a couple of things. He has been out there saying that the Leader of the Opposition has given them a blank page on which to start setting out a rural policy. In fact, he recently said, `Kim Beazley has given me a total blank sheet.' It is probably very much like the one they took to the last election. It was a blank sheet. There was nothing on it. They did not have a primary industry policy.
          <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
           He quoted the Leader of the Opposition as having said, `Rural and regional Australia is at the heart of Labor's comeback.' He said that he sees it as a `huge charter and a challenge to rebuild credibility', whatever that means. We have a blank page here. This is their policy. I wonder, Mr Speaker, could we table the Labor Party's rural policy? Could I have your permission to table it?

          Filling in the gaps would be a very worthwhile exercise on the part of my opposite number over there because we need to know what it is about. All we know at the moment is that, from his reaction to this package, which has been so widely welcomed in rural Australia, the blank page will not have on it gifting, farm management deposits, farm family restart, Farmbis or anything else that is in the AAA package, the Agriculture—Advancing Australia package, because he says that it is just a cruel hoax.

What I do want to say is that the aged care reform policy this government has put into place, which is implemented today and which means this government will start rebuilding the nursing home sector in this country today, is designed to protect financially disadvantaged people in the community. The bill also has within it a hardship provision. The key plank of this policy is that no person in this country who cannot afford to pay bonds or who cannot afford to pay fees will be asked to do so. People who are financially disadvantaged or who cannot afford to pay will be protected by this legislation.

         I just want to conclude by correcting an answer that I gave yesterday. I am afraid I do appear to have slightly misled the House. I said that Labor had in their last set of initiatives—in fact, their 17 last initiatives—in one way or another proposed a review, a committee or whatever. Actually, I was not quite right because when they were talking about retail tenancies yesterday I thought I had better get out their latest statement on these very issues. This one is a sort of Labor policy statement on small business. I said there were 17 reviews. This has been issued whilst Labor has been in opposition, so this is their latest policy—but one, which I will come back to. The headline under the name of the Leader of the Opposition is that the Labor Party today announced it would conduct a complete review of its small business policy.

           —There are many people, contrary to the shadow minister's allegations, in hostels today who have dementia, who are very frail. They are in hostels. They are paying bonds. They have been paying bonds for the last 10 years. They have not been able to look after their own affairs. They have had to have their families, their legal advisers or the guardianship boards in each of the states and territories, look after their interests. The policy has worked well in hostels. Nothing will change in that respect when it is transferred to nursing homes as well. The government will, however, be monitoring the new arrangements, and we will act firmly if there is any sign of providers abusing this system.

She feigns despair, when she was part of the government which introduced the same policy for hostels.

          Furthermore, let me remind the House that it was Labor which allowed hostels to charge any level of additional daily fee they wanted to. They could take everything from the resident over and above the pension and the little bit of money a pensioner could earn before their pension was affected. If they earned $20, under their policy the hostels could take $10 of that money. That was the kind of policy that that mob over there introduced when they were in government. We have put a stop to that. Basically, Labor failed. They failed the aged sector in this country. They failed the frail elderly in this country. Labor left the state of many nursing homes in total decay, and we are cleaning up their mess.

           Business. In the very positive reaction from the small business community, their industry associations and the media to the government's fair trading reform package, it has been implied in some predictable quarters that we are not addressing business conduct issues in the retail tenancy area. Can you please inform the House what actions the government is taking to assist small retailers experiencing retail tenancy problems?

          —I thank the member again for his work and also for his question. I must say that I was rather surprised that the opposition made some comments about what they claim to be the inadequacy of our package when it comes to retail tenancy issues, but I would have to say that I have been in their situation before. If the government does something really good, the pressure is on you to find something in it that you do not like so you can at least be an opposition for the sake of being an opposition.

         It is quite remarkable that opposition members should have said what they said yesterday—namely, that the package was inadequate in respect of retail tenancies—because this is not a new issue. This issue has been around awhile. In fact, it was on your plate when you were in government. I think it is timely that we remind you of the things that you said when you were in government. In fact we might even remind you of what you have been saying in opposition.

         Before I do that, let me say that we have taken very strong action when it comes to the question of retail tenancies. We have done that which Labor was never prepared to do—that is, exercise some national leadership on this issue. We have been prepared to get the parties together, set some benchmarks and set up a process to get the state and territory ministers together.

Can he explain to this House why some small businesses should be allowed to minimise or avoid tax entirely because they operate through trusts, while the bulk of the small business community operates through companies and pays corporate tax?

They overruled legal opinion and said he needed to be counselled. They set him on a 10&amp;hyphen;year career. The Leader and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition—and I have said this before—the 1983 Mal Colston defence team, cannot ask a question because they know they are deeply implicated in all of this. I tell you, there is one question before this parliament today: does the Leader of the Opposition have the ability to sack Senator Sherry? That is the great question that is before this parliament today. If you do not have the strength to do that, old son, you do not have the strength to do anything.

          —I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question. This is a matter of very considerable interest on this side of the House. Yesterday the government announced some important reforms to the child support scheme to take effect in 1998&amp;hyphen;99. The package represents a balanced approach, and it focuses on the interests of children and the balance of responsibility between both parents and fairness to taxpayers generally. The fact is that there are 155,000 payees who will benefit from the introduction of a minimum child support payment of $260 a year. This initiative will reinforce the message that parents have primary responsibility for the financial support of their children. Three hundred thousand payers will pay less child support as a result of an increase in the exempt income amount, and 96,000 payees will have some of this reduction offset through increased family payments.

         The additional relief will be provided to blended families through allowing child support payments to be taken into account for family payment purposes. Furthermore, the amount of income the payee will be allowed to earn before it affects child support will be

          significantly reduced. The non&amp;hyphen;agency payments in arrears received with the first regular payment of child support will be treated in the same way as other child support under the maintenance income test.
          <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
           Other reforms include allowing parents to use the most recent taxable income assessment for the calculation of child support and broadening the income base to ensure that payers are not avoiding their responsibilities through minimisation.

         Further administrative reforms will be introduced to the Child Support Agency to build on the significant reforms that have already been made. We recognise that these measures are a second important step in the process of child support reform, and that continued consultation is required. I can assure the honourable member and members such as her who are interested in this matter that we will be seeking to inform at the next stage. I am sure honourable members will be very pleased to note that, after 13 years of inactivity by the former government, this is a government prepared to address these sensitive issues.

          The charter then continued on to Orungal because I had a speaking engagement in Texas that night. Early the following morning, at approximately 7.30 a.m., the charter flight departed for Brisbane with me and a member of my staff on board. I disembarked in Brisbane to catch a flight to Canberra in order to keep afternoon commitments. A member of my staff continued on the flight to Dalby, which was in any case heading back to its base at Orungal, near Texas. It was a dead leg anyway. The stop at Dalby was offered by the pilot at no extra cost to the Commonwealth. This in fact saved the Commonwealth the cost of a self&amp;hyphen;drive hire car to return the staff member to Dalby from Brisbane. Allowing for relocation expenses, this cost would have been in the order of $200.

          In addition, Mr Speaker, let me put to bed one of the other baseless allegations raised by the member for Hotham yesterday. Yesterday he claimed that my travel allowance claim records revealed a negative capital city claim record for the second six months of 1996&amp;hyphen;97. What has emerged since is that the travel claims referred to by the member for Hotham only included claims for the travel up to and including 6 May 1997. This was clearly stated in the DAS report from which the member for Hotham no doubt derived his statistics. So the figure was for 4&amp;half; months, not six months, in the second half of the financial year. Secondly, DAS has since advised me that the figure of 37 nights quoted by the member for Hotham in support of his baseless allegation was incorrect. It was actually 38 nights. Once again, your allegations are baseless and have vanished into the morning mist.

At the end of question time, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) quoted partially from the transcript of my doorstop this morning and drew from that the implication that I was saying that Senator Sherry was wrong.

         Not a single one of the allegations that I have seen against Senator Sherry in the public domain have suggested that his individual claims were other than entirely justified, that he was where he said he was and that he was acting within the rules. And until someone comes up with some evidence to the contrary on that, I think that's the last we should be hearing of Senator Sherry.

My office was advised last week by the staff of the former Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) that they would be participating in that forum. I noticed from the list of

As that minister's office and department have a very significant interface between the Jetset Users Forum and Jetset itself, it would seem that the circle would not be complete unless they were represented. On behalf of the House, would you write to the minister and ask either him or a senior representative of his office and department to be present at that meeting and continue to be present at those meetings when they are held in the future?

          from the aged care budget. In order to make up this deficiency and to find the capital necessary, the Howard government has come up with this appalling user-pays system of new fees for nursing homes. This Howard government and this minister have introduced this up-front fee, the so-called accommodation bond.

         In November, the extra daily fee will begin. The extra daily fee is, of course, just a tax by another name. It really rubs salt into the wounds of older people. The money goes straight to the government, and the residents get no benefit from that payment whatsoever. This minister has been steadfast in her refusal to acknowledge the facts about where the money will come from to pay this $98,000 entry fee. As the facts mount from today, she is looking more and more like King Canute in her efforts to deny the obvious.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The money for the entry fee will come from the sale of people's homes. Let us just briefly walk through the facts one more time. The majority of people in nursing homes are pensioners. Pensioners, Minister! More than 70 per cent of pensioners have only one asset: their family home. Yes, there are exemptions—I am sure the minister will talk about them—when a spouse lives in the home. But the facts are that 90 per cent of the people who need to go into a nursing home live alone before they go into that nursing home. They will have to sell their family homes. You might like to say that nobody will be forced. This is the biggest playing with words that I have ever seen. Of course it is not compulsory, Minister, but where does compulsion end and coercion begin? The nursing homes will coerce older people to sell their homes so that they pay the $98,000 in entry fees. The fact is they will have to sell their homes.

         Let us not forget which people we are talking about here. This is a generation of people, unlike my generation, which  has lived through the Great Depression and the Second World War.

Minister, part of the cruelty of this legislation is that you do not seem to understand the psychological impact of what you are doing to this generation of Australians. You are trashing the values of a generation. The action is arrogant and contemptuous in its failure to understand the impact it will have on older Australians and their families.

         Let me share one example with you. It comes from a personal friend of mine. I will not use her name because she would not want me to. Her mother and father have just gone through a very difficult time. Her father has very severe dementia and was becoming very violent towards her mother. They had to find a nursing home bed for her father. They went to many nursing homes in the local area—I think five or six. None of the nursing homes wanted to take this man because he is violent and disruptive. But something had to be done to protect the mother. They could not find a nursing home bed. Eventually, this man had to be committed.

This is because the mother is still living in the home. `"You haven't got the money. He's too difficult a patient."'

What an abomination. What an un&amp;hyphen;Australian way of looking after people in their last years of life. It is inevitable that raising money through the entry fee system will produce a system that reflects where the money comes from. In other words, it will reflect the capacity of nursing homes to tap into the value of people's homes. Nursing homes in wealthy areas—as this article in the

         What about the nursing homes in poorer areas, in country towns or the poorer parts of our cities where they can only pay a smaller amount? As is made quite clear in the article in the

Those that charge $98,000 will be very nice, thanks very much. We have seen from the newspapers today that nursing homes are already saying that poorer areas and lower fees will go together.

         From the very first day of this debate, all the opposition has done is play a totally divisive and negative game. That has been the sum total of the opposition's contribution to this debate on aged care.

         Not once have we had any evidence that the shadow minister has been anywhere near some of the older nursing homes, particularly in her state, where a good proportion of nursing homes are simply old houses converted for the purpose. Until today, not once had we had any acknowledgment by the shadow minister of the totally inadequate funding provided for people with dementia under the current system, and the desperate need, as she highlighted—thus highlighting Labor's failure—to develop more appropriate funding and care for dementia patients.

         Not once have we had any acknowledgment that they even care about the 40 per cent of residents that share wards with four or more people, the 11 per cent of facilities that do not meet fire standards or the 15 per cent that do not meet health standards. Does the shadow minister deny these figures and the disgraceful stories behind such statistics? Her silence to date indicates such outrageous denial.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let me explain what these statistics mean, particularly for residents' quality of life. They mean that too many buildings have serious structural deficiencies. They mean that there are hazards which jeopardise residents' safety and security. They mean an unsafe working environment for staff.

         <para first-indent="16">
          There are many institutional buildings with dark narrow corridors with inadequate lighting. This restricts residents' mobility, further hampering their capacity to enjoy a high quality of life. There are also small narrow toilets, perhaps shared between many residents.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Some buildings have multiple storeys with no lifts, further restricting mobility. Some buildings have a sterile hospital&amp;hyphen;like environment which, despite the best efforts of the dedicated staff and providers, are far from homelike. Too many nursing home buildings are serious firetraps. There may be no firewalls, the fire exits could be blocked or even locked. The windows might not open, or perhaps the fire exits open to enclosed courtyards, not allowing residents to escape.

          From such a parlous state it is no longer possible to keep placing bandaids on the problem. The wound is festering and it is getting worse.

           Labor's hostel policy introduced in 1988 and supported by us meant that hostels had an income stream to significantly finance their own upgrade and refurbishment. This income stream was called entry contributions and now accommodation bonds. Accommodation bonds across both hostels and nursing homes will provide an income stream of some $130 million each year after four years. This matches well with Professor Gregory's estimation that around $125 million a year is needed to bring the nursing home buildings up to reasonable community expectations.

           It is painfully obvious that the opposition had never had any intention of being a constructive player in this debate and has no understanding of the conditions of the buildings that many residents find themselves living in today. Let me take this opportunity to put some facts on the table, given the shadow minister has decided to ignore them. The reforms that we will implement today will deliver on a number of fronts. I will briefly mention just 10 of those points. Nursing home building quality will improve. People will be housed in a safe environment where they will have comfort and dignity in their most frail years.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           We will have improved funding for dementia. The new funding system will deliver a substantial increase to funding for dementia—about a 30 per cent increase on average to a hostel resident with dementia. This will relieve the financial strain on dementia-specific facilities and improve access to dementia care.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Higher levels of funding will be guaranteed for providers who care for financially disadvantaged people. Under the current system, providers receive a meagre subsidy of $3.50 per day for financially disadvantaged people. Under our system that amount will more than double to $7 a day and it will go to $12 a day if the provider cares for more than 40 per cent of financially disadvantaged residents. This will provide much greater support for providers in poorer areas and those who specialise in financially disadvantaged residents.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           We will also provide greater services in rural and remote areas. The special viability assistance funding was previously available
           <break page="8925" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            only to nursing homes. This has been extended to hostels as well. Facilities in remote areas in particular tend to have higher proportions of financially disadvantaged residents and so will benefit greatly from the higher funding levels.
           </break>
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           In addition, facilities in rural and remote areas will be targeted by the government's capital grants program which provides additional assistance to help facilitates build or upgrade. For this $40 million was announced in the 1996 budget.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Facilities can also choose to broaden the range of care they provide and be funded for. So residents will increasingly be able to stay in their own towns rather than move to get the care they need. That is very important to rural and remote areas.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           There will also be comprehensive access protection for financially disadvantaged people. Much stronger and clearer protection than ever existed in the past will ensure that older Australians get access to care according to their need, not according to their means.

           When the shadow minister was asked on radio in Perth this morning what the Labor Party would do if it were to lay down a policy, she said, `We would make sure people get access according to their needs, not according to their means.' That is exactly what this policy does. All nursing homes and hostels will have to set aside a proportion of places for people who cannot afford to pay a bond. Providers will receive higher subsidies for those places.

The government needs the money to pay for nursing home upgrades because it withdrew half a billion dollars from aged care in the 1996 budget. The government considers that this money can be found only in the most rotten and despicable of ways: by making aged people sell off their homes if they need to enter a nursing home.

         I want to draw the minister's attention to a well-known fact that seems to have escaped her, that being that hostels and nursing homes, until today, were in no way the same. Comparing hostels to nursing homes is like comparing hospitals to hotels because both have beds. It is like comparing bikes to semi-trailers because both have wheels.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Hostels were established to accommodate—and I stress the word `accommodate'—older people who made a deliberate decision to move into accommodation that offered a degree of supporter living. That they now contain a growing number of people who are increasingly frail is because they are growing older. Another fact that seems to have escaped this minister is that we all do grow old. But the key point is that residents of hostels have decided—and again I emphasise `decided'—to sell up and move into hostels. That they may be frail now does not mean that they were frail or incapacitated when they decided to move into the hostel.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Nursing homes, on the other hand, clearly are for seriously ill or seriously frail people who are unable to look after themselves. You do not go into a nursing home by choice, Minister. I know that is one of your favourite words, but it does not apply in this instance. People go into nursing homes when they are assessed as being unable to care for themselves. They are assessed by aged care assessment teams, usually comprising a doctor, nurse, social worker and perhaps a gerontologist.

         It was said on radio this morning that the government expect to raise $1.5 billion by coercing people to sell their homes. The minister says that Labor has run nursing homes down. Labor acknowledges that nursing homes needed money spent on them. Indeed, it was there in our own forward estimates. That is where the Liberals have made their half a billion dollar saving. When money needed to be put in they cut half a billion dollars out in last year's budget. They

Before I entered parliament I had the displeasure to go through some nursing homes and hostels. I could not understand why hostels seemed to be such wonderful places, such new pristine environments, which you would be happy to have one of your own live in. Then on the same day you would be forced into a nursing home which was dark, dingy, smelly, almost a fire hazard and a risk to people's health. That is what the opposition condemned them to.

          The member for Jagajaga parades herself around this country scaring people, and that is an understatement. I went to a retirement village in my electorate some two or three weeks ago. A fellow said to me, `I can't get into a nursing home. They're going to charge me. I'm going to have to sell my house.' I said, `Sir, have you ever applied to go to a nursing home?' `No, but that's what I've heard from the member for Jagajaga.' She wants to stand there and scare the living daylights out of these people, people who have contributed to Australia for so many years and who deserve a fair go.

         The review found that the existing scheme had achieved a measure of consumer protection. It also found that its credibility had strengthened somewhat in the time since the scheme was reviewed by the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Migration in 1995. The review found that the existing scheme had not adversely affected competition in the migration advice market, although it recognised that there was a need to improve competency standards in a way that would not affect the level of competition in the industry.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In considering the findings of the review, the government concluded that, although it would be possible for the industry to be self-regulating in the future, this was not immediately achievable for two main reasons. The first reason is the vulnerability of the consumer group. This group may have difficulties making an informed choice about the quality of the migration advice they are purchasing. There is a history of exploitation of consumers of migration advice by a number of unscrupulous and unethical migration agents.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second reason is the fact that the migration advice industry is not yet `mature', in the sense that there is limited cooperation

          occurring between the three main occupational groups and the Migration Institute of Australia.

         This bill retains all of the important elements of the existing scheme for registration of migration agents. For example, it will continue to be a mandatory requirement for all persons who wish to practise as migration agents, including members of the legal profession, to be registered. All applicants for registration will be required to satisfy the registration authority that they are of good character and have the necessary knowledge to give quality migration advice and assistance. As is now the case, unregistered practice will be an offence. My department will continue to rigorously investigate and pursue those who provide immigration advice without being registered.

        <para first-indent="16">
         As with the existing scheme, the bill provides for the investigation of complaints made against migration agents who act in an unprofessional or unscrupulous manner. However, it will also introduce significant improvements in the complaints handling process to address the review's finding that the existing process was expensive, slow and insufficiently responsive to consumer concerns. For example, the bill provides for the registration authority to be able to refer a complainant and the relevant agent to a mediator. The intention is to enable the parties to a dispute to negotiate a mutually acceptable outcome without having to resort to lengthy and expensive disciplinary processes.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The existing legislation allows for disciplinary action to be taken against an agent who, for example, is found to have breached the code of conduct or is found not to be a person of integrity. Such disciplinary action can take the form of a caution or the agent's registration can be suspended or cancelled. These sanctions will remain.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill proposes changes to the way disciplinary action against agents who are also practising lawyers will be handled. The changes will make it possible for the Migration Institute of Australia to refer disciplinary matters involving lawyer agents to the relevant professional bodies for disciplinary action. This will place the responsibility for handling malpractice within the
         <break page="8933" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          legal profession itself, where it properly belongs.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill also proposes a number of new provisions aimed at strengthening consumer protection and improving the competence of agents. The present definition of `immigration assistance' does not extend to migration advice given in relation to sponsorships or nominations. This means that a person can provide assistance and advice to potential sponsors or nominators without being required to be registered as a migration agent. Both the Joint Standing Committee on Migration and the recent review conducted by my department recommended that this loophole be closed, noting that a growing number of sponsors and nominees were effectively unprotected from poor advice or unscrupulous practice.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government also recognises that travel agents, in advising non-citizen clients of the need to have a visa for travel to and from Australia, could arguably be required to register as migration agents under the existing scheme. This bill amends the definition of `immigration assistance' in a way which will clearly exclude the limited forms of assistance provided by travel agents and interpreters. The bill, therefore, removes an area of unnecessary regulation and uncertainty for the tourism industry. The government wants to ensure that all clients of migration agents are fully protected by the legislation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Under the current arrangements, agents operating in the voluntary sector are not required to meet the same knowledge test for registration as agents operating in the private sector. Some of these agents have fully met the knowledge test and are recognised as highly competent and ethical practitioners. However, many have not. In practice, this has led to the development of two different standards of competency in the industry, with some of the most vulnerable clients receiving a lower standard of service.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill addresses this inequity by requiring all agents in the voluntary sector to fully meet the knowledge test in order to qualify for registration as a migration agent. Because many agents in the voluntary sector would be unable to meet the test without further educa
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          tion and training, the bill provides for a six&amp;hyphen;month period of grace to enable them to qualify. In addition, my department is making funding available for the provision of training courses to enable agents in the voluntary sector to obtain the level of knowledge required for full registration.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         At present, agents operating in the voluntary sector and providing their services free of charge are not required to pay a registration fee. The recent review of the existing scheme found that this arrangement resulted in agents in the private sector cross-subsidising agents in the voluntary sector. It also found that fee levels were higher as a result because the cost of processing a registration is the same in all cases.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The two charge bills included in this package reduce this cross-subsidy by ensuring that charges are imposed on voluntary sector agents. The government proposes, however, that the regulations will provide a lower rate of charge for voluntary sector agents in recognition of their lesser capacity to meet the full costs of registration.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         At present, once an agent is registered, there are no incentives for them to maintain or improve their knowledge and professional competency. Clients, therefore, have no way of knowing whether an agent has made the effort to keep abreast of changes to the Migration Act and regulations. The bill contains provisions designed to improve the competency and ethical practice of all migration agents. From 21 March 1999, all agents seeking to re&amp;hyphen;register must demonstrate that they have met criteria in relation to undertaking continuing professional development. The details of this requirement will be set out in regulations.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Agents who fail to meet this requirement will be refused re&amp;hyphen;registration and will not be permitted to continue to practise in the industry until they reapply and meet the requirements. I am aware that this is a serious measure. It potentially affects the livelihood of some people in small business. But it is necessary both in the public interest and in the interests of consumers.

Currently, consumers have no guarantee that the agent they are paying to give them professional advice is, in fact, fully competent. If this requirement for continuing professional development has the effect of dissuading some agents from remaining in the industry because they do not wish to improve their practice, then the industry and the community would be better off without them.

         Two charge bills are being introduced in tandem with this bill. Together with the provisions in the principal bill, they will provide a more flexible vehicle for setting the level of fees applying to applications for registration. After appointment as the Migration Agents Registration Authority, the Migration Institute of Australia will be authorised to collect fees on behalf of the Commonwealth. The principal bill includes an appropriation to the Migration Institute of Australia to ensure that it recovers the costs of running the new scheme.

         The Renewal Charge Bill will be repealed on 21 March 1999. After that time, renewal of agents' registration will no longer be automatic. Instead, agents will be required to apply for re-registration and meet the new continuing professional development requirements. The principal bill also includes a series of transitional arrangements. These are designed to enable a seamless transition to the new scheme.

         This bill imposes a charge on applications for registration as a migration agent. It replaces the provisions in the Migration Agents Registration (Application) Levy Act 1992, which will be repealed. The main feature of this bill is that it provides for the actual amount of the charge payable to be set by regulation subject to an indexed charge limit. This provides the government with flexibility to set differing levels of charge depending on the circumstances of the agent. It will allow, for example, lower levels of charge to be set for agents in the voluntary sector. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.

         The bill will insert rules in the income tax law to limit the circumstances in which trusts can deduct current year and prior year losses and debt deductions. The measures generally take effect from 9 May 1995. The government announced in the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 budget its intention to proceed with the previous government's 1995&amp;hyphen;96 budget announcement on 9 May 1995 that trust loss rules would be introduced.

         The government has consulted widely with taxpayers and tax professionals in developing the trust loss legislation. The government announced in the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 budget that several significant changes would be made to the previous government's draft legislation. Those changes were set out in a press release issued on budget night. Most of these changes were made in response to the concerns expressed by taxpayers and tax professionals about the previous government's proposed legislation.

          In announcing that it would go ahead with the measures, the government committed itself to consulting widely with taxpayers and tax professionals before introducing legislation into the parliament. To this end, the government's draft of the legislation was released for public comment on 10 February 1997. A large number of submissions concerning the exposure draft were received. The government has considered these submissions and has taken them into account in finalising the legislation. The government has made many modifications to the measures in response to concerns raised in the submissions.

          One of the main concerns raised was about the application of the income injection test to family trusts. In response to this concern, the government announced in the 1997&amp;hyphen;98 budget that it would relax the application of the income injection test for family trusts but the definition of `family member' would be narrowed from the 1997&amp;hyphen;98 budget time.

          Purpose of the trust loss measures

         <para first-indent="16">
          The purpose of the trust loss measures is to restrict the recoupment of losses and other deductions of trusts in order to prevent the transfer of the tax benefit of the losses. This occurs when a person who did not bear the economic effect of the loss when it was incurred by the trust obtains a benefit as a result of the trust's ability to deduct the loss.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The measures achieve this aim by examining whether there has been a change in underlying ownership or control of a trust or whether certain schemes have been entered into in order to take advantage of a trust's losses or other deductions.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The tax law already contains tests which limit the deductibility of losses incurred by companies. The proposed rules that are to apply to trusts will differ in some respects from those that apply to companies, reflecting the different characteristics of trusts.

          The tests to be satisfied before losses are deductible will vary depending on the type of trust. Each type of trust has to satisfy certain tests relating to ownership or control of the trust in order to be able to deduct prior and current year losses and debt deductions.

           Special rules will also apply to widely held unit trusts so that ownership will be tested generally only where there are abnormal transactions.

           If a trust is involved in an income injection scheme to take advantage of deductions, the income injection test may prevent the trust from making full use of the deductions.

However, the test does apply to family trusts in some circumstances.

            The trust loss measures have been drafted so as to fit into the new income tax law being developed as part of the tax law improvement project. The proposed rules are lengthy but necessarily so. For example, there are many different categories of trusts. One way of dealing with trust losses would be to have a few standard rules that apply to all trusts. This would result in the rules themselves being unfair in their impact.

This bill imposes the family trust distribution tax at a rate of 48.5 per cent of the amount or value of the relevant income or capital. In broad terms, the relevant income or capital is that given, by a family trust and some other entities in the family group, to persons who are not in the family group.

         This bill will amend the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (the SIS Act). The SIS Act regulates the conduct of trustees of superannuation entities to ensure the prudent management of superannuation moneys.

        <para first-indent="16">
         To be eligible to receive concessional taxation treatment a superannuation fund must elect to be regulated under the SIS Act. There are a number of steps involved in making an election, including lodging a standard form with the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner and ensuring that the fund has a trustee that is a constitutional corporation or that the sole or primary purpose of the fund is the provision of old&amp;hyphen;age pensions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are strict time limits within which superannuation funds must elect to be regulated. A superannuation fund, established after the commencement of the SIS Act, must make an election to be regulated at the same time that it comes into existence or shortly after that day. A superannuation fund that was in existence prior to the commencement of the SIS Act must have elected to be regulated at the latest by the beginning of the fund's 1995&amp;hyphen;96 year of income. A superannuation fund that was in the process of winding up after the commencement of its 1994&amp;hyphen;95 year of income could continue to receive concessional taxation treatment without making an election to be regulated, provided they were wound up by 1 July 1995.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Failure to elect within these strict time limits or to wind up by the prescribed date may result in the members of the fund suffering losses due to the removal of taxation concessions. In addition, given that there are a number of steps involved in making an election, a fund may inadvertently lodge a defective election. In this case, a fund is ineligible for taxation concessions until after they have made a valid election. This is despite the fact that the fund may have complied with the SIS Act and regulations in

          all respects apart from lodging a valid election.

         The commissioner previously dealt with the shortcomings in the election process by temporarily modifying the SIS Act under section 333. However, the commissioner's temporary modification power expired on 1 July 1996. This bill amends the SIS Act to permanently reinstate the administrative flexibility which was previously achieved through the temporary modification declarations.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In particular, the amendments will confer a discretion on the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to extend the time within which the lodgment of an election must be made with the commissioner and enable trustees to rectify inadvertently invalid elections. The amendments will also address restrictive timing requirements for funds established prior to the SIS regime or funds who were in the process of winding up. By overcoming these technical rigidities, the amendments will enable superannuation funds who would otherwise be deprived of concessional taxation treatment in certain years to obtain access to such treatment, without compromising the security of members' benefits or fund compliance with the retirement income standards.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is intended that the amendments will take effect retrospectively from 1 July 1996 to ensure that the eligibility for taxation concessions for funds in the period prior to amendment is not jeopardised. I commend the bill to the House and provide the explanatory memorandum.

          The committee also sought to establish if the recruitment of reservists can be sustained. Again, Defence advised that a fundamental principle of recruitment is to recruit people from local communities who have specific knowledge and understanding of their areas and use this to support the surveillance capability. The history of the unit has been
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           characterised by strong representation of members of local communities. At present, 40 per cent—200 members—of the unit are indigenous. It was also pointed out that the unit is currently manned to its full establishment. This is a good indication of the effectiveness of recruitment campaigns and a strong indicator of the support for the unit in Far North Queensland.

         Despite the bitter words of the Democrat senators in the other place, I am proud to include myself amongst the occupation of those people from the land. The pastoralists have been held to ransom. The legislation before us should clarify their position and protect their right to continue to make the soil of this land productive. There is no doubt that the new act and the changes go some way towards that.

         The miners of Grey have been caught in the inadequacies of the Native Title Act. The larger exploration and development companies have been warned off vast tracts of my electorate and millions of dollars worth of opportunity has disappeared. Perhaps the worst treatment has been meted out to the opal miners of Grey. These men and women and the communities they live in—places like Andamooka, Coober Pedy, Marla and Mintabie—have seen their means of earning a living frozen while the native title process creaks through its many stages.

         I come to the state of Aboriginal Australia. It would be absolutely wrong to suggest the reforms at hand are in some way a zero sum gain trade&amp;hyphen;off between Aborigines and other Australians as if improving the lot of farmers and miners is only made possible by the disadvantage of Aborigines. After all, more than one in 20 of my constituents is Aboriginal, compared with the electorate of the member for Banks (Mr Melham). I understand only one in 250 of his constituents is Aboriginal.

         I was able to visit the communities of Oak Valley, Ceduna and the Buttlingarra community at Whyalla not two weeks ago, in the company of the admirable senator the Hon.

         The ALP subscribes to far too many myths about this country's past. I am reminded that three years ago I had to strongly differ with the claim of the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) during the debate on the land fund bill that the Aborigines of Central Australia were only there because they had been pushed off better land in Australia. As I told the member for Charlton at the time, the land he talked so derisively of is top cattle country.

         You might think it would only be Pitjantjatjara country. People have lived on that land for many thousands of years and they do not appreciate being told that their home and their land is a wasteland and of inferior quality to any other land in the country. It is ironic that the inalienable freehold title of the Pitjantjatjara land offers, under its current administration, less land access for Aboriginal people in the way that they would like to have access than the previous pastoral leases.

         I come to reconciliation. The myths of the concept of reconciliation abound in this debate—one might even describe it as a mantra for the opposition benches. I believe that the central tenet of reconciliation—the idea that there is a gaping hole in the spiritual life of this nation that can be remedied only by prolonged apologising by white Australia—is not only an insult to this nation and its people but a dead-end for Aboriginal people. It is a road to nowhere and its pursuit is undoubtedly to the disadvantage of Aboriginal people.

         Until we recognise that history is just that—history—and until we ask all Australians to take responsibility for the here and now, we can never be one people and our nation will still be divided, one Australian against another, to the detriment of ourselves and our nation. In fact, over the years that I have been in this place I have sadly come to the conclusion that the ALP has a vested interest in continuing division in a rather self&amp;hyphen;righteous way.

          I move to the alliance against reform. Perhaps the most intriguing part of this ongoing debate is the distinct difference between the submissions of those who maintain that the Native Title Act is serving this nation well and those who recognise its inadequacies.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Firstly, those who oppose the government's reforms provide no alternative solutions to the problems we confront. Let us remind ourselves: we have had over 600 claims, one of which was successful—that is, if you want to call the exchange of money for some building blocks a success. That is the situation with native title in Australia: $88.8 million spent and in effect I would say no successful native title claims in mainland Australia. If that is success, please let us think again.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Secondly, the submissions of the opposed tend to be glossy, lavish and come from individual groups from Sydney and Melbourne almost exclusively—certainly from metropolitan Australia. To be frank, I have had a gutful of the self-righteous academics and the many Christian church leaders telling me—and by implication the people I represent—what is going on in rural and regional Australia.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I have sent a standard response to such correspondence asking that they come out to my part of the world and actually see the reality of Aborigines and rural people that is threatened by the present Native Title Act.

         <para first-indent="16">
          To balance that, I must add the encouragement that I felt when I read an account by Bishop Malcolm, an Aboriginal bishop, who made the comment that if we must go down the track of reliving our history—however coloured that may be in all its descriptions—Aboriginal people will need to acknowledge the acts of violence against the white people as much as the white people will need to acknowledge the acts of violence against Aboriginal people.

         <para first-indent="16">
          On the ALP's position, I have already touched on the negligent role played by the ALP and those of the party who once sought
          <break page="8943" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           to speak on behalf of regional and rural communities. There is no voice for the regions in the ALP caucus in this parliament, and that lack of voice is reflected in the ALP stance on these reforms.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The fact that the member for Banks has been allowed to run his ideological agenda at the expense of the people of the regions is a disgrace. Those who have not stood up to him and sought a different, less biased viewpoint should hang their heads in shame. Those metropolitan Australians who are such vociferous opponents of this bill and yet hide behind the reality that the land they own and occupy is immune from any aspect of native title or the Native Title Act are nothing but hypocrites, and their opinions should be viewed as such.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I turn now to the legislation at hand. I spent the past 18 months working closely with the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) and others in coordination with Senator Minchin. I would be lying if I said that those negotiations were at all times amicable and I would be dishonest if I said that I did not have some continuing concerns.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Those concerns include the priority given by this legislation to representative bodies in the right to negotiate process. I still have doubt about the capabilities of those bodies in such a process—doubts that I am sure are shared by the member for the Northern Territory, who knows better than most the adversarial approach often taken by these bodies.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In my electorate, the Aboriginal legal rights movement holds considerable sway. Its correspondence with miners in the region is notorious, as are its draft budgets which it bills miners for before exploration licences are granted. In order to clear a tenement area, it is expected that an applicant will provide for two anthropologists, one male and one female, at $600 a day; eight traditional owners at $250 a day; an interpreter at $350 a day; a vehicle at $125 a day; fuel costs; hire of GPS equipment at $320 a week; food at $40 per person a day; travel costs; and accommodation plus a 15 per cent administration fee.

          <para first-indent="16">
           That is simply amazing, especially for a body that has received almost $5 million in taxpayer funding over the past five years. If that is the sort of attitude struck by such a powerful representative body, then I must doubt the capacity of such bodies to manage the right to negotiate process.

          <para first-indent="16">
           There are obviously significant problems with the Native Title Act as it stands. This bill will go a good way towards remedying those problems. Many of the uninformed may criticise my stance as somehow racist or naive. While it may be naive to believe that we should not divide Australia on the basis of the colour of people's skin, surely there can be no other acceptable moral choice.

           In closing, I would like to speak of an incident I encountered before I was a member of this House. I was out in the Pitjantjatjara land with the now Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) whose interest in Aboriginal affairs is longstanding. As a lowly candidate at the time, I was quietly listening along with many of the elders of Ernabella or Pukatja.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           On my way back to the airfield, I travelled with one of the elders. After 15 or 20 minutes of silence, he quietly asked me, `Are you related to them Wakelins at Port Adelaide?' I told him I was, that my son was at the football club and that my nephews were also footballers.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           In no time at all we were deep in conversation on the merits of Port Adelaide. He told me of a recent match played in Alice Springs that many of the people of Ernabella had gone to see. A centralian team was playing the Port Adelaide football team. The Ernabella people were barracking with the best, not for the almost wholly Aboriginal centralian team, but for Port Adelaide. Why? Because they shared the Ernabella football club's colours.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           There was no racial divide, no bitter history, no talk of hate or despair. There were just people sharing in a common love of football. That kind of attitude must characterise our future direction for the benefit of all Australians and that attitude is reflected in the provisions of this just bill. I commend this bill to the House.

           Native Title Amendment Bill 1997
          </xref>
          saddens me, and I will say a little about why in just a moment. We are coming in this discussion of the Wik legislation to what, hopefully, will be the culmination of what has been in modern times a 30-year attempt to grant to Australia's Aboriginal people the dignity of ownership of the land and the right to negotiate that goes with that land.

        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Mabo decision of the High Court, subsequently further clarified by the Wik decision of the High Court, has made it very clear that there is only one way that this final stage can go. I think that was eminently well summed up by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in his contribution in this debate the other day when he said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The government must come to understand that native title rights are a reality and that they are here to stay. They have been recognised by the High Court as fundamental legal property rights and are entitled to the same respect and protection as the property rights of non-indigenous Australians.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         I think that is at the heart of the debate over this bill and that is why Labor wants to make substantial changes to the bill. We believe that this bill contains several measures which are a last-ditch attempt, either by subterfuge or quite openly, to extinguish native title as it has been decreed by the High Court. That being the case, we cannot accept it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The member for Grey and others before him have said that the government and the nation should be focusing their efforts on eradicating the dreadful inequality in the treatment of Aboriginal people in Australia, particularly those living outside mainstream areas, and of non-indigenous people in relation to schools, health facilities, roads, transport and all the other things that go with our life and government investment in our life. I agree with that, but the point that I make is that we need to move on from this point about the ownership of the land and the right to negotiate. Back when the Hawke government was first elected it was called the power of veto and back when Whitlam tried to tackle it it was simply called land rights.

          The principles of the decision of the High Court have been opposed by the coalition at every step since Gough Whitlam tried to give it effect in 1972. Even now when the High Court has given up on the politicians and has responded in two decisions clarifying that there is a land right and that, provided certain conditions are met, that land right stands, we have this last&amp;hyphen;ditch attempt to extinguish native title as it has been granted by the High Court.

          Can I relate two or three instances in my experience as the member for Burke which have fortified my opinions and judgments on this issue. In 1986, not long after I was elected to parliament, I travelled as part of a delegation to Kakadu and witnessed the start of what was supposed to be a grand new era: the approval of the uranium mine and the package of dollar compensation that went with it. Everybody at the time believed that that money would produce opportunities in one form or other.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I went back to Kakadu last year, 10 years after the event, to look at other issues related to the expansion of mining. I found that, $20 million down the road, alcoholism and Aboriginal illiteracy were worse. We did not even have an Aboriginal school teacher for grade 6 kids, for heaven's sake! We did not have a hostel where kids coming in from outlying districts, sometimes travelling for anything up to two hours across the bush to school, could stay in the town. It became very clear to me that this is not about money.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I have to commend, in particular, the Australian mining industry. For the first year or so of our time in opposition I had the portfolio of resources and energy and I had a lot to do with the mining companies, including quite active participation in the negotiation of the solution at Century Zinc in Queensland. The Australian mining industry has impressed me; they too know that this is not about dollars. They know it is about negotiating: negotiating jobs, negotiating a role, negotiating dignity in partnership with the mining ventures.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We have seen a lot of examples of this falling into place. I observe, for instance, the recent publication from the Australian Bureau

           of Statistics for the June quarter 1997 entitled

           </emphasis>
           . It starts off by saying that the upward trend in exploration expenditure since the June quarter 1993 continued in the June quarter 1997. Here is physical evidence from the ABS that all these claims that native title is scaring away miners are just that—junk claims. The evidence from ABS is that it has been a consistent upward trend from the day the act came in. I think it ought to be exposed for that. What is at the heart of this is that 30&amp;hyphen;year resistance to the concept of ownership of the land for these people. That was the first experience that I wanted to relate to you—the visit to Kakadu. The other was much closer to my home base at Kyneton.

          In the bicentennial year of 1988 the then Shire of Metcalfe, a small rural council, which was amalgamated but does not exist any more, as its contribution to the bicentennial year commissioned a woman—I apologise to the House, I forget her name—to do a history of the Metcalfe Shire. This area is about 100 kilometres north of Melbourne. It is just south of Bendigo for those who wonder where it might be.

          That history, when it was tabled and presented, shocked me. I had expected the normal thing you get in a shire history: these are the people who settled here first; this is who became the mayor; this is how the mayor's family have carried on right down through the last 100 years—all the wonderful stuff that we have with a history that starts in 1850. But this woman went right back and she gave a deploringly vivid account of the systematic poisoning, hunting and driving out of the Aboriginal community that existed in quite large numbers in central Victoria prior to the 1840s. I read that.

They know exactly what the provisions mean. That was on offer to John Howard. The offer was made by Labor.

          In respect of the areas relating to pastoral leases, let me say again that I agree—I think Kim Beazley summarised our position very well—with what he had to say in his opening response to the Prime Minister's tabling document. It is true, in our view, that the measures which moved towards redefining what is meant by a `lease' and redefining what is meant by `farming activities' represent a massive overreach of what was defined by the leases when they were issued by the state governments and what is meant by a `grazing lease'. To expand that definition so that it covers a whole lot of things that were not intended when the lease was issued is, in fact, a granting of a new lease which expands the nature of the title and therefore extinguishes the rights of the Aboriginal people who would otherwise qualify. I keep making that point. That is an overreach we cannot support.

          To use the tax act definition of farming for what essentially is a grazing lease, again, is a massive overreach and it does represent a clear curtailment of the common law rights of indigenous people.

What is the point of our bringing a bill through this House, even if Labor went along with it, knowing very well that it would not stand up before the High Court and that we would be right back into that 10&amp;hyphen;year process of uncertainty?

The facts will catch up with the member as the debate ensues.

         Contrary to what the member for Burke was quite wrongly representing, this legislation is designed to maintain respect under the law for native title as determined by the High Court. If we study the words of the member for Burke in his contribution just a few moments ago, the conclusion would have to be made, if we were not aware of what the bill intends to do, that it was going to take away the native title rights and abolish the Mabo common law judgment. That is absolutely untrue.

         I want to say from the outset that the government has reiterated and confirms in this legislation, if you study it closely, that it is committed to respecting the native title rights of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders, as this parliament should.

         The government takes the view that the common law judgment of the High Court in Mabo, delivered some five years ago now, was a very important day for indigenous Australians and was recognition at last of the struggle of Eddie Mabo's family to have recognition of their common law rights in respect of the Mabo lands. The coalition government does not in any shape or form intend to be associated with the words of the member for Burke or to allow him to get away with the misrepresentation that this legislation is designed to destroy that judgment. It is quite the reverse.

I felt that I should mention that I have them because, obviously, part of this debate involves the activities of exploration and mining in Australia. Whilst my shares are very minute, nevertheless I felt it was my duty to just mention that I have that interest because mining and exploration are part of Australia's economic activity and are very important to its future. I am very concerned to ensure that Australia does have a vibrant, modern mining industry to go into the next millennium.

         I also want to mention that I have seen the operation of the Keating Native Title Act 1993 in my own electorate of Indi. Members would know of the claim that is referred to throughout Australia now as the Yorta Yorta claim. It covers a substantial part of my electorate in north-east Victoria—not only a large mass of land in north-east Victoria but also the rivers and streams, and one of them is the great river, the Murray River. So you can imagine how much interest has been engendered in the constituency I represent and in my own mind about the workings of the Keating Native Title Act and how it has impacted on the lives and the communities of the indigenous people in my electorate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Based on the Yorta Yorta's view of what the Mabo decision means, the processes of the Federal Court, the Native Title Tribunal and the registrars that were set out in the 1993 Keating legislation—which this bill amends—have defied, if you like, the best efforts of everybody to bring everybody together. The conciliation and consultative process failed. I think it is fair for me to say that the judge presiding in those areas finished up saying that it was absolutely impossible to bring the parties together because of the uncertainties of the legislation and the competing claims. As a result of that, regretfully, that case is now before the Federal Court and there are various estimates on the duration of that case,
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          but it is estimated in some legal quarters that it will take five years to determine.

         So for members of the opposition who spawned the 1993 legislation—and we had the member for Burke representing them a moment ago—to tell this House and the community that the native title legislation they brought in is good legislation and is working well in the interests of all indigenous people is quite absurd. I just wish the truth would come out and people would come down and analyse the Yorta Yorta issue to see how it is operating.

        <para first-indent="16">
         As chair of the committee and as an Australian, I express my alarm at the damage that that inadequate, unsatisfactory legislation is causing our Australian indigenous people. It has heightened their expectation in some quarters. It has led to these massive, frightening legal sagas. These cases are just rolling on and on and on for years and years at huge cost. Regretfully, in some areas of our community, this has caused division between Australians—indigenous and non-indigenous—because some people, rightly or wrongly, have felt threatened by applications for native title, and the Yorta Yorta claim is no exception.

         I feel very strongly about that because, let us face it, it is hard enough for indigenous people.

         For any member of the Labor Party to stand up and belittle the Prime Minister's efforts to resolve those difficulties, to put obstacles in his way and to misrepresent his work is shameful. I believe that what they are doing is capitalising on the political heat that has generated from such irresponsible statements, and it is not in the interests of indigenous people, non-indigenous people or Australia for them to get away with it. This legislation is an opportunity for people to be non-party political and to work together to resolve the mess that the Labor Party created in bringing in legislation which it said would do certain things but has not.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For example, the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, in his own preamble to the 1993 legislation, declared that pastoral leases would extinguish common law native title. As a result, many people accepted that, came together and agreed to compromise. In some sense, they supported the 1993 legislation. As it has transpired, that statement about the question of extinguishment by pastoral lease is under a legal cloud and it needs to be addressed to give certainty.

         No caring Australian could argue against that principle. It needs to be addressed openly, transparently and in a positive way to remove uncertainty. What do we find?

I think that is shameful.

         The next point I want to make is that, if you study the systems of land tenure in Australia since white settlement, you will see that there has always been a need for people in the public interest to compromise so that when you have legislation like this, which attempts to settle the differences between competing interests and parties, you should balance it against the historical performance of land tenure systems in Australia. When the freehold systems were developed—first of all,
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          the common law&amp;hyphen;general law titles of Australia and then followed by the Torrens system of title giving indefeatable titles—there were always qualifications about the rights of the Crown. It was always stated that the Crown would be paramount in certain respects.

         After Federation, the Australian constitution provided that the taking of people's property by the Commonwealth had to be accompanied by adequate compensation and could not be taken unless there was adequate compensation. But the right to take property has been set out quite clearly in the constitution since Federation. All the states also have power to take property from property owners. In some cases, the states do not have to pay adequate compensation, although most of the state parliaments have passed legislation acknowledging that adequate compensation should be paid.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But take water, for example, which is one of the issues involved in the Yorta Yorta claim. The rights of Australian freeholders to water have been severely curtailed by the parliaments. It is important that water be managed properly in the public interest because it is a finite resource. In fact, in Victoria, my state, 50 per cent of our water resource is already consumed by the existing residents, and commercial and farming activities in that state. So it is a very precious commodity.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Years ago, Alfred Deakin in Victoria was the pioneer of water legislation which eventually led to the Victorian parliament actually confiscating—might I say without compensation at all—the water rights of freehold people in Australia. Ground water, underwater water reserves, and water in water courses, rivers, creeks and the like now belong to the Crown. Previously, some title owners would have had some claim to them.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Similarly with minerals: the history of land tenure systems in Australia has acknowledged that it is in the public interest that the elected parliaments, state and federal, have control over those mineral resources that are below the surface in this country. So it is that freehold owners of land in this country do not have the right to prevent exploration or to stop mining. They have certain inputs into the
         <break page="8950" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          process  which are set out in state acts of parliament dealing with access, compensation, disturbance of soil and perhaps royalties in some cases. But the minerals are owned by the Crown, not by the individual freeholders.

         I make these comments simply to put in context the Labor Party attack on this legislation, which is designed to do things that are absolutely urgent and which does not take away the common law rights of indigenous people as set out in the High Court judgment. Nevertheless, the indigenous people should be judged in the light of the fact that all other property owners in Australia since white settlement have had to give up some of their rights—under their freehold rights or otherwise—because public policy has determined it appropriate that the management of resources be vested in the Crown in certain ways.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I feel it is important to point that out because it does diminish the worth of the contributions made by Labor Party members who are trying to argue that this legislation does awful things. It does not at all. It reduces uncertainty, which has to be done because we cannot go on the way we are due to the failure of the 1993 legislation of the Labor government. It improves the workability of the process of determining whether native title exists or not. And that has to be done to help bring people together, to stop confrontation. It finds a balance, using wisdom, insight and judgment—but a correct judgment—amongst the interests of all of the parties designed to bring them together.

         Finally, and most importantly, it maintains respect for native title as determined by the High Court in the Mabo decision. It does not extinguish those rights. Furthermore, at the end of the period under the legislation when the statutory framework for dealing with these claims expires, it preserves the common law rights of people to make claims for native title under the judgment of the Mabo decision of the High Court. That has to be recognised as being a very responsible approach being taken by the government.

         It would be foolish to address this issue without acknowledging some of those events. There has been a systematic discrimination against Aboriginal and Islander people for the last 200 years which cannot be compared to the problems beset by any other group in this community. Yes, there are many groups in the community, and individuals particularly, who have a disadvantage from one perspective or another, but there is no other group which has been systematically discriminated against by the state over many years. This is not a political point; it happens to have been a fact of life for all political persuasions over the course of democratic governments in this century and, prior to that, colonial government. There has been systematic discrimination.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The horrific thing is how recent that systematic discrimination has continued. In the state of Queensland, for example, it has only been in the last 20 to 24 years that Aboriginal and Islander people have been allowed to work for a wage and keep it. Until the mid-1970s, Aboriginal and Islander people who worked side by side with anyone else in a full award paying job were not allowed to get an award wage. The state government, through legislation, took the money from them and put it into an account—not their account; a state Treasury run account. To this day, the millions of dollars that were taken from those people have never been returned to them—some are still alive—or their families.

         That systematic deprivation of economic liberty was not imposed upon any other individuals in our society at any time. But, in the state of Queensland, Aboriginal and Islander people were denied the opportunity to ever get any economic independence in our society. It is a matter of some shame that successive Queensland governments have been unable to properly address the question of the wages that were stolen by law, but nonetheless stolen, from those people.

          Let me now quickly turn to some of the provisions that are before us, having made some comments about the background. There has been a lot of debate in the community and some in this House about the rights of people with land ownership and how the wishes of Aboriginal and Islander people in respect of the Wik High Court decision will somehow affect people's ownership rights. I have spoken to a lot of people in my electorate and around Brisbane about this. There is a great deal of surprise when you tell people that the pastoralists we are talking about do not actually own the land. They have never bought it. They do not own it today. They have never owned it at any time in their life. Their parents did not own it. No-one has owned it. It has been leased; it has been rented.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There is a perception in the community, which some in this debate are happy to continue to foster, that these people are pastoralists—but they may be third, fourth or fifth generation pastoralists—and that that land is theirs because they have paid for it, they have bought it and they have a freehold in the same way that people in my electorate in Brisbane know and feel they own the house that they bought and are living in. That is not the case, but the view that the indigenous people have set out in relation to freehold land should be noted for the record. I am referring to a document put out in June this year by ATSIC on issues for indigenous peoples. In this document they said:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          . . . it is accepted that private freehold grants and residential leases extinguish native title . . .
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          That is plain enough. The Aboriginal and Islander people are not contesting that. It is about time a bit of honesty entered this debate and people understood that we are not talking about freehold. In this particular area, we are talking about pastoral leases and leasehold land.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          What have the indigenous groups said about that? The document that was prepared in
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

          What is wrong with that? They are saying that they are quite happy to legislate and put into the law an acknowledgment that the rights people have under their leases will be enshrined in the statutes. That seems to me to be quite reasonable. But the problem with it is that a lot of those people who have got leases have done things beyond the rights of their lease. Pastoralists have gone beyond their legal rights. They have rented the property—in very many cases for not much payment—and, having done that for many years and enjoyed the land as if it was theirs in freehold, they now want you to believe they should have the rights of freehold.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          They have been caught out by the Wik decision. Their past practices of exceeding their rights as tenants—their past practice of doing more than their lease allows them to do—have now been brought into question. The High Court has said and the Aboriginal and Islander community have said that they are happy to support a view wherein those rights extinguish native title rights to the extent of any inconsistency, but that does not mean that Aboriginal and Islander people have no rights at all on that land, because leasehold rights are not the same as freehold. They do not afford unfettered opportunity to do what you like with the property. It is a lease.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There are people who are leaseholders who want to turn their lease rights into ownership rights and they want to do that at the expense of Aboriginal and Islander people.

          I quickly want to mention the tax act definition of primary production that has been thrown in here. Mr Deputy Speaker, do you know why the government has decided to define primary industries broadly under the tax act definition? It is precisely because of what I said before: the government knows that there are a lot of pastoralists out there who have breached their leases and have done things that they were not entitled to do. So to cover that, they are going to introduce a new definition. They are now going to legislate to enable those pastoralists to do whatever it is the tax act says is primary industry, even if they never had the right to do that in the past under their lease. And that is fair play—fair play against a group of indigenous people who have got a High Court decision that says otherwise!

          There are two final things that I will quickly say. I listened to a comment earlier in the debate from one of the government members about how mining has been devastated as a result of the High Court decision and our earlier native title. Yesterday, the ABS figures for actual and expected private mineral exploration came out. Members on the other side were making an argument that suited their political purpose; these are the facts. I am quoting from the document released just yesterday. It says:

          In other words, in precisely the four&amp;hyphen;year period in which members of the government say that investors have been running away from us and that the mining industry is being destroyed, the ABS tells us that mining exploration has gone up again in the last quarter as it has right through from June 1993. So no more of the scare tactics about how we are frightening away investment. We are not. The legislation you are putting

         The ALP alleges that requiring the claimants to be more accountable in their claims and the fact that claims are of one particular racial group constitute racism and contravene the Racial Discrimination Act—hence its attack on its constitutionality. It is a pretty long bow, pretty spurious. In fact, the ALP says that, because it does not satisfy the Racial Discrimination Act, it would be subject to High Court attacks and therefore struck down. Quite honestly, I think that the opposition know that that is not true. In fact, they say its constitutionality is flawed because it is a dilution, as I said, of the group's rights, but do they not have the same accountability? Are they not required to be accountable?

         We would say, using the pendulum analogy, that the rights have swung to one particular racial group. In fact, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said on many occasions that the rights have swung far too far. This legislation brings the situation back to a more cohesive and a fairer middle ground. This legislation is not racially discriminatory. In legal advice to the government from the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's Department, several opinions state that this legislation is not discriminatory. In fact, it just goes to the fact that the Australian Labor Party is trying to turn this into a race debate, as we saw the member for Banks (Mr Melham) do in the Northern Territory recent election.

         I address the Law Reform Commission's criticism of this bill in their draft which was waved around today. Alan Rose, who has attacked the constitutionality of this bill—as was said by the Attorney-General (Mr Williams)—was a former employee of that department. He is a former disgruntled lawyer of the Attorney-General's Department. In fact, he is obviously one of the Labor Lawyers; he belongs to the Labor Lawyers association. He is an acolyte acting on behalf of the Labor Party in terms of this matter. He is simply doing their bidding. He knows that he comes from one philosophical viewpoint. If you want to go out and get an opinion on any matter from a QC, those who interpret the law can interpret it their way. This is what Mr Rose is doing.

As a member of the Reconciliation Council, he gets his sitting fee as a lawyer. He has a vested interest in defending these claims. As a former minister in this parliament, he continues to get his superannuation. He should declare this and let us know that he has a commercial interest in this.

         For example, in my own state of Western Australia—the state most affected by native title—around 82 per cent is under some form of native title claim. Much has been said about the cost to the mining industry since this act came in. We know that the mining industry not only contributes huge amounts to Australia's export economy but creates jobs. Some say that there is growth despite the native title problem, and I am sure that is true in many areas, but it is also true that it is holding up the whole matter of certainty in the mining industry.

This case is holding up the second stage of development on the Ord River dam project. This project is worth untold millions, not only to the state of Western Australia but to Australia. There are people laying spurious claims over that area. They know that they do not have a legitimate title right to that area but they think that, if they can register an interest, there is a good chance, by being involved in the right to negotiate, of some sort of financial settlement, if it is settled before it can be decided in legislation. This is true of a number of projects north of the 26th parallel, especially in Western Australia. They have just been held up because of the overlapping claims and the unholy interest in being registered as having a claim and the right to negotiate and what that does.

         We have seen numerous compensation claims paid out. For example, the Anaconda mining project in Western Australia recently negotiated a claim with the local claimants. But, by agreeing to a claim outside any legal framework, the legitimacy of that claim is thrown into doubt in relation to its absolute land title. In other words, you can negotiate an agreement over a particular mining area, but at some time in the future you will again have a problem when either that particular agreement finishes or that mining tenement finishes. This is because native title has not been decided even though there might have been a commercial agreement. That does not give certainty to anybody, especially future generations of claimants.

         The opposition's biggest stumbling point in this is, as I have said, the right to negotiate provision, which contributes to the problem with overlapping claims. In relation to the right to negotiate, let me say that I could not believe it when the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) said the right to negotiate was in common law. It is not. The right to negotiate was never part of the 1993 act. It was referred to in the preamble—just as Keating referred to the fact that there was no native title over pastoral leases—but the opposition always sought to treat it as a core part of the legislation.

In fact, when challenged later by the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), conceded that that is the case, but that at some time in the future there may be a common law right. Saying that there may be a common law right is a lot different from saying there is a common law right.

I can assure you that they individually tell us that they are pretty angry that they cannot determine these matters on their behalf.

          The threshold test will determine whether, under the original Mabo legislation, there was a legitimate claim.

But this has to be a physical attachment to the land, not a spiritual attachment. As Judith Watson, a former Labor member in Western Australia, said in relation to the Yackabindie nickel project, the planes could not fly over the project because the spirits would be entering heaven and that would contravene some right. That is crazy. How high would a plane have to fly over the project before it did not contravene a right?

          I want to move to the matter of the sunset clause. The ALP's third major disagreement with our legislation is the sunset clause which will come into effect six years after the implementation of this legislation. I should point out that claimants can go to the Federal Court if their claims are rejected by the tribunal. If, after the amount of publicity, a claim has not been made in the six&amp;hyphen;year period, I will be most surprised if people do not continue to find and resurrect pieces of land that were not found in that six&amp;hyphen;year period. The 10&amp;hyphen;point plan legitimately delivers native title to the claimants, and certainly to the land&amp;hyphen; and leaseholders. It has brought the act and the spirit of native title back to the middle ground. Hopefully, we will begin to see more indigenous people gain from the changes to the act.

A freehold disposal of these airports, however, requires

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Before I turn to the specifics of the proposed amendments I would like to briefly elaborate on the reasons for the government's decision. While the airports included in phase 1 were all airports of national and international significance, the 15 airports in phase 2 are diverse. Some are major national airports while others are principally of regional and local significance, many with a large general aviation base.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Freehold sale of the general aviation airports and the smaller regional airports will provide greater opportunities for those airports to be integrated into the policy and planning frameworks of state and local authorities. The sites would cease to be Commonwealth places and in the future the states and territories would assume the responsibility for planning and environment controls on the airports.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is logical and consistent with the practice adopted under the previous government's aerodrome local ownership program where some 230 local airports were transferred under freehold title to local owners, a number of which are far larger in terms of revenue and aircraft traffic volumes than some of those now being proposed to be disposed of by freehold sale.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Unlike the major airports, these airports are principally intrastate in their traffic and their non&amp;hyphen;aviation activities are more locally orientated, with a local community focus and impact. A freehold sale of these airports provides an opportunity for a strengthened association with local community interests—those best placed to influence the development and operation of the airports in a manner conducive to fulfilling regional aspirations—without a Commonwealth overlay of controls in the areas of planning and environment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Existing Commonwealth controls over safe operations, flight paths and aircraft noise would be unaffected, but the question of how an airport's operations interlink and interact with the community in which it is located would become a matter for the state or territory concerned. The Commonwealth will require, however, before an airport is sold
         <break page="8960" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          freehold that the relevant state government undertakes to ensure that state or territory and local laws do not jeopardise continued airport operations and that the core airport site will be restricted to continued use as such. The Commonwealth wants to ensure that any airport sold freehold continues to be used as an airport, and is reserving the option of leasing any of these airports if the required assurances are not forthcoming from the relevant state or territory governments.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As mentioned earlier, in order to allow for freehold sale of some of the phase 2 airports it is necessary to amend the Airports (Transitional) Act 1996. Those amendments are contained in schedule 1 to the bill and their main provisions are to facilitate the transfer of: land from the Federal Airports Corporation to the purchaser; the assets, liabilities, contracts and employees directly to the purchaser following the transfer of land; and the relevant staff at each of the airports to the purchaser.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As for the phase 1 sales, it will be important that the jobs and entitlements of FAC staff at the airports to be sold will not be threatened by the disposal process. Therefore, whether the airports are to be leased or sold, staff and management will be transferred to the relevant airport entity immediately upon sale. Existing awards, enterprise agreements and contracts of employment will transmit to the new airport lessees or airport entity which will ensure that airport staff retain key terms and conditions of employment and entitlements to accrued benefits following their transfer. Following the transfer of staff, the terms and conditions of their employment, as contained in awards, enterprise agreements and contracts of employment, will be able to be varied only according to the terms of those agreements.

         There are two minor amendments to the stamp duty provisions in the Airports (Transitional) Act. Firstly, item 14 of the bill provides that, post sale, an entity is not liable to stamp duty in respect of an instrument which was executed by the FAC before sale. This is an extension of the existing provisions under section 47 of the Airports (Transitional) Act in regard to a leasehold disposal. Its purpose
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          is to ensure that an airport company does not become liable to pay stamp duty in respect of an instrument to which the FAC was party and which was formerly exempt from duty. Any alteration to the instrument after sale which would attract stamp duty is not exempted by this provision.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Secondly, item 15 of the bill is to extend the application of section 48 of the Airports (Transitional) Act to freehold entities. Section 48 ensures that stamp duty is payable in circumstances where the sale is affected by making of a declaration vesting the freehold in the airport entity. That section provides that, where stamp duty would have otherwise been payable, it is not exempt just because the transfer of the airport was affected by a ministerial declaration.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is one minor amendment, item 16, to the special income tax rules in the legislation and that is to extend to a freehold entity the power of the minister to make a declaration that the Income Tax Assessment Act applies to the FAC as though it had received payment for the disposal. This provision was used in the phase 1 sales to declare the value for tax purposes on the assets disposed by the FAC.

         As for the phase 1 sales, I am not proposing to utilise the determination provisions available in sections 49, 50 and 51 of the Airports (Transitional) Act.

         This bill also contains amendments to the Airports Act 1996 which are proposed to streamline the regulatory regime for the leased federal airports. Schedule 2 of the bill covers four main areas, which I will deal with in turn.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Firstly, section 5 of the Airports Act specifically defines a joint&amp;hyphen;user airport as Canberra, Darwin and Townsville. The Department of Defence is currently considering the nature of its operations at Canberra Airport and the status of the airport may change in the future. The bill will amend section 5 of the Airports Act to enable a regulation to be made declaring that Canberra would no longer

         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Secondly, section 33 of the Airports Act provides that an airport lessee company cannot enter into an airport management agreement with another person unless that person is both approved in writing by the minister and a qualified company within the meaning given under the act. The Airports Act also provides that the minister cannot approve an airport management company if it breaches ownership restrictions under the act.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Since the ownership restrictions in part 3 of the act already apply to an airport management company, the provision is unnecessary and so the bill provides for the requirement to be repealed. In its place the Minister for Transport and Regional Development will retain a simple power to determine by disallowable instrument whether a specific agreement is, or is not, an airport management agreement, and to not approve any agreements if there are concerns with them. The government wishes to take advantage of the benefits that foreign management expertise can bring to Australia's airports, but it remains important that any structures designed to circumvent the public policy objectives of the legislation can be denied.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Thirdly, section 192 of the act provides that the minister may determine that each airport service provided at an airport will be a declared service for the purposes of the access regime set out in part 111A of the Trade Practices Act 1974, except to the extent to which a service is the subject of an access undertaking given within 12 months after the airport is leased to the private sector.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill proposes to give authority to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, to determine by disallowable instrument which activities at an airport fit within the relevant definition of an `airport service' as a result of a determination by the minister. This amendment will ensure that the ACCC has the capacity to clarify situations where doubt arises about the scope of an `airport service' that has been declared as a result of the minister's determination.

          Fourthly, subsection 242(1) of the Airports Act provides for applications to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of certain decisions made by the minister. Those decisions concern the approval of master plans, major development plans and environment strategies, including variations to master plans and major development plans and environment strategies.

          Under the act, the airport lessee is required to undertake wide public consultation prior to submitting draft master plans, major development plans and environment strategies to the minister for approval. The minister then either approves or refuses to approve the draft plans having regard to the matters to be considered as set out in the act, including: whether an airport development would assist airport users; how the airport and surrounding areas are affected; comments made by interested and affected parties as part of the public consultation process; and the environmental impact.
          <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
           These procedures are comprehensive and permit soundly based decisions to be made by the minister. The amendments ensure that these decisions will be open to the scrutiny of the parliament. The minister is required to prepare and table in both houses of parliament a statement about these decisions, except to the extent that the commercial interests of a person would be substantially prejudiced. This will also bring these provisions into line with planning processes under state law.

          In addition to these four changes, the bill will insert a number of notes to existing sections of the Airports Act to clarify the way in which state law applies to airport activities. Schedule 3 of the bill extends the corporation's functions to include assisting in the sale of a federal airport by way of freehold disposal. This removes any ambiguity as to whether the corporation is empowered to assist in the disposal of its assets by this means and provides the board with an assurance that they are clearly operating within their responsibilities.

          In conclusion, I would like to note that the government's airport sales process and the post&amp;hyphen;sale regulatory regime, which has been put in place, is making Australia a world leader in airport ownership and management. It provides the opportunity for the utilisation of private sector investment and expertise at Australia's airports.

          There is already a great deal of investor interest in the next tranche of airports, particularly in regional areas. The proposed measures outlined in this bill will maximise the opportunities for the development of regional airports and will provide a more streamlined and effective regulatory regime. Given the need to provide certainty to airport bidders and airport users, it is essential that this legislation be passed in the current sittings to meet the airport sales timetable. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.

         The House of Representatives does not accept the amendment for two reasons.

It is the executive which will be held accountable to the parliament and ultimately to the electorate for its performance in that regard. Secondly, the framework of clause 37, as amended by the Senate, would provide scope for the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General to be drawn in as an unwitting party to the often political issues that members and senators may wish to pursue.

         He went on to say that it is generally the case that parliamentary committees are made up in the majority by members of the government and, therefore, the government would act to protect the national interest, to protect national interest issues. I think that clearly indicates what this particular section is all about as it stands in the bill before it was amended by the Senate and it perhaps indicates what the Senate had in mind in seeking to amend it.

          Clause 37 of the bill is specifically relevant to those areas which apply to national security. I would have thought that all members of this House would appreciate that it should not be left open for the Auditor-General to be interfered with in his decisions on matters of national security and national interest or, for that matter, for it to be left in the hands of a committee of the parliament to seek information that would go into the public arena in a way that could do great damage to Australia's standing on an international basis or otherwise.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I believe that in the drafting of the bill, as it was originally passed by this House, the government had this in mind, and I had many discussions on the need to ensure, firstly, that there was an unfettered power there for the Auditor-General as an officer of the parliament entrenched by these bills and, secondly, that the Auditor-General was not embroiled in political controversy brought about by some decision of a committee whereby the majority on that committee were not members of the executive government of the day.

          Clause 37 replicates a framework which has been in operation in the Audit Act 1901 for almost 20 years. The scope for intervention by the Attorney-General to prevent disclosure of particular kinds of information on public interest grounds is not extensive. In view of discussions I had on that very point, it was considered appropriate that the Attorney-General, again in the national interest, should give a certificate to the Auditor-General as to why information should be withheld by the Auditor-General. Again, that is to ensure that the maximum amount of accountability was there and at the same time we did not interfere with the national interest and particularly, as I say, the national security.

          If one were to imagine a worst case scenario that could occur under the Senate amendment it is possible to see how damage could be caused to Australia's national or international security and how the integrity of the Commonwealth's position could be undermined in ways that caused genuine damage to Australia.

          The House of Representatives believes that the framework in clause 37, unamended, has been proven to operate in a realistic and sensible way, having been used only once for reasons of national security. Moreover, clause 37 as drafted provides an added measure of accountability on the executive in that it compels the Auditor-General to report any intervention by the executive and the reasons for it. The House of Representatives believes that the framework provided for in clause 37 is sound and therefore disagrees with the Senate amendment.

          —The only point of difference between the opposition and the government on this whole package of legislation relates to clause 37. The legislative package itself dates back to 1989 and the work of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. It lapsed in previous years, principally because of an obstructive opposition at the time. As the Labor opposition, we support the legislative package. It is largely our creation. Whilst the former opposition delayed the package literally for years, in this parliament we have facilitated quick passage and intend to continue doing so.

         The Commonwealth needs modern financial systems in legislation and this package will deliver that. However, there is one matter of contention, and that relates to the power of the executive to gag the Auditor-General. Labor accepts that in some situations the national interest will be served by the non-disclosure of some information—for example,
         <break page="8964" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          sensitive Defence or foreign relations information. We agree with that position and, accordingly, support the right of the Attorney-General to issue a certificate under clause 37 in appropriate circumstances.

         I note that this power currently exists and apparently has been used only once over the last 20 years or so. I believe it was during the time of the Fraser government. However, the amendment which the Senate agreed to is designed to stop potential abuse of what is by any yardstick a very wide power given to the Attorney-General. The amendment of the Senate, whilst maintaining the general power of the Attorney, qualifies it in one important respect—namely, that the Attorney cannot issue a certificate to silence the Auditor-General about an issue on which the parliament, or a committee of the parliament, has requested information.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Just as the reserve power for the Attorney is important, so too is a legislative guarantee against the abuse of that power. Indeed, the unfortunate recent episode where we saw the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) seeking to gag the Law Reform Commission is a striking and contemporary illustration of the need for this kind of protection. We have had the Law Reform Commission seeking to make a submission concerning the native title legislation. We have had clear evidence that the Attorney-General has interfered with that process. His defences have been that this issue is outside the charter of the Law Reform Commission, yet the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Nick Minchin, has sought himself the views of the Law Reform Commission on the native title and Wik legislation.

         The Law Reform Commission routinely comments on inquiries by parliamentary committees. Indeed, the Attorney-General had to own up this afternoon to having tabled an annual report which gave a number of examples of that process in action. The Attorney-General had not even bothered to read it, according to his response this afternoon. The real reason for that attempt by the Attorney-General at suppression was political—the embarrassment of the government at the Law Reform Commission's findings that the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

         It was never a problem before that the Law Reform Commission made submissions to parliamentary committees and other bodies. So for this government, when the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) attacks Aborigines, that is free speech and ought to be celebrated but, when the Law Reform Commission wants to tell the government some home truths and tries to support Aborigines, that material ought to be suppressed and never see the light of day.

         In my view, this is not the kind of Attorney-General whom we would want to see having the kind of unlimited power which the government is seeking to provide for with its provision. It is clearly a political use of the Attorney-General's power to suppress what he has been engaging in. The matter was reported to the office of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) by the Chief of Staff to the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, Mr Hugh Funder. He spoke with the principal private secretary to the Prime Minister, Tony Nutt, to let him know what was going on. This was all about high politics, not some appropriate and genuine concern on the part of the Attorney-General about the Law Reform Commission exceeding its powers.

         I would have thought that the Democrats' amendment in the Senate is in fact enhancing the relationship between the Auditor-General and the parliament rather than perhaps reinforcing the relationship of the Auditor-General as a creature of or answerable to the executive. I would be interested in his response to that.

          —Very briefly, in response to the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), I can indicate that, if the honourable member for Moore looks at section 37 and the subsections there in terms of the provisions that are applicable, the circumstances in which the Attorney-General can in fact issue a certificate is very clear. That certificate can only be issued by the Attorney-General and, of course, reported on by the Attorney-General to the parliament where it is in the public interest to do so.

         This is about a protection of areas. I would have thought that the honourable member for Moore would understand more than anyone else that information will be forthcoming from committees of this parliament on a regular basis where the government is not in the majority, particularly in another place, if there is an opportunity given for base political purposes. I seek to avoid the national interest being affected by such decisions that are taken for base political purposes. I certainly would want to avoid any risk being put to national security. That is the basis for the clause as drafted. That right, that protection, is taken away by the amendment moved by the Democrats in the Senate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are very limited opportunities for the Attorney-General to issue such a certificate. I have indicated that in the past 20 years it has occurred on one occasion. I would have thought that the honourable member for Moore could imagine many situations in any single week where information is in the national interest. Dare I say it, events in New Guinea and Bougainville earlier this year might have been fairly relevant, but it would not have been in this government's interest
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          for that sort of information to be in the public arena. It is narrow. It is clearly in the public interest to have that there, and the amendment would destroy that protection which I believe is vitally important for this nation's future.

         We note that part of this bill is to make the Auditor-General an officer of the parliament and, against that background, we think it is appropriate that parliament should have some fetter on the powers of the Auditor-General. I emphasise that, for the Auditor-General to be truly independent, the Auditor-General is in a position to carry out his or her functions in the way that he or she sees fit. I do not think what is being proposed by the Senate gives rise to the prospect of parliamentary committees dictating to the Auditor-General in any shape or form.

         First, it is the proper role of the elected Executive to bear responsibility for preventing damage to the public interest  and it is the Executive which will be held accountable by the Parliament and, ultimately, the electorate for its performance in that regard. Secondly, the framework of clause 37, as amended by the Senate, would provide scope for the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General to be drawn in as an unwitting party to the, often, political issues that Members and Senators may wish to pursue.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         Clause 37 replicates a framework that has been in operation in the Audit Act 1901 for almost 20 years. The scope for intervention by the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General to prevent disclosure of particular kinds of information on public interest grounds is not extensive. The reasons listed in Clause 37(2) for the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General to issue a certificate relate only to matters of genuine importance and significance. If one were to imagine a worst case scenario that could occur under the Senate amendment, it is possible to see how damage could be caused to Australia's national or international security and how the integrity of the Commonwealth's position could be undermined in ways that caused genuine damage to Australia. Accordingly, the House of Representatives believes that it in not worth the risk to accept the Senate amendment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         The House of Representatives believes that the framework in Clause 37, unamended, has been proven to operate in a realistic and sensible way, having been used only once, for reasons of national security. Moreover, Clause 37, as drafted, provides an added measure of accountability on the Executive in that it compels the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General to report any intervention by the Executive and the reasons for it. The House of Representatives believes that the framework provided for in clause 37 is sound and therefore disagrees with the Senate amendment.

They should be commended for that, as should the employers of Australia that offered the 20,000 jobs. However, the stark reality is that these 20,000 jobs, even if they all eventuated, would do nothing of a fundamental nature to change the chronic and endemic unemployment that stagnates the economies of Australia and the developed world.

         For generations students were taught that increasing trade and investment, coupled with technological change, would drive national productivity and create wealth.

         In globalisation's previous incarnation governments had done little to protect working people from its

         Kapstein argues that governments are trying to break their postwar deal with workers while maintaining their commitment to an open economy. Governments cannot have it both ways and, instead, the policy focus should be on negotiating a package that helps workers adjust to ongoing changes. Kapstein says:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         If the concern is incoming inequality, policies should be adopted to close the income gap. If the concern is unemployment more jobs should be created. In developing positive solutions however, it is important to recognise that declining rates of economic growth caused largely by a drop off in productivity are hurting all workers.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         Governments from the mid&amp;hyphen;1980s until now have adopted policies deemed sustainable or credible by financial markets. These policies have privileged stability over employment, according to Kapstein. Restrictive economic policies, reduced deficits, reduced spending, reduced taxes and—the most exalted deity—low inflation have favoured financial interests at the expense of workers. Politicians and public officials who adopt these restrictive measures are labelled `responsible' by editorialists, and the markets reward their behaviour sustaining the ideology.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Kapstein says that governments essentially have four choices to assist their unskilled and semi&amp;hyphen;skilled work force. The first choice is protectionism, which is a remedy worse than the disease. The second is education and training, and that is perhaps the only policy intervention that meets with universal approval. Democratic societies should be financed. It makes for good politics and good economics. But, in the near term, it cannot provide the solution to the structural problems of employment and inequality.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The third approach is to increase the number of jobs through public works programs and employment subsidies to the private sector. Public job creation is relatively efficient and socially productive—since it provides younger workers with needed job experience—and it can be done fairly quickly. The fourth policy choice is tax reform, and perhaps eliminating income taxes altogether for a large number of the working poor while
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          making them sharply more progressive up the income ladder.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the main arguments against an expansionary strategy is that it is inflationary. Certainly, inflation is unwelcome, but so is unemployment, which in this country is more like 13 to 15 per cent and much higher than the admitted rate of almost nine per cent. Kapstein acknowledges that restrictive policies may have been necessary when first conceived in the 1980s to bring stability to financial markets, but they have failed too many people for too long.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The challenge to all governments is clear: restore growth and opportunity. Unfortunately, in this country of Australia that we all represent, realisation of the message that Ethan Kapstein brings—who was also one of the proponents of globalisation in a former life—totally escapes the Howard government.

          —Two Dunkley small businessmen have lost substantial sums of money investing in a phonecard vending machine business that had the backing of Telstra. Mr Gerhard Schulz and Mr Ted Hancock each lost $16,000 by investing in a business opportunity in 1993 promoted by General Vending (Australia) Pty Ltd, an associated company to Del-Marina Pty Ltd, which shared a common director, Mr Rod Montague Laski of Prahran East, Victoria.

          Age
         </emphasis>
         in early 1993 a `staggering 40 per cent minimum guaranteed return on your investment'. This same claim was reiterated in subsequent correspondence between Mr Laski and my constituents. The written guarantee promised that only sites that took revenue of at least $340 per week per machine would be selected. Naively but not unnaturally, as the associated company, Del-Marina Pty Ltd, had a distribution agreement with Telstra, they were among at least 19 small investors who believed these claims and purchased phonecard vending machines subsequently deployed at various retail outlets around Melbourne and Sydney.

         Companies like Telstra and those associated with it have an obligation to behave ethically.

          On 14 October 1994 after the Casualties of Telecom saga with one compensation payment of $2.3 million, Telstra CEO, Mr Blount, said in large advertisements that Telstra embraced `an approach based on honesty and integrity . . . values fundamental to the way we do business'. My constituents assumed Telstra would have conducted a full study on Del-Marina Pty Ltd in view of their distribution agreement and relationship.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Telstra suggested to potential investors that Del&amp;hyphen;Marina would be the sole source of new phonecard distribution outlets. The Telstra phonecard brand name was used in advertisements. My constituents assert that Telstra never enforced its agreement with Del&amp;hyphen;Marina which insisted investors read the distribution agreement, only provided to Mr Schulz four months after he had made his investment. In July 1993 Telstra stated that General Vending Pty Ltd was the trading arm of Del-Marina and that General Vending (Australia) Pty Ltd was now registered as a company.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         By September 1993 my constituents knew that the claimed return on investment was mythical. Mr Schulz complained to the Trade Practices Commission which advised that, with their limited resources, the matter did not involve widespread consumer detriment and therefore would not be pursued. Despite receiving complaints in mid-1992, Telstra failed to terminate General Vending's contract until 28 October 1993. Telstra knew of Mr Laski from previous dealings and had previously terminated a contract with him. This surprising reaffirmation of faith in Mr Laski by Telstra allowed General Vending to win around $1 million in revenue. Telstra benefited from more phonecard sales and a reduction in vandalism at public phone boxes.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         While Telstra offered to allow affected investors to supply phonecards to existing sites, this was impractical because a tiny number of people were supplying large areas by this time in view of the low returns from each machine. By October 1994 Telstra was indicating to Mr Schulz's solicitors that they might consider funding an action against Mr Laski, but nothing came of efforts to get Telstra to fund a class action against Mr Laski or the companies, justified by Telstra on the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          basis that General Vending was pending company deregistration. This was despite Telstra engaging solicitors to prepare a class action. Eventually, in April 1995, Telstra offered Mr Schulz $1,600 to use as he saw fit. Mr Rodney Laski did not cease as a director of General Vending (Australia) Pty Ltd until 24 April 1996 but had ceased his directorship with Del-Marina Pty Ltd on 2 February 1993. These vending machines were sold by General Vending for up to $1,800 each.

He now trades at Level 1, 391 St Kilda Road, Melbourne.

         Mrs Robyn Peet of Dingley, Victoria, obtained judgment against General Vending Pty Ltd, Del-Marina Pty Ltd and Conmorre Pty Ltd for $71,800 in February 1996. Mrs Peet had been pregnant at the time she originally invested $63,000. Mr Donald Smith obtained a judgment in the county court for $70,000 in November 1995 against Del&amp;hyphen;Marina and Mr Laski. In July this year Telstra wrote to Mr Schulz saying that they were unwilling to reopen their previous goodwill offer or renegotiate. Mr Laski is now offering so-called `club cards' for phone sex.

         I call upon Telstra to put aside its indifference and to again consider doing what it can to assist these investors.

There is another Noel Crichton&amp;hyphen;Browne kid—Senator Lightfoot—who is prepared to stand up for Western Australia. Today I received in my office a letter dated 26 September from Senator Lightfoot, senator for Western Australia. It is addressed to Senator Ian Campbell, senator for Western Australia, Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, and it says:

          May I also add, that with the combination of Native Title, Diesel Fuel Rebate capping, the removal of 23(pa), the Western Australia Government's soon to be implemented Gold Royalty, a worrying number of miners are on their fiscal knees. As the Nation's biggest dollar earner, I am becoming increasingly uncomfortable with my Government's indifferent, even irresponsible attitude to the mining industry.

          So let us hope, for the mineral and resources industries in WA, that Senator Campbell's disloyalty to the industry is not rewarded by a promotion into the cabinet over the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General and over the Minister for Family Services. Senator Campbell does not deserve to be promoted on the basis that he has monstrously and massively let down the Western Australia mineral resources and prospecting industries.

          One of the reasons for the success of the school is its initiative in reaching out to feeder schools. It has become a standard feature of the high school that students spend some time at feeder primary schools telling the pupils what the high school children are doing, especially in the environmental field. As Milton puts it, it is `kids teaching kids', and it has been very effective. They have been very proactive in environmental work and I fully support and encourage the principal, Milton Simmons, and a number of very professional and dedicated teachers.

          At the school they have the Kingscliff Enviro Club and membership is about one&amp;hyphen;third of the whole school from all age brackets. Their involvement with landcare projects includes dune regeneration work, reafforestation work at Kingscliff and river care. They won the NSW Landcare award in 1996, they were finalists for the Telstra Landcare Education Award in 1996, they won the Banksia Environmental Award in 1996, they were entrants in the NSW Landcare award this year and they are also now putting together a proposal for the United Nations Environment Programme Environmental Youth Forum for South Pacific and Asian nations.

Several very positive decisions came out of the conference and particularly the proposal for a youth congress which would talk directly to government. These three and others from the Kingscliff High School are actively working to bring people in the Tweed Valley into environmental programs. They participate in the activities of the local Tweed Valley Family and Youth Support Service—run by David Neely who is doing a very good job as a youth officer—and set up a Tweed Coast Youth Council which meets every month at the Kingscliff High School. They are discussing not just environment issues but public transport, other activities and facilities for young people.

         The best case scenario for price reductions under the government's plan on new releases is only about $2 to $3 per CD. This minor saving would hardly seem worth the potential cost to the industry and Australian jobs. While reducing the cost of consumer goods is a worthy cause, many would say the human price is too high.

          —On 30 July this year I conducted a youth forum on drugs at North Sydney Leagues Club. Students from nearly 21 local secondary schools as well as some prominent local guest speakers came along, including Alice Wood, who, at the age of 17, lost her 15-year-old sister, Anna, after she took an ecstasy tablet at a dance party, and Billy Moore, an Australian representative in rugby league who plays football for the local North Sydney Bears.

        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The discussion on this vital issue was forthright. I learnt from students that drugs such as marijuana and ecstasy are more common and accessible in our local schools than even I previously believed.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Gone are the stereotypical drug pushers who lurk in public toilets and laneways waiting for kids to finish school for the day. Now the dealers are students in the schools and, despite what older people may think, they no longer have to widely ply their trade. Students these days have more knowledge about where to get drugs than they do about what drugs actually contain and what they can actually do.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Some students at the forum spoke of peers who turn up to school stoned; others told of the frankness and openness with which marijuana use in particular is spoken about at school. Still others discussed the fairly sophisticated way in which credit for drug purchases is provided.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As our discussions continued, I was amazed at how undisturbed these students appeared to
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          be about the presence of illegal drugs in their lives, both at school and at parties. The stereotypical North Shore student shows no real intrigue and is not unfamiliar with the different types of drugs available, nor the various methods of use.

         But from almost all the approximately 40 students in the room I received an overwhelming message: fear campaigns such as the anti-smoking campaign are very effective. The ads show kids how uncool it is to smoke.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Currently, some influential figures in the lives of the average teenager send deadly messages. It could be a band like Oasis—who I happen to like—or singer Evan Dando, who put their song writing ability down to a permanent drug haze, or actor River Phoenix, whose death from a drug cocktail is attributed to merely `bad karma', that are inspiration for a student to give it a go.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          We need to fight back with a campaign illustrating how you can be successful, drug free and cool at the same time. We need some positive role models.

         The second demand of students was for a real life education campaign that was not couched in the usual rhetoric of a `teacher knows best' classroom. On the real life effects of drugs, we all have much to learn. For example, I was surprised by Billy Moore's comment that as a professional footballer he cannot stay in a room where people may be smoking marijuana, because the smoke from a joint will penetrate the pores of his skin. Of course, with the random drug tests in professional sport this could mean the end of a sporting career.

         In fact, it was a guest crown prosecutor who surprised students with a detailed treatise on exactly what goes into uppers like ecstasy, acid, and other laboratory manufactured drugs. He spoke of the contaminated backyard stills where drugs are mixed and cut with various substances in an environment that is a far cry from the sterile surroundings where legal pharmaceuticals are made. He concluded that if drug users could see and smell these garage factories they would not be so keen to ingest the finished products.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We should respond to the calls from students in my electorate with a two&amp;hyphen;pronged attack. Firstly, we must prove to young Australians that drugs are uncool. Secondly, we must  educate our youth and allow them to make informed decisions as mature, young adults. If we do not respond, then Anna Wood will be just one of many young people in our society who, after making a flippant and ill-informed decision, ended their lives in a manner which allowed them no opportunity to say, `This was a dumb idea after all.'

           National Firearms Program Implementation Bill
          </xref>
          had its genesis in the meetings of the Australasian police ministers in May and July of last year and, more particularly, the Port Arthur massacre of 28 April 1996. That massacre certainly encouraged the national campaign intended to bring in tighter gun laws in this country and to ensure a degree of uniformity.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It should be noted at the outset that one of the main accomplishments of the campaign concerned the matter of uniformity. Until the action of the government, with the support of the opposition, we had had a mishmash of different regulations around this country which undermined the credibility and the effectiveness of gun laws.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If we go back to the period just after that massacre, we find there was a variation in regards to minimum ages. In Queensland it was 17 years and 13 years on farms. In the ACT it was 18 years for a full licence and no minimum age for club use. In the Northern Territory it was 16 to 18 years. There were different requirements in regards to registration. There were different waiting periods for licensing ranging from five days on renewal in New South Wales to 21 days in all cases in Tasmania, et cetera. As you can see, one of the problems this country faced was the question of a lack of consistency and therefore the ability of people to play off different state and territory regulations where they found restrictions or problems for themselves in obtaining arms.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When we talk about Port Arthur, whilst it was certainly a massive jolt to this country, it should not be seen in isolation from the broader problem of gun deaths in Australia. It is worth noting that in the period 1987 to 1996, or at least up until Port Arthur, 124 people in Australasia had been gunned down in these massacres. The massacres ranged from the November 1990 Aramoana, New Zealand, massacre of 14 people and a further 13 wounded, through to the more well&amp;hyphen;known ones in this country, such as Hoddle Street and Strathfield.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There had been a clear problem in this country which, unfortunately, the political system failed to deal with. The reason it failed to deal with it was because a minority of people with very determined views were prepared to change their votes due to this one particular issue and so thwart the wishes of the majority of people.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         All surveys in this country have shown the determination of the vast majority of people to support tougher gun laws. If we go back to 1978, nearly two decades ago, a Morgan poll showed that 88.8 per cent were for registration of shotguns and .22 rifles and only 8.1 per cent were against it. That shows there has been consistent support in this country for tougher gun laws. Unfortunately, there had been a degree of political opportunism in this country, but that did not arise in this case, I am pleased to say.
        </para>
        <break page="8984" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          There is a minority of people out there who possess guns. We all know that possession of guns leads to certain attitudes in regards to restrictions on registration, licensing, et cetera. There is a minority out there who are prepared to put their votes on the line because of this gun issue and try to control the political system by their willingness to ignore all other issues and, essentially, determine policy in this area.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The momentum after Port Arthur was assisted not only by the determination of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the preparedness of the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) to stand by him, but, importantly, by the fact that the opposition did not choose to seek applause from that minority.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As early as 5 May, the opposition spokesman in this policy area, Senator Nick Bolkus, made a series of policy statements outlining where Labor stood in regard to tougher gun laws in this country. He called for the implementation of strict controls on the mail&amp;hyphen;order sale of firearms; uniform standards of qualification and training for gun owners; uniform standards for the security and storage of firearms; and a requirement for authorised gun dealers to record all transactions, et cetera.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          He also made very clear early on that the minister in this policy area in the previous government, the member for Denison (Mr Kerr), had already gone down a large part of this road that we have now reached. Essentially, what we have today are the kinds of measures that he had been pushing through at national ministerial meetings. There has been fundamental support from the major political parties in this system.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Those people who use the rhetoric of the silent majority, middle Australia, the majority of people et cetera, are the same people who will come into this parliament seeking to exploit that minority of people who feel victimised or feel that they suffer from having their rights taken away. The reality is that the majority of people very strongly support these rules.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is extremely important that, at this stage, Australia has accomplished this. All surveys show internationally, particularly in the United States, that there is a clear correlation between attitudes in regard to gun laws and the question of ownership and possession of guns. Unless we bring in these kinds of laws to try to persuade the Australian electorate that you do not need a gun because you fear your next-door neighbour, you do not need a gun because you fear crime rates and you do not need a gun on the off-chance someone breaks into your home, we will have a situation, such as exists in the United States, where there are so many people with a vested interest in ownership that they are prepared to work actively within the political system to avoid restrictions and controls.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This action then takes place at a very important stage in this country. We know the situation in America, where the National Rifle Association, a hugely funded organisation, has been able to thwart most measures. There were the Baker changes in the last few years, but essentially the NRA has succeeded in inducing a tolerance of a gun culture in society. There are figures that indicate nearly half of American people fear guns. They feel that guns are a significant problem, not only in their community, but in their local schools. I think the figures show that around 30 per cent of people have actually heard a gunshot. That is the kind of situation that this legislation aims to tackle. That is the kind of legislation that we need at this stage.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The accomplishments are to have a compensation scheme through the Medicare levy increase for the surrendering of guns and for the operation of the various states' and territories' surrender and buyback schemes. Concurrently there is also finance towards a national education campaign in regard to guns. There is also the move towards uniform firearm laws,
          <break page="8985" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           with the licensing of guns and the registration of owners. Related to this, there is an endeavour through the national exchange of police information et cetera to monitor the situation.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Amongst the matters that the opposition would raise in this particular piece of legislation today, which mainly deals with compensation paid for historically prohibited weapons, is the understanding that any surplus would be repaid. Certainly we appreciate that that is in the spirit, as the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General pointed out, of what was intended. We endorse fully the attempt to pick up that point today.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The other matter is this question of the distribution of information. The Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's Department, either alone or in conjunction with the Australian Council of Police Ministers, prepared in May of this year advice to the Attorney as to the degree of compliance of each state and territory with the resolutions agreed to by the Australian Council of Police Ministers. The opposition would appreciate if the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General would table advice on the degree to which each of those administrations has accomplished what was sought and the degree to which the public has cooperated. If possible, it would be appreciated, from the point of view of ensuring continued bipartisanship in this policy area, that the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General would provide that kind of material.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We do know that there has been a very significant level of compliance—in the area 550,000 to 600,000 weapons surrendered. I would—

           —Very few—as you note—who have basically described this as some kind of attack on rights and on liberties, and have conspiracy theories about supranational world governments and all those kinds of crackpot theories. There are people out there who, in other instances, are prepared to run around the place trying to make sure that young kids are gaoled for spitting at them or something, but, at the same time, are essentially saying that these laws are not important, that they are somehow different from other laws in this country and that people have more rights in this case to defy the elected legislature with regard to changing rules.
          </para>
         </talk.start>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It concerns me that there seems to be this tone out there that somehow, with regard to weapons possession, you have intrinsically greater rights than other people in terms of adhering to the law. I would like to put on the record a hope that, whilst there is obviously a degree of danger for our police force in enforcing these laws, like any other laws they have to be adhered to, they have to be respected and they have to operate. This was not done, as some people would suggest, as a knee&amp;hyphen;jerk, politically opportunistic measure. It was undertaken because of a very obvious perceived need, because guns are a serious problem in any society.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is important to reiterate that this is not just a matter of trying to deal with active criminality. The problem of guns is more pervasive in everyday society. The kinds of arguments that say that possession of a gun will be of advantage to the home owner with
          <break page="8986" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           regard to burglaries are being absolutely demolished in US criminology work. The fact of life is that, in altercations where a gun is involved in burglary, a gun owned by the owner of the property more often than not is actually used on the owner by the person breaking in, because of the element of surprise.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          That criminology work has been mainly by people like Zimring, who has done a lot of work in this area. He has also traced the lethal nature of guns and the fact that if one compares the degree of assaults involving the use of a knife and a gun, the gun is far more lethal. There is also a very clear correlation relating to availability. If you look at the United States, gun possession is far greater in the south than in the north, west and east, and there is a clear correlation there between gun suicides and gun homicides per capita.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In Australia we know the same point has been made. There has been concern by everyone in our political system about our levels of youth, and more particularly male, suicide. Again, if you look at the statistics on the nature of those deaths, the gun is certainly a very active participant and is essentially a far more useful vehicle for accomplishing that task.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Gun laws are critically related to the fact of life that most people are not killed by criminals or by their permanent or long&amp;hyphen;term enemies. Most people suffer deaths through their neighbours, their friends, their family, their business partners, in spur of the moment altercations, often arising from trivial matters and with very little forethought. So the availability of a gun is critically related to the question of these deaths that might not have occurred if the gun was not available.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          So, the opposition does endorse this measure. It understands fully that these kinds of laws were long overdue, that we had a very big hole in our system because there were different regulations, restrictions, licensing, and waiting times. All of these things fluctuated around the states of Australia and related either to the political facts of that state or, I guess, to some degree, to the culture of the state itself and the degree of power of the rural interests who obviously have a very understandable need in this area.

          This legislation allows some continued access for primary producers and exemptions for occasional shooters who are licensed for feral animals. The opposition endorses the measure. It would like to see, as I said earlier, some material in regard to the monitoring of the various levels each state and territory has reached in regard to adherence to these requirements, and it hopes that the government will reiterate its earlier commitment to repaying any surplus from this measure. We know that at this stage there are still calculations to be made in regards to gun shop proprietors who have lost businesses through these changes.

         The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has shown absolutely outstanding national leadership in relation to this issue of guns. When as a nation we were riveted by the tragedy at Port Arthur, the Prime Minister stepped forward without being concerned about political popularity, or winning a few votes, and made a very strong, immediate and public stand saying that enough was enough. Credit must also be given to the opposition for supporting the Prime Minister and the government in their determination to ensure that never again would we have a Port Arthur like tragedy.

          I am not known for standing in the parliament and rejoicing at the expenditure of huge amounts of public money, but I must say that I am particularly pleased that almost $300 million has been paid out by the government as a result of the firearms buyback program.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As I mentioned in an interjection when the honourable member for Reid was speaking, some 617,416 weapons have actually been handed in, and now Australia is a much safer place. It is, of course, with respect to this background that I am very pleased to join the debate on the  National Firearms Program Implementation Bill 1997 . This bill complements the earlier act, the National Firearms Program Implementation Act l996, which provided for the states and territories to be reimbursed for compensation paid by them in support of the national firearms program.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The response to the Port Arthur tragedy was indeed a national response. Most of the powers in relation to guns reside in the states and territories, but the Prime Minister and the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams) were able to sit down with the police ministers from right around the country and decide that this gun culture was not going to continue and that we ought to have a national response which would ensure that there would be many fewer firearms out there in the Australian community.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The 1996 act proscribed a number of firearms which were prohibited as a result of the nationwide firearms agreement. It was interesting that when the guns buyback took place, there was a whole raft of other weapons out there in the community which were not in the minds of the police ministers when they had their conference in response to the Port Arthur tragedy. The states have actually handed out considerable amounts of money to collect other historically prohibited weapons, such as submachine guns, heavy machine guns and other similar weapons.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I understand in fact that in the Northern Territory, 22 aircraft cannons were surrendered in that jurisdiction. Technically, what has happened under the buyback is that the states and territories have actually paid out money that was not in accord with the 1996 act. They paid out to bring in weapons, not prohibited as a result of the police minister's agreement, that clearly were well within the spirit of that agreement.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          That is why this very small, brief and concise bill has been introduced to the parliament by the government to complement the earlier legislation. The bill aims to ensure that the Commonwealth reimburses the states and territories for compensation that they have already paid for historically prohibited firearms or other weapons. In a sense, the states and territories have broken the law prior to the passage of this bill. At least, they have paid money given to them by the Commonwealth to bring these weapons in. Everyone in the Australian community believes that these weapons ought to be collected. If the states have gone out there and been proactive and collected weapons within the spirit of the 1996 agreement, clearly this government and this parliament should make sure that they are not out of pocket as a result of that very positive step.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There was some suggestion that the sole reason for the bill was that the Northern Territory needed to be reimbursed for the $460,000 it paid to the owner of the 22 aircraft cannons. That was certainly one instance. It has also been discovered that, in other states and territories of Australia, compensation has been paid for historically prohibited firearms. It is important that all states and territories be compensated for collecting these historically prohibited weapons.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Some people have also suggested that maybe this ought to have been an amendment to the 1996 act, but the government decided, on advice and after consideration, that it would be more

           concise and precise if a small specific act was brought in to meet this particular need. That is why we have got this clear, concise bill before the parliament, which certainly does the job.

          Some people say, `The buyback ended yesterday. What's going to happen with respect to the reimbursement of the states and territories for moneys that they have outlaid not in accordance with the word of the previous law?' The simple facts are that provided these historically prohibited weapons have been surrendered by yesterday, the Commonwealth will be able to reimburse the states and territories with respect to those weapons surrendered. Even though this piece of legislation will not have proceeded through the parliament by 30 September, it will still be possible to compensate the states and territories.

         <para first-indent="16">
          There has been speculation, and it was mentioned by the previous speaker, that some members of the parliament are not happy with the national response to the firearms buyback. Overwhelmingly, regardless of political party—including some independents—we have spoken with one voice on this issue. The government, the opposition and most other members of the parliament were prepared to join together to ensure that there was an effective national response to the Port Arthur tragedy.

         <para first-indent="16">
          This was not done as a populist measure or with one eye on the next election; it was done as a matter of principle by the Prime Minister. The Australian people have overwhelmingly endorsed the government proposal. Interestingly, surveys indicate that over 78 per cent of adult Australians are in favour of gun laws and 56 per cent are strongly in favour of the new laws. Unlike many other pieces of legislation which seem to escape many members of the Australian community, overwhelmingly, Australians are aware that the federal parliament has acted, in conjunction with the states and territories, and 96 per cent of people are aware of these reforms. That may well be the reason that we have had some 617,416 weapons handed in and the reason that the Commonwealth has paid out $296,874,323 in compensation.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There were some people who said that Australians would bury their weapons, that they would do absolutely anything to avoid handing in these prohibited weapons. But I am very pleased that the Prime Minister and the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General have both been proven correct and, overwhelmingly, the people with prohibited weapons have indeed complied with the law of Australia. This indicates that, as an Australian community, we are very responsible. I would like to commend those gun owners who have indeed acted in accordance with the law in handing in their weapons and receiving compensation.

          I am particularly pleased to support this legislation, coming as it does just one day after the close of the buyback program. As was mentioned by the honourable member for Reid, the buyback was funded as a result of a temporary increase in the Medicare levy. Overwhelmingly, Australians supported this revenue raising measure as a means of fixing up what was a glaring national problem.

          Returning to the bill, it is a very small bill and it complements the 1996 act. It does enable the states and territories to be compensated for the compensation that they have already paid with respect to historically prohibited weapons, including submachine guns, heavy machine guns and aircraft cannon, and other weapons which might not have been actually prohibited by the police ministers' agreement and which therefore were not approved for compensation under the 1996 bill. I am very pleased to commend the bill to the Main Committee.

          —Just listen for a moment; I will explain what my particular problem is. What we are seeing is people, and in some cases government instrumentalities, cashing in on this scheme at taxpayers' expense. In my own electorate, there is great anger after the federal government owned Australian Defence Industries factory in Lithgow surrendered 160 unwanted firearms and was paid more than $400,000. ADI has defended this decision, claiming the company is a licensed firearms dealer and is legally entitled to compensation. I have argued that this is morally wrong and goes against the spirit of the buyback scheme.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         You would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in rural areas like Lithgow there is already some opposition to the buyback scheme. This extremely unwise decision to sell off old military style weapons has only helped generate more anger and opposition to what is a very worthwhile scheme but one that has been extremely difficult to sell to rural people.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To make matters worse, it has since been confirmed to me by two former executives of the ADI Lithgow small arms factory that taxpayers have now forked out twice to have those particular weapons destroyed. Both former executives have said that the majority of weapons recently surrendered under the buyback scheme were from the Korean and Vietnam wars. ADI Lithgow was contracted by the army to destroy the weapons between 1969 and 1974 but it seems they were not destroyed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Now we see the struggling factory, decimated under 13 years of Labor government administration, doing everything it can to stay in business—and, unfortunately, `everything' includes double&amp;hyphen;dipping at taxpayers' expense. What we are seeing is a buyback scheme being used to purchase weapons that should have been destroyed years ago and that were safely kept under lock and key in a factory armory. Surely ADI has the means within its walls to shred these weapons and not dip into this public purse. As a great supporter of ADI Lithgow, it pains me to have to highlight this fact, but this decision has clearly angered the people of Lithgow as I am sure it should anger the people of Australia.

         The rush to hand in weapons over the past few days under the buyback scheme has demonstrated that there are still vast numbers of firearms in homes across this country, and that many have been slow to take advantage of the amnesty. I would much rather see the amnesty extended and publicised for another month, to rid Australian homes of conventional low&amp;hyphen;powered rifles and such, than see money spent buying antique military weapons that pose little or no threat at all. It is the presence of these low&amp;hyphen;powered rifles that poses the greatest danger.

          One of the great legacies of the Port Arthur tragedy is that this shocking incident empowered the government of Australia to take action to restrict firearms and to ensure there are enforceable uniform laws in all states. Many misguided firearm owners still believe it is their constitutional right to bear arms. Of course, there is no such right, and with multipartisan support this government has shown that only people with a genuine need for firearms have any right to have one. The gun culture that many with vested interests try to promote has taken an enforced step backwards.

          Most firearm owners I have been in contact with say they find the new laws fair and workable, and they have no problem complying. That particularly applies to farmers. In most cases it is only the absolute fanatics who are disenchanted with this law reform: people who cannot be satisfied with owning any gun, but feel they really must have one or several high&amp;hyphen;powered deadly weapons.

          Of course, there are also those collectors who have, I believe, a legitimate concern about the loss of their hard&amp;hyphen;won and long&amp;hyphen;cherished weapons, handed down from grandfathers and so on. I can appreciate their appreciation of the aesthetic form of these weapons, but say to them that, at the end of the day, a gun was designed to kill something. Unless we can get the most dangerous weapons out of the system, then we will not have achieved anything in the wake of Port Arthur.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There are still many high&amp;hyphen;powered deadly weapons out there that have not been handed in. According to bush folklore there are hundreds, perhaps thousands, buried underground in PVC piping. For that reason, the critics of the buyback scheme have branded it a failure, and say the deadly weapons are still out there and there is nothing to stop another Martin Bryant going on the attack.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Mr Deputy Speaker, they are wrong. In New South Wales around 150,000 automatic and semiautomatic firearms have been handed in. That is a magnificent figure, and will ensure the lives of many ordinary Australians are saved. Thankfully, the Martin Bryants of this world are extremely rare. Most people who are killed by firearms are not victims of mass shootings like Port Arthur. They are everyday mums and kids, killed in the heat of a domestic dispute, perhaps; or people caught up in the child support system at the moment—a system that I hope is finally getting some sort of reform.

I live on a property and I need weapons because I have dingoes, foxes, and sick stock which need to be put down. It is necessary for me to have weapons. Therefore, I have applied for a licence. I put in my application last Friday and I hope it will be accepted. I did have a licence previously, of course. The application is for the basic weapons, not the fancy weapons; it is for a .22, a shotgun and a .303.

         One aspect of the overall legislation, if I might say by way of comment, involves a leap too far. I have had a number of complaints from constituents, one of which I really have to mention to the House. This particular constituent had been bequeathed two air rifles by his grandfather. He had never so much as polished the oil off the barrels in about 30-odd years, yet he has had to hand in these rifles. It seems to me that that was one situation where the buyback scheme went too far.

         I remember the comment that was made earlier by the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) about the aircraft cannons which had to be handed in. They were World War II cannons and $440,000 was paid for 22 of them. One would really wonder whether that was catching too many fish in the net, as it were.

         There have been some anecdotal stories of weapons that have sat on display for many years—old cannons and old bits and pieces of machine guns and so forth—having to be pulled out of their stocks, having to be unbolted and handed in. You do tend to wonder a little bit about that.

         What I wanted to turn my attention to specifically was a particular constituent who has been hurt very badly by the events that occurred and by the subsequent legislation. His name is Mr John Peterson. He has a business in my electorate called Queensland Combined Arms Technologies and it is located at 30 Duntroon Street, Brendale.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Mr Peterson and his wife have been building up the company over a number of years. In more recent times they have achieved some success in their business by the development of certain moulds used in the manufacture of stocks for weapons. The revenue from the sale of these stocks provided a regular income to the company. It is a little business. Like so many small businesses in this country, it depends for its existence on the incredible effort and time that is put in by a husband and wife team. Also, the assets that they own are used to support and maintain the business.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The income generated was used over a period of time in the development of a semiautomatic weapon with a view to selling it to the Australian army as a training weapon. There was also interest from the Thai government in relation to the development of this particular weapon. The company was involved in the tender process.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, after the Port Arthur massacre and the subsequent events, demand for weapons Australia&amp;hyphen;wide dropped dramatically and the income previously generated by the sale of the synthetic stocks was reduced to a near non&amp;hyphen;existent level. As a result, the company was forced to withdraw from the tender process, thereby denying itself the possibility of a significant profit from the sale of the weapons. The company, in effect, has been put in grave jeopardy by these measures.

          The question really is whether or not he can get compensation and that is a real question in this particular case. A compensation claim was subsequently made on behalf of the company to the firearms compensation division of the Queensland Police Service. Compensation was sought in respect of the moulds and related to their value, which was established by professional valuers.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The Queensland Police Service wrote to my constituent through his solicitor on 25 September this year to the effect that the items of equipment contained did not fall within the parameters of stock items being compensated for under the Queensland firearms compensation scheme for licensed dealers. Items being compensated for under the scheme are broadly confined to restricted firearms and parts and accessories specific to those firearms, not equipment used in the manufacture of those items. The letter goes on to say that items used in the manufacture of firearms or firearm components are clearly included under the auspices of the loss of business program in Queensland. The operational components of this program are being managed by Price Waterhouse. The company was invited to present a case for consideration by Price Waterhouse under the loss of business compensation program.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In effect, under the claim that was made, this amounted to a letter of rejection and it was suggested that the alternative process—by loss of business compensation—should be pursued. The problem, as the company sees it, is the very restricted models for valuation of the business that have been prepared. In other words, a very narrow and restricted model for valuation has been prepared by Price Waterhouse. As I have indicated, this company is a registered dealer and, as such, it is entitled to make a claim for loss of business under the program. However, the models produced for assessment of value of business are drafted in such a way as to relate to dealers and not specifically to manufacturers.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I ask the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams) to look into this. The company fears that the limited compensation models will prevent a fair and reasonable payment to the company in respect of its loss of business. This fear is a well grounded one, it would seem.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The  National Firearms Program Implementation Bill 1997  provides that the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General may authorise the payment to a state of amounts by way of reimbursement for qualifying compensation paid by the state. It therefore seems to me, having regard to the bill, that there is an opportunity or there is a discretion perhaps that is open for the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General to authorise the compensation payment by the state to an applicant in respect of items which were not specifically covered in the buyback program. Thus, arguably there is a possibility that this could be extended to include compensation to be paid in respect of the moulds. The company believes that the government has already made payments to others in respect of surrendered moulds. I do not have information in relation to that; that is a belief that the company instructs me about.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is no overstatement to say that this company is teetering on the brink. With it goes the livelihood of the people who own the business, Mr and Mrs Peterson, as well as the assets they have used to support the business in its trading position. Its trading position has suffered considerably and its somewhat buoyant and prospectively exciting role of being able to be a supplier of specific and very discrete weapons, both to the Australian Army and to Thailand, has been very much eroded and, indeed, probably eliminated by the effect of the measures that the government has introduced.

As well, he has been acting through a solicitor whom I know personally and who is very competent.

          —Australians have always had reasonable access to firearms, and law&amp;hyphen;abiding citizens have always had an understandable expectation that individual ownership would continue, as indeed would the facility for them to pursue their sporting pastime. This reasonable expectation has lost ground daily. Australian firearm owners quite rightly believe the day is coming when the civilian population will be disarmed and only those who break the law will possess firearms.

         The uniform gun laws were ill&amp;hyphen;conceived and rushed through without thought or consultation. Any proposed need has no basis in fact and is an affront to anyone who is even slightly informed of the facts and figures. Dr Adam Graycar, from the Australian Institute of Criminology, has stated that banning semiautomatic firearms will do nothing to prevent the majority of Australian gun deaths.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         While I would certainly not advocate illegitimate ownership of such firearms, we cannot escape the fact that even just in the case of centre&amp;hyphen;fire semiautomatic rifles, the majority of which are military style, there are in excess of a million such firearms in Australia, yet this style accounts for less than two per cent of Australian firearm deaths.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Despite the free access to millions of firearms in Australia, the available data shows the number of murders committed with firearms since 1979 has been in a steady downward trend, despite the rise in murders generally over the same period. It should also be acknowledged that this period of general decline covered the peak years of importation for the so&amp;hyphen;called military style semiautomatic firearms. In fact, this period shows that an average of 92 murders, or 20 to 30 per cent of the total murders committed each year, were carried out with firearms. Many more people are murdered by other means.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Since 1990, there has been a rapid increase in murders committed with sharp instruments. These alone far outnumber murders with firearms for the same period—again, despite the vast availability of firearms. Even when looking at suicides, where there is an alarming increase in incidence, you will find a steady downward trend in the use of firearms. Available information shows that since 1979 suicides have increased nearly 45 per cent but use of a firearm to commit suicide has gone down by over 25 per cent. Since 1970, suicide with a firearm has dropped from nearly 30 per cent of all suicides to about 17 per cent.

         Removing completely inoperable guns from our war museums and paying compensation in excessive amounts is probably one of the more foolish examples of this government's agenda.
         <break page="8995" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          The act of removing rusty, non&amp;hyphen;working machine guns from museums is contributing to erasing our history and will not save a single life. A person in Darwin was paid nearly $&amp;half; a million for 20&amp;hyphen;millimetre cannons from fighter planes. Considering that the current removal of firearms from private ownership was largely targeted at centre&amp;hyphen;fire semiautomatics, and less than two per cent, or 10 firearm&amp;hyphen;related deaths a year are attributable to this style of firearm, is the $500 million buyback coupled with the unaccountable costs justifiable in the context of the variety of weapons used to commit murder, and the many causes of accidental deaths?

        <para first-indent="16">
         Perhaps as many as 50,000 Australians die each year through the effects of diseases caused by alcohol and tobacco. What impact would the $500 million have had in reducing these horrendous figures. Each year, countless thousands die in road accidents and in all manner of other activities, yet are we to believe that these and the deaths from alcohol and tobacco are somehow more acceptable because so many people drink and smoke and drive? There are millions of firearms and firearms owners, but despite the vast numbers and the amount of use, in context, the number of deaths is relatively low, and the government's approach cannot be justified.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Bear in mind that removing firearms from law&amp;hyphen;abiding citizens will most likely impact only upon accidents, and in this case, there are only about 15 fatalities each year. One thousand people die each year from accidental falls, and 250 drown. There was no gun debate, as such. There was no consultation or concern for the facts, merely misinformation shoved down the throats of an understandably emotional public.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This has been a political exercise, pure and simple, with no reduction in the amount of firearms in society. In fact, quite the contrary has occurred, as the figures show. For every firearm turned in, approximately 1.7 modern firearms have been purchased with the compensation. There is also the issue of the number of firearms that have literally gone underground.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The returns do not begin to count for the estimated number of firearms. In particular, hundreds of thousands of military style semiautomatics would seem to be missing. It is time we acknowledge that crime is caused by economic desperation and helplessness, unemployment, loss of hope, family breakdown, substance abuse, and cultural conflicts—not by firearms ownership.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Swiss experience is, perhaps, the best example. In Switzerland, there are more firearms and fewer deaths than in Australia. The majority of firearms in that country are military weapons—millions of them. It is only when we, as one nation, address these issues together that crime will reduce. Violence and crime are not proportional to the availability of firearms; they are directly linked to the security and decency of our society. Governments that pretend otherwise are looking to hide the true causes of the situation and escape the responsibility for addressing the real issues and, therefore, they perpetrate a lie on their people.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Saving lives, or reducing crime, was obviously not behind the government's attacks on the private ownership of firearms. Indeed, they are guilty of the crime of using an emotional period for political purposes. Have no doubt, the buyback has failed. There are now more firearms out there than before, and many are modern and potentially more deadly than the firearms they replaced. It seems that most Australians have not handed in their firearms, and be assured, absolutely no criminals have complied.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What does the government intend to do with the millions of Australians who have not complied? Will Australia become a police state with homes systematically raided and property

          confiscated? Will the government harass, fine and gaol otherwise innocent law&amp;hyphen;abiding Australians. History has shown that only the worst kind of government disarms its people. I stand by my belief that Australians have the right to defend themselves and their families in their own homes. Shooting is a legitimate sport and pastime, and participants should be treated accordingly. Disarming law&amp;hyphen;abiding Australians is not in the national interest and will do nothing to reduce crime. An honest government would take heed, so we can be sure this one is not listening.

         Simply put, it should be remembered that, during the last election campaign, the current government used the slogan: `enough is enough'. Be assured that the firearm owners of Australia are tired of unwarranted and unjustified interference. They are tired of being used as political scapegoats and of being the victims of United Nations treaties. You can be assured that Australia's firearm owners have adopted the Liberal&amp;hyphen;National coalition slogan because that is exactly how they feel, that enough is enough. Always remember, outlaw firearms and only outlaws will have them.

         I do welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate, and I want to do so by picking up some of the remarks made by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), who preceded me in the debate. In reflections on the question of gun ownership in Australia that did not surprise any one of us, the member for Oxley implied not only that the scheme has been a failure, but that it was the intention of the government to disarm Australia with the legislation that followed the Port Arthur massacre, and that that intention has failed because Australians have successfully rearmed; so the scheme has been a failure, and there are more weapons in Australia than there were prior to the legislation being introduced. That was the first of her themes.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second of her themes was that effectively, since alcohol, tobacco, cars and sharp instruments killed more people than guns, the government in some way had been inconsistent in applying this gun legislation and not legislating effectively, in her view, against the carnage caused by alcohol, tobacco and road accidents.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Mr Deputy Speaker, let me tell you, this chamber and the member for Oxley that it was not the intention of the government to disarm Australia. The legislation that was introduced following the horrific Port Arthur massacre was introduced because the federal government recognised the responsibility that it and every Australian government had to ensure that the innocent would be adequately protected.

         <para first-indent="16">
          If the intent of the federal government had been to disarm Australia, Australia would have been disarmed. But as a member for a rural electorate, with the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams) sitting here on my left, let me hasten to reassure everybody that neither I nor anyone that I am aware of within the coalition—and, I would suspect, no&amp;hyphen;one in the opposition either—sought at any stage to disarm Australia.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          When the rumours about disarming Australia were running so rife I was one who said to the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, `I hope you are not intending by some sort of underhand method to disarm Australia, because I am not going through all of this agony again if this is only step 1.' Of course, that was not his intent. It was not the intent of the government, nor was it the intent of the opposition.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          What effectively has happened, counter to the general theme of the speech of the member for Oxley, is that in Australia today we probably have very nearly as many weapons as we had prior to the Port Arthur massacre. That does not cause me any alarm. As far as I know, it does not cause the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General any alarm. He will have an opportunity to respond in just a moment.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          What we have succeeded in doing is removing a large proportion of what were the most antisocial weapons out of the community and replacing them with those that are legal. I am not bothered that people who surrendered firearms and were compensated have used that compensation money in many instances to acquire another firearm. That does not bother me at all. I expected that to happen. The firearm they have acquired, however, is not as antisocial as was the firearm they surrendered and it is a firearm that, by the very nature of the acquisition under this legislation, will now be both licensed and recorded so that the law enforcement agencies know where that weapon is and in whose hands it is held. That is a dramatic step forward.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is just absurd to draw any sort of analogy between the firearm legislation and the other difficulties that we have in common with every other society as a result of drugs or alcohol or cigarettes or even knives. No&amp;hyphen;one is proposing that the government, for example, should legislate against knives so that we cannot consume meals except with forks. Even a fork in the wrong hand could be seen to be lethal in one form or another.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Furthermore, the government has not ignored, as the member for Oxley would suggest, the antisocial implications of alcohol, drugs and tobacco. Quite on the contrary! Both sides of the parliament have been quite adventurous in the way that they have dealt with ensuring that the laws across Australia for drugs somehow are enforceable from state to state and ensuring that road tragedy laws become increasingly reinforced from a common perspective. What has been done with the legislation that was introduced following the Port Arthur massacre is simply that we now have a situation where uniform laws apply across Australia.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I participate in this debate as a South Australian, as someone from a state whose gun laws were seen to be relatively effective. But even in South Australia, the management is dramatically enhanced of weapons that no&amp;hyphen;one—not even the member for Oxley—would want in Australia and weapons that ought to have been illegal across the entire nation because of their military characteristics. Whereas, prior to the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's action, any South Australian could have a neighbouring land&amp;hyphen;holder across the border store those weapons for them, in October 1997 we are in a situation where wherever you place that weapon it is illegal unless licensed. The full force of the law will be brought against you if you are found to be in possession of it.

           That is a dramatic step forward—a step that not just the government but the parliament and the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General ought to be commended for as well. It is simply nonsense to paint a picture of legislation seeking to disarm Australia. It is simply nonsense to run some sort of conspiracy theory that suggests that somehow we are going to leave the citizens of Australia more vulnerable to attack as a result of this legislation. It is nonsense because the citizens of Australia remain in a position where they have access to legal firearms as they need them and nonsense because there is no sense in which one can expect to be defending the nation sitting in your front lounge poking an automatic weapon through the window at someone who is or would be an intruder. If Australia is genuinely under attack, its defence will come clearly from the full force of the military. Any other form of defence is nothing more than offensive in terms of keeping a cohesive and effective society.

           The legislation before the House deals, of course, with much more than the events that have followed the Port Arthur massacre. It has been a necessary amendment brought in by the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General because of action in the Northern Territory where the acquisition of 22 aircraft cannon warranted some additional compensation beyond the act and hence this legislation. This has been brought in with the support of both the government and the opposition, recognising that this amendment allows us to complete what was part of the firearm buyback in Australia, that it covers an anomaly that had arisen in the Northern Territory, and that it is part of a scheme that has allowed us to take over 600,000 firearms out of the community at the cost of not quite $300 million.

           By any measure, Australia is a safer country because of the action taken by the government and the opposition and by the vigorous actions of Attorney&amp;hyphen;General following the Port Arthur massacre. No-one pretends that risk has suddenly been eliminated from Australia, but one of the risks, the mowing down of innocent people as occurred at Port Arthur, has been dramatically reduced through this legislation. Not to have done what we have done would have been an act of gross negligence on the part of the parliament. Parliamentarians should be proud of the action that they have taken in the face of some community hostility. It was action that was taken courageously, recognising that it is in the community interest.

           As the representative of a rural electorate, there is one other issue that I must address before I sit down, and it is this. It is absurd to suggest that farmers have in some way been disadvantaged by the legislation that was introduced following the Port Arthur massacre. In fact, access to bolt action weapons is still readily available to any farmer at any time, and exemptions are in place so that where an appropriate automatic weapon is needed then farmers can acquire it.

           There is no cause for concern on the part of the rural community. There is no cause for concern on the part of those who have a sporting interest in firearms because as a result of being a recognised member of an appropriate firearm club, they too can have access to the weapons they need to participate in various sporting events. Anyone with a legitimate need for a weapon that is seen to be not of the antisocial group that the original legislation was designed to prohibit still has access to those weapons.

           I am pleased to be a part of a government that has acted courageously not to trim the rights of Australians, and to ensure that innocent Australians are protected from the sort of horror that we witnessed at Port Arthur.

          . The greatest reason for the nationwide guns buyback scheme was the tragedy at Port Arthur in Tasmania on 28 April 1996. There is a lot of debate saying that this government or this parliament has disarmed the country. However, debate on this guns issue has been in the community for many years. As far as the whole issue is concerned, I congratulate both sides of the House because of the fact that people were prepared to work in a bipartisan way to ensure that this country's future is well protected.

         Thirty&amp;hyphen;five people were killed and many people were wounded when Martin Bryant used his high&amp;hyphen;powered semiautomatic weapon. As a result of this tragedy, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) immediately announced that the Commonwealth government would buy back all military style self&amp;hyphen;loading rifles, pump action shotguns and other semiautomatic weapons. People have not only handed in all those different types of weapons, but we have also seen submachine guns and, of course, World War II aircraft cannons as well.

         The guns buyback scheme has been a great success, with more than 600,000 firearms being handed in for destruction and compensation. To say that the parliament wanted to disarm the country is crazy. Australians can still own firearms. I have heard people in the debate today say that it was not a great success. People have to understand that the government was only chasing a particular style or set of weapons. It is as simple as that.

If, on the other side of the fence, you want something that is in the illegal category and you have a legitimate reason and you can support that, once again, you can have that weapon.

         As far as I am concerned, this will make Australia a safer place to live. Of course, there are still many guns out there in the community; there may be some illegal ones as well. There are a lot less of them than there were before and I consider that to be a good thing. I have spoken to a lot of people in the community—and I will keep using this word `emotion'—and now that the emotion has been removed from the debate somewhat, people are starting to say, `Well, gee, this isn't such a bad thing after all.'

         I still get faxes and letters from some people, including constituents in my electorate who believe the gun buyback scheme has not worked and there are still thousands of illegal guns in the community. I hope this is not right. I have attended many gun rallies since the inception of the gun debate. I have attended both sides of the argument. I understand the pain and the passion of many people over this issue. Most gun owners are decent, responsible people and the majority of Australians will agree that change had to happen, especially in relation to a prohibited persons register. At the end of the day, if somebody is not of sound mind and they should not have a firearm, then that should be exactly the case. They should not have a firearm.

I consider it is terrible that people are prepared to use this debate for their own devices. I ask people to look very closely at those who try to use it for their own self-gain. Make sure you

         If there were to be change at the eleventh hour, maybe I would have liked to have seen people who have applied for licences in relation to illegal weapons before 30 September and have been knocked back and had to hand their gun in still get compensation.

         On the whole I was not excited about handing my gun in. But once you take the emotion out of the debate and sit down and accept that this is now the law and it must be adhered to, it is simple as that. Basically as far as guns are concerned, I still have my 243 bolt action rifle. It is licensed. I am allowed to have it. It is as simple as that. I say to one and all—the people out in the community—this was not all about disarming Australia, takeover bids from other countries and this world order and so forth. If you want to own a gun and you can verify that you fall into the correct category, you can still have a gun. We had to remove those weapons that can cause mass destruction and were not acceptable in today's society.

         On the other side of it, we see our gun clubs. Gun clubs have prospered from this. I think it is a great initiative. We can have community policing in society. Some people may not be able to have a weapon or a rifle, owing to the fact they do not have large amounts of land to shoot on. Now they have to be a member of a club. People will now see them mixing in society, with their rifles, when they go to sporting shoots. Now you can actually police people to see whether they are worthy to have that rifle. This form of community policing is very acceptable; it has gone a long way.

As I said, if you want to own a gun, you can still have one.

          complements the National Firearms Program Implementation Act 1996. The thrust of this bill is to ensure that the Commonwealth can reimburse the states and territories for compensation paid for historically prohibited firearms or other weapons. It will provide the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams) with the authority to certify that the surrender of certain firearms or other weapons is consistent with the spirit of the national program and it will allow the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General to authorise that the states and territories be reimbursed for the compensation paid for such firearms.

          I believe that the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General has put a lot of effort into implementing the whole firearms buyback scheme in a very fair and balanced way. It is important that what we see is that the government, led very ably by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and strongly supported by the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General and the states—and, I must also acknowledge, by the opposition—has put in place what, in general terms, has been something very beneficial for Australia. I also have to support the comments of my colleague and good friend the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) when he pointed out the nonsense of some of the things that were being said by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), particularly any suggestion that this move by the government is in some way to try to disarm the civilian population of Australia.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I come to speak to this bill as someone who has had a keen interest in firearms ownership for many years. I have, in fact, held a licence for 30 years. I have been a member of the Field and Game Association for more than 25 years. I was honoured to be asked by the Prime Minister to chair the Firearms Consultative Committee, which looked at certain details of the implementation of the firearms buyback scheme.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is important that we should always recognise the dual expectations of the community. There is no doubt that the Australian community was absolutely rocked by the tragedy of Port Arthur. I think the Australian community was extremely impressed by the decisive leadership that the Prime Minister showed following that tragedy, and he was strongly supported, right across the political landscape. What the Prime Minister set out to do was to remove undesirable firearms from the community and, as well as that, to ensure that Australia did adopt uniform laws. The other aspect was to give much greater recognition to the need for a responsible approach to firearm ownership. On that point, those who have demonstrated a responsible approach should be able to continue to have that ownership and to pursue the use of the firearms in a responsible and legitimate way.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          When we saw the drama of Port Arthur, it raised a very real community fear. It certainly was a terrible tragedy. But what it did do with the vast majority of firearms owners, who are responsible people, was to cast a question mark over them as to why they should continue to own firearms. Yet when you look at the safety record of the vast majority, when you look in particular at the safety record of gun clubs, I think they can demonstrate that they have in fact carried on their sport in a very responsible manner. At the same time, we should continue to recognise that legitimate shooting is a sport that is pursued not only within Australia but internationally. Australia was very well served by three medallists at the recent Olympic Games. There were two gold medals—one to Russell Mark and one to Michael Diamond—and a bronze to Desiree Huddleston. All of them achieved the pinnacle of their sport and did it in a way that made Australia proud.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There is also a very strong and legitimate reason for farmers to continue to have firearms, particularly in dealing with vermin such as foxes, pigs, rabbits, but also, at times, to deal with an odd animal that gets deranged, shall we say. I have had an occasion myself to go and borrow a neighbour's .303 to get rid of a bull that had flipped its lid and was totally uncontrollable. It was the only way we could deal with it. It did not matter what other method we tried, the only humane way to get rid of it was to shoot it with a .303. That is always going to be a problem. I think that all of us are aware of occasions when cattle have lost control and caused the death of individual farmers, and farmers are going to continue to need that last resort—which is all it is; but access to that last resort, nonetheless.

           I would like to talk a bit about the tightening of the laws. While I certainly endorse what has been done, and I certainly agree with the move for uniformity, I think that it highlights also the importance of safe storage of firearms. We have heard a number of speakers already talk about the need to see firearms probably stored in a locked cabinet, or whatever, depending on the type of firearm. We have also seen, as has been mentioned, the growth in clubs which encourage the safe and responsible use of firearms. But the concern I have is that, notwithstanding the move to uniformity, there has not been a uniformity in the administering of some of the legislation.

           In Victoria we have had a situation where the state government has not administered these laws in quite the same way as other states. I will just give you a quote from a constituent of mine who said:
          </para>
          <para font-size="-=2">
           I am a policeman with twenty years experience. I am a trained firearms instructor with the Victorian Policeforce . . . I have 36 years involvement with firearms—

           He goes on to say:
          </para>
          <para font-size="-=2">
           We now have a system which creates confusion, frustration and inexcusable delays—
          </para>
          <para style="Para">
           And he goes on to outline some of the frustrations that he feels as someone who has been a responsible gun owner and enforcer of the law. He is certainly—and I have spoken to him—far from happy with the way that the laws are being administered. There are many examples which I will not go into in the time available, but we could elaborate at another time.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The second thing that does concern me in the follow&amp;hyphen;up to what has happened is that, while it is true that we have now seen over 600,000 firearms surrendered, the surrender rate seems to vary quite a lot between states. When we look at the official numbers that have been very kindly released by the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General today, and we compare the ratio of the number of firearms surrendered with the number of registered voters, we find that the rate does vary quite considerably. For example, in Tasmania, the rate is 9&amp;half; per cent of the number of firearms compared with the number of registered voters. In the Northern Territory it is similar—9.3 per cent. Then it drops in Victoria to 6.9 per cent, and down further in Queensland to 5.9 per cent. Then we go to Western Australia, 4.3 per cent; South Australia, 5.2 per cent; New South Wales, 3.6 per cent, and the ACT, 2.4 per cent.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           What I wanted to highlight from that is that there is quite a big difference between the highest rate of handing in and the lowest rate of handing in, particularly when we look at states like New South Wales. The concern I raise is that I find it difficult to believe that the ownership of guns varies so significantly between the states. It raises very serious questions as to whether states, such as Victoria and South Australia, and the others that have had high rates of hand in, where there has been firearm registration for some years, have had a higher rate of handing in than has occurred in those states that have not had firearms registration up until now. I believe that this is a matter that the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General would probably like to take up again with the police ministers, and I will come back to that in a minute.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The other point that has come through very loudly and clearly is that gun ownership is very much a regional issue. By that I mean that people living in country areas have a much higher rate of gun ownership than those living in the city, and probably for very understandable reasons. I do get rather sick of the anti&amp;hyphen;gun lobby, most of whom seem to sit smugly in city citadels such as universities. They go on with their unctuous branding of all firearm owners as inferior citizens. They go even further sometimes and suggest that they must have some sort of personalty deficiencies. Given the background of many of these critics, their
           <break page="9003" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            unprofessional and distorted outbursts seem to be far more directed at personal publicity than seeking a balanced public debate or trying to get a responsible approach to this whole serious and complicated issue. I could give you some quotes, but I have not got them here with me.
           </break>
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Many people in the country not only have a legitimate reason to own firearms but also, in many cases, they work in an area where they need them as a tool of trade, as is the case with farmers. As I have said, in the country areas in particular and in some urban areas, there are gun clubs. These clubs have an impeccable safety record. This should not be overlooked. We should respect those who want to get involved without maligning them.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           It is worth noting that there are schools in country Australia—I know of them in country Victoria—that are willing to train students in firearm safety because they recognise the need for this training and safety. They recognise that legitimate firearm ownership is quite frequent in country areas and that they have a role in teaching that safety. In my own electorate, the finals of the schools clay-trap shooting attracts around 200 student shooters each year. I add that there are not only boys but also females presenting at those finals.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           In looking towards the future, it is important to continue to emphasise that ownership should be limited to those who are responsible. That is something that the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General has emphasised. At the same time, we should recognise that ownership of legitimate firearms is a pursuit that should be allowed to continue. We should also recognise that firearms are a tool of trade for some people whether they are farmers or people involved in controlling vermin.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           We also need to develop a confidence in the community so that, if we do have a proper licensing system and a responsible approach, community safety can be enhanced. I think that is equally important. At the same time, those who do have a legitimate reason to own a firearm should know that, if they are prepared to comply with the law and to behave in a responsible manner, they are not going to feel as though they are being treated like second&amp;hyphen;class citizens. We should recognise the fact that we have Olympians who are as good as anyone in the world and who have demonstrated that. I see no reason why we should not encourage people to be involved in that sport, just like all the other athletes that we proudly send to the Olympic Games.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           I do see the need for another aspect in this whole issue. With our achievements to date, and with the end of the buyback scheme yesterday, a lot of public confidence has been built up in safety. Nonetheless, this is an ongoing issue. I urge the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General to set up consultative committees not only in each state but also with some national focus. I believe that those committees should have some real teeth for the ongoing work needed to encourage the safe and responsible ownership of firearms. The need does extend to ensure that the community is properly informed about what these committees could do and that community expectations are properly met so that legitimate and responsible firearm owners can be confident that they will not be the scapegoats for any future occurrence or tragedy. The tragedy at Port Arthur was clearly not done by the majority and the majority felt just as sick about what had happened there as all other Australians.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           I commend again the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General. What has been done will help to add to safety, not just because of the reduction in firearms but, equally importantly, because the campaign is helping to shape community attitudes. There is now an expectation—I believe a very strong expectation—that anyone who wants to continue to have the right to own a firearm will be granted that right only on the basis that they demonstrate that they are going to be responsible and that they have a genuine need.

            On that basis, what has been achieved is something of truly national significance. I hope that through the use of consultative committees we can ensure that governments, both at the state and federal levels, are able to continue to meet the varied demands of the communities, particularly the different demands that often occur between regional areas and city areas, so that we have a more informed community and, most importantly, a safer community where we can all live.

          —I came into this place not expecting to speak, until I received a letter this morning and I could not let the opportunity pass—I will come back to that in a moment. At the outset, in relation to the National Firearms Program Implementation Bill, I want to commend first of all, at the highest level, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). The Prime Minister's leadership on this issue has been fundamental to what has happened right across the country.

         I want to commend the premiers and chief ministers, who had the responsibility in this area for implementing what was an absolutely essential move to reduce the risk factor across the country. The federal Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams) is here with us this morning, and I want to take the opportunity to commend him for what he has done, under some trying circumstances, to put this piece of legislation through and to implement it. Daryl Williams, as the Attorney, has been accused by some of being some sort of left&amp;hyphen;wing internationalist who wants to brutally disarm this country. He is not, and this legislation—and indeed the measures taken right around the country by state and territory governments—is, of course, a reflection of a community mood, and that community mood is overwhelmingly in favour of what has happened.

          —in reply—This bill is in the nature of a tidying&amp;hyphen;up bill. It is a bill that has not attracted a great deal of attention in the debate, which seems to be a common feature of debates in the Main Committee, but it is significant nevertheless. It will enable compensation to be paid for firearms that do not fit within the description of the firearms to be surrendered under the 1996 legislation because they were of a more dangerous type—even more dangerous than the automatic military rifles that were one of the real causes of the buyback scheme. They include submachine guns and heavy machine guns, and they had been identified and handed in in a variety of jurisdictions.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The buyback scheme, which resulted from the police ministers meeting of 10 May 1996 and subsequent meetings, for the surrender of firearms for compensation, concluded yesterday. It is very pleasing to be able to report that, as of 10 o'clock this morning—that is, soon after the closing of the scheme at midnight—623,632 firearms had been surrendered and compensation to an amount of $296,874,323 had been paid.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Those figures will, no doubt, change somewhat. There will be a number of firearms surrendered in respect of which applications for licences have also been made but not yet dealt with. Those firearms may then be returned when a licence is granted. In respect of others, compensation may be payable if the licence is not granted.
        </para>
        <break page="9006" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          In drawing attention to the success of the buyback, I mention that there was a debate in the House of Representatives last night on a matter of public importance. I made then most of the points that I would wish to make in respect of the conclusion of the buyback. The other speakers included the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) and the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson). The member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) also spoke, but took a rather different point of view which I would not commend to the House. The bill we have before us has generated little controversy. I will not comment, except in respect of a comment made by the member for Calare (Mr Andren), which I will come to in due course.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I would like to thank members for their contributions. I thank the member for Reid, the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith), the member for Calare, the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), the member for Capricornia (Mr Marek), the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) and the member for Groom (Mr Taylor). You will have noted I did not mention the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), whose comments I will have something to say about in a minute. I think her contribution was regrettable.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The member for Reid raised the question of provision of information on monitoring adherence to the requirements. A number of issues arise in respect of the termination of the buyback scheme, and these will be dealt with in police ministers meetings, the next one of which will be held in November. I will certainly be writing to my state and territory counterparts as police ministers, asking them to report on their monitoring of the uniform registration and licensing system. In due course there will be a full analysis and an audit of the scheme. I have requested them also to write reporting on the implementation of the buyback, with a view to identifying any injustices that may have occurred in the administration of the scheme that could be remedied relatively quickly.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The member for Reid also raised a question of the government adhering to the promise about repaying surplus funds in the Medicare special levy. The question of whether there are going to be moneys left over is an open one at this point. We know how much money has been paid out in compensation; we know that $63 million has been paid out to states and territories and on other administrative arrangements in relation to the buyback scheme.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          What we do not have yet is a final figure on the firearms compensation and we are very far from a final figure on the compensation to be paid to firearms dealers. The exercise there is rather more elaborate than in assessing compensation for the particular firearms because what needs to be identified is the loss in value of the business or, if the business closes, the value of the business that has terminated. It will take some months to ascertain the appropriate figures and make the appropriate payments.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) stands that any surplus funds will be returned to taxpayers through the Medicare levy system. I apprehend that, if the amount of money that remains is relatively small, the community might have an expectation that it would be devoted to an appropriate measure rather than chewed up in administration on the return of the modest amount.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The member for Calare raised an issue that pertains to his electorate. He indicated there was some anger about Australian Defence Industries Ltd surrendering stock under the buyback scheme and acquiring payment. This is not an issue that arises under the bill under consideration. What was done was lawful under the 1996 act. He can be assured that because ADI is wholly Commonwealth owned, it does amount, in effect, to a transfer of Commonwealth moneys to a Commonwealth entity and therefore gives rise to little concern.
         </para>
         <break page="9007" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          <para first-indent="16">
           The member for Calare also—and he was the only one—expressed some reservations about the particular bill while supporting the general buyback scheme. His suggestion was that the money could be better spent by a commitment to recovering other prohibited firearms. I do not think what he is suggesting is necessary at this juncture. We have yet to assess the level of success of the buyback scheme. No doubt if there are steps that need to be taken as a result of the assessment, these will be taken by agreement among police ministers.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           This bill complements the 1996 act, as noted by the member for Fisher. The old&amp;hyphen;style military weapons—and I use the word `weapons' advisedly; they are weapons, not firearms—were not in the minds of the police ministers following the tragedy at Port Arthur. We did not have in mind that there would be in the community bazookas, aircraft cannon, Bofors cannon and the like, which subsequently, it turned out, there were. The surrender of historically prohibited weapons for fair and proper compensation is certainly within the spirit of the national program and this bill would allow for it to be achieved.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The member for Dickson raised concerns about the adequacy of the compensation arrangements. That is not an issue that arises in relation to this bill, but the buyback scheme was administered by the different states and territories. They had different arrangements pertaining—some started earlier than others. It is evident that in each jurisdiction there were some difficulties, at least at the outset, in establishing what was the most efficient scheme. Most of those difficulties were resolved as time went by, although there was, no doubt, considerable pressure, especially in Queensland, in meeting the target within the time frame.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The member for Wakefield followed the member for Oxley and addressed some of her remarks, as I will do also. He pointed out that the government did not seek to disarm Australia, as she had asserted.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The member for Oxley indicated that the day is coming when the civilian population will be disarmed. That statement is totally wrong. The government has no intention of going down that path, nor to my knowledge does any other government or any opposition in the country. It is not only wrong, it is inflammatory, dangerous and irresponsible. I commend the members who spoke subsequently and indicated their rejection of that particular view.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The member for Oxley seems to think that the only people who will be left with firearms will be criminals. I cannot imagine where on earth that conclusion could be derived from. The uniform laws contemplate that there will be valid uses of firearms and valid purposes for holding them. That is the nub of the scheme.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           There is recognition that there are genuine reasons for holding firearms of whatever category. It recognises that there are, in some cases, genuine needs for having the more dangerous category C and D firearms. That is part of the scheme and it is not intended to change it. The member for Wannon, among others, mentioned the particular uses as tools of trade to which some firearms are put and mention was also made of recreational use under very strict conditions.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The member for Oxley suggested that violence and crime are not proportional to the availability of firearms. The point I would make in response to that is that she seems to have no research to back that up. I question the assumption. But what is evident from the research is that the availability of firearms is related to the number of deaths and injuries resulting from firearms. In Australia we have between 400 and 500 deaths from firearms, the bulk of which—80 per cent approximately—are suicides. The relationship between the availability of firearms and the suicide rate in a particular community is direct. By removing more than 600,000
           <break page="9008" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            firearms we may, and I hope we have, set in train a reduction in the death rate and the injury rate from firearms.

          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The member for Oxley asserted that the vast majority of Australians have not handed in their firearms and again mentioned that criminals, one should be assured, have not. The member for Oxley is talking through her hat. The research conducted by the government, about which I spoke in the MPI in the house yesterday at some length, indicates that there is very strong support for the uniform laws. What was indicated with that was that, nationwide, there is very strong compliance and intention to comply. The vast majority of Australians about whom the member for Oxley speaks in fact support the laws and the vast majority have complied with the laws. Again, what she says is inflammatory, dangerous and irresponsible.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The member for Wakefield spoke as a user of a firearm and I think the attitude that he evinced towards the use of firearms is a healthy and an appropriate one. The member for Capricornia (Mr Marek) raised particularly the question of those who had surrendered firearms by 30 September, but whose licence applications had not been dealt with. That is a particular situation which has been addressed already, but we will closely monitor that situation and the reports from the various jurisdictions in order to ensure that there has been no injustice in the closing off of the scheme.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The member for Wannon, whom I commend as the chairman of the consultative committee, who assisted the government in the formulation of the proposals, is a very experienced firearms owner, as his speech indicated. He highlighted a number of the features of the current scheme, I think appropriately. The safety record of firearms owners, and in particular those who participate in clubs, is well&amp;hyphen;known and the responsible attitude evinced by those people is a matter of record.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           He questioned the administration, giving an example of delays referred to by a constituent in Victoria. I am not able to respond directly to that, but I did indicate earlier that the administrations in the different jurisdictions did take time to settle down. That is certainly forgivable because the governments were doing something that had never been done before and, in some cases, they were setting up registration and licensing systems that did not exist in any form prior to the commencement of the scheme.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The member for Wannon has calculated the ratio of firearms handed in to population, and gave some interesting statistics. He queried whether the ownership of firearms does vary that much. It seems in fact that it does. I have been advised that New South Wales, for example, has a third of Australia's population but only one-fifth of the firearms, and that may account for the relatively low percentage figure that the member for Wannon referred to.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           In Tasmania and Queensland there were relatively few, if any, rules relating to the ownership of firearms. That may account for the very high percentage in Tasmania, where there was no registration system at all. In the Northern Territory, I would suggest, it is much more likely that people would own firearms than they would in the southern states.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Victoria seems to have a different culture from other places. There has been a high ownership of shotguns in that state, particularly in the rural and regional areas, although, notably, there was a higher number of firearms handed in in metropolitan centres than there were in Victorian rural and regional centres. Western Australia and South Australia have had strict licensing schemes for some time and strict ownership rules, which may account for why their percentages are relatively low. However, analysis would provide better information, and I hope that will be done.

            The member for Wannon mentioned the question of training in schools. One of the features of the uniform scheme was the development of training packages for new firearms owners. What is occurring in schools, which I had not heard about before, sounds very good. He also made particular mention about consultative committees. He suggested that there will be a need for ongoing work in relation to the safe and responsible ownership of firearms and a need to ensure that community expectations and safety expectations are met. This is an idea that I think should be taken up and examined and I propose to do that.

            The member for Groom referred to some extremist views that had been expressed to him in a letter. That letter is one that I think should be referred to appropriate authorities. Those sorts of letters should not be received by anybody, particularly a public figure, from somebody who is simply making threats. He referred to some of the extremist views that had been expressed by a number of people. I reject them in the same way that he does. I think all right thinking people in Australia would reject the notion that firearms should be owned in order that there can be militia groups established who will conduct their own treason trials, as he pointed out.

         The work of the NRTC has involved gradually developing, in consultation with the states—and, of course, relevant stakeholders, such as the industry and the Transport Workers Union, users and various parties—a structure of uniform national rules with respect to road transport. Of course, that covers a very wide variety of issues—not just things like uniform charging

         I commend John Hurlstone, David O'Sullivan and the commission on the work that they have done to date. It is a remarkable tribute to them that they have managed to achieve so much and that that has been done in spite of the constraints of our antiquated federal system which means that it is impossible to do anything in these areas without getting agreement from a very wide range of players, many of whom have a variety of different agendas.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is also very pleasing to see the NRTC pursuing a range of innovative agendas on a number of issues. I was particularly pleased to see that the question of penalties for drivers breaching regulations with respect to safety, driving hours, and the like, has been addressed by the commission, and that the question of company owners, or prime contractors, being held liable for breaches perpetrated by their drivers has actually been raised by the commission.

         One of the critical issues in Australian transport policy and, indeed, public life generally at the moment is the way that drivers in the road transport industry are forced by employers, contractors, users and circumstances associated with the needs of the users to work ridiculously long hours in grossly unsafe circumstances which threaten the lives and the wellbeing, not only of the drivers, but also of other users of public roads. We are all very conscious of some of the tragedies that have occurred over the past five years or so that have related to excessive driver hours. It is an issue that I regard as one of the upmost importance and I am pleased to see that the NRTC has also given it a very high priority.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In that context I just wanted to give an example that was drawn to my attention only yesterday to illustrate just how serious this issue is and how difficult it is for ordinary truck drivers to escape the pressures that put them in a position where they are forced to work ridiculously long hours and to ultimately become a danger because of fatigue, not only to themselves, but also to other road users. In some instances they end up being forced to use drugs and this ultimately increases the level of danger that is already existing.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The example I would like to cite concerns a South Australian company, quite a substantial company. A driver has regularly been doing three round trips Adelaide to Sydney per week, which is, of course, a pretty lengthy trip. On top of that he has to do a range of things associated with routine maintenance, loading, unloading, refuelling, and all of those sorts of things. He is working regularly in excess of 90 hours a week, the vast bulk of which is on the road driving a potentially lethal piece of equipment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This particular driver was on the way back into Adelaide only very recently when he stopped at a weighbridge, showed his logbook and indicated that he had clearly been breaching driving hours regulations. As a result of that his company was telephoned and he was instructed on the spot that he was dismissed. He was told that he should have taken a back route to avoid the weighbridge, that he was to take his rig and leave it at a nearby BP service station, and that it was his own problem as to how he then got home. There was instant dismissal because he had advised the regulators, or effectively the enforcers of regulations, that he had breached the regulations. This was not by some fly&amp;hyphen;by&amp;hyphen;night tiny company either; this was a substantial and quite well&amp;hyphen;known road transport operator in Adelaide.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is that sort of problem that is quite widespread. It is those sorts of pressures that force good honest working Australians to break the law in order to be able to work. As a driver, he is being offered two alternatives: he breaks the law or he does not have a job. That is the reality for a lot of drivers and that is why it is of fundamental importance for regulators,
         <break page="9011" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          politicians and organisations like the NRTC to ensure that everything possible is done to minimise this sort of conduct.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It is probably impossible to stamp it out completely, because it is difficult to regulate, but we have to place maximum priority and emphasis on eradicating this sort of behaviour by companies and contractors. In that context, not only do I applaud the NRTC but also I am very pleased to see that industry organisations—like the Road Transport Forum, Victorian Road Transport Association and other industry associations—are treating these issues very seriously. One of the other problems in this area is that, if there is a proliferation of bad operators who break the law, it places the good operators—the decent companies of which there are many—at an immense competitive disadvantage.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have already seen the majors like Mayne Nickless, Brambles and TNT gradually exiting from general road transport freight. One of the elements in that change—by no means the only one—is the problem of unfair competition faced by those companies by people breaking the law. It is important for the decent parts of the industry that the law is strictly and properly enforced, so that they can actually compete on a level playing field, where competition should exist on efficiency and reliability, not on breaking the law and endangering the lives of their drivers and other citizens on the public highway.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I commend the industry leaders for the seriousness with which they are approaching this problem and their willingness to address it. It is a very large industry. There are thousands of operators with a very wide range of people involved. It is very difficult to pursue this issue in a way that guarantees that the regulations are fully and comprehensively enforced.

         Essentially, that is all I have to say on the legislation. As I said, the opposition supports the extension of one year for the life of the NRTC to provide a breathing space in which the various governments can negotiate about the future of the NRTC. My suggestion would be that there is a substantial future for the NRTC, once the bulk of its work developing uniform regulations is completed.

        <para first-indent="16">
         There is a substantial future for the NRTC in the enforcement field—not as a direct enforcer, because that ultimately will remain the territory of the states, but as a facilitator, in the same role that it has had in the regulatory sphere. I see the NRTC having a potentially valuable role as a national facilitator in the enforcement field, working with the various enforcement bodies to ensure that the regulations are properly enforced, to ensure that there is a degree of commonality and consistency across the various jurisdictions, and to ensure that there is a Commonwealth involvement, albeit by consent with the states, in that enforcement process, so that there is enough muscle and public commitment to ensure that the sort of story that I have just recounted with respect to this Adelaide driver becomes a rarity rather than the relatively common experience that it currently is.

There is already a strong feeling that we have moved a great deal of distance in terms of reforms to road transport in Australia, but it is felt that another year is needed to bed down the reforms that are already well in the pipeline and to work out what the best future is for the NRTC.

         Let me list some of the most positive reforms that have been forthcoming since the NRTC was formed in 1991. There has been the Road Transport Reform (Vehicles and Traffic) Act, which provides the basis for uniform national road rules; the Road Transport Reform (Heavy

          Vehicles Registration) Act, which allows for uniform and consistent registration requirements across the country; and the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Act, providing for a safer operating regime for the transport by road of dangerous goods.

         These reforms have been initiated since 1991. They have involved numerous negotiations and consultations between the states and territories and the Commonwealth. Originally it was probably never imagined that such a detailed negotiation was required. But there is further time needed to make sure that the reforms already under way are bedded down and institutional arrangements made are the best for the nation as a whole in the future.

         The government last year reviewed the achievements, the accomplishments and the functions of the commission. The main findings of the review were accepted in February this year by the Ministerial Council for Road Transport. Commonwealth, state and territory officials are now working to turn the review principles into amendments to the National Road Transport Commission Act, but they also need additional time  to achieve all of these objectives.

         Clearly, Australia is an enormous continent. Most of the inland communities are effectively only linked by road and are dependent on an efficient network to move their primary production to the ports and manufacturers. And, of course, our cities depend to a very substantial degree on the transport industry to keep their commerce moving.

         A 1996 report of the Department of Transport and Regional Development, entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          A national approach to road transport regulation
         </emphasis>
         , found that the transport industry dominates freight in Australia, accounting for 75 per cent of the value of the Australian freight market. As part of the report, a survey of road transport companies was carried out. According to the respondents, differing road transport regulations between states and territories in the past had imposed the most substantial and unnecessary costs on the industry and on transport users.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The report noted that, while substantial administrative changes have resulted from increased national uniformity in Australia's road transport regulatory regime, costs to users of road freight have not significantly dropped. Savings have been invested in better equipment and the need to meet increased costs, for example in fuel. Reforms leading to uniform mass and loading regulations, uniform vehicle standards and better access for B&amp;hyphen;doubles will allow firms greater freedom to select the best driver&amp;hyphen;vehicle combinations for a given task in the future.

        <para first-indent="16">
         National standards have enabled firms to make more efficient use of their existing fleets by giving them greater freedom to select the most appropriate vehicles. Small firms in particular will be able to have more flexibility in terms of the use of drivers always under a safer regime and, as time goes by, they would expect to see the costs of using road freight reflected in these substantial reforms.

         In the past, state and territory borders have to some extent become artificial market boundaries and barriers and they have provided some shelter for intrastate operators compared with those operating interstate.

         Prior to Federation the colonies in Australia were each responsible for their transport infrastructure and regulation. The constitution recognised the integrity of the borders between states, but made sure that interstate commerce would always flow freely without taxes or tariffs. It has been the transport regulations that have assisted colonies to maintain some advantages—one against the other—over time, and it is up to this nation to make sure that we have in fact genuine free trade flowing between states.

          Responsibility for the development of road transport regulations has rested primarily with state and territory governments, and each has applied a regulatory regime considered best to suit its particular circumstances. One of the great achievements of the National Road Transport Commission has been the bringing together of all of those interests, where they recognise the nation as a whole must be, at the end of the day, the winner.

          In an effort to try to overcome some of the consequences of the interstate parochialism, the federal government, in 1987, introduced the federal interstate registration scheme, or FIRS. FIRS has been restricted in its ability to compete with state registration schemes, however, as FIRS registered vehicles cannot be used to provide intrastate services, while state registered vehicles can be used to provide both inter&amp;hyphen; and intrastate services. That is just one of the anomalies we need to work with.

          National Road Transport Commission recommendations are submitted to the Ministerial Council for Road Transport for its approval. Once the council agrees, the onus is on each government to amend its regulations to achieve national consistency. The Commonwealth is responsible for relevant legislation on behalf of the ACT, and for legislation to cover vehicles registered under FIRS. Other governments are then required to adopt substantially the intent and content of the legislation applicable in the ACT as their own.

          In the case of emission and noise standards, these are presently developed by the NRTC in conjunction with state and federal environment ministers. However, while noise and emission standards for new vehicles are controlled through the Australian design rule system administered by the Federal Office of Road Safety, second&amp;hyphen;hand or in&amp;hyphen;service vehicles' noise and emission standards are subject to a template process. In other words, they remain ultimately in the domain of the states and territories—another example where we still need time to work through anomalies that are not in the best interests of the nation.

          It is important to remember that much road transport takes place in built&amp;hyphen;up areas with substantial road congestion and population densities. Most road freight trips do not cross a state or territory border, and a high proportion of them are in urban areas. About 80 per cent of all road freight trips are less than 100 kilometres in length; thus this issue of noise abatement and emissions is an example of one of the most important areas where work in reconciling processes still has to be done.

          A 1994 report by the Centre for International Economics estimated that Australia's road transport industry accounts for two per cent of Australia's GDP, and about 2.1 per cent of total employment. This would put the value of road transport at $8.5 billion, employing at least 160,000 people. In l994 the National Transport Planning Task Force found that road transport makes up 73 per cent of the value of Australia's freight market. It showed that the total quantity of freight carried by road increased from 18 per cent in 1975&amp;hyphen;76 to 33 per cent in l990&amp;hyphen;91, and since l975&amp;hyphen;76 the average length of road freight trips has nearly doubled. Clearly, we are dealing with an industry here that is growing in proportion to the enterprise of Australia's businesses, and we have to make sure it is world best and efficient.

In a l996 survey by the Department of Transport and Regional Development, road freight operators were found to be superior in terms of reliability and service quality compared to other freight operators. They have been doing a good job. It was suggested that on some prime line haul routes such as Melbourne to Sydney, rail needed to become some 20 per cent cheaper to compete.

           Imagine the frustrations and the safety implications of an interstate trucking business faced with a 13&amp;hyphen;hour trip between Sydney and Brisbane. Under New South Wales regulations still in force, a 14&amp;hyphen;hour shift is legal. That is a shift with one driver driving continuously. Under Queensland law, however, the maximum time he may drive without a break is 12 hours. So the lone driver heading up the road from Sydney to Brisbane drives without a break and exchanges with someone else for the last hour or so of the trip or, indeed, the transport operator employs two people for the duration of the journey.

That sort of shift, obviously, can lead from time to time to endangering others on the road.

In New South Wales, trucks without 100 kilometres per hour limiters are required to go some 90 kilometres per hour on that same highway where there are single lanes. A truck driving at 90 kilometres an hour on the Hume Highway is a frustration to both a truck driver and a line of cars piled behind.

         The bill that we are debating today is the National Road Transport Commission Amendment Bill 1997. The bill extends the operation of the NRTC for another 12 months.

         It is interesting to note that the Industry Commission estimated that gains from reforms to the national road transport industry would provide up to $0.8 billion to GDP. That is a significant amount of money. It is a significant improvement in efficiency in what we do in Australia. It is important that we should look at not only building better roads to improve efficiency and safety and all those other things that we are trying to achieve, but also focus on how an industry is operated and try to do away with a lot of those inefficiencies, which predominantly flow from different regulations in different states.

         It is very good to see the work that the NRTC has achieved.

The speech also notes that the Road Transport Reform (Vehicles and Traffic) Act has been passed; that the Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Act allows for uniform and consistent registration requirements across the country; that the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Act provides for a safer operating regime for the transport by road of dangerous goods; and that driving hours for long distance coaches and for trucks have reached an advanced stage of development.

In no small way that is due to an increasing commitment between the Commonwealth and the states to improve the processes involved in transport in Australia. I think everybody would be aware of the communique that came out of the national rail summit that the former minister had convened recently in Melbourne, which was another breakthrough as far as a national decision is concerned. It is in line with what I was saying: that this nation is slowly maturing in this area of being able to work together and not having petty jealousies across state borders.

That is notwithstanding the fact that they held two seats along some of the critical parts of the Pacific Highway.

         The development of the strategy that the coalition government has with regard to road funding and the attention that is being placed on the national highway system—and not only on the development of the roads of national importance but also the reintroduction of the black spots program—have been very important elements of addressing the serious issues of transport in Australia, particularly road transport. It seems that the opposition is going to support this bill, and it was interesting to listen to the comments of the shadow minister, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), in this regard. His comments are certainly welcome and the support of the opposition is welcome.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We look forward to more positive gains during the next 12 months from the NRTC in advancing a national strategy for road transport in this area. Hopefully, in the future, we will see a national strategy—that is, one agreed to by all states—with further development of the very important network and infrastructure of roads, no matter what category they fall into across Australia. Until we reach that stage of maturity in attitude between the Commonwealth and the states, particularly coming back from the states, we will not progress it fast enough. We will not achieve the efficiencies that we must achieve to be much more competitive in the world scene.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But the most important thing that can be achieved from a national agreement on a strategy in this regard, as far as the National Road Transport Commission is concerned, and also with a national road strategy, is the efficiency in the expenditure of taxpayers' dollars. It goes without saying that we have seen what can be done with the Pacific Highway program when there is agreement between the Commonwealth and the state of New South Wales to fund that road. New mechanisms are being put into place. One section that is being built at the moment just south of my electorate is being done on a design, construct and maintain basis. The contract that was let came in, I think, somewhere in the vicinity of $60 million cheaper than the RTA's estimates.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is a new form of contract where there is a massive contract for 27&amp;hyphen;odd kilometres of brand new dual carriageway highway. The RTA estimated $196,000,000 to do the job and the successful contractor is going to do it for $130,000,000. Those sorts of innovations are what we are really responsible for in this place, making sure that we get the maximum efficiency out of taxpayers' dollars and that in turn will create a much more efficient road transport industry.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is important that we support this bill and it is important we see the continuation of the very good work that the National Road Transport Commission has achieved so far. I support this bill in extending that for the next 12 months.

           Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1997
          </xref>
          was introduced into the House on 26 June 1997. The purpose is the restructure of the Australian Wheat Board and the transfer of the AWB's wheat marketing and financing functions to an AWB wholly owned holding company and its subsidiaries.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The AWB is to retain control over export and marketing of wheat overseas. The AWB is to obtain control over the wheat industry fund, also known as WIF, until the WIF component of the levy on wheat sales is terminated on 30 June 1997. The AWB is to be treated as an
         <break page="9018" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          agent of nominated companies in respect of new season wheat transactions in the season beginning on or after 1 July 1997.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The wheat industry of Australia is one of the great historic industries, with $3 billion worth of exports. Therefore, as we would all know and understand, it is inextricably linked to the history of the country. It has a long history of government intervention, beginning in 1915, with the Wheat Board established as a wartime measure and the breaking of the collusive wheat merchants' control. In the 1930s, the Great Depression led to the government direction of wheat production levels. The Senate and states remained barriers to legislative direction. Finally, in November 1931, the wheat bounty was passed by the parliament and there was recognition of both Commonwealth and state interest. I would add that there is still evidence right back to those times, right across Australia I would imagine, of the impact on land use and land tenure of the management of the wheat industry.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In 1948, the Labor government introduced guaranteed prices, a home consumption price, the Australian Wheat Board—as we have come to know it—and stabilisation arrangements. Between 1948 and 1984, there were a series of wheat plans based on these basic concepts. From 1979 to 1983, there were calls for reform from the High Court, the Senate, the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General and the Industries Assistance Commission.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In all of that, the balance was for the growers, who by and large were small business operators, against the power—as was noted in 1915—of the merchants and the world traders. So the Wheat Board has shown a great resilience and ability to adapt, and, as much as any other contribution by any other organisation, has given a stability and strength to regional Australia, for which, as a former wheat grower, and going back as far as my grandparents, I have been extremely grateful.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The 1984 Wheat Marketing Act introduced a system of permits for wheat used for stock feed, where producers and consumers could trade directly but under guidelines and regulations; alterations to the guaranteed minimum price arrangements which sent increased market signals to producers; and five separate categories for wheat for which prices were underwritten, as against one category previously, to reduce the cross&amp;hyphen;subsidisation and allow a stronger market focus.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In 1986&amp;hyphen;87, a period I remember very well, the McColl royal commission into grain storage, handling and transport recommended a number of improvements including: marketing authorities to deal with a deregulated distribution system; removal of the requirement that market authorities grant sole receival rights to the state agencies for storage and handling; and removal of all restrictions and impediments for the transport of grain by road. There was a well&amp;hyphen;known phrase, the least cost path, because before that we had a range of impediments related to the history and development of the road&amp;hyphen;rail industry. The commission also recommended a disaggregation of port service and sea transport costs, with charges to growers and other users to reflect actual port costs—that is, reforms to allow charges for port and shipping services to more closely reflect actual costs incurred.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In 1988, we had the IAC wheat industry report, which recommended: limiting the AWB's power to control exports to prescribed markets; extending the grower&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;buyer and permit arrangements to export sales; extending permit arrangements to cover all domestic sales, with no restraints on reselling in the domestic market—and there was great debate on that issue at the time; the AWB's obligation to supply the domestic market; discontinuation of the administrative domestic pricing mechanism; discontinuation of underwriting provisions; and
         <break page="9019" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          advance payments to be a declared proportion of the season's expected market returns, with the option of negotiable certificates in lieu. Finally, the IAC wheat industry report recommended that, as far as practicable, individual payments to growers were to reflect actual market returns and associated costs.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In 1989, we had further government reform and deregulation, no doubt contributed to by the previous IAC report. There was deregulation of the domestic wheat market through the removal of the AWB's compulsory acquisition powers and termination of administered domestic pricing arrangements. There was the introduction of a fixed government guarantee on AWB borrowings in relation to pool wheat for advance payments, payments in lieu of final payments and operational expenses associated with sales where the AWB's borrowing liability exceeded money available for repayment of the borrowing.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Further in that particular development we have the removal of the requirements that there be a majority of growers among board members. I remember the angst in the industry at that time and there was a feeling, perhaps, of loss of control by members. But the philosophy, I think, has been proven to be sound and right in that the industry and the government of the day brought in the expertise—in marketing, quality control: a whole range of different expertise—other than just that of the growers, as important as that is.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Then there was the establishment of the wheat industry fund. We have funded that principally from a minimum two per cent grower levy to generate a capital base for financing the AWB's marketing activities. And finally, there is the AWB objective of maximising net returns to producers by minimising storage handling and transport costs, with costs to be passed back to individual growers where possible.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This legislation delivers control back to the growers as requested by the grains industry, and from 1 July 1999 wheat marketing will be undertaken by a grower controlled and run company. The new company will comprise a holding company with two subsidiaries, pooling and domestic trading. There will be A&amp;hyphen;class and B&amp;hyphen;class shares and the organisation of that was set down in the speech of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson). Transitional provisions will apply until 30 June 1999. There will be the cessation of the WIF levy and, of course, there is the issue of the composition of the board of the AWB.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In conclusion may I just put on record my appreciation of the industry's effort in coming to terms with the emerging competition policy and striking the balance between the stability that is so important out there for the wheat industry in regional Australia, and that which has to be market focused. In respect of those original pioneers who saw the importance of the AWB, I am sure they would be appreciative of the strength of the new arrangements adapting to the 21st century. Thank you.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (1) To be eligible for Newstart Allowance a customer must firstly be unemployed. A person who is substantially involved in running a business would not normally be regarded as unemployed. An exception to this is where the business is on a small scale and designed to be a supplement rather than an alternative to wages and is compatible with taking a full&amp;hyphen;time job.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Where it is determined that a person is unemployed for the purpose of meeting the eligibility requirements for Newstart Allowance, they must also satisfy a set of requirements known as the activity test. A major requirement of the activity test is that a person must be actively searching for and willing to undertake any suitable paid work. A self&amp;hyphen;employed person generally must meet this job search requirement, including not refusing an offer of employment because it interferes with their business. Sub&amp;hyphen;contractors or other self&amp;hyphen;employed people, who hire themselves and/or their plant or equipment out for particular jobs, may be regarded as unemployed when out of work but they too must meet the above tests.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        In certain circumstances, the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) may approve the development of self employment opportunities as an activity which satisfies activity test requirements and Newstart Allowance can be paid.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (2) The provision of work for another person would not in itself disqualify a person from receiving Newstart Allowance. However, it is unlikely that a sole trader in these circumstances would be considered to be unemployed or be able to satisfy the activity test requirements. If, for example, a sub&amp;hyphen;contractor obtains some casual work, he or she would not be disqualified from payment on the basis that they employed another person. Where the work was of a casual nature, they would be treated in a similar manner to other casual workers and would generally remain qualified for payment, subject to the income test. Self&amp;hyphen;employed people earning income may receive reduced payments or no payments at all.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (3) Newstart Allowance provides income support to unemployed people who are looking for work or who are engaged in other labour market related activities. There is no anomaly in denying an unemployment payment to someone who is not unemployed. People who have been on Newstart Allowance for at least 6 months can undertake self employment development (SED) as part of their activity agreement. SED can be approved as part of a person's activity agreement where the CES is satisfied that the business will be commercially viable within 12 months of commencement and it

         is likely to provide the person with full&amp;hyphen;time employment at a level of income at least equivalent to the rate of Newstart Allowance. The approval is intended to be for the developmental stage only and it is expected that once the business commences, income support will cease and healthy, fair competition will prevail. In addition, the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS), administered by the CES, provides income support for up to 12 months to people setting up and running businesses, as well as training in business management.
