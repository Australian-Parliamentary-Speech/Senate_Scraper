          —I thank the honourable member for his timely question. It is well known to the members of this House—and, for that matter, to the Australian public—that this government inherited a reprehensible budget deficit from the Beazley&amp;hyphen;Keating government. Under Labor the 1995&amp;hyphen;96 budget outcome showed a deficit of $10.3 billion. In our first full financial year of government we have reduced that deficit by more than half to less than $5 billion. The final budget outcome for 1995&amp;hyphen;96 shows that the underlying deficit has reduced to $4.934 billion.

         As I have said in this House on a number of occasions—and I believe the Australian people should be reminded of this time and time again—under Labor the general government debt increased from around $16 billion or four per cent of GDP in 1989&amp;hyphen;90 to around $93 billion or nearly 20 per cent of GDP in 1995&amp;hyphen;96. We have stopped that reckless extravagance and, as the OECD has projected,
         <break page="8159" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          over 1997 and 1998 Australia will have the third lowest public debt to GDP ratio in the OECD. By 2000&amp;hyphen;2001 we will have reduced our debt by almost half, to what it was in 1995&amp;hyphen;96.

         Commonwealth outlays on public debt interest increased by only three per cent last financial year, compared to over 14 per cent in 1995&amp;hyphen;96 and to an enormous 24 per cent in 1994&amp;hyphen;95. Last year's result represents sound, responsible fiscal management, a far cry from the profligate and blatant fiscal mismanagement this country received under the Beazley and Keating governments.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is a stunning turnaround, and we are not resting on our laurels. There will be a real reduction in outlays on public debt interest during the current financial year, and by 1998&amp;hyphen;99 the government will be in a strong position to realise its expected underlying budget surplus—the first since 1990&amp;hyphen;91.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         By reducing our level of public debt, we are reducing the burden on future generations of Australians. As we continue to reduce outlays on public debt interest, the government will have more flexibility to adjust spending in more important areas of the budget, while still maintaining the strong fiscal stance so essential to the future prospects of Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Unlike our predecessors, we are not a government of big budget deficits, large public debt and taxation increases. Our strategy is based on getting the fundamentals right for strong, sustainable economic growth. Our fiscal consolidation effort is focused primarily on outlays. Underlying outlays will decline from 27 per cent of GDP in 1995&amp;hyphen;96 to just under 23 per cent of GDP by 2000&amp;hyphen;2001, the lowest percentage of GDP since 1973&amp;hyphen;74. At the same time, we are raising national savings, providing a low interest rate, low inflation environment to encourage investment and raising productivity in Australian workplaces.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The budget outcome for 1996&amp;hyphen;97 is a good news story for all Australians. It demonstrates quite clearly that this is a responsible government. The budget outcome, as most commentators have acknowledged, sets the stage for long&amp;hyphen;term and sustainable recovery of the economy after 13 years of Labor mismanagement.

He had a question totally devoted to how he explained the fact that he has gone into negative growth, as far as employment is concerned, for the first time in Australian history when there has been a 12&amp;hyphen;month period of growth. He was asked why that was so—quite simple, but there has been no answer to it.

So I can assure you, Mr Speaker, and all members of this House that the ingredients are there to see growth, and the indicators show that that growth is going to occur as we proceed into the first half of next year.

          —I thank the honourable member for his question on this very important issue. As the honourable member points out in his question, the European Union has indeed put forward for the Kyoto conference a proposal of a reduction in greenhouse emissions between 1990 and 2010 of some 15 per cent. This is one of a wide range of different proposals which are being canvassed at the moment by almost all of the countries which will be party to the discussions in Kyoto. So at this point we are nowhere close to a consensus being achieved.

         Of course, all countries recognise that something needs to be done, we included. We recognise, as I think a lot do, that we should make a contribution, and that contribution should be fair and it should be equitable. But it is well known that the proposal that Australia puts forward is a proposal for differentiated national targets. That is, what we are arguing is that Australia is prepared to make a contribution, but it is only prepared to make a fair and equitable contribution. We are not prepared to carry on our own shoulders a disproportionate burden to solve this problem, and other countries should not ask Australia to carry a disproportionate burden: to give up more jobs proportionately than they are prepared to give up; to give up more of our living standards than they are prepared to give up. To put it very simply, that is why we so strongly argue for differentiated national targets.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The concept of differentiation is supported by a number of countries, and the argument that people like the Deputy Leader of the Opposition use, that somehow we are embarrassed in our isolation—and I will come back to that—is simply not true. As far as the European Union is concerned, I am not aware of any country outside of the European Union supporting the proposals of the European Union.

        <para first-indent="16">
         As far as differentiation is concerned, while different countries may have different views about how differentiation should work, the concept of differentiation is supported by countries such as Japan, Norway, Switzerland,
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          Iceland, South Korea, Singapore, Brazil and China. So it is quite a long list of countries that support differentiation.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Of course, the European Union supports differentiation as well, but the European Union only supports differentiation for the European Union. If you are outside of the European Union it is not okay; if you are in the European Union it is. Portugal, according to the European Union's program, is able to increase its emissions by 40 per cent, whereas Luxembourg is to reduce its emissions by 30 per cent. That is the differentiation of the European Union, and its simple point is that if it is all right for the European Union it should be all right for the annex 1 countries as a whole.

         It is clear the Labor Party supports the European Union's proposal. It is also clear to South Australian electors what that will mean in the South Australian election. What Labor is arguing will put something like $4 billion worth of investment in South Australia at risk, at the expense of 5,000 jobs, and let South Australian electors know on 11 October that that is the plan of the Labor Party, in stark contrast to the coalition, which will stand up for the national interest on this issue.

          —I thank the member for his question. The news in today's papers highlights the false claims being put out by the MUA, with the MUA being supported by the federal Labor opposition, because it was only as recently as yesterday that John Coombs,
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           who runs the MUA, was claiming that waterfront productivity was increasing. `It's on the up,' says John Coombs. Yet here you have in the paper today a real live example where, in fact, things are going backwards. For example, in November last year the MUA negotiated a new enterprise bargaining agreement with Patricks for Melbourne's East Swanston dock. At that time the average lifts per hour were 15 TEUs, down from 22 lifts in July of that year. But despite the agreement, which was entered into to increase productivity, the average lifts are 20 per cent down on what they were before the agreement.

         So you have the Labor Party and the MUA basically saying, `What is the problem?' You have John Coombs saying, `Things are on the up.' Yet, when you look behind it and actually look at the figures and the facts, the reality is the company has been losing productivity since the agreement was entered into—an agreement purporighted to be to improve productivity. All this is happening in the Patricks operation at a time when they have been pumping in something like $200 million worth of investment to improve the capital equipment available to do the job better in the future.

         The Labor opposition says, `What are the problems? What are the reasons for this?' Of course, one of the reasons for this is that we have a very high level of industrial action on the waterfront. What are the reasons? If you look at the facts, the international group Shipowners Mutual Strike Insurance Association ranked the Australian waterside as No. 1 in terms of strikes in 1996—No. 1 in terms of strikes in 1996—and, what is most amazing, that is in a situation where Australia only accounts for 2 per cent of the world's shipping trade but nearly 23 per cent of all days lost due to industrial action.

          You cannot deny the basic fact: if you have very substantial increases which are not tied to productivity, the people who cop it, the people who are disadvantaged, are the very people that you claim to be supporting and concerned about—namely, the low paid.

An increase of that magnitude would be a serious impediment to agreement making, which when you were in government you said, as we now say, is the way in which people can genuinely have the opportunity to do a deal at work, get the higher pay and the productivity to go with it so the thing can be sustained.

          I think it was grossly irresponsible of the federal opposition to so quickly fall in line with the ACTU.

Is it not a fact that workers who lose their jobs in the future—such as BHP's 2,000 workers in Newcastle—will be affected by this measure even if they have as little as $45,000 in superannuation; an amount which would buy a pension of a meagre $2,500 a year?

That is something that year after year they asked you to do, but you were too insensitive to do anything about it. I wonder whether the

The Centrelink agency will bring together the entire social security network, parts of the Commonwealth Employment Service network, Austudy and child-care services.

I made amply clear in the doorstop that I did on this matter this morning that I supported the principle of the living wage claim and that I believe the underpinnings of it that the ACTU had put forward were excellent. But I also said that the Industrial Relations Commission itself would have to make, with all the factors it takes into account, a determination on what the actual amount would be. What needs to be reflected upon, Mr Speaker, is that these people earn what those opposite claim as one day's TA in Sydney and they support a family on it for a week.

           industrial relations has finally slipped. The approach by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) and the government's industrial relations approach has been revealed. Those of us who have been studying it closely have always known what was going on, but it is now apparent to the public. It is starting to be reported and commented upon. What are they seeing? They are seeing a very partisan approach and they are seeing an approach focused on confrontation, not cooperation. It is an approach that is an abrogation of the proper responsibilities of government to pursue national, rather than narrow, sectional interests. What is more, it is an approach that is failing, even by its own miserable standards.

         Of course, we all say that our opposition is the worst since Federation. I said the other day that this minister is the most partisan minister in Australia's history. Is this an unreasonable claim? Let us have a look at what is being said about it by others. One of the advantages of staying back until 10.30 p.m. when the parliament sits late is that you get to see the late night news. I saw the minister being interviewed by Paul Lyneham last night. How did he start? He started off by referring to the minister as `partisan Pete'. I have to say that there is a very good reason why he did—because most Australians are.

         . . . I think we are in a war of attrition between both sides . . . We shouldn't be back in the 80s with this "slug&amp;hyphen;it&amp;hyphen;out" approach to arbitration and union matters.

         It's one thing for a Government to intervene, it's another thing to actually get in there and say to employers "take em on, we've put an Act in place, test it and we'll help you all the way". Governments should be about facilitating co&amp;hyphen;operative workplaces.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         The best part about it from our point of view is that every time the minister gets up to deny his partisanship, he reinforces it absolutely. He gets up and says, `No, I haven't been partisan,' and starts to cite all the times in which the previous government might have intervened on behalf of unions and on behalf of working people in Australia.

         He does that very selectively, because when we were the government, there were a substantial number of balanced representations made. But if the allegation is that we have a propensity to support workers and they have a propensity to support employers, I plead absolutely guilty. If it is a question of whether the role of the Labor Party in government was a balanced, responsible role in industrial relations for 13 years, I think that unquestionably it was. There is no doubt about it, and the Australian people made their judgment time and again, and I am happy to say that they are continuing to make that judgment.

         But what we find now is the circumstance where they are saying, `We are partisan in the Hunter Valley No. 1 dispute because we are calling for arbitration. It is not us who are saying that the CFMEU's claims should be adopted. We are saying that there should be arbitration. Nobody will win everything that they want.' This minister is saying, `The simple solution is that the workers should just accept the employer's offer. Why doesn't one side give in, then the problem will be

         It is not a bad role for an advocate for an employer. It is what they are expected to go in and do in public and in the Industrial Relations Commission on behalf of their client. On behalf of Rio Tinto, any paid advocate would say, `The best solution is to accept the employer's offer.' I am sure that is what their barrister has said. But why is it that the minister for workplace relations is saying it for them and why is he is sending their advocate in to say it on their behalf?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         They go into the commission and argue exactly the same case as Rio Tinto and expect us all to say, `Oh, it's just a coincidence. We did speak to them on the phone a lot. We rang them several times. We had a lot of discussions. But the fact that we came to the same conclusion is a coincidence. It is an absolute fluke. Fancy that! Rio Tinto came in and said the same as us. What a surprise! It may be that they helped us write the act. It may be that they donated to the election. It may be that they are the only people who will take up this absurd proposition of ours, so we have to support them. But it is a coincidence that we are saying the same thing. We didn't cooperate at all. I just rang them to tell them that if they looked at their fax machine, a press release might have come off it.'

Do we hear a word of support for that proposal from this government? No. All it is saying is that BHP has not been tough enough.

          One company is out there not pursuing that approach but seeking confrontation, refusing arbitration, not coming to an agreement and threatening to sue its own employees.

He needs one of those little rattles so that he can stand on the side and wave it like the supporters at the British soccer—wave his scarf and rattle and come out in support of Rio Tinto with his unqualified, undying devotion to their cause.

           Those other companies are also operating within the Workplace Relations Act. The unions negotiating with them are working within the Workplace Relations Act.

You say, `It is a one size fits all approach. Everybody has to go my way and I will support you.' If a company has the temerity to say, `We think we can achieve the major reforms we need in a cooperative manner by working with our employees and their representatives,' what they get from this government is condemnation, attack and criticism—and, in the case of BHP, I suspect, at the moment, it is pretty unwelcome criticism at this time in their corporate history.

           We have seen in the headlines the confrontations between the government's approach to industrial relations and the people it has been able to crank up to be its advocates and some of the strongest unions in this country.

What you do not see is what is happening to the weakest employees, the employees not in a strong bargaining position, who do not have such strong unions to represent them and who are confronting these same changes without a strong voice.

After they get sacked, another one comes on and just works for a couple of days. In one particular workplace in my electorate one of those young people happened to be a member of the shop assistants union. She got $200 back pay. That is a sign of what has happened to all the others that nobody spoke up for. That is how much they all lost. There is no publicity about

           So what do we have now? The end of the cooperative era in industrial relations has now unfortunately been seen. We have had cooperation derided, arbitration attacked. We have the promotion, the encouragement, the active seeking of confrontation. He is ringing people up in America and Jakarta saying, `Isn't there somebody out there prepared to have a fight?' He is like a promoter without a boxer ringing everybody up saying, `Who is it that is going to turn up? I've an opponent for you, won't someone hop into the ring?' He has had only a very mild change from the role he was playing before, strolling around the Australian industrial relations scene like a pocket Maggie Thatcher looking for an Arthur Scargill to fight.

           But why won't the employers hop into the ring? Because they have sensible obligations and responsibilities to their shareholders. If they choose to seek reform cooperatively without closing down their workplaces, if they keep the coalmine operating whilst negotiating for change, they deserve the government's support. The Australian people deserve a better industrial relations system than the Americanisation of Australian industrial relations we have experienced in Australia in this last 18 months.

Is that the future we want to see for Australian industrial relations? Do we want to see the government's advocate going before the Industrial Relations Commission and saying, `If this dispute goes on and on as a intractable dispute, well, so be it.' That is the government's position.

         It is the same at Rio Tinto. At the start of last week Tony Marr, who is the 2IC in the CFMEU said publicly—and it has been reported—that the intention of the union was to grind the company into the dust. And you support them! You claim we are being partisan when we say, `What needs to happen here is for people to focus on what needs to be done to run this particular operation more efficiently.' What we need is a system where people are responsible for managing their own affairs to improve the productivity of that particular mine or, in the case of the Cairns waterfront, to improve the productivity of that operation.

Examples of the productivity improvements include the case of the port of Tauranga where the volume of logs loaded per gang per hour increased from 70&amp;hyphen;80 cubic metres to 110 cubic metres while gang sizes fell from 10.5 to six persons, resulting in a labour productivity increase of about 150 per cent.

          I will conclude by making just a few brief points about the Hunter Valley dispute. Indeed, that particular dispute does not go to the question of wages or conditions. It goes to the question of an employer that has had a long history since the Franco regime in 1937, when its managing director told a meeting of Rio Tinto shareholders in Spain that year that the workers would be quashed under Franco's, Mussolini's and Hitler's fascist regime, which would be to the benefit of the company. I am fearful that indeed those same sentiments persist in Australia today.

If you go through the history of everybody on that side of House, there would be very few of them who either have not been an active member of the union or are not still currently an active member of the union.

         A lot has been said about the Cairns situation and that unpleasant incident recently on the wharves. It needs to be said, first of all, that the company that was involved in this, International Purveyors, rightly have come to realise that they needed only four people to do the work of seven.

         It needs to be understood that there is a lot at stake here. We are talking about a few individuals who were complaining that they were going to lose their jobs, but International Purveyors moves over $100 million dollars worth of goods through Cairns. There has been a real concern, and I will quote our local chamber of commerce. They said that there has always been a concern that at some stage they are going to move their supply depot from Cairns. It could go to Darwin, Singapore or even the United States. They said they were constantly in competition and hoped that this move—and we are talking about Interna

         They were arguing that they were going to lose six, eight or nine full&amp;hyphen;time jobs and some part&amp;hyphen;time jobs. The reality is that, if we lost $100 million out of the Cairns economy, we would be losing dozens of jobs. To suggest that we need to maintain that ineffectiveness and that non&amp;hyphen;competitive nature for the sake of half a dozen jobs is an absolute nonsense.

Guess what the average Cairns wharf worker earns? He earns $62,000 a year—and that is for three days work a week. Is that a fair go?

         I will give you some examples. We have heard some in the House recently but you have to repeat some of these; there are a couple of other ones there that I think need to go onto the record. First of all, for a day shift your average wharfie gets $33.32 an hour, for the evening shift they get $46.32 an hour and for the midnight shift they get $60.36 an hour. It increases for Sundays, public holidays, et cetera. Then there is another interesting one they call the `close day'. For a close day they get $102.57 an hour plus an extra annual day's leave whenever they work it. I will explain what a close day is in a moment—it is a little beauty. I might add that we are talking about grade 3 waterside workers. They are classified as semi&amp;hyphen;skilled. A supervisor at the same port would earn upwards of $136,000 a year. So I can assure you we are in the wrong occupation—there is no question about it.

         The minister mentioned earlier on the number of days off that they have: the five weeks annual leave, et cetera. They have 17 weeks a year when they can be absent on full pay. He did not say that they have a 27.5 per cent annual leave loading and a 27.5 per cent
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          long service leave loading too. We heard the other day about the Akubra hats for them to sit on top of their hard hats. We also heard about the wellington boots and the safety boots and the trousers and the shirts and the overalls—even towels for showering and a nylon bag to carry it all in. With all of that, of course, there are expenses. So every man receives a laundry allowance of $13.90 a week. But the overalls are different; they are provided at work and so they are laundered by the company. I mean, we have to take care of that as well!

         One of the more interesting ones which I mentioned before is the close day. A closed public holiday, for the information of the House, is called a `wharfies' picnic day'. Under the award they are entitled to five per year—in Cairns, too! It is not a bad effort really when you think about it. And you wonder why people start to get a little bit concerned and a little bit perturbed, particularly people living out in the bush who are making a living out of trying to grow something that they are going to export and who then find that they cannot get anywhere near the prices that they want or they cannot sell their products for export because of the anti&amp;hyphen;competitive nature of our wharves, which are held up really by just a few greedy and unreasonable individuals.

There was a real hope within the community that we would have been able to sustain that and get some productivity in there because while we are talking about one Freeport supply ship—or two every three weeks we get in there—the Chamber of Commerce has been working very hard on a number of other companies to try and get supply bases out of Cairns. We are very much reliant on the tourism industry. We desperately need other business. But while we have these restrictions on the wharves it is going to be very hard to be competitive.

         The union movement has been shaping up for a fight ever since Australia overwhelmingly elected the Howard coalition government. The unions have never been able to accept either their dwindling roles in modern society or the temerity of the Australian voter in dumping Labor and electing a conservative government. If it was not the waterfront, some other issue inevitably would have been found to act as an excuse to declare war on the government and the country. There is no doubt that the union movement still has the capacity to do serious damage to the Australian economy and the livelihood of every Australian, but there is no doubt also that the union movement in its current form, which is still based on outdated 19th century principles of class warfare, ultimately is.

          The museum proposes to acquire a 99-year lease for a 2,852 square metre site known as Wharf 7, Pyrmont and to construct a building to provide accommodation for its back&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;house activities, including collection and display areas and a library. The lease will be acquired from the Citywest Development Corporation of the New South Wales government for a cost of $4.5 million. The cost of the development, $19.5 million in all, will be borrowed from a major bank and repaid over a period of approximately 12 to 14 years using rental offsets and income earned from commercial activities on the site.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The new site will provide the opportunity for the museum to co&amp;hyphen;locate with the Sydney Maritime Museum, a move the museum believes will be advantageous to both organisations. The building will accommodate the museum's collection, curatorial, conservation and registration staff, laboratories, workshops and library. An innovative design solution will provide the public with the maximum access to the collection and the back&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;house activities, compatible with safety and efficiency. The estimated outturn cost is $19.5 million. It is anticipated that the construction will start in April 1998 and be completed by April 1999. I commend the motion to the House.

          —When the government introduced the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 it suggested that it sought only to make a number of technical amendments to the Workplace Relations Act 1996. Apparently this is the case, and more the pity for it, because there is still much that needs to be done before the principal act starts to bring about any significant improvements in Australia's labour market performance.

         Schedule 8 of the bill clarifies and extends the conferral powers to the Commonwealth from the Victorian government. The Commonwealth Powers (Industrial Relations) Act 1996 was passed by the Victorian parliament on 11 November 1996 and was premised on an interpretation of the Australian constitution that opines the Commonwealth is unable to pass law which impinges upon the functions of a state that are critical to that state's capacity to govern.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The decision by Victoria to transfer one of its prime constitutional rights and responsibilities to the central government was almost, if not entirely, unique. Previously, the Commonwealth and the six states had each shared the responsibility for industrial relations. The latter had hitherto jealously guarded their sovereignty in this field of industrial relations. Despite the passage of the principal act through the parliament last year, five out of the six states remain out of step with Victoria.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         By any criterion, this is a strange state of affairs—if the House will forgive that pun. Here we have, arguably, one of the key states comprising the Canberra-Sydney-Melbourne triangle acting alone in a way not emulated, or even in prospect of being emulated, by any other state. This is intriguing, because the Premier of Victoria is never short on offering his advice to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) about how he should go about his job. More about that later perhaps.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is now pretty widely accepted that the original workplace relations package fell seriously short of the government's promised reforms due to the influence of its de facto co-author, Senator Kernot. The unwelcome outcome enshrined in the principal act is that relatively modest reforms were reduced to mediocre ones. Whether that mediocrity influenced the Victorian government to subcontract to the Commonwealth remains a moot point. It is unusual, though, but not unheard of, for a state or states to relinquish powers to the central government. But it is very rare.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Victoria's Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Mr Birrell, recently called on the other states to hand over their industrial relations powers to the Commonwealth so as to nurture a more uniform national industrial relations environment, saying, `Australia can ill afford the status quo.' So advice from our friends in Victoria is not limited to Mr Kennett. Mr Birrell argued that Victoria was benefiting from the decision by way of increased productivity, improved certainty, reduced costs for business and reduced complexity for both employees and employers.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Critics claim that the Kennett government's decision to cede its industrial relations powers to the Commonwealth amounts to little more than a cop-out. Perhaps somewhere down the track we might expect to read about the Victorian Premier once again lambasting the Commonwealth for the inadequacy of its industrial relations apparatus, as he does already at practically every other opportunity.

         <para first-indent="16">
          For its part, the present federal government, through the agency of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), continues to hail the acquisition of Victoria's powers through the legislation, which at least for now remain for the other states the responsibility of state governments.

          Of all the clauses in schedule 5, item 1 is the most significant in terms of the clarification between federal laws and awards and state legislation governing termination of employment. Subsection 152(1A), as it now exists, could see employers bound to state provisions on termination such as severance
          <break page="8188" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           pay, despite being covered by a federal award. This goes way beyond what was intended in the principal act.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The subsection was originally included to protect employees by providing them with access to state unfair dismissal provisions, irrespective of whether they were covered by a federal award. However, it appears that the subsection also provides an avenue for employees to utilise other state provisions, including redundancy consultation.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          While new subsection 152(1A) will not claw back any of the existing safeguards for employees, it will prevent them from accessing state laws, unless those laws relate to harsh, unjust or unreasonable termination of employment. That seems eminently reasonable.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Item 2 of schedule 5 is also important as it brings unions into line with individuals in terms of the length of time available to them to apply to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, the AIRC, over termination. The original workplace relations bill outlined a maximum 21&amp;hyphen;day threshold for individuals to make their case to the AIRC after notification of their termination of employment. However, there was no such stipulation for unions.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Critics of this amendment claim that it is inequitable and may not provide unions with adequate time to launch their claim on behalf of a member or members. If 21 days is insufficient time to allow the union machine to move into top gear, then so be it. Why should the unions have more time to do what individual employees are currently doing without the resources available to a formal organisation such as a union? The simple answer is that there is no justification for this disparity, and the amendment is a sensible one.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The final item worth noting in this schedule is that which clarifies the ruling on termination payouts. Subsection 170CH(8) of the bill will be repealed by these measures, the result being:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">

         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          It is the latter part of the definition that is important as it was absent from the original act. Employees are now assured that, if they have been paid less than their entitlement in the six months prior to termination, their payout will reflect what they were actually paid or what they should have been paid, whichever is the higher.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The changes to the powers of the Employment Advocate are among the more interesting ones in this bill. As one analyst has observed:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          They are a significant new weapon in the Employment Advocate's arsenal because, for the first time, an authorised officer is allowed to enter a workplace where breaches are not suspected, in search of evidence in relation to where breaches are suspected.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          Under the proposed changes, the Employment Advocate will be able to interview any person in a workplace in an effort to determine whether there has been a breach of the Workplace Relations Act. This contrasts markedly with the current legislation that allows for the interviewing of any employee only if there is a suspicion of a breach.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Items 1 to 6 of schedule 8 of the bill will clarify and extend the application of two rulings from the original act. As the legislation currently stands, a successor employer is bound to the existing certified agreement of his or her predecessor only if the former is either a constitutional corporation or the Commonwealth government itself. This amendment will mean that in future all successor employers in Victoria will also be bound by any existing certified agreements that are in place. It is not a controversial amendment as it seeks to bring into effect what was always intended by the federal and Victorian governments.

          Mr Lyndon Rowe, the Executive Director of the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the CCIWA, described the principal act as `a major disappointment'.

          It must have been perfectly clear to the Prime Minister while on a recent overseas trip that Australia is languishing behind the United Kingdom, the United States and New Zealand in the freeing up of labour markets. Perhaps he could remind the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business of that. It is no accident that unemployment in each of those three countries—the UK, the USA and New Zealand—is impressively less than it is in Australia.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Schedule 5 of this bill will see a number of minor technical changes to the original act with regard to Australian workplace agreements, AWAs. However, these are insignificant changes and will not substantially impact upon the manner in which AWAs will continue to operate. At the time that the principal act was passed through this place, the CCIWA suggested that `the flexibility gained, though, by AWAs is limited by the no disadvantage requirement'. This bill will do nothing to increase the flexibility of AWAs and will therefore continue to limit any national benefit that employers and business groups hoped to see under the coalition's industrial relations reform program and policies.

          Having had time to observe the shortcomings of the Reith-Kernot legislation, there is ample evidence that criticism of it is well founded.

I would not very often quote that august organisation; one of the great cop&amp;hyphen;out employer organisations which has led the way over history in wage break&amp;hyphen;outs time after time after time, in conjunction with employers in my old industry, the building industry.

          It's one thing to say employers ought to be tough, and the signs are the hard yards we are putting in are starting to pay off. But it's the legislation that hasn't supported their—

          It should be said that the MTIA's comments were in response to remarks made by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Ian McFarlane. In effect, the governor said that management had been weak in adjusting to the demands of enterprise bargaining and that wages growth was `out of whack' with the pace of economic growth. With that newspaper report back in May, and given the record of the building industry, is it any wonder that that body of employers is now breaking out and making deals, the costs of which far exceed economic growth and productivity gains?

          Another example of disquiet from a whole grab bag of examples was reported by Ms Katharine Murphy in the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Australian Financial Review
          </emphasis>
          not so long ago. This time concerns were expressed on behalf of the Business Council of Australia, the BCA. Mr Vernon Winley called for a substantial overhaul of the Australian labour force within three years. That exhortation alone demonstrates the fact that the BCA is far from enthralled with the Reith-Kernot Workplace Relations Act. This bill will do nothing to encourage enthusiasm in the government's industrial relations reform agenda.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Ms Murphy reported that Mr Winley further said `a completely new, streamlined and internally coherent piece of labour market legislation' might be required to address the demands of the global market. This was despite the operations of the act, ostensibly designed to increase labour market flexibility. Mr Winley is just one among a number of responsible commentators who laments the minister's compromises reached with the Democrats to obtain passage of the Workplace Relations Act. Mr Winley said the act had led
          <break page="8190" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           to a `new system dogged by a belts and braces approach to safeguards', particularly with the new stream of non-union individual contracts. He went on to state that the act's `excessive administrative burden' had been `to the detriment of flexibility and easy implementation of productivity dangers'.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          These are mere examples of where Australia is or is not with the Reith-Kernot Workplace Relations Act. An outcome of the deal done with the Democrat senator by the minister acting alone is that relatively humble reforms have been reduced to modest and marginal ones, according to labour force academic Ms Judith Sloan. In other words, the originally proposed legislation before the backdown by the minister was inadequate to the needs of modern Australia seeking its place in a competitive global economy. What we ended up with was worse. That outcome is arguably because the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business in his dealings with Senator Kernot did not display an understanding of the difference between negotiation and capitulation.

          As recently as 5 August, Mr Allan Wood wrote in the

           Australian

          that Australia must adopt a more radical approach to labour market reform, including a simple, short and new industrial relations statute. He went on:

         <para font-size="-=2">
          Growth is an important part of the solution to unemployment . . . but that growth is not a short term cyclical boost. Labour market deregulation and faster microeconomic reform more generally will lift the economy's sustainable long term growth rate.

         <para style="Para">
          He concluded by saying that this is what is needed to eat into unemployment in Australia. In particular, the Reith-Kernot act makes less than satisfactory progress in reducing the number of unfair dismissal claims.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Unlike the Workplace Relations Bill 1997 that was debated in this place last sitting week, these amendments do not deal with the issue of unfair dismissal in any way. That is most unfortunate. The coalition's decision to not only partly exclude small business from unfair dismissal provisions has forced some employers to adopt practices designed explicitly to circumvent the current legislation—surprise, surprise.
         </para>
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          <para first-indent="16">
           For example, it is becoming increasingly common for employers to engage new staff on short&amp;hyphen;term contracts. Once the contract has expired, the employer has the option of dispensing with that employee without the fear of running foul of the unfair dismissal provisions. They then simply employ another worker or even the same one on another short-term employment contract and press ahead with business as usual.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           This is not a practice that should be encouraged. It is another illustration of how many in business still feel that their back is against the wall when it comes to dealing with unfair dismissal. The government remains adamant that the changes it has championed in this field will see a reduction in the number of claims being brought against employers.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           This is not the way to bring about such a reduction. One wonders how sustained economic growth and employment can possibly result when business is having to resort to utilising short&amp;hyphen;term employment contracts simply because the government did not have the gumption to bite the bullet and embrace a more radical workplace relations reform program. The CCIWA has said of the new unfair dismissal provisions:
          </para>

           These changes will not cause a large decrease in the total number of unfair dismissals filed. However, employers will be better placed in defending claims that are made against them, and claims are more likely to be settled earlier in the conciliation process than happened under the previous legislation.

The minister has sought to consult widely in the community on this legislation. Indeed, as a member of the Committee on Industrial Legislation, which is the legislative subcommittee of the National Labour Consultative Council, the minister has met with a number of people, including Mr Reg Hamilton of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Mr Tim Pallas of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, with a view to achieving broad agreement on what the government seeks to enact through the  Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 .

          This meeting discussed a range of matters. It is interesting to see that a very large number of the amendments were accepted as being non&amp;hyphen;contentious and technical by everyone at the meeting. There were a number of amendments which, while considered to be technical amendments, Mr Pallas would recommend to the ACTU that they should be opposed. Then there was a third group which
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           were recommended for total opposition. We think that the ACTU and the Labor Party are playing politics in relation to this legislation, which is important though technical legislation.

          This bill will amend the Workplace Relations Act 1996. The amendments include changes to certified agreements, Australian workplace agreements and the Employment Advocate, the no&amp;hyphen;disadvantage test, the termination of employment, the freedom of association and preference clauses, union disamalgamation and matters referred to the Commonwealth by the state of Victoria. The bill also makes a number of minor amendments to five other acts, namely: the Navigation Act 1912; the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988; the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992; the Superannuation Act 1976; and the Superannuation Act 1990.

          It is eminently regrettable that the Labor Party is seeking to oppose the attempts of this government to ensure that the effect of the Workplace Relations Act mirrors the intention of this parliament when it passed through the House some time ago. What we have sought to do is to introduce flexibility and choice into the industrial relations system of Australia. It is interesting to note, that since the passage of the Workplace Relations Act 1996, we have had some 1,600 new agreements certified—including 47 directly between employers and employees—and over 500 Australian workplace agreements have been approved.

          So, far from the concerns of the honourable member for Curtin being accurate, this government has brought about a sea change in industrial relations. This government has realised that we could not go on the way we were, with certain sections in the Australian community, principally the union movement, having rights, privileges and responsibilities not available to other Australians. This government has sought, through its legislation, to even up the situation. We have brought legislation into the House which is balanced, fair and necessary.

          It ought to be recognised that when we were elected in March 1996 we inherited an
          <break page="8192" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           economy that had many problems. We all recall the fact that the former government said that the budget was in surplus whereas on the Monday after the election we discovered that there was a deficit of $10.3 billion. We inherited a situation where real wages had fallen since Labor had assumed office in 1983. Despite some improvement in the last years of Labor, wages were still below their level of a decade before. Our labour productivity continued to lag behind that of many of our trading partners and was well below the OECD average. We were therefore unable to compete internationally. Inflation had risen to more than five per cent and nominal interest rates were amongst the highest in the OECD. Worst of all, our unemployment rate became stuck at a very high level and there was no attempt made by the then government to reduce it.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business has clearly pointed this out on very many occasions. What we had to do, therefore, was to fix up the problem we inherited even though we did not cause it. That is why we have attacked problems in the economy. That is why we have assisted small business. That is why we have created a situation where business is able to grow, invest and create jobs. That is why we have brought in responsible economic management which has seen five successive interest rate falls in the period that we have been in office. We have created an environment where the economy will get under way. We have looked at what we have inherited and decided what had to be changed.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I ought to mention also that one of the key problems in the area of industrial relations was the inheritance of Laurie Brereton's unfair dismissal laws—the job destroying unfair dismissal laws—which prevented so many employers putting on extra staff. We have sought through other legislation recently passed through this place to remove the effect of the job destroying unfair dismissal laws for small business.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          So this government has looked at the mire and the mess that we inherited and done something about it. Consequently the workplace relations bill was introduced to the
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           parliament. It was a very strong piece of legislation, clearly recognising the realities of this place. It was necessary to talk to the Democrats because we took the view that it was best to get most of what we wanted into the law of Australia rather than none at all. Had we taken the advice proffered to the minister by the honourable member for Curtin, we would have been stuck with the industrial relations regime of the former government, we would not have had any legislation through the parliament, and we would therefore have had business languishing under the industrial relations system given to us by the Labor Party.

          It is eminently reasonable that the minister was prepared to be flexible, that he was prepared to sit down and talk to Senator Kernot and to anyone else who would talk in the Senate with a view to making sure that we got through most of what we wanted. The Workplace Relations Act has been a particularly successful piece of legislation. Every day this legislation is considered to be a success. A number of newspaper reports and editorials have pointed out very clearly that this legislation is necessary and will benefit the Australian community.

          When the government reviews legislation—part of the law of this land—it must from time to time make changes. We always said that we would review the legislation after it became law, and that is why we considered a number of the amendments which are currently part of the legislation before the House. We are pointing out that these are technical amendments. They do not include matters of great moment or substance. I am very sorry that once again we find that the opposition is seeking to frustrate the government as it endeavours to sweep up the mess left behind by the opposition when it left the treasury bench in March 1996.

          I referred a moment ago to the meeting which took place between the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reg Hamilton, Mr Tim Pallas and other members of the Committee on Industrial Legislation—the legislative subcommittee of the National Labor Consultative Council. Mr Pallas pointed out that the ACTU remained
          <break page="8193" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           opposed to the policy of the Workplace Relations Act. But, as I said, he recommended that a number of matters listed in the first group of items were technical and ought not to be opposed.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Those matters include: clarifying the Australian Industrial Relations Commission's power to arbitrate in relation to safety net wage adjustments during a bargaining period; clarifying the status of awards made under section 170MX; updating the reference to `awards' in legislation other than the Workplace Relations Act; ensuring that designated awards can be determined for the purposes of the no disadvantage test for certified agreements; clarifying the successor provisions for certified agreements and AWAs binding on Victorian employees; clarifying the time limit allowed for applications to certify an agreement; removing section 170VT(2), which is obsolete; correcting paragraph 170XA(2)(b) by omitting the word `other'; extending the prohibition on hindering the AWA negotiations and providing false statements to ensure that it applies in relation to variation, extension and termination of AWAs; clarifying the provision dealing with access to AWAs for Victorian employees; setting time limits on the making of certain termination of employment applications and for discontinuance of such applications; correcting an unintended limitation on access to disamalgamation by registered organisations; clarifying who may make an application for a disamalgamation ballot to ensure that a committee of management can make such application, whether it was elected by a direct or collegiate voting system; clarifying what documents may be inspected under a right of entry permit by defining the term `ancillary document', which relates to AWAs; removing from section 178 obsolete references to section 182 and bans clauses; removing a number of obsolete references and updating references to state legislation; and clarifying the status of `incidental and necessary' provisions in awards simplified by the AIRC during the award simplification process.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The items in group 1 also permit the Employment Advocate or the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, as appropriate, to
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           designate a state award for the purpose of the no disadvantage test where there is no federal award regulating the terms and conditions of employees engaged in the same kind of work as the employees whose employment is to be covered by an agreement. Lastly, they provide for compensation which may be awarded in respect of an unfair dismissal to be calculated by reference to the amount of remuneration to which the applicant was entitled rather than the amount the applicant actually received.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          That is the range of technical matters in group 1, which Mr Pallas and other people present at the meeting signed off on. One would hope that the opposition would have been prepared not to oppose those matters at least. But I gather that Mr Pallas has not been able, in all cases, to persuade his colleagues in the Labor opposition to support the position that he took at that particular meeting. That is unfortunate. Maybe my good friend opposite, the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), might be prepared to tell us later if he makes a contribution why the ACTU and the Labor Party have reneged on this situation.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There is a group of amendments which Mr Pallas also conceded were technical amendments, but he indicated that he would recommend to the ACTU that these items should be opposed even though they are technical. So we find the ACTU, no doubt supported by the political wing of the ACTU, the Labor Party, clearly opposing the technical amendments in group 2.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I think I should outline to the House what those particular amendments in group 2 are. They seek to: make clear the 14&amp;hyphen;day period to be provided to employees to consider a certified agreement is not affected by new staff commencing work within the period; expand the definition of `AWA official' to include all staff of the Office of the Employment Advocate; clarify the provision relating to the publication of AWA determinations; clarify the rights of entry and powers of authorised officers of the Employment Advocate; and clarify reference to `relevant award' in section 152 to make clear that relevant awards are relevant state awards.

          <para first-indent="16">
           As one can see, there is nothing major, nothing complex, nothing complicated and nothing difficult in the changes proposed to be included as a result of those items set out in group 2. Yet, despite that, the ACTU has recommended that they be opposed. This government has gone out to consult, has talked and been reasonable. The minister has been prepared to talk through and discuss all of these matters with all parties in the community. Yet at the end of the day we find that, despite the fact that the law is not being substantially changed as a result of the technical amendments in group 2, the Labor Party is clearly not prepared to come on board and be reasonable.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           There are a number of items set out in group 3. I suppose these are items which would positively cause the ACTU to froth—not for any particular reason, because they also are technical amendments. Clearly, those amendments are amendments which the Labor Party and the ACTU are not prepared to stomach. That is an absolutely ridiculous attitude from both of them, because these amendments merely seek to extend the time limit allowed for filing AWAs from 14 days to 21 days. They permit persons authorised by AWA parties to provide information to the Employment Advocate if the Employment Advocate considers it appropriate. They allow the Employment Advocate to waive technical filing requirements in relation to AWAs where waiver would not disadvantage a party to the AWA. They clarify the application of state laws on termination to employers covered by federal awards. They ensure that an agreement may not be approved where it includes a preference provision inconsistent with the freedom of association provisions of the Workplace Relations Act, and they provide for the removal of void preference clauses in awards and agreements.

We have got away from the industrial warfare tactics of those opposite.

         He said in relation to the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill that these technical amendments seek to even up the situation. I presume that what he means by that is that the amendments are designed to ensure an even balance between the employers on one side and the employees on the other side. The claim that is made by the member for Fisher and by those people who sit alongside him and on the front bench is that, in some way, this legislation will ensure that negotiations, particularly at the Australian workplace agreement level, will be undertaken by equals. Nothing is further from the truth.

It was suggested that, if he were concerned about the confidentiality of the agreements—the question of privacy—all he had to do was blot out the names and then he could let us know some of the terms that were

Those opposite talk about negotiations, but not genuine negotiations. They like the boss's office formula. They do not like the idea of the union in a civilised, mature, balanced, constructive way sitting down with the employers and with the managers.

         Whilst there has been a lot of rhetoric on this particular piece of legislation, the fact of the matter is that this bill is proposing various technical amendments to the operation of the Workplace Relations Act, which, by and large, came into effect on 1 January this year. In preparing the amendments, the government sat down with the ACTU and the employers organisation, the ACCI, and we comprehensively went through each and every one of the propositions that the government was proposing. Most of the amendments were put by the government as we have monitored the operation of our new workplace relations laws, but we did accept one amendment from the employers and we accepted one amendment from the ACTU.

          In one of the final meetings that we held in Melbourne on a Saturday with this committee—it is known as the Committee on Industrial Legislation, which is a subcommittee of the National Labour Consultative Committee—we ended up agreeing that one lot of amendments being proposed were entirely technical, which the ACTU would not oppose; one lot they agreed were technical but they would oppose them; and there were some that they would not agree were technical and were opposed.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I think it would be fair to say that, on the ones where they disagree, they disagree because they disagree with the original proposition rather than fighting over the technical amendment. We have deliberately kept this at a technical level. Whilst there are many fights and arguments we have with the Labor Party and the ACTU, we do prefer to argue on the substantive issues rather than the technical ones. For that reason, obviously we would encourage our colleagues in the Senate to give due and appropriate passage to the legislation.

          It is appropriate, however, that I say something about Australian workplace agreements, which have created so much excitement in the Labor Party in recent times. These are individual, or maybe collective, agreements available under the Workplace Relations Act. I should say that, if you are going to have one of those agreements, they still have to pass the no disadvantage test; in other words, in total you cannot be worse off than the total benefit provided by the award. That is established by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and is a fair protection for people in entering into agreements.

          We also have made it very clear in the law to the Employment Advocate that these agreements must be genuine.

Sometimes we have duress by union bullies who get stuck into employees and make them toe the line. If the member for Charlton is genuinely concerned about duress, he would acknowledge that.

          The opposition claims that some of the proposed amendments increase the powers of the Employment Advocate.

They are designed to correct drafting oversights which have led to minor errors and anomalies, to clarify existing provisions and to make some other minor changes to make sure the legislation operates as intended. Even the ACTU does agree that most of them are technical. As to the few that they say are not technical, we obviously disagree with that opinion.

          One of the amendments would give the Employment Advocate the discretion to waive strict compliance with elements of the filing procedures in circumstances where the Employment Advocate considers that waiver would not disadvantage a party to the Australian workplace agreement. In the absence of such a waiver, the Employment Advocate has
          <break page="8200" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

          The capacity to waive minor defects is a sensible technical amendment aimed at smoothing the operation of the AWA provisions and eliminating unnecessary delays and procedural burdens. It is in keeping with the intention of the AWA scheme that it is to provide a simple and speedy means of formalising agreements entered into by employers and employees. To suggest that the amendment amounts to an increase in the powers of the Employment Advocate is obviously a nonsense.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The amendment makes clear that the advocate will have to be satisfied the waiver would not disadvantage a party to the AWA. The amendment will not affect the substantive requirements to be met by an AWA. There will still be a need for strict compliance with the substantive requirements, such as the provisions relating to the no disadvantage test and, of course, genuine consent. The amendment provides only for defects of a technical nature to be  waived. This will avoid a waste of time and resources involved in correcting minor defects whilst ensuring that the interests of AWA parties are protected.

          Another proposed amendment extends the time limit for filing an AWA from 14 to 21 days after it is signed. This is a simple, practical change designed to assist the parties, especially those in rural centres. It could hardly be described as an increase in the powers of the advocate.

          On accountability, the opposition claims there is a lack of accountability in the AWA process. It has previously suggested that the advocate should provide written decisions. Provided an agreement meets all relevant statutory requirements, including the no disadvantage test, there is no point in the advocate wasting time and resources preparing written reasons for decisions. A requirement to publish decisions would do nothing to improve the operation of AWAs; it would simply delay it.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Contrary to the claims made by the opposition, AWAs are not secret documents. Parties to AWAs, both employers and employees, are free to disclose the content of their AWAs to anyone, and the act specifically provides that an agreement must not include any provision that prohibits or restricts disclosure of details of the AWA by either party. The fact that approval arrangements are streamlined does not mean that employee protections are compromised. The act provides extensive protection for employees and these protections are explained in the information statement which employers wishing to enter into AWAs must provide to their employees.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The information statement is a detailed booklet prepared by the advocate. It makes clear that to be approved an employee must genuinely consent to the agreement and the agreement must meet the no disadvantage test. The information statement explains how the test operates and provides advice about the appointment and role of bargaining agents. It makes very clear that an employee cannot be dismissed for refusing to sign an AWA. It also sets out how to obtain further information from the Office of the Employment Advocate.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The Employment Advocate can only approve an AWA if it clearly meets the no disadvantage test. If the Employment Advocate has any unresolved concerns about whether the test is met, the advocate is obliged to refer the agreement to the AIRC. The commission may decide to reduce particular AWA determinations to writing if it chooses
          <break page="8201" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           to do so. This is a matter for the discretion of the commission, but any determination which is to be published must be edited to ensure it does not disclose the identity of the AWA parties.

          Where any concerns about compliance with the no disadvantage test are resolved by written undertakings given by the employer, those undertakings are deemed to be part of the agreement to which they relate and are therefore enforceable as part of the agreement. Stripped of their rhetoric, the opposition's objections to the proposed amendments amount to no more than the fact that they object to employers and employees taking responsibility for their own workplace relationships without the intervention of uninvited third parties.

         The opposition understands the mischief to which the government is trying to respond in this particular set of amendments. We have a situation of continuous employment: some new person is employed every day. So the provision of the act that says you have to give 14 days' notice to everybody is impossible to comply with. You never get to a point where everybody has had 14 days' notice. We understand that. Our concern—and we want to facilitate dealing fairly with that concern—is that the rather stark way it has been dealt with in the bill has the potential of creating a situation where the time period for the last&amp;hyphen;employed employee could get down to five minutes. We are trying to accommodate that by way of a two&amp;hyphen;stage process.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I will speak to all the amendments together; they essentially go to the same point. We are trying to say, first, that a lesser period should occur as of right. It is not an extreme or unusual position for someone to be employed every day. Where a person has been employed within the last 14 days and, but for that fact, every other aspect of the approval arrangements has been complied with, the fact that the notice was between seven and 14 days as a result of late employment should not stand in the way. In all the circumstances up to and including that, the outcome of our proposal would be the same as that for the government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We are looking to have in place some mechanism for people employed less than seven days that says it ought to be a reasonable period. But in an extreme case—for example, the case that I gave in my opening—where it is a very big project and a new person is being employed every day, you will never meet the test. Even if the test is any specified number of days, you will never meet it because there is always a new person
         <break page="8202" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          coming on. There ought to be the capacity for an independent body—the commission—to say, `You are dealing with this fairly. You have put a fair set of arrangements in place. You cannot meet even the seven&amp;hyphen;day test but it is as fair as it can possibly be; therefore, that lesser period is approved.'
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is the structure. It is reflected slightly differently in each of the three amendments because they are dealing with slightly different circumstances, but they come together to try to meet the legitimate concern of the government that there are circumstances in which these sorts of agreements will not otherwise be able to receive approval in meeting the technical requirements which most will, and should, meet.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We want to put a proposal in place that strikes a balance and I think it is the same balance the government is trying to strike. I do not think in this instance we have different objectives. Our concern is that the way it is constructed creates the potential for an individual, through no fault of anybody, to fail to receive reasonable notice of an agreement about which they are required to give their consent and that they will not have had adequate notice to give them the opportunity to consider the pros and cons and maybe take a bit of advice.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is the framework, that is the objective and that is the structure. It is not designed to interfere with the government's attempt to achieve the flexibility that its amendments are designed to achieve in schedule 2. As I said, we understand that objective. Without any action being taken you would get into the situation where some agreements could never properly be approved and that is obviously not a reasonable situation. Whatever we think about the broad structure of the agreement stream, you cannot render it inoperable by administrative technicality. We do not seek to do that so we therefore propose this alternative framework.

         The position of the Employment Advocate should never have been created. The way it is operating is reinforcing our worst fears. I did not pretend during the second reading, and do not now, that any of these is a major important new change. Our opposition is to each increment in opportunity for the employment advocate to act in the way that he has done in that remarkable lack of accountability to the parliament and the failure to in any way meet what we would regard as reasonable standards for protection of employees subjected to these AWAs which the employment advocate or his office has to apply. We will oppose and resist that until we get the opportunity to abolish the position altogether. That is our position. It is not going to be productive spending hours reiterating it; I simply state it. It is a position shared and expressed by many of my colleagues in their second reading contributions.

         I am particularly concerned that the lack of public access to the nature of decisions being made, which are affecting the lives of Australians and have ramifications for those beyond the immediate agreement, should not extend to the Industrial Relations Commission. Our concern is that item 15 on page 8 of the bill does, in its present form, start to extend to the Industrial Registrar and the Industrial Relations Commission those sorts of provisions where decisions are made but they are not public, they are not open to scrutiny, they are not open for other people to assess their implications in connection with potential future matters on which they might impact—not just if they are not parties to this, but if they work in a similar industry or are confronting a similar problem.

         Up until now, if a decision having been made by a public authority has the capacity to affect your rights or set a precedent that might affect your rights, you can consult on it; you can see whether or not you agree with it; you even have some capacity to respond to it. We do not want to see that important function undermined. We would like to see it taken away from the Employment Advocate, but we cannot do that in this particular set of amendments to the legislation. So that is a question for another day.

        <para first-indent="16">
         However, what we would like to do is make sure that the poor standard that is set with regard to the Employment Advocate is not extended to the Industrial Relations Commission. So we are seeking to substitute item 15 on page 8 with the amendment contained in amendment 8. It is, I think, an important question of principle. We do not want to drag the Industrial Relations Commission standard of accountability down to the level of the Employment Advocate. Therefore, I recommend the amendment to the House.

         In terms of people having access to information as to the operation of the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act, in respect of the application of the no disadvantage test and, generally, the functions of the Office of the Employment Advocate in approving AWAs, I would say that the Australian Democrats were similarly very concerned to ensure that the parliament was appropriately informed about what was happening.

         So provision has been made for there to be an appropriately comprehensive review of processes within the AWA by the bringing in of outside academics, independent persons, by the OEA so as to prepare a report which will be made available on the operations of AWAs.

         These amendments are some of those that we consider significantly more than technical.

         It gets very technical, and I do not want to start pursuing it in an inordinate amount of detail, but if I can put it in layman's language in the broad we have here the possibility that the no disadvantage test can be met by a standard set by a state award rather than a federal award.

         Given that I grew up in Western Australia, I suppose the prejudices that I have in this matter might be obvious, but it is not exclusively a Western Australian problem and will not necessarily in the future be exclusively a Western Australian problem. If, by some mischance, the current Queensland government were to be re-elected at the next state election, there is no doubt they would wish to move in that direction, and I have some apprehensions about the second&amp;hyphen;term agenda of a re&amp;hyphen;elected Liberal government in South Australia should that be the result of the forthcoming election. So, while it is Western Australia about whom everybody has the priority concern at the moment, it is not exclusively a problem that could be resolved by dealing with Western Australia alone.

         There is no automaticity that state standards are necessarily lower than those of federal. Of course, if the state standard is higher, the problem does not arise.

It is certainly better than that which the government proposed and which passed this House. It might not be what we would wish to see, but certainly we do not wish to see it watered down.

         There may be some circumstances in which it is not possible to identify a suitable federal award. The proposed amendment will therefore allow the commission or the advocate to designate a state award as the benchmark for the no disadvantage test where there is no federal award covering work of the same kind as that performed by employees whose work is to be subject to an agreement. This will ensure that the absence of a suitable federal award will not prevent the effective operation of the no disadvantage test.

         That seems quite a good idea to me. If you do not have an underlying award, what have you got? It is not much of a no disadvantage test if it does not have something to which it can be compared. That is all this says. You could have some alternative inappropriate federal award, but that might be dudding your employees even more so, which I think is why the ACTU went along with it. I think this is nothing other than a technical amendment. I encourage you, in your next conversation with the ACTU, to reconsider.

         The purpose of this particular amendment is to clarify the application of state laws in relation to the termination of employment of an employee covered by a federal award. The intention of subsection 152(1A) was to ensure that federal system employees who do not have access to a federal remedy for unfair dismissals, such as employees whose former employers were not constitutional corporations, would still have access to a state unfair dismissal remedy. This provision was needed because some federal system employees have been denied access to state unfair dismissal remedies on the basis that federal award clauses dealing with termination of employment have been taken to cover the field to the exclusion of the state remedy.

          Subsection 152(1A) was not intended to give federal award employees access to other provisions of state laws or awards dealing with termination of employment, such as entitlements and notice and severance pay under a state award. This is because any federal award entitlements they may have related to termination and redundancy pay are unaffected by the fact that their former employer was not a constitutional corporation or engaged in constitutional trade or commerce. Section 152(1A) was only intended to provide access to unfair dismissal remedies. The proposed amendment makes it clear that it does precisely that.

          Consistent with the original intention of the legislation, the amended provision will still allow an employee covered by a federal award who has no access to a federal remedy for unfair dismissal to apply for an unfair dismissal remedy under state law. However, the amendment will make it clear that employers bound by federal awards are not subject to other state laws relating to termination of employment, such requirements in relation to severance pay or redundancy. I think that says it all. As I say, it is entirely technical.

         We are dealing with a large number of amendments to schedule 6 but they all essentially go to the same point in terms of our concern with schedule 6. They relate to the circumstance in which a preference clause is
         <break page="8208" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          in an award or agreement. Obviously, the act means that that clause cannot have effect. That will be the impact of the Workplace Relations Act. A lot of people might expend millions of dollars on QCs trying to interpret that in fine detail. But, in broad principle, that is what it means. We are not trying to argue that point; we accept that conclusion.

        <para first-indent="16">
         But that is not the same as saying that the fact the preference clauses are not operative means they ought immediately be struck out of every agreement or award that they are in. Let us think about the implications of that: how did the clauses get in the award or the agreement? Once you think about that, the process becomes evident. They came into the award usually by agreement but, if not by agreement, then by considered decision of the arbitral authority of the time, whatever it might have been called. For the purpose of this, we have said it is the Industrial Relations Commission but, when it happened, it might have been some different body.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What happened is that the arbitral authority at the time, the court or commission, made a decision or accepted an agreement that such a clause should be introduced into an award. In the case of an agreement, by definition such a clause went in there because the parties to it signed on and said that is what they wanted. Now that cannot override a law passed by the parliament saying such a clause does not have any effect. Obviously, it would be wrong should that be the case. But that does not, it seems to me, create the justification for saying that we should pretend that those agreements never existed and that those decisions were never made.

         Let me just explain what is proposed here. If somebody enters into an agreement today and that agreement includes a clause which is not legal under the Workplace Relations Act because it is discriminatory, it is proposed in our amendment that that agreement should not be approved. The reason is quite simple: if the CFMEU—it is the CFMEU, the CPSU and a couple of other trade unions—get some weak employer to agree to a discriminatory, illegal clause, then the union plan is to get that agreement approved through the commission so that it can then go around the work sites and say to employees and to employers, `This has been agreed. This has been certified by the commission. This is the deal.' That is what they have been doing.

         All we are saying is—as the shadow minister, the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) acknowledges—that it is not legal because it is outlawed by the federal act. There are penalties for breaching the anti-discriminatory provisions of the federal law; yet the shadow minister wants the CFMEU and some of these other types to be able to have these clauses in agreements with a commission stamp on them so that they can go around deceiving people and misleading people about the nature of the agreements for particular work sites.

          union. It is a clear breach of the rights that people have under the federal law and you are proposing this amendment effectively to collaborate with some of these people in the trade union movement who want to enforce compulsory unionism. It is the old game.

         Quite frankly, the amazing thing about this is most rank and file trade union members do not believe you should be forced into the union. And certainly 70 or 80 per cent of the Australian public do not believe in compulsory unionism. Yet that is all that this is: it is just a device to be able to mislead people. It is a pretty serious thing too because there are penalties for enforcing compulsory unionism. Yet you are going along with a deal to get these clauses through the commission so that the usual games can be played out on the CBD work sites, the building industry and various others.

         It does show an incredible attitude from the federal parliamentary Labor Party that, in a labour force today where only one in four people are in a union, where people have been leaving trade unions and where there is a very strong value in the Australian community that you should not be able to jackboot people into unions, it believes that unions should have a right to effectively incorporate into agreements to be certified by the federal commission clauses which they know are void and which will entrap people into breaches of federal law and expose employees to penalties under that law.

         You have sunk to a new low. We have abolished compulsory unionism. We think it is quite wrong for you to set out, as you have today, to mislead employees about their basic rights just to support the campaigns of a few people in the trade union movement to dragoon people into unions against their will. This is quite wrong. It shows a lot about the thinking in the federal parliamentary Labor Party. I am disappointed that you do not see the commonsense of the technical amendments before the House.

An important issue—the minister said it many different ways for five minutes—is that the will of the parliament is superior to anybody wanting to enter into an agreement to say something different. That is right. Who would argue otherwise? Somebody might argue with it, but we do not. This clause does not. Nobody should breach the law by seeking to enforce something that is void.

If there is one thing in Australia—there are probably quite a number—that I would not take the word of this minister on, it is anything he says about the alleged activities, of which he has no evidence, of the CFMEU. He has got form on that. We do not accept that that is a way in which anybody ought reasonably to behave.

          —The whole issue of preference for unionists has been one of the most misrepresented issues in the entire modern history of industrial relations debates in this country. The present Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) has indulged in the same
          <break page="8211" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           time-honoured practice of misrepresenting the entire process of preference for unionists. I notice that he seems to replace the words `preference for unionists' with `compulsory unionism' on an interchangeable basis. It really does demonstrate the ideological view that the Liberal government has brought to the entire industrial relations issue. Compulsory unionism does not and has never existed.

         Preference for unionists is nothing of the sort and even in its heyday did not provide, with the possible exception of one or two types of employment, anything approaching an absolute requirement. In fact, there are plenty of examples where matters were taken to industrial commissions for determination on those clauses when they were enforceable in awards only to be turfed out because, as the minister would well know, the concept of preference was one that applied only where all else was equal. It was not difficult for employers to subvert the actual intent and desire of those preference clauses by obfuscating a whole range of other qualities which they may have sought in prospective employees.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The whole thing about preference for unionists has been built up as a major smokescreen by successive conservative advocates. The minister is simply the latest in that line of conservative advocates doing his darnedest to tell people why workers on low wages do not deserve an increase and why preference for unionism is somehow compulsory unionism, widespread and evil. It was nothing of the sort and it is hollow rhetoric.

         It has always amazed me that, on the one hand, the advocates—the minister has fallen into this trap as well—for the minister's cause will argue the evils of preference for unionists and compulsory unionism as being the dreaded impost of union bosses who wield an almighty power over their membership, the work force and the economy. In the next breath—in fact, he did it a few minutes ago in the same speech—he then points out that the number of people in unions represents about 24 to 25 per cent of the population and, therefore, they are pretty insignificant and dying. On the one hand, this is a powerful and dangerous group of people wielding
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          enormous authority and in the next moment they are a group of people who are anachronistic and have no place and no power in Australia today. You cannot have it both ways.

         The minister went one better in the debate on this bill when he actually urged the opposition to accept the advice of those same people. In one breath he castigates these people as being dangerous, all&amp;hyphen;powerful, manipulative union bosses who forced people into the union and stopped decent Australians from getting jobs. He then turns around and says to the shadow minister, `You should go and talk to Tim Pallas.'

The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) referred to the outlawing of compulsory unionism. The member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) quite correctly said that the minister and the government members tend to equate compulsory unionism with preference for unionists. The minister was quite aghast that the Labor opposition should be, in effect, supporting what he alleges these circumstances to be.

         All I want to do is to remind the minister that, in connection with the CRA dispute up at Weipa, the Industrial Relations Commission found that CRA was acting contrary to federal law in not discriminating in favour of unionists or giving preference to unionists but, rather, discriminating against them and showing disadvantage to them. Who was the person who was supporting that position up at Weipa? None other than the minister himself.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I think it is important for us to understand that there is a particular sentiment around; it is not just a matter of philosophy. If the minister was aware of those types of communities that I am personally familiar with, he would understand the background to the development of the sentiment which gives rise to a powerful motivation on the part of those people to see everyone in the union. It does not take very long for people who are involved in industries of that kind to be affected by that sentiment and to understand its importance.

         It was that fellow's own experience which caused him to adopt that position. If the government and the minister fail to understand that sentiment and act in accordance with it and show respect for it, the sort of problems that they have been having will simply continue and compound. It is important that those attitudes and those experiences of working people be respected. We prevail upon the minister in connection with his whole approach to industrial relations to try to see that.

          This is a legitimate amendment within the framework of standing orders prepared under advice, and it is entirely appropriate to be moved in this place.

          We move the amendment because it is necessary for this House to give serious consideration to accountability matters before it considers anything else.

           The reason for that, no less, is the fact that this relates to documents that have misadvised us and which have been tabled in this place. This House has been either inadvertently or deliberately misled—we do not yet know which and we do not yet know by whom, but misled it has been and misled massively. This is a case of smart alecs being caught out.

          What is the evidence for the fact that we have a cover&amp;hyphen;up here? Let us take the starting point of this particular cover&amp;hyphen;up. Members will recollect that, when ministerial travel allowance statements were previously tabled in this House and there was an element of a repayment involved in a minister's position, an asterisk was placed alongside their names with advice as to the amount that they repaid as a result of having effectively misclaimed.

         <para first-indent="16">
          There was a coincidence about that asterisk. It was placed only against members of the former government in reporting in this place. It must be said that that particular inadvertence did not in fact relate to any degree of misclaiming of an entitlement that had been determined by the parliament or by the government, but by a convention that had been put in place by the previous government that, from a particular point during an election campaign, unless circumstances otherwise indicated, that should not be—

          —I am delighted to have the opportunity to make a contribution. It has been a long time since the parliament has been full when I have made a speech and I am a little overcome. In fact, it is actually worse than that because I was planning to be sitting here quietly for half an hour listening while the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) spoke, making some notes to take the opportunity to rebut the arguments that she put forward. But I am not going to have that opportunity now, so I am a little embarrassed by that.

         I was rather disappointed that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) took the opportunity that he did to obviously flout the standing orders or at least the spirit of the standing orders. The matters may well be matters that he may wish to raise in this House. He, when he was leader of the House, frequently pulled us into line on those sorts of matters when we were in opposition, so he knows that there are many facilities available to him to pursue the matters that he wishes to pursue. I do not deny that he might wish to pursue them but I believe that the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) was absolutely right in making the point that the Leader of the

         The other matter that I understood was that the government was concerned to have this bill passed through the House this evening. There was a suggestion that members might keep their speeches short. I have not been told whether that is still to be the case or not but that was my understanding. Perhaps the whip might let me know as I make my remarks whether they need to be curtailed earlier than the 20 minutes that the time shows that I have allotted.

         The fact is that the child care industry has grown largely unchecked because in recent years it has been underpinned by government largess. It is an industry that has grown because of the system which allowed it to grow. Something had to be done about it; something had to be done to bring that growth into perspective and to make sure that the problems that existed in it were fixed. I understand that the problems are exacerbated in south&amp;hyphen;east Queensland. I understand that in some other parts of Australia the problems are not as bad as they are in south&amp;hyphen;east Queensland. But I can tell you that we have a serious problem in the child care industry in south&amp;hyphen;east Queensland.

         The child care industry is now a multibillion dollar industry, accounting for .5 per cent of GDP, with government providing 60 per cent of the costs. That amounts to $1.5 billion that the government is putting into child care. Let us examine the question of why. In recent years, debate about early childhood has become complicated and confusing. But there is no doubt in my mind—and I would have been interested to see whether this was an issue the member for Jagajaga might have taken up—that parent involvement gives children the best start in life whilst it also brings deep satisfaction to their parents.

         The Howard government is committed to giving families a real choice about how their children are cared for—and I mean real choice. This legislation that we have before us is entirely consistent with actions that this government has already taken to ensure that parents do get a real choice about the sort of care that their children receive.

         It is also consistent with the economic imperatives that this government faced when it came into government. I do not need to remind the House tonight that there were very serious economic problems faced by this government when it took office, problems which it inherited from the previous government. Expenditure on child care in that regard, like expenditure in many other areas, had to be reigned in. Already actions have been taken to limit child care assistance to 50 hours a week. There have been situations where exemptions can be gained from that particular limitation. Indeed, I think most people would regard 50 hours child care a week as being very generous. A number of other measures have already been implemented.

         The government in this legislation also imposes a limit of 7,000 on the number of new private child-care places eligible for child-care assistance in the two years 1998 and 1999. Once again, I have to assume that the opposition will support that limitation. Again, I would find it rather inconceivable if they were not to, even if they were only half&amp;hyphen;aware of what the child&amp;hyphen;care industry is about—and particularly considering the problems existing in the child&amp;hyphen;care industry, as I was saying, in south-east Queensland.

         In south&amp;hyphen;east Queensland, child care has grown to the point where there child-care centres on almost every corner. In fact, they are a bit like corner stores; they have just sprung up everywhere. We now have an excess supply situation that is threatening the viability of existing child-care centres. So I am very pleased that this legislation proposes that 7,000 limitation for the years 1998 and 1999. Also, I need to foreshadow that I think there will be a need to give consideration to extending that limitation beyond those two particular years.

         There have been—and I am sure the member for Jagajaga would have gone into some detail about this—some concerns expressed, and in my view quite rightly and justifiably, by the industry about the complication or complexity of the changes and also about some of the particular impacts of the changes on the industry in south&amp;hyphen;east Queensland. I need to say—and the members opposite have detected quite correctly that I would be consistent with the line that I have put throughout the eight years that I have been in this place—that I am not a great supporter of

Especially—and the member for Jagajaga will collapse when I say this—I believe mother care happens to be important to kids as well.

         Parents should be able to choose the care that they want for their children. I noticed that during my opening remarks there was much mirth opposite when I made those sorts of statements because, of course, my pro&amp;hyphen;child or pro&amp;hyphen;family views—and they are views that are shared by a large number of my colleagues here—are offensive to extreme feminists. I notice that Eva Cox, for instance, is one who said that women not back in the work force by the time their child is one-year-old are bludgers. That would describe, unfortunately, a very large number of women who choose not to return to work so soon—and my wife is one of them. That description is offensive to a large number of women.

         The debate about child care was hijacked for many years by the extreme feminists who dominated the previous government's policy making in this area, and the result was unchecked growth of an industry almost completely underpinned by government largess. As I said, it has risen almost exponentially over the years and it is now costing us $1.5 billion.

         This government was elected with a mandate to fix up the problems in many areas, and child care is only one of those areas which has needed attention. I am pleased that this legislation is consistent with our underlying objective in this particular area—that is, to provide real choice for families; to enable families to make choices about the child care which best suits them. I would be interested to hear what members of the opposition have to say about this issue of choice. They have always been in favour of choice. But, essentially, they want to give families Hobson's choice, or their choice. The choice was that you could make any choice you like, as long as—

You let this debate be hijacked all along by an ideological position that essentially downgraded the importance of families and which did not take into account the best interests of children. I can understand why you are sensitive about that. If I were in your position, I would be sensitive about it too.

         In the minute that I really ought only to take, I will refer to the immunisation requirements in this particular legislation. I want to put on record my concerns about this. I understand that there is, I think, within the community a good deal of support for it. But, once again, my position on this issue would be that parents should have a choice about this particular matter. I do not believe that they do have a real choice about this issue. The act provides that children attending child care be fully immunised before any child-care assistance is payable.

         According to the act, parents can become conscientious objectors, but a strict test applies to that particular position being taken, and it is not certain yet exactly what the requirements will be. I understand that in part they would have to be counselled by a doctor, who presumably would tell them about the risks of not vaccinating, but not necessarily the risks of vaccinating. I will finish off.

         I need to put those remarks on record. I know they are not consistent with the government or opposition positions, but I feel strongly that it is a matter of choice for parents. Seeing it is something that I subscribe to very strongly, then I think it should apply to the choice of whether your children are immunised or not. I have chosen to immunise mine. I am not against immunisation, but I have some concerns about the obligatory or the compulsory nature of this requirement.

         Child care is important. I assume there would be general agreement on that. In fact, nothing could be more important. Let us decide and be sure in this debate that this legislation is consistent, as I believe it is, with really finding what is best for children. There has been too much of the dog wagging the tail in the child&amp;hyphen;care debate for too long. The debate has been hijacked, as I said, by those who have an agenda other than finding out what is best for children. I believe this legislation is broadly consistent with that very desirable objective.

         —I rise in this debate because of the commitment of the Labor Party to advancing child care for working families in this country—a commitment that we never shirked during our 13 years in office. During Labor's years in office, 1983 to 1996, there was a 500 per cent increase in Commonwealth funded child-care places. Labor's policies were about addressing needs, not cutting for the sake of cutting. What we were about was offering security to families and the ability for them to exercise choice in the work force, and we had to recognise that one of the barriers to people getting into the work force, which was how they could have their children cared for whilst they were so participating.

        In contrast to Labor's commitment to child care, what have we got from the coalition government? A cut of $820 million in child care. And that is essentially what we are debating here tonight. For the sake of some point of reference, let me indicate to you what it costs an average family a week for child care. It costs $170 a week to participate in child care. But we have the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) defrauding the Commonwealth for that amount every night in Canberra—$154 a night and he has done it for 47 nights. It costs $170 a week for child care and the minister is defrauding the Commonwealth for that every night for 47 nights at least.

Under these circumstances, given the repeated attempts by the opposition to flout the standing orders, it would be appropriate for you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to require the Manager of Opposition Business to confine his remarks to the matter before the chair. He is speaking instead of the member for Jagajaga for the very purpose of defeating the standing orders. I make that submission to you.

          , I am reminded that a major part of our job is to help our constituents carve their way through the red tape of bureaucracy. Absolutely nothing separates politicians from the people they serve when it comes to dealing with the bureaucracy. We all experience the same frustrations. The word bureaucracy tells the story. It means, according to

         What a perfect description of the Child Care Act this government inherited. I could be easily convinced that it would be easier to have a baby than it would be to work out the child-care entitlements. Currently, child-care assistance is paid direct to approved long day care centres by the Department of Health and Family Services, but the child-care cash rebate is paid direct to the family by the Health Insurance Commission. The commission is better known for its Medicare role, which is why parents claiming their child-care cash rebate have had to apply to a Medicare office as opposed to the Department of Health and Family Services. Many, of course, have not known this; nor, sadly, have they been advised by either organisation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Thankfully, the  Child Care Payments Bill 1997  tidies up this split system merry-go-round. As laid down in this bill, both the child-care assistance and the child-care rebate will be paid through the one agency. This will be the newly formed Centrelink, the one&amp;hyphen;stop shop which will absorb our local Social Security offices while taking over many other government services.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When we took over government 18 months ago we inherited an outdated and out of control child-care system. The Child Care Act dates back to 1972 when taxpayer funded child-care assistance was virtually unheard of. The government's first move in the early 1970s was logical and involved providing capital funding to help establish childminding facilities in the suburbs where they were sorely needed. We have pretty well turned a complete cycle with an overabundance of centres in some areas and not enough in others. Child care has grown into a massive
         <break page="8228" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          industry, both public and private. As a result, the system has been patched and filled so many times that even a person with the wits to program a VCR would have trouble with it.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I certainly have a great deal of sympathy for the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) whose job it has been to completely restructure the child-care system. Some of the changes she has made have had predictable reaction in the community. Community funded centres want more funds and privately run centres want less competition. But everyone agreed the system was badly in need of an overhaul and concede that the changes made by this government have made child care accessible to more low income families.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Rationalising child-care assistance has not been an easy task and this bill resolves some of the more minor but vital aspects.
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          (Quorum formed)
         </emphasis>
         One of those aspects involves the introduction of a limit of 20 hours per week of taxpayer funded care for non&amp;hyphen;working parents. This change met with unqualified support by my community in south-east Brisbane. There was one memorable story in our local paper of a non-working mother who was annoyed as the cut in hours from 50 hours per week to 20 hours per week meant that she would lose a fair amount of her leisure time. But, otherwise, the taxpayers of Griffith were happy their funds were assisting working parents and not being used for baby&amp;hyphen;sitting.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill amends one aspect of that cut to 20 hours for the parents of children who have special needs. I do not believe anyone in our community of Griffith would begrudge extending assistance to a family with a child who has special needs. I commend the Minister for Family Services for extending child&amp;hyphen;care assistance to not just the child with the disability but also its brothers and/or sisters.
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          (Quorum formed)
         </emphasis>
         This change will mean much needed relief for the parents and will also assist the children by giving them time in another caring and safe environment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In addressing the many aspects of the child&amp;hyphen;care system, which sorely needed reform, this Child Care Payments Bill also attacks the emotive issue of immunisation. I have made it clear to my electorate of Griffith that I
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          support our program for the immunisation of our children, I have produced immunisation charts which I have delivered to child&amp;hyphen;care centres, preschools, kindergartens, medical centres and pharmacies. Without exception everyone has been supportive of the program.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This amendment to the Child Care Payments Bill makes it easier for parents to ensure that their child has been immunised before placing them in child care. The Child Care Payments Bill as it currently stands does not give parents a period of grace when they make a retrospective claim for a child&amp;hyphen;care payment. Following these changes, a family will be given the time to meet the immunisation requirements, which will be of special benefit to those who do not use child care on a regular basis. This does not mean that they can avoid having their child immunised—quite the contrary. Any subsequent claim will be rejected.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill—in particular the introduction of a limit on the number of new, private sector child care places in the next two years—brings some coherence to a system which had grown with almost carefree abandon. Recently I spent time contacting all child&amp;hyphen;care facilities in my electorate. I spoke to the managers of community long day care centres and the operators of private centres. Both expressed concern at the growing number of private facilities opening in the electorate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The community based long day care centres admitted that they were losing customers to the private centres. Established private centres expressed concern that new centres opening were aiming to entice customers from existing centres. In other words, unchecked funding by the previous government has allowed the caring of children to become big business, and competition in some areas is rife. Queensland has the highest per capita number of private long day care places of any state in Australia—74,600 places in all.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Too many centres in one area cannot be to the advantage of the children as spreading the child&amp;hyphen;care dollar can only result in the watering down of services. This bill not only places a limit on the number of new, private sector child&amp;hyphen;care places eligible for government assistance but also introduces a planning
         <break page="8229" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          system. The government has limited control over the forces of the marketplace but, if a planning system is put in place, the private sector, the community sector and, ultimately, all families using child&amp;hyphen;care facilities will benefit.

         Child&amp;hyphen;care centres in the community sector have had $100 million in operational subsidies withdrawn.

          I believe it is in our children that we find the greatest hope for our future. That is why at the very heart of the Howard government's social policy is a fundamental commitment to get a better deal for families—a fairer deal that helps to give our children both social and economic stability.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Experts consider that the early years of a child's life are the most important for their development. Indeed, these formative years of childhood are invaluable. They are significant because it is during this time that parents can create the secure and loving family environment that gives our children the best chance to achieve their childhood dreams.

          My personal view as a mother is that often the best care and upbringing a child can receive is one where the primary caregiver—and that predominantly is still considered to be the woman—comes from within the family environment. But it would be insensible not to acknowledge that because of different circumstances an increasing number of women wish, or indeed need, to enter the work force. For these women, the possibility for child care to be provided outside the home by a non&amp;hyphen;parental figure is a necessity.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Parents who seek the assistance of professional child&amp;hyphen;care workers do so for a variety of reasons. One of these is to heighten a child's social and educational developmental process through interaction with other children of a similar age. Yet Arleen Leibowitz, in an article on child care last year, stated:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          Despite the research on the educational value of child care, most families see day care as a means of freeing the mother's time for market work.

          That is why the Howard government, through legislation introduced as part of the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 budget and through the bill we are debating in this place today, is giving priority of access to child care for families where parents either work or are seeking a job.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Similarly, those taking part in schemes such as work for the dole or who are undertaking study or training to improve their opportunities of securing paid work have the same access. Therefore, it follows that child&amp;hyphen;care assistance should, in the main, be targeted at working parents with dependent children. This

          Let me turn to one of the many reforms that the Child Care Payments Bill 1997 seeks to introduce, namely, the limiting of child&amp;hyphen;care assistance to 20 hours per week for each child in non&amp;hyphen;work related care. By doing this, the government demonstrates that it is not in the business of providing respite from the responsibilities of parenthood over and above what is considered acceptable by the tax paying community.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Parents whose primary responsibility is the rearing and caring of their offspring utilise the child&amp;hyphen;care system, on average, for 14 hours per week. Therefore, a cap of 20 hours per week as stated in this legislation is supported by many who serve in the industry.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The changes being debated today as part of this bill seek to give parents the right to choose the level of care that they consider appropriate. It also seeks to ensure that the system in which child&amp;hyphen;care payments are made and distributed is compatible with a hectic family life.

          The Howard government recognises that raising a family can at times be demanding. This government does not want to make the job of parenting any more difficult. We do not want a quagmire of bureaucratic processes for mums and dads to battle with before being able to receive the child&amp;hyphen;care benefits they are entitled to. That is why the application, provision and appeals procedures for child&amp;hyphen;care payments will soon be made through one agency, the new Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency's Centrelink, currently still known to most people as the Department of Social Security.

          From January 1998, families applying for child&amp;hyphen;care benefits will have to lodge only one form at one government agency.

           system that serves our families and children well into the next century. This is in stark contrast to the previous government's policy on child care, which showed that those opposite had, and still have, a complete lack of vision. It was the intention of Labor to apply only quick fix solutions to our most pressing family concerns. That is why, on coming to government, we in the coalition have sought to redress the unacceptable situation of an undersupply of child&amp;hyphen;care centres in some areas and an oversupply in others, a situation, I would suggest, that is most unacceptable to parents.

          The coalition government's intention is to rectify this inefficiency. We will do this by creating a child&amp;hyphen;care system that is flexible enough to meet the emerging needs of most families. Simultaneously, it will provide the required framework to ensure our primary objective of creating an effective and efficient child&amp;hyphen;care system. That is why this bill seeks to introduce measures aimed at confining the number of new child&amp;hyphen;care places to areas where they are most needed. This move is welcomed by responsible child&amp;hyphen;care providers because they understand and acknowledge that controlled growth is essential if the industry is to reach its full potential.

         <para first-indent="16">
          In the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 budget the government introduced legislation to encourage community based long day care centres to become more efficient and cost competitive with their private sector counterparts. This government has offered additional funding to such centres so they can obtain financial planning advice which may assist them with undertaking restructuring. Measures such as this will ultimately bring benefit to the community in the form of more productive use of taxpayer subsidies.

          This measure is consistent with the finding of the 1996 child&amp;hyphen;care task force interim report, which identified that one of the national goals for child&amp;hyphen;care provision is for quality services to be provided at the least cost for that required quality. The report goes on to say:

          The coalition government has also been instrumental in developing a new information system to meet the planning and access needs of both service providers and parents alike. In an ideal world with perfect information, people would be equipped to make perfectly rational choices. It is then the duty of government, in this imperfect world, to ensure that an adequate level of information is made available. This will equip all concerned to make an informed decision in the best interests of the family. The national child&amp;hyphen;care information strategy seeks to provide just that measure.

But the way this child&amp;hyphen;care bill is before us, the way it is being handled, the significance of what is in it and the contrast with what is fundamentally going on is an absolute metaphor for what is happening with this government: it is slashing funds to areas of public necessity, and it is absolutely self-indulgent in expenditure on itself. That is a contrast that is appalling the Australian people—and it properly is appalling them. In my own electorate we have child-care centres closing down, child&amp;hyphen;care workers losing their jobs.

I am seriously concerned about that. Those people are being forced to withdraw for a variety of reasons, all of which go back to this government. To some extent, they have been caused by the sackings that have been undertaken by this government. That means there is a large number of people out of work who cannot therefore access child care. To some extent, it is affected by other issues of this government which are forcing up the price of child care.

          —I want to report tonight on a meeting I attended on Sunday at Bowman Hall. This was a rally of people against Badgerys Creek airport. There has already been extensive coverage of the wide number of people who attended this meeting organised by Charlie Lowles, the Mayor of Blacktown City Council. It was also attended by quite a number of other surrounding mayors, by two state ministers and by my federal colleague the member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield).

         I undertook at that meeting to bring back a message to the parliament: the unanimous, overwhelming view of the many hundreds, if not thousands, of people who attended that meeting that they did not want an airport at Badgerys Creek. Indeed, they did not want an airport in the Sydney Basin. In particular, they were not in favour of option B. Those Liberal ministers and backbenchers who favour option B should clearly hear that message. They were not in favour of option A, nor of option C. And why would they be?

         The summary EIS that was released by Minister Sharp—how long will he be the minister?—is very deficient. It ignores serious implications with regard to the air we breathe, endangered and vulnerable flora and fauna, and noise. I thought the most poignant point made at that meeting was that 63 schools will be adversely affected by this airport—under any option. If honourable members opposite do not care about that, that translates to 30,000 students. That is a very conservative figure. In the western suburbs of Sydney, we understand that we suffer from educational disadvantage already. This airport will only add to that educational disadvantage.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In terms of the information provided in the EIS, no information was provided as to how the noise levels will vary during one day or even seasonally for different climatic conditions or even operational conditions. The only
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          conclusion to be drawn from these averages is that for at least 50 per cent of the year tens of thousands of residents of western Sydney who thought they would not be affected by aircraft noise will be.

         In this EIS, the minister is using the Australian noise exposure concept methodology. This is the very methodology which was used in the third runway debacle and which was completely discredited and criticised. The very same methodology is being used in the Badgerys Creek EIS summary that was released by the minister.

         If members opposite are not concerned about endangered plant species, let me say that 31 species are vulnerable in western Sydney and will be affected by this airport.

         The EIS also ignores the importance of ozone as a regional issue in western Sydney and ignores any attempts to reduce ozone levels in western Sydney. The clear message is that the people of western Sydney do not want the airport. They have resolved to fight, and fight it we will.

         Before the last federal election, the Australian Labor Party went to the people of western Sydney and said, `No, we are not even going to have another EIS, we just want to build Badgerys Creek.' The member for Kingsford Smith, the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and the current Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, were out there promoting to the people of western Sydney and to the people in the Sydney basin the prospect of having the second international airport at Badgerys Creek. In fact, they said they had started work and that they had spent $360 million on Badgerys Creek.

We will take that idea but we are still going to build Badgerys Creek.' The Labor Party have said that when the heat is turned on, but this is after having made numerous promises to the people of Sydney that they would build Badgerys Creek. They announced it in 1985 but, in fact, the original proposal goes back to the 1970s. As Alan Ramsay revealed quite bluntly in the

         The member for Prospect stands up here and waffles on with the gross hypocrisy that is typical of someone who is flip-flopping between airports and flip-flopping between policies on airports. How is she going to explain to the October meeting of the Labor Party that she wants a change to a policy that has been in existence for some years? The members for Prospect and Chifley have been promoting western Sydney for years, but now they are going to try to flip-flop back in the interests of self-gratification. At the end of the day, the people of western Sydney are the big losers because the Labor Party is lying, lying and lying again.

            I wonder whether other members are prepared to do the same for the spurious overseas trips that have been taken by many members in this parliament and ones before that serve absolutely no good purpose for the Australian electorate. We have members of the now opposition who were party to the paying back of travel allowances by a member of their own party a decade and a half ago—something not revealed until many years later—and now they claim a cover-up from a minister of another government.

         Yes, we probably have had a cover-up. The Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) should explain to this House why an apparent special arrangement was made for a minister of the Crown to pay back an overclaimed amount, and I would like to know how those claims could have been made given the diary that a minister must have of his movements.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But the irony of all this is that, unless the transport minister had drawn attention to the overpayment, nothing that the administrative services minister's special investigators could have found out—or even the FBI—could have detected those overpayments, even under the allegedly tighter system put in place in May this year to supposedly make members' entitlements more accountable. Why? Because the minister uses a car to travel between his home base and Canberra—as do I. There is no way of cross checking travel and accommodation at the Sunday evening or Thursday evening end of a sitting week. The system relies on the good intent, the honesty and, it now seems, the memory of members. That is just not good enough nor is it the accountability the public demands.

         So let us not stand up here in the sort of pious exhibition of self righteousness that we have seen tonight, desperately scrambling to reach the higher moral ground, because the public knows the system is rotten—that in itself it is a cover-up—and they demand changes. Let us not forget that, if Senator Colston had not, to use the phrase, ratted on his colleagues, none of this would have

         I know there are many members on both sides of the House concerned at the looseness of the system and the lack of accountability. They feel they are being tarred with the same brush, and so we are. The public out there just becomes more and more cynical, especially when it appears no attempt has been made to explain that a repayment was made because a mistake occurred and an apology offered. No, like the child we are trying to impress with our leadership, we hide the error and hope we are not found out and, when we are inevitably found out, the damage is so much the worse for us all.

         It is not only the travel allowances that is of concern to the public, it is also the trips during a first term, the three-yearly junkets and the lack of public accountability for most of it which gets up the nose of the battlers out there that each party pretends to lay claim to. It just happens that one Ted Mack spoke at a dinner I held in Orange recently. Let the parliamentary ghost of the former parliament's conscience echo around this chamber tonight as I quote from that speech. Mr Mack said:

         The expansion has almost been in proportion to rising unemployment and mirrored the increasing disparity between rich and poor.

Federal Parliament at a cost of over 3 million dollars a day is the most expensive and unwatched program in history.

The first was born on 27 August 1910 at Skopje in what was then Yugoslavia, now the capital of Macedonia. The youngest of three children to Albanian parents, Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu was later to become Mother Teresa. At 12 she wanted to become a nun and at 18 she travelled to Ireland and joined the Order of Loreto. A year later she travelled from Ireland to India and joined a convent school in Calcutta, where she worked as a teacher, mainly of geography.

Because she was such a high profile person, her acceptance and championing of these causes gave them a respectability and a focus that nobody else could do.

        (1) Neither the Treasurer, the Prime Minister nor any other individual is able to grant a temporary tax exemption to individuals, businesses or organisations. The taxation legislation does not make any provision for temporary tax exemptions to be granted or contain any discretion regarding temporary tax exemptions. The sales tax law must be amended to grant further exemptions.

        (3) The sales tax law provides specific exemptions for certain goods, certain organisations and specific types of organisations. The sales tax system is one of self assessment. Detailed information about the use made of these exemptions is not readily available. The Government and the Australian Taxation Office also receive requests for the existing exemptions to be extended. These are generally considered by the Government as part of the Budgetary process and therefore this information is not available.

        I am also advised by Airservices Australia that a number of modifications were made on 24 April 1997 to flight paths for aircraft departing from and arriving at Tullamarine Airport for safety and operational reasons. Details of the changes, and the reasons for them, are as follows.

        Aircraft departing on this SID now turn left one nautical mile, rather than the previous five nautical miles, north of Tullamarine Airport and track south, rather than north, of Sunbury. The modification to the track was made for operational reasons to improve air traffic control coordination.

        From 24 April 1997 aircraft departing on this SID turned 30 to the right after passing 1,500 feet on climb and after passing the northern end of the runway. These aircraft previously maintained runway heading until approximately six nautical miles north of the airport. The modification to the track was made to enhance safety by minimising the potential for conflict between departing and arriving aircraft. A secondary benefit flowing from this change is an increase in the traffic handling capacity of the runway by allowing less distance between some consecutive departures.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Airservices Australia has since introduced a further minor modification to this track to avoid overflight of Oaklands Junction by departing aircraft. Aircraft are now required to maintain runway heading until two nautical miles north of the airport before commencing the turn.

        Aircraft arriving from the north on this STAR now turn onto an easterly heading approximately six nautical miles north of Tullamarine Airport. Previously aircraft arriving on this STAR turned onto a south&amp;hyphen;easterly heading approximately ten nautical miles north of the airport. The modification to the track was made to enhance safety by minimising the potential for conflict between aircraft tracking to join the final approach to runway 27 and aircraft already on the final landing approach.

        Aircraft arriving from the west on this STAR previously took up an easterly heading from overhead Essendon Airport before turning left to intercept the approach path to runway 27. The modified track takes aircraft approximately 1.5 nautical miles south of Essendon Airport on an easterly heading before turning left onto a longer track to join the final landing approach to runway 27. The modification was made to allow aircraft to intercept the final approach path on a normal rate of turn compared with the previous, tighter turn.

There are a number of initiatives currently in hand including the recently announced Prime Minister's Task Force to review the problem of illicit drugs. The Task Force will examine both supply and control and demand reduction issues including better allocation of federal resources, border controls, domestic law enforcement, community drug education and programs for users. It will report to the Government in September. In addition, the

MCDS will receive a report on the development of a national heroin supply reduction strategy which is being prepared by the Senior Officers' Group of the Australasian Police Ministers' Council. In the course of this work, the members of that group will be consulting with appropriate agencies and groups including the National Drug Strategy Committee. All States and Territories have agreed that prior to the November meeting they will conduct consultations with key stakeholders and individual experts to allow them an opportunity to provide expert and community input to the meeting.

Article 4 of the Convention is the general obligations article and requires parties to take the necessary and administrative measures to give effect to the Convention.

        (1) Estimates of the size of the black economy can vary greatly, depending upon the definition used, and the methodological approach taken. Any estimate is very reliant on the assumptions underlying the analysis.

         Australian cash economy or the revenue foregone. Academic studies estimate the cash economy to be between 3.5 % and 13.4 % of GDP. Using 1995&amp;hyphen;96 GDP figures as a base and an effective average tax rate of 23%, these studies suggest that the annual amount of income tax revenue foregone could be between $3.9 billion and $15.1 billion."

        (2) The extent of the black economy in any country is likely to reflect a number of factors, including the culture and attitude of the population towards paying tax, as well as the nature of the tax system itself. Addressing the impact of the black economy will involve a range of measures, including consideration of tax base issues. It is not sufficient to look at only one solution to the black economy because focusing on any one area in isolation would give an incomplete picture. Empirical evidence on the impact of measures to deal with the black economy is subject to considerable uncertainty because of the practical difficulties associated with accurate measurement in this area. However, there are strong conceptual grounds to believe that a broad indirect tax would increase revenue collected from the proceeds of the black economy, compared to an indirect tax levied over a narrower base.

        (3) (a) No. The United Nations General Assembly Special Session held in New York in June was not convened to consider the issue of setting binding targets for greenhouse gas emissions. The Special Session was called to consider progress in meeting the objectives established under Agenda 21, and broadly the Special Session did not consider matters of detail where they are being negotiated or dealt with through other forums or conventions. In regard to greenhouse issues the Assembly ultimately agreed that climate change is "one of the biggest challenges facing the world in the next century" but that it would be inappropriate for UNGASS 51 to "seek to predetermine" results prior to the Kyoto meeting in December.

        Vessels engaged in the live export trade are considered suitable to carry livestock from Australia. All vessels are subject to a variety of inspections.

        Under Port State Control arrangements, all ships can be subjected to a detailed inspection by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) every six months as a requirement of the Port State as distinct from the Flag State or country of registration. These inspections are undertaken in line with the authority contained within the International Maritime Organisation conventions on ship safety and pollution as well as the provisions of the Australian Navigation Act and Marine Orders. If any significant problems of safety are revealed by the inspection, the deficiencies are required to be rectified before the ship is allowed to continue transporting Australian livestock. The ship can be detained if necessary.

        AMSA also undertakes inspections in relation to Marine Orders Part 43 which deals with the carriage and handling of livestock.
