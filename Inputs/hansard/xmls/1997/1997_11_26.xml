         This bill is intended to ensure that small businesses are exempted from the federal unfair dismissal provisions in respect of new employees. This exemption is necessary and appropriate, given the special features of small business—and it is necessary, to maximise growth in employment in small business.

         This is the same bill that was introduced into the House of Representatives on 26 June 1997 and passed by the House of Representatives on 27 August 1997, but rejected by the Senate on 21 October 1997, in the face of the majority report of the Senate committee to which it was referred. The government is reintroducing this bill, not because we want an election over it, but because we want to see this problem fixed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Senators who spoke against this bill said there was insufficient evidence of the need for the bill, and its benefits. There was plenty of evidence, but they were not convinced. They were not convinced by Morgan and Banks' 1996 survey, which indicated that 16 per cent of businesses with fewer than 30 employees had been adversely affected in their hiring intentions by the previous federal unfair dismissal laws. They were not convinced by the Recruitment Solutions survey, released in April 1997, which indicated that 32 per cent of businesses in metropolitan Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane had been the subject of some sort of unfair dismissal claim in the 12
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          months covered by the survey. They were not convinced by the Bell committee, which reported on the widespread feeling that the previous government's unfair dismissal laws were `the final nail in the coffin' for small business.

         When the Senate rejected the bill, small business made its view even clearer. Mr Rob Bastian of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia said that small business would create 50,000 jobs if this bill could go through the Senate. And the Chief Executive of the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce, Ms Katie Lahey, said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         For the opposition to claim that there has been no independent research proving business concern on this issue is nonsense—it shows how little attention they have paid to the needs and concerns of the small business community.

         She drew attention to the New South Wales chamber's own survey, conducted jointly with the St George Bank in May this year, in which 56 per cent of businesses surveyed said that the prospect of unfair dismissal claims had discouraged them from recruiting additional staff to their businesses.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To make it all completely clear for the Labor Party and the Democrats in the Senate, the Commonwealth government has commissioned further research, as part of the labour market research program being conducted under the auspices of the Labour Ministers Council. Specific questions on unfair dismissal were included in the latest Yellow Pages Small Business Index survey, conducted from 30 October 1997 to 12 November 1997. This is the largest economic survey of small businesses in Australia; it focuses specifically on small businesses with 19 or fewer employees. Approximately 1,200 randomly selected proprietors of small businesses were covered in the survey.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In this survey, 79 per cent of proprietors thought small businesses would be better off if they were exempted from unfair dismissal laws. Thirty&amp;hyphen;three per cent of small businesses reported that they would have been more likely to recruit new employees if they had been exempted from unfair dismissal laws in 1996 and 1997. And 38 per cent of small businesses reported that they would be more

         Helping small business to grow, employ, export and invest in Australia's future has been a top priority for the government since its first day in office. The government's economic and industrial relations policies are central to its agenda for the growth and development of the small business sector—and the government is also committed to tackling the impediments to small business imposed by unnecessary government regulation and paperwork, as set out in the government's small business statement,
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         .
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government has made substantial progress in labour market reform, which is and will be of particular benefit to small business. The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1996 changed both the federal industrial relations system, and the relationship between federal and state industrial relations systems. These changes provide small business with greater opportunities to develop industrial relations arrangements best suited to their individual circumstances. In particular, small business employers have new opportunities to make direct agreements with their employees. Small businesses that choose to remain in the award system are benefiting from a simplified and more flexible system; small businesses now have greater certainty with respect to industrial action within their business; and the Employment Advocate has been given a specific charter to assist small business.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Unfair dismissal was one of the most important industrial relations issues for small business, prior to the last election. Our commitment, in
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Better pay for better work
         </emphasis>
         , was to introduce a new unfair dismissal scheme, which would recognise the circumstances facing small business, and we have done this. The new system is more balanced and fair to both employers and employees. It is less legalistic and costly, with an emphasis on conciliation. Employers are protected from frivolous and malicious claims by the requirement for a filing fee and access to costs where a claim is vexatious. In considering
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          unfair dismissal claims, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has to consider a range of factors, including the possible effect of any order on the viability of the employer's business.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These changes are important—but they have not gone far enough—for small business. It is an unavoidable fact that the defence of an unfair dismissal claim, however groundless, is especially burdensome for small businesses. In many larger businesses, expertise and resources can be put into recruitment and termination procedures. Small businesses have no such resources. Even attendance of witnesses at a hearing can bring a small business to a standstill.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government has been listening to the concerns of small businesses, their experiences of the impact of unfair dismissal claims, particularly under the previous government's provisions, and their fears that the simple fact of employing someone makes them vulnerable to unfair dismissal claims. The Yellow Pages survey confirms the difficulties that even the government's new provisions cause for those small businesses who experience an unfair dismissal claim: not just the cost of settlement, where that occurs, but the time and location of hearings, stress, costs to business in lost time, disruption to working relationships and the costs of defending the application. And the Yellow Pages confirms the terrible pall that the fear of those difficulties casts over small business employing intentions, even amongst businesses which may not have themselves experienced a claim. These are the reasons that this bill should be brought into law as soon as possible.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I turn now to the terms of the bill itself. The exemption is to commence on royal assent. However, it will not affect existing employees. As it is intended to encourage new employment, the exclusion will only apply to employees who are first engaged by the relevant employer after the commencement of the amendment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The exemption is from the federal unfair dismissal provisions only. Employees will still be protected by other provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. Section 170CK protects employees against dismissal because of any
         <break page="11261" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          discriminatory reason. Sections 170MU and 170WE prohibit dismissal of an employee because the employee engages in protected industrial action, in seeking a certified agreement, or in AWA industrial action. Section 298K, in the freedom of association part of the act, prohibits dismissal on grounds contrary to the principle of freedom of association. And section 170CM prohibits dismissal without one to five weeks notice, depending on the employee's length of service and age, or pay in lieu, except in cases of serious misconduct.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The exemption also does not affect the rights of apprentices in small businesses. Apprentices have a particular need for protection, given the additional impact that any break in the continuity of their employment may have, in terms of attainment of qualifications. This bill will not affect existing rights in this regard.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The exemption applies only to businesses employing 15 or fewer employees. This size of small business was chosen because of the precedent provided by the Employment Protection Act 1982 (NSW), introduced by the Wran government, and followed by the then Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in the 1984 termination, change and redundancy test case. An exemption for businesses of this size will benefit a substantial proportion of all businesses in the federal jurisdiction, but will not cover too many businesses of such a size and complexity that they are likely to have a separate management structure which would facilitate defence of unfair dismissal claims.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill provides that, in counting the number of employees in a business, casual employees are only to be counted if they have been engaged on a regular and systematic basis for at least 12 months. The intention of this exclusion is to reflect the fact that a business which occasionally engages additional casual employees is not necessarily a large business. This bill will have no significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.

         The government has indicated its commitment to the sale of ANL Limited on a number of occasions, including in its pre&amp;hyphen;election policies and in the 1997&amp;hyphen;98 budget. While timing for the start and conduct of a sale process is yet to be determined, the government has decided to introduce sale legislation to enable the sale process to be conducted as expeditiously as possible when it commences. I might also add that the government has been advised that it may be possible to conduct a sale through administrative means without legislation, but at this stage the government wishes to keep its options open to provide for the best commercial outcome.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         ANL is a 100 per cent Commonwealth owned shipping company, which also has land transportation and container park and servicing interests. It formerly operated as the Australian National Line and was converted to a public company, with effect from 1 July 1989.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The previous government announced an intention to sell ANL in the 1991&amp;hyphen;92 budget and, after an on again/off again sale process, negotiated a sale agreement with P&amp;O in 1995. In the face of union opposition to the sale, the then government decided to restructure ANL rather than sell it to P&amp;O. However, it is to be noted that the then government also announced that `after restructuring ANL will be sold' and that restructuring was to be self&amp;hyphen;funding as no further equity would be provided by the government. This was its policy going into the 1996 election.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Restructuring of ANL is now largely complete. The company has been significantly transformed in the last two years, with exit from the loss making Europe and trans&amp;hyphen;Tas
         <break page="11262" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
          man trades, exit from or closure of several  other businesses, rationalisation of corporate headquarters and a number of other significant cost cutting measures. ANL's result has improved from a loss of $19.4 million in 1994&amp;hyphen;95 to a loss of $1.6 million in 1996&amp;hyphen;97. This is testimony to the efforts of ANL. However, to ensure future progress, ANL needs a change of ownership.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government believes that the company now represents an attractive acquisition, particularly for a buyer who could benefit from synergies and economies of scale and provide equity to further develop ANL. Sale of ANL will be the best outcome for the company and the best outcome for the taxpayer. From the Commonwealth's perspective, the fundamentals of ANL's situation remain unchanged, notwithstanding the recent improved performance.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Continued ownership would require taxpayer funded injections of equity, but without equity ANL does not have a viable future. The company is also exposed to a major downturn in its Asian markets, especially as a small operator competing against large companies with global coverage. The Commonwealth and the taxpayer are also exposed to ANL's debt through the Commonwealth guarantee.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill makes transitional and savings provisions in relation to ANL employee long service leave, maternity leave, compensation and rehabilitation and certain retirement benefits that are standard in legislation relating to the disposal of major Commonwealth assets.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill also removes ANL's accumulated tax losses for the years prior to the year of sale. As of 30 June 1997, ANL had tax losses of about $80 million. This is similar to the approach taken with tax issues in a number of other sales.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In conclusion, I would note that the government may need to introduce amendments to the bill when the sale process is under way, depending in part on commercial issues which may emerge as the sale progresses. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.

         This government is one committed to expanding the number of places in higher education, to improving the resources of higher education and to creating a higher education system that is flexible enough to meet the needs of Australian students, employers and the community and to continue to attract large numbers of students from overseas.

         The bill legislates funding levels for the years 1999 and 2000. It provides new funding of $3,783,052,000 in 1999, in addition to the existing $8,247,000 already legislated, and $3,581,640,000 in 2000. In legislating funds for 1999 and 2000, the bill confirms to higher education institutions the overall funding levels that are expected to be published later this year in the higher education funding report for the 1998&amp;hyphen;2000 triennium. This will assist the institutions in their planning for the next few years.

         I want to take this opportunity to set the funding decisions embodied in this bill in the context of the government's policy to promote access to higher education in Australia and to build quality.

         In implementing the efficiency cuts to forward estimates the government has been careful to maintain fairness. The universities have wherever possible accommodated the changed financing at the postgraduate course work level. This maximises the number of students who will receive a first degree and all the opportunities that can flow from that.

         The universities will from 1998 be paid the equivalent of the minimum up&amp;hyphen;front differential HECS payment for each HECS liable undergraduate they enrol over their target level.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Further opportunities to participate in higher education have been created by the government's decision to allow universities, from 1 January next year, to offer undergraduate fee paying positions once they have met their target enrolment levels. These are all extra places that would not otherwise have existed. As students take up the fee paying positions, this has a flow&amp;hyphen;on effect, creating new opportunities for students who would
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          otherwise have missed out on a HECS funded place. It is a win&amp;hyphen;win policy. Students who would have missed out on their first preference course will now get to do it, and students who would have missed out on a higher education place entirely will now get to enrol.

         Over time, this policy could greatly increase the number of places in Australian universities. Up to 25 per cent of course numbers can be fee paying once the institution has met its target enrolments, so the potential numbers of new undergraduate students on a Commonwealth funded base of over 360,000 is very large indeed.

         Another important point to recognise is that this policy ends the previous government's discrimination against Australian undergraduate students and ensures that Australian students have equal rights of entry to Australian universities with overseas students. Under the Labor Party, if you were from overseas you could invest in your future via education, but not if you were Australian. Under the Labor Party, if you were a postgraduate you could invest in your future via education, but not if you were an undergraduate. This was a very unfair policy, yet it is a policy the Labor Party intends to bring back. Their draft platform released last week promises the abolition of this new opportunity for students to invest in their futures. This is a very backward step.

         As higher education numbers expand we must make sure that opportunities to participate are widespread.

These scholarships provide exemption from the HECS charge to an additional 1,000 effective full&amp;hyphen;time student units each year. By the year 2000 the scholarships will provide exemptions of 4,000 equivalent full&amp;hyphen;time student units, which means that well over 4,000 students will benefit each year.

         This bill amends the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989 and the Australian Federal Police Act 1979. Those two acts make provision for the making of superannuation orders against corrupt Commonwealth employees, which have the effect of cancelling those employees' Commonwealth&amp;hyphen;funded superannuation benefits.

         Where a person has been charged with or convicted of a corruption offence, the minister may make a written direction to the accused's superannuation fund, the effect of which is to  temporarily suspend the accused's employer-funded superannuation benefits. The suspension prevents the dissipation of superannuation benefits which may later become the subject of a superannuation or recovery order. Suspension or `freezing' of employer benefits preserves the benefits in the Commonwealth scheme until the finalisation of superannuation order proceedings.

         A person's own contributions are not affected by the suspension and may be withdrawn or cashed in accordance with the cashing restrictions of the superannuation law.

         The bill also authorises the Official Trustee to take charge of and sell restrained property in satisfaction of a superannuation recovery order.

          offences, and the new role of the Official Trustee, fortify the operation of the two acts and ensure that corrupt Commonwealth employees do not either receive or retain the benefit of Commonwealth&amp;hyphen;funded superannuation.

         These activities are related to an efficient and effective cooperative classification and enforcement scheme. They assist in ensuring that the classification decisions are acceptable to applicants and the public generally and in maintaining the integrity of the Australia-wide scheme. However, they cannot, for constitutional reasons, be included in the fee for the provision of classification services. Implementation of the government's decision therefore requires that charges for classification and related services be imposed as a tax. This decision ensures that those who benefit directly, and indirectly, from the work of the OFLC pay the full cost of its operations.

         The charges, which are to apply from 1 July 1998, are set out in the schedules to the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Charges Bill. They have been set at an amount calculated to meet the estimated revenue needed to fully fund the OFLC's operations for the financial year 1998&amp;hyphen;99.

In these cases the unit cost attributable to classification charges is higher than in media which has wider appeal and thus attracts a lower unit cost due to its much larger distribution volume.

The fee must be directly related to the cost of providing the service.

          This bill represents a key component in the delivery of increased competition in the natural gas sector, competition which will provide significant benefits to all Australians in the form of lower prices and increased economic activity. The bill fulfils the Commonwealth's obligations in respect of the natural gas pipelines access agreement signed by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and all other heads of government at the COAG meeting of 7 November 1997.

          The agreement by all governments to the natural gas industry reform package is a significant achievement in competition reform. The agreed arrangements will enhance competition in the natural gas sector and establish the basis for the best possible use of Australia's gas resources and the lowest possible prices for all gas consumers. The economic benefits from increased competition in the gas sector are considerable. Competition will increase efficiency in production, haulage and delivery, leading to lower energy costs for industry and other users with consequential increased economic activity. There are also substantial greenhouse benefits from the increased use of natural gas over other fossil fuels for electricity generation and energy.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In the new competitive gas market, gas consumers will be able to contract directly with a gas supplier of their choice for the supply of gas and contract separately with the pipeline owner for the transportation of the gas. This will encourage `gas on gas' competition between producers within a basin and between basins for the supply of gas to consumers as well as increasing competition between gas and other fuels. In the downstream sector of the gas market where competition is constrained by natural monopolies, the reforms, of which this bill is a part, have been designed to replicate the outcomes of a competitive market. It seeks to do this by providing a transparent, industry specific, third party access framework.

For the sector to continue to grow at the forecast three per cent per annum in order to provide 28 per cent of Australia's primary energy demand by 2030, it is recognised that competition reforms in the gas sector need to be delivered.

          Heads of government have indicated their continued commitment to the national competition reform process, specifically to the implementation of the proposed regulatory framework for the gas sector. The national third party gas pipeline access regulatory scheme was developed through a process which included the Commonwealth, states and territories and gas industry members—gas producers, pipeliners and major users—represented by their associations. The agreed reform arrangements reflect a sound and balanced outcome which is acceptable to all nine jurisdictions and the four peak industry associations.

          The national gas pipeline access scheme will provide a legally enforceable right for third parties, such as suppliers, retailers and users, to negotiate access to pipelines for haulage services on terms and conditions which are fair and reasonable to both access seekers and pipeline owners. At the same time, the access regime provides incentives for pipeline owners to grow the market and provide innovative and competitive pipeline haulage services, with the discretion for pipeline&amp;hyphen;specific circumstances to be taken into account.

          Establishing and maintaining a consistent and uniform national regulatory framework is central to delivering the reform benefits to gas users and to the economy. This uniformity has been established in a number of ways. Firstly, a common third party access code is to be adopted by all jurisdictions. Secondly, to ensure consistency, an `application of laws' approach to give legislative effect to the national Gas Pipeline Access Law and the code has been chosen. This will best maintain the uniformity and integrity of the regulatory arrangements across all jurisdictions and eliminate the danger of variations over time as a result of uncoordinated changes being made to jurisdiction based legislation.

          Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 6) 1997

         , which is now before the House, contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. The amendments have already been introduced as customs tariff proposals during the current Spring sittings, with the exception of the textiles, clothing and footwear amendments in schedule 3. I will briefly outline the changes.

         Schedule 1 of this bill commenced on 3 July 1997. The customs duty on aviation gasoline, avgas, contains a component to recover the costs of aviation terminal and en route navigation services provided to the general aviation sector by Airservices Australia. In reviewing the costs of providing these services for 1997&amp;hyphen;98, Airservices Australia proposed a reduction in the duty of 0.6 cents per litre on avgas, which represents a five per cent decrease in real terms.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This reduction in costs to aircraft operators follows the implementation of an election commitment by the government. This commitment was to freeze the airways component of avgas duty in 1996&amp;hyphen;97, except for movements in the consumer price index, while working towards the implementation of a fairer system of funding for the general aviation sector's contribution to Airservices Australia. The

         The amendments in schedule 2 commenced on 1 September 1997. They will give effect to the government's decision on passenger motor vehicles and automotive components from 2000 up to 2010. Honourable members will be aware of the announcement of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on 5 June 1997 of the key elements of the government's response to the Industry Commission's review of the automotive industry.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government delivered an integrated package of reforms and measures designed to promote a sustainable and internationally competitive automotive industry into the next century. A central element of the package was the government's decision on the tariff arrangements to apply to passenger motor vehicles and automotive components from 2001. There are to be no changes to the tariff phasedown as provided for in the current legislation up to the year 2000, when the tariff will be 15 per cent. This will hold constant till 2005.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The changes to be introduced through this bill effect a reduction in tariffs on passenger motor vehicles and certain components of five percentage points from 1 January 2005, reducing the general rate of duty to 10 per cent. Tariffs on four wheel drive and light commercial vehicles are to remain at their present rate of five per cent. Tariffs on micro&amp;hyphen;light vehicles are to stay in line with that of passenger motor vehicles.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This delivers clear and certain policy settings that will ensure that the automotive companies can invest and operate with confidence. The industry is now well placed to build on its achievements to date and to continue to move toward global integration. At the same time the government is maintaining the trend towards lower tariff levels. In 2005, automotive tariffs will be at 10 per cent—a significant achievement since 1985 when assistance measures included import quotas and a tariff of 57.5 per cent.

          The decision also demonstrates anew the government's commitment to the APEC goal of trade liberalisation by 2010. This benefits all trading countries and will enhance opportunities for all globally competitive firms. It will benefit Australia's automotive industry as well by enhancing the opportunities for further growth through exports under the APEC agenda. The government's decision was endorsed by industry and state governments. It was unanimously supported by the Automotive Manufacturing Council which provided advice to the government throughout the review process on issues critical to the future viability of the industry.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Schedule 3 of this bill will take effect from 1 July 1998. The amendments contained in this schedule implement the government's decision on the Industry Commission's report on the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. The economic conditions under which Australia's TCF industries have operated in the past 15 years have undergone dramatic change. In the 1980s, the effective tariff rate for clothing and footwear was 250 per cent. By 1996, the effective tariff rate had fallen to about 40 per cent.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The tariff rate in 2000 will be 25 per cent for clothing and 15 per cent for footwear. The rapid reductions in tariff assistance have caused Australia's TCF industries to implement radical reforms so as to maintain competitiveness. This transformation has not been easy. There have been significant impacts on employment and the overall strength of our TCF industries. Australia's TCF industries must be able to compete in the free trade environment that will exist from 2010. The proposed legislation allows for a step down in TCF tariffs on 1 January 2005 after a pause from 1 July 2000.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The step down will put tariff levels within striking distance of achieving the APEC goal of free trade by 2010. The pause will give Australia's TCF industries an opportunity to consolidate and strengthen by investing, restructuring and identifying global business opportunities which are necessary to achieve sustainable, internationally competitive industries in a free trade environment. Tariff levels will fall from 25 per cent to 17.5 per cent for
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           clothing and finished textiles; from 15 per cent to 10 per cent for cotton sheeting, woven fabric, carpets and footwear; and from 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent for sleeping bags, table linen and footwear parts.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The government is supporting this legislation with a range of TCF industry assistance measures aimed at encouraging  investment, research and innovation, and the achievement of international best practices in management, marketing, processes, and product design and quality. These assistance measures are fully consistent with our World Trade Organisation obligations. In 2005, the government will review the tariff arrangements. This review will incorporate a detailed analysis of the progress that other countries are making toward achieving their free trade commitments. I commend the bill to the house. I present the explanatory memorandum.

          This government is committed to the development of a viable pharmaceutical industry in Australia. In April this year, we announced three new initiatives to ensure an internationally competitive operating environment for the industry into the 21st century: the introduction of the pharmaceutical industry investment program; the extension of patent terms for pharmaceuticals by up to five years; and the provision of a regime of data exclusivity. These measures were announced in the context of the government's response to the Industry Commission report No. 51,

         <para first-indent="16">
          The development of a new drug is a long process. A new chemical entity, from which a pharmaceutical is derived, is patented early in the process. However, considerable re search and testing is still required before the product can enter the market. This long development time, combined with the considerable regulatory process to register and market a new product, means that companies usually have considerably fewer years under patent in which to gain a return on their investment. This becomes significant to the industry, as companies rely heavily on patents to generate the substantial cash flows necessary to finance the development of new drugs.

         <para first-indent="16">
          A country's patent system is also an important factor in investment decisions. A strong patent system contributes significantly to a positive investment climate and sends a signal that Australia values an innovative pharmaceutical industry.

           The objective of this part of the bill is to provide an `effective patent life' more in line with that available to inventions in other fields of technology. It will also create a patent regime for pharmaceuticals which is in line with our competitors.

          An extension of up to five years will be available for a standard patent relating to a pharmaceutical substance that is the subject of first inclusion on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. The scheme will apply to all existing 20-year patents as well as those patents granted after the commencement of the scheme. An extension is not, however, automatic. Companies will need to apply within six months of the inclusion of the

          In Australia, patent attorneys hold an exclusive right to draft patent specifications on behalf of others for gain. Patent attorneys and the legal professions have exclusive rights of practice in respect of the prosecution of patent applications and all aspects of the prosecution of trade marks and designs applications where owners choose not to prosecute the application themselves. To ensure Australia's continued competitiveness in innovation and research, the government examined the current regime to ensure that the profession would be better placed to continue support of these vital activities in the future.

           The government recognises that allowing unqualified persons to perform the highly specialised activity of drafting patent specifications would involve unacceptably high risks to both consumers and the public.

In trade marks and designs, it will remove restrictions on who can practice. Restrictions on practice in patents will be retained, given the technical and demanding nature of patent regimes and the potential cost to the applicant of a poorly constructed or prosecuted application.

          The bill proposes that the existing partnership arrangements for patent attorneys should be relaxed to improve the public's access to the professions by encouraging a broadening of the competitive base within the patent attorney profession.

I believe that the amendments proposed in the bill will enable the government to meet its obligations and objectives of balancing a strong intellectual property system with competent professional advice against the benefits of greater competition. There will be no additional cost to government from any of the proposals as the patents, trade marks and designs systems operate on a cost recovery basis.

          On the one hand, the member for Canberra claims that, as a result of introducing parallel importation, prices for CDs will not fall and that there is no evidence that parallel importation will result in cheaper CDs for Australian consumers.

          If the claim that prices will not fall were true, then why would a retailer source product  from overseas and lose the advantages of readier and cheaper access to local product? Australian retailers and distributors will only embark on the greater complications of buying offshore and the greater delay in delivery of overseas product if that overseas product is cheaper. If, as the opposition maintains, there is no price advantage, then they will continue to source supplies locally, and there will no damage to the industry by imports. However, the government maintains that there will be a fall in prices and a corresponding benefit to consumers. The  Copyright Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997  gives local suppliers an incentive to match overseas prices and thus maintain their competitiveness as suppliers to the local market.

          The member for Canberra suggested that if the exchange rate used were 78c rather than 68c the price differential disappeared. I am unable to comment on the actual exchange rates utilised, but that proposition, on my arithmetic, could not be sustained. The report also quoted a similar comparison provided by the Australian Record Industry Association, ARIA, which, using the standard Australian full price of $29.95, with estimated sales tax at $4.59, and the ARIA estimate of the standard US full price of $A21.91, generated a smaller price differential of $A3.45.

          Exchange rates are always going to fluctuate. The principle of relying on one exchange rate at one particular time is obviously not something that ought to be relied upon, but in this particular case the differential on the data available to the BTCE provides for such a significant difference that the usual fluctuations in exchange rates will have no effect.

         I want to go away and think about the material about the assumptions and its impact on the price. The arithmetic did not seem to me to add up, but there is not much point in our having a wonderful discussion about that here because, if we convince each other, the rest of Australia might still be a little bit dubious. Let me go away and look at that.

         However, I can say that I was pleased to hear—and it was my understanding from previous comments—that one of the bases of the price estimate was AMRA. My advice came indirectly from AMRA, so I want to check it, and at this stage I will not be unequivocal. As I understand it and as I am advised by the Australian Music Retailers Association, with the then current exchange rate at the time that I got this advice—which was 69c to 70c, and it is actually a bit lower than that now—imports would be selling at $34.

         That is AMRA's advice to me, but I want to make it absolutely clear to the House that I did not get that directly from AMRA. Others have conveyed it to me as its view and, until I have double&amp;hyphen;checked it, I do not want to say unequivocally that that is AMRA's view because it is just possible that I have not been accurately advised—although I think I have been. It seems to stack up. I did not query it until today because it seems to fit with my understanding of the arithmetic of how the exchange rate would work, but I will double&amp;hyphen;check it before I go any further.

         At least we have some more information, although not as much as I would have wished, and it is my all too long but nevertheless limited experience in opposition that we do tend to find that reports that favour the government lose their confidentiality very quickly and reports that do not retain it. That gives me some sense of what the BTCE report would actually say if it were released, but that is a crisis for another day. I was just recounting my experience, but of course you will prove me wrong in time, I am sure.

          Attorney's area. It relates to the piracy question. We support the increase in penalties. I do not want to argue about that; it is not a matter of controversy. The controversy surrounds the extent to which the parallel imports are part of the current Customs procedures for effective detection of piracy and whether removing parallel imports will undermine that effective protection. There are substantial arguments put by people in the industry that that is so, that Customs relies upon the exclusive licensee for advice as to who should be receiving CDs and that there is no alternative practical way for Customs to effectively vet CD imports. That does not mean that none will ever be caught, but it would mean the prospects and proportions, and effective operation and enforcement, of the piracy laws would be dramatically undermined.

         I am interested as to whether the Attorney, in his investigation of this matter, has been assured that it is not the case—as I am advised—that the current Customs procedures rely substantially on the parallel importation provisions as the basis for objections from copyright owners, which is the trigger mechanism enabling Customs to pursue and effectively enforce the piracy provisions. It is that which is our concern. It is not the biggest concern with the whole legislation, but it is a continuing concern which would apply irrespective of all our arguments about price, et cetera. I would appreciate your advice on that matter.

They include funds for post&amp;hyphen;budget decisions up to about the start of November this year. There are, in fact, a few other additions since that time which are not included in this bill.

If we lump those two together, which are the substantial money and take into account the offsetting savings which were the elements that the Minister for Finance and Administration was trying to refer to in the sentence which he has just corrected, we get net increases in outlays of $1.311 billion.

           —A very substantial contribution nevertheless, Mr Deputy Speaker. I want to focus on these appropriations and their immediate consequences for the budget bottom line and on some of the extraordinary backflips and policy reversals we have had recently from this government, which have, amongst other things, consequences for the budget bottom line. That is their main area of significance. I am referring to really important issues for the social and political life of this country. I am talking about nursing homes, tax changes, the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, the greenhouse package, the Tough on Drugs package, the domestic violence package and the disabilities package.

          The changes in policy and sometimes straight backflips from previous policy in all these areas are part of the cause of the emerging perception in Australia that the government has lost its way; that it is a government that does not have a sense of where it wants to take Australia and does not have any idea about how to get to the vague destination it sees somewhere in the hazy future.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Let us have a look at some of these backflips and policy reversals. Some of them are welcome, even if all too modest. First of all, there was the nursing homes backflip. The government never seems to have come to the conclusion that the fundamental problem is
          <break page="11282" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           that the policy at its heart is rotten and should just be discarded. The government keeps trying to find ways to make minor modifications, patch it up here, put a bandaid on there. The government does not go to the core of the problem.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 budget they said they would pull out almost $500 million worth of funding from nursing homes. That is the core of the problem with that policy and it remains the core of the problem. It is absolutely unbelievable that a minister can say, `The problem the government developed the new policy to cope with and to respond to was inadequate capital injection to nursing homes. Our solution is to cut the funding.' It is the oxymoron of oxymorons to say that the problem is lack of capital and that the solution is to cut the funding. That is an extraordinary proposition.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The opposition found that $60 million is the prevailing assessment of the 1997&amp;hyphen;98 budget consequence of the partial temporary backdown that they have made so far. There are clearly more backdowns to come. In response to a question from me in the House, the Minister for Finance and Administration said that when the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) had released all the  details of the new policy there would be no shortage of capital for nursing homes.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I have to say that at the moment that remains a source of some mystification to everybody I have met in the nursing home sector. They are waiting for the information that will support that position. There was, at the time that statement was made, some media speculation that the government was going to put $20 million into capital for nursing homes. There has been no sign of that commitment. There has been no indication of any extra funding of that sort. But perhaps that is the next backflip. It is likely that the backflip so far will have outyear consequences for the budget, although on the preliminary assessment we have made it will decline from the $60 million in 1997&amp;hyphen;98. The best assessment we can make at the moment is that, over the four&amp;hyphen;year budgetary forward estimates cycle, it may be an extra $130 million.

           Until now no&amp;hyphen;one has challenged our assessment of $60 million for 1997&amp;hyphen;98. It is getting harder for the opposition to precisely forecast the cost consequences of such a policy thereafter, but we think that over the four years it certainly will be more than $100 million: it will get up towards but probably not be quite as much as $150 million. That is a most extraordinary policy reversal because it does not go far enough. It is a policy that just needs to be abandoned.

           We have had a policy reversal with regard to the capital gains tax and the new cost based rules and their impact on the budget changes. It is assessed that they will add $135 million a consequence of the 2 November 1997 announcement by the government.

           We had the pharmaceutical benefits scheme backflip on the therapeutic goods decision, which adds about $100 million over four years.

We have the $180 million greenhouse package and the $87.5 million drugs package, in both instances responding to huge cuts made in those very same programs by the government in 1996. The huge cuts were made, and then they hoped to win applause from the Australian people for saying, `Well, we'll put the money back in.'

           In the case of greenhouse, some of the research which they hope the funding will pick up and which they hope will make a substantial contribution to the resolution of greenhouse both domestically and internationally—as it might—has been stopped as a result of the previous cuts. We have to go back and try to pick up the pieces and put the research process back together again. It is appalling government, appalling mismanagement, to have thought that that was ever a sensible thing to do. It says that the government has no understanding of the profound
           <break page="11283" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

If, as a result of excessively parsimonious behaviour by a government, we leave people with an unsustainable environment, we have not been equitable to future generations.

I find all the time in my capacity as shadow minister for the arts that this is the most constant theme: `The worst fears have not been fulfilled. Isn't that wonderful?' Nothing new has happened. No improvement has occurred. We simply have `It could have been worse.'

And we must remember that this government did not invent or create low inflation. Australia has been in a low inflationary growth phase for five years—not for 18 months. There have been 4&amp;half; to five years of sustained low inflationary growth. It is what they inherited when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in a burst of honesty said that the economy he inherited was `better than good'.

It does not matter how often the Prime Minister wanders around saying, `We are not part of Asia; we are not Asians'—not that anybody ever said we were—our economic future is fundamentally tied to the success of our region.

This was Labor's legacy. Under Labor, high foreign debt led to high interest rates and that meant higher mortgage payments for families and small businesses and fewer jobs for battling Australians.

         This must never be allowed to happen again. That is why one of the first steps taken by the Howard government was to introduce the charter of budget honesty. In my contribution to the debate on this bill in this parliament earlier this year, I said, and I reiterate:

         Yet again, Labor, to its shame, continues to campaign against the passage of that bill in the national parliament. Even as recently as last Sunday, 23 November 1997, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) on national television complained that the charter of budget honesty would be used to release budget figures undermining the opposition's  election costings after they have been released. He said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Well, because what they've said is that they will release a set of figures about the direction of public outlays or direction of the budget overall in the immediate week or two of an election being called . . . Now, no party can put itself at risk like that.

         It seems obvious to me and my colleagues on this side of the House that the Labor Party does not want to put itself at risk from the truth about the budget. That is why they concealed Beazley's $10 billion black hole in the 1996 election campaign. The charter of budget honesty would prevent such deception, yet Labor opposes such a needed reform that has the overwhelming support of all Australians. The fact is that under the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill both the government and the opposition would have to present policies

         The pre-election outlook is the responsibility not of the government but of the secretaries of Treasury and the Department of Finance and Administration. If the opposition is so concerned about pre&amp;hyphen;election budget updates, why did they not move an amendment to have them removed from the bill? Instead, the opposition lamely puts forward a questionable amendment which would provide pre-election costings five days after an election is called, rather than allowing for a period of 10 days. It is almost impossible to produce meaningful updates in only five days. What is the opposition's real agenda? I suspect it is to derail the bill so there will be no budget honesty. I think the Australian nation should be aware of that.

         The Senate again failed to pass the charter of budget honesty for the second time by insisting on a number of amendments that would make the charter unworkable.

This should serve as a warning, as I said earlier, to all the Australian public that the Labor Party want their legendary type of deceit to continue.

Rapid capital flows have also made currencies more sensitive to perceptions about the credibility of economic policies. As such, the international financial markets have been an important barometer of the success of Australia's economic reforms. This success is reflected in the fact that Australian 10&amp;hyphen;year bonds are currently trading at yields less than 0.1 of a percentage point away from US yields, down from a differential of well over two percentage points at the time of the election last year.

          —I would like to make a number of points about the budget and the economy in the context of discussing these appropriation bills. At the outset, I would like to correct the continual misrepresentation by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) of Australia's budget deficit and the government debt position that the government inherited on the change of government. The Treasurer continually claims in question time, and we have all heard it time and time and tedious time again, that there was a high level of government debt when they came into office in the order of $90 billion to $100 billion—he varies in the numbers that he uses—that there was a supposed $10 billion black hole in terms of a budget deficit and that all this indicated how fiscally irresponsible the Labor government was.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I will make a number of points about that. Firstly, it is true that debt did increase substantially in the first half of the 1990s. That, of course, was because of a recession. In a recession, all governments find that they are faced with an increasing budget deficit, or reducing surplus. That is because of the automatic effect on the budget of a recession—that is, reduced tax revenue as unemployment increases and fewer people are earning incomes, company profits fall so there is less company tax, fewer things are bought
         <break page="11289" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          so there is less in the way of sales tax and, on the other hand, there is a much higher expenditure on unemployment benefits. These things happen automatically. So the budget turns around in a recession quite quickly through these automatic factors, which are called automatic stabilisers in so far as they mean the government is cutting taxes and spending more so there is some kind of impetus to the economy.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Also, there are discretionary increases that all governments use to try to get the economy out of a recession more quickly than would otherwise be the case. These discretionary measures—increases in public works, cuts in taxes, whatever the government decides to use to boost demand—have the effect of increasing the budget deficit and, therefore, increasing government debt.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Both these things happened in the early 1990s. We had the automatic increase in the budget deficit. We had the discretionary increases to try to get us out of the recession quickly. So the budget surplus at the end of the 1980s of two per cent of GDP turned around quite quickly into a deficit by about 1993.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The same thing happened in the early 1980s when the then Treasurer, John Howard, now Prime Minister, was presiding over the country's economic fortunes and there was a recession. Immediately the budget started to deteriorate through the automatic factors and  also because of the discretionary measures brought in by the Fraser government to try to get the economy back onto a growth path. So, when Labor came into office, we inherited a budget deficit heading towards four per cent of GDP. In today's money, that four per cent of GDP would be about $20 billion. That is what we faced.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Did we rush in and say, `This is terrible. We've got a budget deficit of four per cent of GDP. We have to slash and burn in order to get the budget back into surplus as quickly as possible'? Had we done that, we would have kept the economy in recession for longer than it was and prevented the recovery, which occurred fairly rapidly after Labor came into office. We gradually pared the budget deficit
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          back through the combination of repair through growth and also through discretionary changes to the budget to reduce outlays in the main. Over time that took us back into a budget surplus of up to two per cent of GDP by the end of the 1980s.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The contrast between the way in which Labor went about dealing with a budget deficit which it inherited and the way in which this government went about dealing with a budget deficit which it inherited is stark. One sought to do it in a graduated, sensible way, not impairing the growth of the economy; the other one belted into it and said, `This is disastrous. We have to take big steps,' and, therefore, put a damaging anti&amp;hyphen;growth and anti-employment factor into the economy. I will come to that factor later on. It is very important to understand exactly what the situation was and the contrast between the situation that Labor faced when it came into office and the way it handled it and the way in which the current government handled the situation of trying to repair the budget deficit.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If in the eyes of the Treasurer it is so important to attack budget deficits as soon as they emerge, does that mean that in the face of a recession he believes that the appropriate policy for the government to pursue is to slash government expenditure and increase taxes to repair the deficit? He seems to be implying that, when the recession occurred and we had an automatic deterioration of the deficit, we should have dashed in there and repaired the budget deficit. Had we done that, we would have had a much longer recession, maybe a depression. It would have been absurd policy to do that.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         No Western government faced with the same situation did that. They all did what we did—that is, they took discretionary action to try to get the economy back on a growth path. That did not involve tightening the budget; it involved loosening the budget. Of course one does not do this forever. The day comes when you have to repair it, as we did in the 1980s and as we were doing through the 1990s subsequent to getting the economy back on a growth path. But the Treasurer seems to imply that we should have got stuck right into
         <break page="11290" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          the budget in terms of tightening it up in the midst of a recession. It would have been an absurd policy. It would have been totally counterproductive. We would have had a much deeper recession. We would still have substantial budget deficits, but a far worse economy.

         What happened in Australia with regard to the budget deficit and debt happened in most Western countries for the same reason. Virtually all of them went into recession in the first part of the 1990s. It was not in the same year—some went early like us, the United States, Canada and a few others. The English speaking nations tended to go early. The others came a year or two later. But over the period of the early 1990s most Western countries went into recession. All of the G7 countries did. It was not just Australia. The whole of the G7, the major locomotive forces of the world economy, went into recession over this period. Most of Europe went into recession over this period. In other words, the developed world as a whole went into recession at some stage or other over this period. It was not an isolated Australian experience.

         The OECD figures for general government financial balances, which give a common basis for analysis of country's budget positions, show that in 1989 the OECD average budget deficit was 1.2 per cent of GDP and that by 1993 that had increased to 4.3 per cent of GDP. So the figure for all the Western developed countries in the OECD went from  1.2 per cent of GDP deficit in 1989 to 4.3 per cent of GDP deficit in 1993 because of recession. It was a common experience for all of us. Some countries had a dramatic turnaround. Sweden went from a surplus of 5.4 per cent of GDP in 1989 to a deficit of 12.3 per cent of GDP in 1993—an extraordinary turnaround. Most were nowhere near as dramatic as that. Certainly, Australia's position was not in that kind of order.

It was a relatively low budget deficit compared with most Western countries. The average deficit for the G7 countries, the major economic forces, was 3.4 per cent of GDP in 1995—well above ours of two per cent.

         Also in regard to government debt, the OECD table in relation to government financial balances shows common analysis of gross financial liabilities for OECD countries. It lists 21 countries and shows their gross financial liabilities as a percentage of GDP for 1996. It shows only two countries out of 21 had a lower level of debt than Australia. We get this ridiculous nonsense from the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey), all the backbenchers and the Prime Minister about Labor's legacy of debt and deficit. It is just an absolute nonsense. Labor's debt and deficit was low by the standards of Western developed countries. We did not leave high levels of debt or high levels of deficit.

They were not false figures, they were not figures that we dreamed up or that we changed from the analysis that was given to us by Treasury and Finance; we used their figures.

         The 1996 budget must take some substantial blame for that.

          by 0.8 per cent, which means people have dropped out of the work force. If participation had remained where it was at 63.8 per cent, the unemployment rate today would be 9.5 per cent not 8.4 per cent. They have been saved, to some extent, by the fact that there has been this decline in the participation rate—a decline which the government has, in part, engendered by such actions as slashing funds for child care, making it much more difficult for women to afford child care so that they are dropping out of the work force.

         Let us compare all that with what happened in the previous 20 months before Labor went out of office. In our last 20 months, we had employment growth of 453,000 compared with the next 20 months under this government which had a miserable growth of 121,500. We had a growth in full-time employment of 265,000 compared with a growth of—how much?—24,500 in the next 20 months under this government. What an incredible contrast: this government has achieved less than a tenth of our development of full-time jobs.

         Labor increased employment in its last three years by a whopping 733,000 jobs. So far, in  1&amp;frac23; years this government has increased employment by just 121,500 jobs. The Prime Minister boasted in the election that he would `boost jobs growth'—I think those were the exact words. If he is going to at least match Labor's 733,000 jobs, then in the next year and a quarter he will have to produce 611,500 additional jobs. You reckon he has a chance of doing that? Obviously not a hope in hell.

         Yet to hear the ministers at question time boasting about what they are doing to improve employment—the Treasurer, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp), the Minister for Finance and Administration and the Prime Minister—one would think that this was a terrific record that they could point to. In fact, their record on employment is a disaster. That is partly because of reduced economic growth but it is also because of the way in which they have gone about their budget cuts by slashing the Public Service, cutting Public Service jobs to an incredible degree, abolishing the Working Nation programs, pushing up long-term unemployment and destroying employment services.

The one thing I guess he is saying is that he does not believe that the electorate in March last year dumped his party comprehensively for the way it managed the economy.

         Let me recap on a few of the legacies associated with the speech by the member for Gellibrand and former Treasurer (Mr Willis)—his valedictory speech, I would think. Labor's legacy included a $10.3 billion deficit in 1995-96. The member for Gellibrand and former Treasurer denies that deficit was there, but it is there. He blames the Treasury officials for giving the wrong figures. Labor's legacy also included record small business interest rates, which were up to 24 to 26 per cent during their term. But Labor—not understanding what small business is all about—would not appreciate how much of an impact that had.

         Labor also introduced a fringe benefits tax during their term, which meant the closure of

          many towns in the north-west of Western Australia. They had an 800 per cent increase in foreign debt since 1983 and they had the worst current account deficit in the OECD. And despite what the former Treasurer said, because no-one can believe anything the Labor Party says these days, it was worse than the deficit in Mexico.

         The real startling point about Labor's legacy is that they promised in 1993 not to put up tax. They went to the Australian people in 1993 saying they would not put up tax; yet they increased taxes by $10 billion in their last three years of government. Here we have opposition members saying how wonderful they were. That is why the previous speech from the member for Gellibrand was a very sad speech.

         The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Mr Gareth Evans, on 19 March 1996 said, `We were a good government, and we are not going to apologise.' In a radio interview in September last year, an interviewer asked the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), `When do you think you will be Prime Minister?' He said, `In three years.' What an arrogant statement from someone who has just been dumped out of the electorate. Labor's Martin Ferguson, the member for Batman, said on 25 November 1996, `The Australian people are a pretty forgiving population. They basically threw us out on 2 March not on the basis that we were a bad government but basically because of the "It's time" factor.' They do not yet have the message. Mr Beazley, the opposition leader, said on 22 June 1996, `We don't need to go through the  sort of soul searching that the state parties went through, because we were a competent government.' The electorate did not believe that.

         When we came into office and gained the confidence of the electorate in 1996, our goal was to govern for all Australians, not just a few, to try to meet these concerns.

Whilst there is much more to be done, we are taking some steps in the right direction.

         It is interesting to note Labor's history when it comes to debt. Labor members do not recognise debt. They say that debt is good. If you went to any household in Australia and said, `Don't worry about it. Debt is good,' its occupants would throw you out the front door, because debt is not good. The Labor Party thinks it is okay to overspend what we earn. The current account deficit in 1994-95 was equal to six per cent of GDP, contrary to what the former Treasurer just said. Perhaps he has the wrong advice again. It was the worst in the OECD.

          —One has got to be generous, but I must say he really stretched that friendship a long way today. The honourable member for Cowan said that he was proud to be a member of the government and that it was heading in the right direction. All I can say to the honourable member for Cowan is: keep heading in that direction. We are delighted that you are heading in that direction because that is why you are where you are in the polls today. Have a look at the Morgan polls and the other polls and see where you are going. We encourage you to keep going in that direction—and the direction of the polls will be down, down and down. Whenever that election is held, instead of us having this temporary sojourn on this side of the chamber, we will resume our rightful place on that side of the chamber. Keep heading in that direction; we are delighted.

         One wonders if everything is as wonderful as the honourable member for Cowan has spent the last 20 minutes telling us: how great it all is and how great society is today. One wonders why the coalition parties are where they are at the moment, because the community is sending them a message. Far from going in the right direction, on so many issues they are going completely in the wrong direction. Let me take up some of the points that the honourable member for Cowan raised.

          He raised the question of youth unemployment. We all know that youth unemployment is a very difficult problem. It was a problem when we were in government and it is an immediate problem for them. But government members keep saying this phrase, which apparently came from the former Senator Richardson—`promise them anything'. I remember the last election. Next door to me is the seat of Gilmore, and I remember the now member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash)—again someone who I have known for a long time and have an amount of admiration and respect for—promising the youth of Nowra that if the then opposition, now the current government, were elected, they would no longer tolerate youth unemployment in the Shoalhaven.

         <para first-indent="16">
          As anyone knows who cares to read the figures, youth unemployment in the Shoalhaven has gone up significantly since the government was elected. There were lots of reasons; I am not saying it was all the government's fault. Nevertheless, the member for Gilmore made much of it during the campaign. She used to come on television and say, `We will not tolerate this, we will not tolerate that, we will not tolerate youth unemployment in the Shoalhaven.'

          I was quite interested in what the member for Cowan was saying about the job training schemes. Whatever people might argue about Labor when it was in government, we did have a commitment to the youth. You only have to look at some of the programs that we initiated—the training programs and others—to give youth not only jobs but also some feeling of worth in the community and some money in their pocket. I agree with the member that there should not be any unemployment, but there will be unemployment.

          The member for Cowan must live in a very different area from me or he must have read different newspapers from me: he is talking about apprenticeships. I have been reading in the paper this week that Qantas—in an act of spite, I believe—are not taking on any apprentices. I know that in my own area, where we could always rely on BHP to take on apprentices, they are not taking on apprentices. I can remember at one time BHP at Port Kembla had an apprentice training school.

He made much of what they are doing for the family, but they are also causing a lot of divisiveness in the family. One thing he did say, which I agree with wholeheartedly, was that they remodelled child care. You remodelled it all right—you remodelled it right out the door. The people in my area, a working class area, who came to see me cannot afford to pay the fees in child&amp;hyphen;care centres today. People come even from the member for Gilmore's electorate to see me. People come up from Nowra and Kiama to see me.

          I remember when we came into power in 1983 what the child&amp;hyphen;care provision was in this country. It was way down on OECD levels. One thing we can be proud of when we were in government—there are many things we can be proud of—is that we made good quality child care accessible to all and affordable by all. You have most certainly remodelled it so that it is not accessible to all and affordable by all. We all represent areas in which there are child&amp;hyphen;care centres, thanks to the Labor government, and these people have been to see each of you as they have been to see me. The claim that they are making is that child care is no longer accessible to all and no longer affordable by all.

          I am so grateful to the honourable member for Cowan for making such a wide ranging speech because I did not have a lot prepared. He has given me the opportunity to respond to his comments. He touched on Medicare and said that Medicare is preserved. You are trying to gut Medicare; you are trying to kill it by 1,000 stabs. Let me tell you of the commitments made during the election campaign. In the last federal election campaign, the Liberal candidate for the seat of Throsby was a chicken farmer from Liverpool—he did not even live in the electorate. This chicken farmer—we called him `the chicken man'—fluttered into my electorate on one day during the four or five weeks campaign.

          For some time, there had been a campaign in my electorate to open a new Medicare office at Dapto. I was very involved in this. It was put through the Dapto branch of the ALP and many people came to see me. The combined pensioners were running a campaign on it. There were letters in the paper and it went over a couple of years. When Graham Richardson was a minister, I remember a deputation went to see him. When the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) was a minister, we had a meeting here. We said to the people, `In the growth projected for Dapto, in a couple of years time there will be the population base for a Medicare office and I am sure we will eventually establish a Medicare office there.' They were a bit angry with me and the government that we had not immediately seen the validity of their arguments and immediately opened a Medicare  office in Dapto. But we had produced all the figures to show that, in the long term, we would open it.

           the Liberal Party is elected to government, we will immediately open a Medicare office in Dapto.' `Great news,' everyone said. Everyone was ringing me up and saying, `The chicken man'—whatever his name was—`is so successful he is going to open a Medicare office in Dapto.'

Instead of opening one, you closed two Medicare offices. You closed the Medicare office at Warrawong and you closed the Medicare office at Corrimal! Instead of giving us an additional Medicare office in Dapto, which was a solemn promise from the Liberal Party, immediately they won the election, what did they do? Instead of opening one, they closed two. Unbelievable! And they are expecting us to believe that they are not determined to destroy Medicare.

          Now we come to the environment. Unless things have moved a little more quickly than I have known them to move, the whole question on the environment is still a promise. It is still a gleam in some Liberal Party member's eye. Like us, you are committed to the environment, but do you think that it will really be delivered? Why are the environmental movements throughout Australia, those who you conned, so worried about you? It is all very well for Liberal Party members to stand up in this chamber and say that the Labor Party would promise us anything. Any of us who lived through the last election know the sleazy deal you did with the environmental movement. The deal that was done then was not delivered on. So don't you people lecture us on promising anything to get government. You promised anything to the environmental movement and, as I always say to the environmentalists when they come to see me, the problem with the Liberal Party is that they have the chainsaw wielding National Party to contend with—the chainsaw gang.

          Moving on to workplace reform, most workplace reform—and I notice it has been in the media this week—is to do with the waterfront. It always amazes me that, when those opposite talk about the waterfront, they talk as if taking the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia membership out, lining them up against a wall and shooting them would immediately solve all the problems on the waterfront. Of all the trade union movements in Australia, the Maritime Union of Australia—the former Waterside Workers Federation of Australia—is the most reformed. The shipping unions are the unions which have been most reformed over recent years. It is a lean and mean team on waterfront today. A few years ago on the waterfront a lot of people could be seen. They are not seen today. The union movement has been restructured. The waterfront is an extremely complex business. There are a lot of cogs in the chain there and the waterfront workers are but few.

         I also caught a few of the remarks earlier on by the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe). There is a fairly consistent theme emerging from the other side in this debate. They conveniently forget the damage that they did in government. The legacy that they left was not just left to this government; it was also imposed on the people of Australia—a very poor legacy it is, too. They have
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

         For example, the member for Maribyrnong talked about growth and unemployment, and the fact that he did not think there was any commitment from this side to fix unemployment. On that subject, I remind the House that the previous government ran very high unemployment rates for very many years and tried all sorts of programs, special initiatives, and special legislation, spent literally billions of dollars on special unemployment programs and so on, and still were unable to fix the problem.

         Although the unemployment rate today obviously remains at a totally unacceptably high level and is something that does cause all of us concern and that we all are trying to find ways to deal with, to suggest that that is something that has occurred under us or that could be fixed very quickly under us is, frankly, very hypocritical, given that after 13 years the previous government was not able to fix the unemployment problem in general and the youth unemployment problem in particular.

The point that I want to make is that I think there is a fundamental truth that the gentleman opposite needs to understand. You get to the point—and we saw it at a federal level; and I come from Victoria, and certainly saw it with the last Labor government in Victoria—that you can get into debt for a certain period of time, but you cannot just keep running up the bill forever and ever.

          Two things happen. One is that you have to pay interest on your borrowings, and that becomes a larger and larger proportion of your recurrent expenditure, which therefore means that the amount of disposable money you have to spend on services diminishes. The second thing is that if your debt gets too high those from whom you have borrowed the money will actually move in and will not give you the freedom and the flexibility to sort out your own problem; they will impose solutions.

          What happened with the previous government is that they were getting increasingly into debt. So when we came to government less than two years ago, we inherited a very adverse financial situation. Therefore, it is important on a national scale as well as in our own home budgeting—and I think everybody can relate to home budgeting—that if you are living beyond your means ultimately there comes a point in time when you have to take some fairly drastic action. This government had to take that action. I notice that unfortunately the honourable member for Throsby, who was making so many complaints, has not stayed around in the chamber to listen to the response to what he had to say. Of course, we know that it is pretty unpalatable from the opposition point of view.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The reality was that we inherited a $10 billion shortfall in the government's budget and we have had to try to put that right. Nobody suggests at all that that has been without pain. Of course, it has been painful. It has been painful in a number of areas of government expenditure. And a lot of the decisions that we have had to make have often been a choice between two unpalatable options. Sometimes it is a question of doing less damage in one area than you might do in another area. But of course we have felt pain.

          I also draw the parallel I mentioned earlier of the situation in Victoria. The Kennett government, before the Howard government, had to undertake a similar exercise in terms of the Victorian economy. And Victoria is  now very much getting back on their feet. They have paid off much of the debt and are able to now start to spend some more money in the services area of education, health, and
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           so on. So they are getting back on their feet. Clearly, that is the route that the federal national government has to undertake.

          It is no good the other side talking about what we have done to child care or what we might have done to health or education or complaining about any of those other areas. The reality of life is that they had 13 years in government to put all those things into place. And had there been a paid for, effective, operating set of systems in those areas when we came to government, then there would have been no need for us to take the painful action that we have had to take.

          The member for Throsby talked about small business. He complained about the fact that there were still small businesses going bust. As I am sure you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I know many other members of this chamber will be aware, small businesses go bust on an ongoing basis. To say that there are a few small businesses going bust today is in itself obviously regrettable in the individual cases, but it does not actually mean a thing in terms of looking at what the government has done. The reality is that small businesses were going bust at a far greater rate under the previous government than they are under this government. In fact, this government has introduced a number of measures that have helped small business very significantly.

           I was very disappointed when the member for Throsby talked about small business. One of the things that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology did recently was to conduct an inquiry into the operation of small business, which looked at predatory practices of large companies against small companies, retail tenancies and a whole range of other issues that are of critical importance to small business. That inquiry received a lot of input from small business. When its recommendations were published they were lauded by the whole small business sector and all their spokesmen. This government picked up those recommendations and not only implemented them fully but in some areas went even further. Again, the whole small business sector stood up and applauded what this government has done. And that was on top of earlier measures that we had taken in terms of capital gains tax—measures aimed at helping small business. Of course, there are always problems out there. Nobody is suggesting that the small business climate is perfect, but the reality is that this government has done a great number of things for small business.

           It was interesting that the member for Throsby talked about Medicare. He said that this government is `trying to destroy Medicare by 1,000 stabs'. That is not the case. We have not, in any shape or form, tried to destroy Medicare. In fact, closing the odd Medicare office is often a matter of prudent administration when you decide to open an office here or close an office there. Obviously cost factors and population shift come into it, and clearly, on an ongoing basis, offices will be closed from time to time and new offices will be opened. It seems to me that whether you have got a Medicare office or not is not the core of whether you are destroying Medicare. Medicare is about delivering medical and hospital services to people. We are not talking about the administration. If the strongest point the member for Throsby can make is that we have closed some Medicare offices, he has not got much to complain about at all.

            considerable degradation of medical facilities available to people in this country, particularly in the private health sector where, under the previous government, we saw participation in private health insurance drop from around 70 per cent down to around 32 or 33 per cent. What that meant was that those people not only were taken out of the private health area, which left a number of facilities underutilised, but then went on to the public health system which, in turn, put huge stresses and strains on the public health system. That has caused much more damage to the health system in this country than our closing a few Medicare offices around the traps.

           The member for Throsby also talked about waterfront reform. He painted a graphic picture about us wanting to take out people from the waterfront, line them up and do terrible things to them. That is not what the argument is about at all. He said that they were lean and mean, there had been a lot of reform and we were performing much better on the waterfront. I agree with him. We are performing much better on the waterfront. He also talked about the problem of people not collecting their goods, resulting in the goods being left for three days on the wharf, and said that perhaps we should do something about that. I agree with that.

           The reality of life is that, although we have improved handling on the waterfront—let us talk about handling on the waterfront: the loading and unloading of ships and so on—in the last few years, and there is no argument about that, we function in an internationally competitive environment. What we have done on the waterfront has been an improvement, but it has not been a sufficient improvement. Five years ago on the Melbourne waterfront—and Melbourne is one of the largest ports around the traps in our neck of the woods—we were handling something like 11 containers an hour. That figure, up until a couple of years ago, had improved to about 25 or 26 containers an hour—a significant improvement.

That is why people on this side of the chamber are talking about the need to improve our performance on the waterfront. It does not matter how effective and efficient our manufacturers or our road transport systems are if, when goods get to the waterfront, the costs—and we are talking about cost of ultimately delivering to the customer overseas—of slow handling, of getting things through, of the number of employees needed to handle a particular container load and so on are uncompetitive with our overseas rivals.

We obviously have had to work hard to put the budget in surplus, which will happen in the next budget year, and then we will be in a position to be a bit more generous with a few things. There has been some pain with that but, because of this prudent financial approach, we are in the fortunate position where we have got not only zero inflation but also interest rates down to the lowest level in living memory for most of the people who live in my electorate. When I was elected to this chamber in 1990, home interest rates in my electorate were around 16 or 17 per cent and small business interest rates were 22 or 23 per cent. Today home interest rates are, as we all know, around the six per cent mark and business interest rates are a bit higher.

That is a significant and very specific benefit brought to the people of my electorate and many other parts of Australia by the responsible fiscal management of this government. We have achieved in less than two years something that the previous government could not do in 13 years.

         One of the most disturbing political news stories to emerge over the past week would have to be the decision by the National Party to scale down its national headquarters here in Canberra. I say this in the context of these bills, the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1997&amp;hyphen;98 , the  Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1997&amp;hyphen;98  and the  Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1997&amp;hyphen;98 . I am trying to set out the fact that, whatever this government and the one before might do in an economic sense, I believe they are being driven by a theory about economic performance which is perhaps getting the bottom line right and delivering growth in one sense, but it is not having the desired impact on, or the return for, regional Australia.

         I think patience is running out in the regions, and I want to raise a few issues which I think the government and the opposition could well take on board in framing their  policies down the track. I think there needs to be a softening. That is not to say that you

         According to the reports, the decision to close down the national headquarters of the National Party was taken because membership of the party has fallen off dramatically. It gives me no great pleasure to draw attention to the fact that I think the reason why the National Party is losing members is that so many people in rural and regional Australia are suffering. After 13 years of Labor in government, the people of rural and regional Australia had very high expectations of this government when they overwhelmingly voted in support of the coalition in last year's election. But, where they believed there was a viable option, they took out an insurance policy and gave support to Independents—we can all debate the wisdom of that, I suppose—and strong support to the options that were available in the Senate.

         I think it is fair to say that the gulf between the major cities and rural Australia has continued to widen in the last 20 months. The sandstone curtain, as I call the Blue Mountains, separating my electorate from Sydney has grown even higher it seems. When I came to this place last year, in my first speech I highlighted many of the problems facing people in rural and regional Australia. I said how I felt I was elected because there was so much disillusionment with the major political parties that when given a credible choice of candidates who were not part of the system voters were happy to take a gamble with an independent. Certainly the recent South Australian election and the last by-election in Victoria have demonstrated that that trend has not changed since the federal election in March 1996.

That is probably very unfair to the current government in some regards because right around the world we are seeing the difficulties people are having in coming to terms with the internationalisation and the globalisation of their economies and the trade liberalisation programs, where, in the case of many Australian farmers, they are not seeing the sort of return they were led to expect would be there nor do they see it happening at any point further down the track. Now we see the partial collapse of some Asian economies or at least extensive difficulties in their economies. We see a devaluation of their particular currencies. We now have the prospect of even cheaper imports from those markets that we are battling to contend with, with their current protection regimes.

Not only are we having to prop up—and I have no difficulty with propping up these economies because therein lies our future market potential—but they see further danger signs ahead and they say, `What are we sacrificing in the interests of trade liberalisation and when will we derive our benefit?'

          It is a very difficult job for the government to sell these policies. There also seems to be a misunderstanding by this government that getting the bottom line right is enough on its own. Social economics is not part of the equation. What is the cost of not putting more money into, say, our rail infrastructure? What is the cost of not having heavy freight on rail instead of on roads where we are using our scarce road dollars to chase the heavy transports along inadequate routes to repair and restore them?

          The other part of social economics is the cost of not providing a proper public service out there in the bush so that people, many of whom are ageing, can rapidly access real people. I notice that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) has taken steps to remedy this in his area by training people in Orange and Oberon to provide veteran services. There is a real feeling out there amongst not just the older people in the bush that they cannot cope with a lot of technology such as the 1800 numbers and more and more they need people on the ground to talk to. There is one financial information service officer to service the whole Bathurst&amp;hyphen;Orange&amp;hyphen;Oberon district at a time when there are all of these changes to aged care delivery, general welfare delivery, the youth allowance and Austudy. All these things require people sitting down one on one, looking at particular circumstances and working it out. The people who are there are overworked. They cannot make enough appointments. They need more assistance. It is a cost to the bottom line, but it is certainly not a cost in terms of delivering services to the electorate.

          Lithgow, for instance, was the strongest Labor voting area in NSW, but today the people of Lithgow are not as loyal as they once were. They are willing to swing their votes if they are not offered better alternatives. Despite the battering the city has copped, there are still people in Lithgow with a lot more vision than you will find in Canberra amongst the people advising. I recently met with local union officials to discuss the problems facing the coal industry. As I said, 500 coalmining jobs out of 1,500 will be gone by August of next year. International coalmining companies do not give a stuff about the welfare of their workers. They see them merely as units of labour. With international prices for coal now so low—the `great' Australian, BHP, has gone out into the spot market and got contracts at $26 a tonne; it costs $17 a tonne to get the coal from the western fields onto the boat at Port Kembla—there is no margin there.

The western field is underground. It is fraught with dangers. We have had tragedies within the last 10 years in that area. Unfortunately, we will probably see more.

They might not necessarily agree with my point of view, but they are certainly better educated about it, and I cannot recall one complaint in the last six months about native title. On the contrary, it has been a very supportive electorate for the principles of delivering to our indigenous people a true native title that means something—not freehold, but something that offers them something to work with down the track with perhaps negotiation for commercial gain at some point. Recognition of native title is what they basically require and my electorate is supporting that. Having said that, I support these bills with a warning that you have to get a little more of the social economics into the equation.

          —Before the honourable member for Calare (Mr Andren) leaves the chamber, I would like to thank him for what was a very balanced, perceptive and intuitive insight into the way many people out there see the contemporary issues that face us at the moment. That is not to say that I agree with everything he said, particularly some of his economic theories. Nevertheless, I think his contribution today reinforces a view that this chamber is the richer for having some independent thought. On that point, I am very pleased that he differentiated his views—and this would be the case with the views of the members for Moore (Mr Filing) and Curtin (Mr Rocher)—from the more extreme partisan views of the members for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) and Oxley (Ms Hanson). I thank him for a balanced contribution to this debate.

          Appropriation Bill (No. 3)  mentions a $111,121,000 allocation of appropriations to the Department of Defence. Of that, a little over $88 million is for equipment and stores. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) made the point that this appropriation was for high priority logistic items, including spares and equipment repair activities. One thing that does frustrate and disappoint me at times in this place—and indeed as I look at the record of the other place—is the degree to which national security and strategic issues are not debated comprehensively. There are but a handful of people in this place and in the other who attempt to address some of these issues. I am not being unduly critical, because there are, in some people's views, more important portfolio, public policy issues that need to be addressed.

          What I want to do in the time available to me today is talk a little about defence funding generally, the defence efficiency review—one of the commendable initiatives of the present Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan)—and the ongoing defence reform program. Finally, I will relate back to my comments in terms of the defence logistic expenditure and the item in Appropriation Bill (No. 3)  and talk a little about the Australian National Audit Office report No. 5, which was highly critical of the performance management of the defence industry.

          Assessing the level of funding required for the defence of Australia is a complex and challenging task. It involves judgments about likely political, diplomatic, economic and industrial trends, it involves developments in our increasingly sophisticated and uncertain  regional security environment, and it involves the rate of advance of technology and the
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           changing nature of warfare. It also involves careful assessments about the level of assurance required by, or conversely the level of risk likely to be acceptable to, the Australian government and the community in the provision of their defence.

          Government policy is to assure the promotion of Australia's security and the protection of its people and interests through the development and the maintenance of the self-reliant capability to defeat any use or threat of armed force against Australia. It is important to note that capability is the combination of force structure and its preparedness and encompasses equipment, trained people to operate that equipment, facilities and the total support required to operate efficiently and effectively. Preparedness comprises readiness, which is the ability of forces to carry out operations within specified time frames, and also sustainability, which is the support required, including personnel aspects, consumables and the maintenance of systems to sustain operations for specified periods.

          Defence funding has traditionally been measured in terms of the proportion of the nation's or the government's resources allocated to defence. The 1997-98 budget of a little over $10.4 billion represents 1.9 per cent of gross domestic product and 8.2 per cent of Commonwealth outlays. These proportions have declined over the last decade, from 2.6 per cent and nine per cent respectively in 1986&amp;hyphen;87. In comparison, the proportion of Commonwealth outlays for health, social security and education has grown from 12 to 16.3 per cent, 27.2 to 40.1 per cent and 6.8 to 8.2 per cent respectively over the same period, and the percentage of GDP for each department has also grown over this period.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Put another way, defence funding has been reduced in real terms in recent years by 0.75 per cent in 1993&amp;hyphen;94, 0.5 per cent in 1994-95, 0.5 per cent in 1995-96 and again 0.5 per cent in 1996-97. This represents an ongoing reduction of some $230 million per annum compared with pre 1993-94 levels. For the period 1997-98 to 1999&amp;hyphen;2000, defence funding is planned to remain constant at zero per cent real growth. Given anticipated growth in
          <break page="11309" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           GDP, defence outlays are forecast to be 1.8 per cent of GDP at the end of this period.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Whilst percentages of GDP or overall Commonwealth outlays provide useful measures of trends in spending—for example, these figures demonstrate that there has been a relative decline in Australia's spending on defence compared with the major areas of Commonwealth outlays—they do not provide an objective basis for the amount of funding that should be provided to a specific function. For example, much depends on the movement in GDP itself. Australia's GDP has grown in real terms from 1986&amp;hyphen;87 to 1996-97 by some 33 per cent. If defence outlays had remained at 2.6 per cent of GDP, as they were in those earlier dates, the 1997-98 defence outlays would have been a little over $14.2 billion, and I compare that with the $10.4 billion that is included in the 1997-98 appropriations.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          However, the level of funding for defence needs to be determined not on the basis of share of GDP, but rather on the basis of overall government objectives in terms of fiscal policy, a realistic assessment of the resources that government will be able to allocate to defence, the strategic environment and the task to be achieved in the defence area. To achieve an acceptable level of risk necessitates a balance between defence tasks and resources. Should the resources required to achieve the task not be available, the level of risk will of course increase.
          <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
           The government and the Australian community rightly expect Defence to use its funding wisely. The government must also ensure that full value is being achieved for the resources allocated to defence—that is, that existing resources are being used in the most effective and efficient manner possible.

          Turning quickly to the defence efficiency review and the defence reform program, I wish to refer specifically to excerpts from a couple of speeches the Minister for Defence gave a few months ago and highlight one or two points he made.

           He also went on in that same speech to differentiate between the defence efficiency review and the strategic review, and I hope we will hear a little more on the latter in the ministerial statement from the Minister for Defence which, I understand, could be as early as next week.

            the minister went into much greater detail, and I really do not have time to do that today. He talked about the specific measures under the defence reform program in terms of policy and strategic guidance, in terms of the acquisition programs and in terms of relations with industry. He said:

          <para first-indent="16">
           He also talked about personnel management measures and the personnel executive. I hope, from a personal viewpoint, that there will be some further rationalisation as the reform program proceeds, particularly in terms of training and education, where I think there is more scope for rationalisation and, therefore, savings.

           That leads me to the final point in terms of logistics—the report from the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General, Audit Report No. 5, which was tabled last month, in which there was some substantial criticism of the performance management of the defence industry. I will quote one or two excerpts from the brief overview, in which it is stated:

          <para font-size="-=2">
           The current Defence inventory of spares, consumables and repairable items (excluding explosive ordnance) is valued at approximately $3.9b, with $1b expended annually on further procurement and the maintenance of repairable items by external contractors.
          </para>
          <para font-size="-=2">
           Defence holds stocks of these items primarily to ensure their availability in support of ADF requirements. In some cases, this has meant procurement of sufficient stocks to maintain equipment to the end of its forecast working life. Retirement of equipment by other countries has also created opportunities to purchase bulk stores at low cost.

           It then makes those firm recommendations. I understand that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts will automatically look at this report and report back to the parliament and to ministers. I feel sure that the Minister for Defence would see this as a positive step forward—a critical but nevertheless positive step forward—in optimising our defence budgetary output. I commend the ministers, including the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, Mrs Bishop, for the initiatives in these areas. I look forward to the initiatives being proven over the next 12 months to two to three years. I commend these bills to the House.

         I am referring, Mr Deputy Speaker, to our exports of iron ore, iron and steel. You will recall that this matter was discussed in the parliament last year and there has been an ongoing discussion about that matter. The government's response to this, as to so many other matters, is that it is none of its business; that the government has no real role in iron ore exports—whether we export metal or ore or whether we do it or someone else does it. That attitude has been so transparent that it is now obvious.

         Back in mid&amp;hyphen;September, the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) presented to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) a report on the Australian iron and steel industry by an ad hoc committee which comprised members from both sides of parliament. It is a very useful report, even though some of us disagree with many parts of it, because it represents the first full compilation of the activities of the Australian iron and steel industry, as well as putting the matter in an international context.

         When the report was put forward, there was a request to the minister for it to be tabled in this place so that it would become the property of the parliament, which would allow all of us to debate those issues contained within it.

          In speaking to the report, I point out that the committee was not a parliamentary committee, therefore it had no resources. We are appreciative of the fact that departmental staff did provide some back&amp;hyphen;up, and that was extremely helpful. I personally made a request, as did the parliamentary committee back in September last year, to the minister for a parliamentary inquiry. That was refused. The government refused to allow us to conduct a normal parliamentary inquiry and we ended up instead with a watered down version of a committee of parliamentarians, which lacked both the resources and the authority to conduct a full&amp;hyphen;scale inquiry. Despite that, some members of the committee worked very hard. I appreciate the efforts of the chairman, the member for Wannon.

          The report went to the minister, and in the report a number of things are obvious. Firstly, there is the fact that we, as a country, export 130 million tonnes of iron ore a year at an average price of $23 a tonne. We earn $3 billion a year exporting iron ore. If that was all converted to steel and exported as steel, it would earn $36 billion a year. In other words, there is a $33 billion gap between our ore exports and what we would earn if we were exporting metal. For many of us, that gap has been an issue of major concern for a long time. We see that gap as being resolvable. Aspects of the national balance of payments, aspects of massive national unemployment, would be dramatically addressed by that shift.

Right now, for example, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) could be taking up these matters. I refer, for example, to the recommendation about barriers to exports from Australia. Of course, the country with the worst barriers is America. The fact that companies in America are taking anti&amp;hyphen;dumping action against BHP has wiped out current steel exports to that country. The government, today at APEC, could be arguing with the Americans, both publicly and privately, about their barriers to our exports to their country. The fact that we are not doing so is indicative of the lack of genuine concern by this government on things that really matter.

          There is a minority report which goes into the iron and steel industry in much more detail, and the issues that confronted BHP both back in 1995 and now. What we have seen in the last eight months is a national disaster. Our biggest and strongest company is melting down in a major way. More importantly, our prospects for exporting more metal rather than ore have evaporated. The report is potentially misleading in that it confuses iron and steel, but the fact is that the minority report does point out how that occurred.

I preface my remarks by saying that, with some 650 unresolved claims out there, just one has been resolved at a cost in excess of $200 million. There is a degree of uncertainty of a sort that can only be appreciated by the pastoralists—and, for that matter, the miners—who live out there producing wealth, export dollars and jobs for so many Australians.

         Many of those people face not just a claim but multiple claims. They have no idea what the outcome might be. They do not even have an idea as to when they might know what the outcome might be. It really gets pretty demotivating to face not just the harshness of the environment and the economic stress that many people in the more remote parts of this country face but also, I have to say, the real lack of understanding of some of the armchair critics around the place, very few of whom face any of the uncertainty or the dislocation themselves, and many of whom reassured pastoralists, until quite recently, that the issue of a lease extinguished native title.

          It has to be said that it is very easy for critics to attempt to label legislation as racist when it deals with a form of title that by definition can only be held by one racial group. The original Native Title Act was subject to the very same criticism, and that ought to be remembered. The original legislation was subject to the very same charge, the very same criticism. The fact of the matter, though, is that we are respecting the principles laid down in the Mabo and Wik decisions, and we are not removing common law rights from indigenous Australians. We acknowledge the existence of native title.

Surely then contributors to this debate should accept their responsibility to ensure informed, balanced and rational dialogue. I made the comment this morning that some of those who seek to taunt supporters of our approach based on the 10-point plan are in fact in danger of doing the very thing they say would be undesirable: promoting an unhealthy racist debate in this country.

As one who represents many Aboriginal people as well as farmers, I want to ask this question: how can reconciliation, which has to involve better relationships between indigenous people and pastoralists where they live cheek by jowl in Australia's real communities, possibly be advanced in the current climate of uncertainty and animosity over this issue? I conclude by making this point: this legislation needs passing because time is not on our side.

The first of those achievements is the role we played in bringing to fruition the comprehensive test ban treaty. The comprehensive test ban treaty was signed in New York at the United Nations General Assembly in September last year. As members of the House may recall, when this government was the opposition we took a very strong stand against the decision by the then French government to resume nuclear testing in the Pacific. When we got into government we put our money where our mouth was. The House will recall that even President Clinton, the President of the United States, congratulated this government on the role it played in making the nuclear comprehensive test ban treaty a reality. That stands as one of the truly great achievements of this government.

The culmination of the role we have played will be next week when I go to Ottawa and on behalf of the Australian government—and I know with the support of the opposition, because they put out a press release to say so—sign the landmines treaty. We have played a very significant role as a government internationally in the field of disarmament. I have to concede that I have flown all through the night from Vancouver.

         I read the article fairly carefully. When I got to my office, I asked my staff if I could have a look at this great speech that had been made by the member for Kingsford-Smith. It did come as some surprise to me that the member for Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith described the previous government—in particular he was referring to his deputy leader—as suffering from foreign policy fatigue and referred to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's extraordinary lapse in the way he handled the issue of French nuclear testing.

         It is clearly the view of the opposition that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has graduated from policy fatigue to relevance deprivation syndrome. To be fair, the Leader of the Opposition, who is after all supposed to lead the opposition, should tell us whose view he shares. Does he share the view of the member for Kingsford-Smith that the previous foreign minister suffered from foreign policy fatigue? Is he one of the critics of his own deputy or is he going to stand by the deputy and bring the shadow minister into line? I think we are entitled to know what is the position of the opposition. You are its leader, so maybe you would like to tell us.

         In conclusion—I do not want to delay the time of the House too much on this, although I could be tempted—I would like to say that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition should do the honest thing by his own reputation and make a personal explanation at the end of this question time and defend himself. I have to say that, in all honesty, I do not very often stick up for the shadow minister for foreign affairs, but this time I think he got it dead right.

         It allows native title to be claimed on 79 per cent of the Australian landmass, no matter that the original Mabo court decision was in respect of the Murray Islands off the mainland of Australia and no matter that the Wik test decision, 4:3, was in respect of two brilliantly selected leases by Professor Reynolds. Full credit: they have played it absolutely brilliantly in selecting two leases which were non-conforming, absolutely non-typical leases and had been deserted for many decades. We are accepting the challenge of getting it right. As soon as the Senate passes the legislation, the sooner we will have more job certainty across Australia.

Research into areas of health relevant to the veteran population is extremely important. The needs of veterans and war widows are special and are different as a result of their war service. In addition, their needs continue to change as they age. We as a nation and as a government must ensure that the treatment and the services made available to them are at the cutting edge of medical practice.

         The government has just allocated something like $468,000 to four research projects covering the areas of the transition of genetic disorders, community nursing, palliative care and the relationship between social isolation and health. These are all very important priority areas for the government in terms of meeting the needs of our veteran community. The most significant of these projects is the research into the links between herbicides used in the Vietnam War and birth defects, particularly spina bifida. The government believes that there is still much to learn about this issue. To move forward we need more research and, as promised, we are funding that research.

Defence service home loans have been cut as a result of the economically responsible approach we have taken to the economy. Because of this government, an extra 10,500 veterans are now entitled to claim compensation benefits, including for service in Vietnam, the British Occupation Forces, the Far East Strategic Reserve and others.

Of the more than 100,000 marriages conducted each

Those who wish to have their marriage conducted by a civil marriage celebrant should be confident that the celebrant is providing a high quality service which meets the couple's needs. The review aims to make the program more relevant to the needs and aspirations of couples marrying and to ensure that civil marriage celebrants are thoroughly professional, sensitive to the wishes and needs of their clients, and committed to marrying couples with dignity.

         The discussion paper covers matters such as ethics, a code of conduct for civil marriage celebrants, service standards, professional development, training, fees, advertising standards and legal matters. Once the review is completed and implemented, civil marriage celebrants will have an integrated policy framework and clear guidelines within which to operate. Couples in the community, irrespective of where they live, will have access to a choice of high quality civil marriage services. This initiative is a further demonstration of the government's determination to uphold and enhance the institution of marriage in Australia.

Far from being delivered last June, the situation is this: Telstra is now no longer the manager; someone else is the manager. Telstra has had to make provisions for losses of $211 million in 1995-96 and $394 million in 1996-97.

         If you add it all up—this is the figure you wanted—the complete cost of JORN, including additions, is $1,116 million to Defence, which is the proper price, plus $605 million of losses and provisions that your government racked up. That makes a grand total of $1,721 million, which is an overrun of 53 per cent on the original price. My guess is that, if you were able to get into the Telstra books, you would find that it is more than that.

         The criteria will indicate very clearly that the multinationals are welcome, if they wish, to tender for this work. But they must do so by showing who their partners are. Those partners must be small and medium enterprise Australian companies. They must show what content, in terms of the hardware, is Australian produced. That is also about supporting Australian business. They must show what other work they will do for Australians in Australia outside of the government contract—not just work for the government but also work in other parts of Australia—as a consortium. On top of that, they must show where they will do work as a consortium—that is, the multinationals with small and medium sized businesses—outside of Australia.

          —I thank the honourable member for his question. At the moment there are a number of overseas trained medical practitioners undergoing a hunger strike in Sydney. I think it is relevant that I inform the House what the procedures are and what the situation is. First, it is my view that people who come from overseas who wish to have their qualifications assessed should be able to have that done on a completely non-discriminatory basis. To this end, we as a government have not sought to reinstate the quota that used to exist on the AMC exam. We have also said that, for doctors filling country positions before they come from overseas, Australia should look to overseas trained doctors here in the first instance.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We give a substantial amount of assistance to help doctors from overseas try to pass the exams. We spent $900,000 last year on 153 bridging courses that we paid for for doctors, and we spent $400,000 paying the examination fees of unemployed doctors who could not afford them. Unlike comparable countries—such as the UK, Canada or the United States—in Australia the Australian Medical Council actually publishes a booklet of test questions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, there are countries that have a very variable pass rate in the AMC exams. Some countries, such as Hong Kong and South Korea, do very well, and that reflects the very high standards of their medical
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          schools. Other countries, such as Colombia and El Salvador—and Italy, for that matter—do poorly, and that reflects a different type of medical education in those countries from the situation in Australia.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The whole point of the AMC exam is to make sure that people who want to practise here are safe. That was illustrated in a recent exam where, I am informed by the Australian Medical Council, a question was asked about what you would do if, 20 minutes after childbirth, a woman had a substantial post&amp;hyphen;partum bleed. Eighty per cent of the people got the answer wrong, and 56 per cent of the people gave an answer that would have killed the woman.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That said, since 1990, 1,600 doctors who trained overseas have passed the AMC exams—about 220 a year—and that is an addition of about 20 per cent of the total number of doctors we graduate ourselves. So the system is a fair one, but I concede that some people have difficulties. In the end, not all medical universities overseas are the same and, as health minister, I have no intention of allowing people who are not properly trained loose on the Australian public.

Firstly, the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs is handling the Willett report, and he is quite adequately doing that at the present moment. Secondly, as it relates to other areas of dumping, you should wait until we respond to the total Willett report.

          —I thank the honourable member for his question. The fact is that a shift away from the government's greenhouse policy would place in jeopardy some very important Australian industries and the jobs that go with them. Apparently those opposite would be quite happy to go down that road, but we have a number of projects which could very well be put at risk: the Korea Zinc refinery in Townsville; the South Australian steel and energy project; the Comalco alumina refinery in Gladstone; the direct reduction iron project in Western Australia; the Chevron gas pipeline from Papua New Guinea; the An Feng/Kingstream steel project at Geraldton in the Leader of the Opposition's home state—he is not too worried about jobs in his own home state—the Bass Strait to Sydney gas pipeline; and three proposed liquid gas developments.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These projects amount to thousands of jobs for Australians, and the fact of the matter is that the opposition has come up with a greenhouse policy that it has stolen from the United States government. They have been over there borrowing ideas from Clinton—or is it from Gore? Perhaps they want to reposition themselves in case they are seen as wanting to imitate the United Kingdom Prime Minister.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The fact of the matter is that you have not said much about the policy. You are probably ashamed of it, because you ought to be. Your position on this immediately calls into question that very dubious document, your policy platform, which states that Labor will `encourage downstream processing of minerals, resources and energy products, and promote the sound development of Australia's coal resources'.

          This sort of goes hand in hand with the very rubbery figures that they have been promoting in relation to what they claim was their effort on greenhouse versus our effort on greenhouse. I find it amazing that they are claiming that $400 million of their expenditure on greenhouse gas has been cut; $300 million of it is related to the defunct LEAP. That is where $300 million of their $400 million was supposed to have been. That program was a labour market program, not a greenhouse program. It was not even a good labour market program! It certainly was not a good greenhouse gas program.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Then you have other tenuous links that you tried to establish, such as cuts to cooperative research centres—you claim. They do not all fall on greenhouse gas emissions efforts by any means. In fact, the reality is a simple one—that we have significantly increased expenditure in the very areas that you are claiming that we have made cuts. What you cannot bring yourselves to acknowledge is that Australia's greenhouse response represents an effective and credible package of measures to address the issue of climate change.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Really, despite the difficulties left by Labor, in budgetary terms, we have put together a very substantial and impressive package which will make a real difference to environmental outcomes and demonstrates a very real commitment ahead of Kyoto. Your greenhouse statement shows quite clearly that you do not care about jobs, you do not care about restoring the economy, you do not care even about the environment.

          —Mr Speaker, I have a rather timely question to you, in view of the latest frivolous answer from the minister. Mr Speaker, one of the measures that was announced by the government in the Prime Minister's greenhouse statement was a commitment to a review of energy efficiency in the government sector, but of course no dollars were provided
          <break page="11326" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           for its funding. Can I raise with you the process that I would ask you to consider about reporting to this parliament about our own parliamentary departments' contribution towards energy efficiency. Might I, in passing, mention that in fact we actually have a very good record of some very significant energy efficiency gains—I think about 40 per cent since the building was first commissioned. Might I ask whether you would consult with the President of the Senate to undertake an annual review of environmental and energy efficiency practices in the parliament and to produce to the parliament—I know sometimes these are mentioned in the annual reports—a specific report on these measures against best practice settings and an external review through an organisation such as the Sustainable Energy Development Authority. Might I specifically ask whether you might consider, as an interim measure, one particular measure: that is, whether it is appropriate to establish a glass and aluminium recycling facility in the cafeteria and coffee shop areas so that members who currently throw away bottles and cans can actually contribute towards energy efficiency practices in the parliament.

          —The charge levelled at the government in this matter of public importance is its failure on industry policy. The consequences have been lower economic growth and fewer jobs. The culprit is the inability of the government and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to show any leadership, not only on this issue but on any other, and the inability of the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) to win an argument unless Labor creates a sense of urgency for him. This matter of public importance is about establishing that sense of urgency on industry policy.

         Where did the problem begin in relation to this? Their election promise 18 months ago was to create 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing by the year 2000. They also promised not to cut research and development funding, not to cut the computer bounty and not to weaken our anti&amp;hyphen;dumping system: all of them core promises, all of them now ditched.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In the first budget we saw a $4 billion cut from industry support, and manufacturing was hit particularly hard. There the programs have been cut to 20 per cent of that which prevailed when Labor was still in office. And this is the sector that they were going to make the only focus for an employment target. I challenge the minister, in his response today, to recommit their target of the 200,000 jobs in manufacturing but, more importantly, to tell us what sort of progress he has made now
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

         We also saw in that budget assistance to exporters declining over the period and we saw research and development assistance cut by $500 million off the amount when Labor was in office. All of these cuts were dressed up by the minister and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in particular as an attack on `business welfare' and that they were covering the rorts. Yet they have produced not one example of a rort associated with the programs. If the minister is still going to resort to this argument today, I challenge him yet again to just give us some examples.

         Your budget has also been responsible, Minister, for reducing economic growth in this country by between half a per cent and three&amp;hyphen;quarters of a per cent. That is why we have unemployment in this nation stuck at 8.4 per cent. It should have been pushing seven per cent. That was what Labor was on track to do as evidenced by the department's own analysis of Labor's program. Since August last year you have destroyed 15,000 full&amp;hyphen;time jobs—not one added but 15,000 lost.

Affectionately known in some quarters as Black Jack, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism has only had success, if we can call it that, at stopping things: for example, the tariff cuts in both auto and TCF. But who led the campaign in these areas? It was Labor in consultation with the industry. They just followed. We had to create the environment in which he got the win. The minister has not created anything new in terms of industry policy initiatives.

         Look at steel. Rod Cameron's research showed that the weakness of the government's response to the closure of BHP's steel plant at Newcastle was a turning point in how this government is perceived in the community. If we cannot keep the steel industry in this country, what industry can we keep, Minister? Yet you indicated again today that, despite the fact that the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) participated in the steel report, it is a good report and that we should read it but that he is not going to act on it. The minister is directly responsible. He was out to lunch at

         The government has failed to meet its election commitment to reduce the time for anti&amp;hyphen;dumping complaints from 245 days to 155 days. Instead the government called for a inquiry, resulting in the Willett report. The government has failed to implement the recommendations of that inquiry and has referred the anti&amp;hyphen;dumping issue to the Productivity Commission. As yet, the terms of reference have not even been announced.

         We have had another fiasco in this country. Because the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) made such a botch of scrapping the DIFF scheme, it counted against us in our international trade relations. He went to China and said to them, as part of the trade&amp;hyphen;off, `We are now prepared to treat you as a market economy.' Despite the fact that we produced evidence that shows there is price fixing going on in China, this government now says China is an open market and that we will accept fixed prices on any product that is alleged to be dumped in determining whether or not to act. This is a sham.

          Minister, you negotiated a $200 million deal with the pharmaceutical industry to replace our factor F scheme. Industry welcomed the announcement, but two months later we had the budget announcement on drug pricing. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has been running away from that ever since because of the attack on him by the member for Dobell (Mr Lee). That has resulted in a twofold negation of the first announcement. Industry was not even consulted. The Prime Minister holds this industry up as the shining light of his new interventionist approach to industry policy, but he never satisfies the claims. He does not know what he is doing and he cannot get his ministers to act in concert. The simplest form of industry policy is to have two departments working together. This minister cannot coordinate a thing with the health minister, and that is why the industry and future investment in that industry is under threat.

Isn't it funny that Monday week is the day after the House gets up? Isn't there a pattern about this? They will only announce things when they are not accountable in the parliament.

          It will not be good enough because this government is not committed to industry policy in this country. This government believes that industry should be cut loose and left on its own to try to get into markets without a partnership with government. It is only Labor that is committed to developing that partnership. We have our policy out there; we announced it last week. It is built around the concept of strategic intervention, partnership, mutual obligation on the part of the corporate citizen in return for assistance and government schemes to commit to targets in exports, jobs, research and development and investment. That is what we need by way of an industry policy, but we will not get it from you.

          Let us look at your performance today in question time. You made a complete goose of yourself yesterday. We thought we would test you out today to see if you could redeem anything. The minister's only answer to the first question was that he anticipates we will have an industry statement next week. The second answer was in response to a question from the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) in relation to the automotive plan and the export scheme. The minister said the scheme is complete, then he said it is well advanced and discussions are continuing. Can you make sense of that gobbledegook? Do you know what you are talking about, Minister? On the question of outworkers, you said Labor did not have a scheme in place, yet the whole question was: why did you cut Labor's scheme and still have not replaced it? How can the Labor government have been doing nothing on this, Minister, if you cancel that which we were doing?

         When the Labor Party fell out of government, a totally disgraced government, they left this government with a deficit of $10 billion, a deficit which they claimed did not exist and which we then had to approach in the oncoming budget. They left an unworkable set of industrial relations laws. They left the lowest business investment on record and the poorest overseas perceptions of our investment climate. Australia's share of world direct investment was four per cent in the 1980s; it is now less than three per cent. That is a reflection of what goes on under the Labor Party.

         Business investment shows strong growth—almost 20 per cent in the year to 30 June, 1997. The Reserve Bank, for the first time in my time as minister, has noted that growth of more than four per cent would not have a bad effect on the balance of payments or interest rates within Australia.

         So I welcome the opportunity, under those circumstances, to look at what we have been doing in relation to industry policy in Australia. For the whole of this year, the government has had a very busy time in terms of addressing all of the matters left by the previous Labor government. At the end of this year, by the time we have the response to the Mortimer inquiry, more will have been done on industry policy than John Button or the Labor Party ever thought of in 13 years.

         I am pleased this MPI was put on this afternoon because it gives me the opportunity to look through the history book to see just what we have done this year. Let me start with the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceutical industry investment program was initiated—a $300 million program, not $200 million as was suggested by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean)—to encourage investment in that area. In a world in which major pharmaceutical companies are increasingly merging, and in which there is more capital investment and a huge development program, it is very important that we keep our eye on research and development in this area. There is no doubt that development in pharmaceuticals does lead to open&amp;hyphen;sided areas of research and development. They are no longer concentrated in one place such as New Jersey. Any country can attract pharmaceutical R&amp;D with the right R&amp;D programs.

          In response to the Productivity Commission's report, we then moved on the automotive industry. Here is another example where nothing much had been altered for many years. The Labor Party program would have run out in the year 2000, and the government decided to act decisively by deciding not to carry on the program. It had led to very significant reductions in employment, and there was huge uncertainty within the industry. They did not know what was going to happen past the year 2000. The government addressed this in its policy statement in June.

         <para first-indent="16">
          A high priority was to ensure that the next round of major investment was carried forward into the auto industry. We did this in no small measure and got commitments from the corporations themselves to investment between now and 2005 of something like $6 billion. All the major corporations that are currently manufacturing here are committed to a new round of model development in this country. Combined with that is the huge spin&amp;hyphen;off that goes to the auto component area, which is very important indeed and certainly world class in itself.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We then moved to addressing the TCF industries. This was a very difficult one indeed because of the regionality of those industries, the high levels of unemployment and because investment in that area is hard to come by. Nevertheless, in September we announced a comprehensive package in response to the Productivity Commission report. The expectations are that we will get $400 million worth of new investment between now and the year 2000 on a per annum basis. The certainty corporations get from that will enable them to develop investment programs, to get up new product and to carry out whatever amalgamations may be necessary in the future. It was very important, when we looked at what the right response would be on the TCF and auto industries, that we looked to the investment, the employment side of it—

          I want to tell the House about the three goals which all of these answers were directed towards. Firstly, there is investment. We will not get employment growth in Australia, and we will not have Australia in the competitive position we want it to be in, unless we attract significant investment to this nation. That must be the hallmark of what we want to see in the next few years.

          To do that we firstly addressed the fundamentals in the budget in terms of the debt and the question of industrial relations and all areas of industry. We are now moving to taxation reform. All of these will indicate the positive nature of Australia for investment in the future. When you look at the last five years you will see that $40 billion of foreign investment has gone into South-East Asia. All of it has swum past Australia. Why? Because we have not been a competitive nation to attract that investment. Governments of the day have not gone out there and sold the story of what we have here. This government will address that problem, because without adequate investment you will not have the necessary record to build on.

We have seen the contemptuous way he has treated the work of the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) in terms of producing a report that the government is not going to bring on to debate on this critical issue.

Legislation has been introduced into the House to unravel the mess caused when the government agreed to treat some market goods from China as being sourced from a free market.

           —Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Mortimer stressed, as has the minister, the importance of investment. In looking at the position the government takes on investment, I quote a recent report prepared by the Metal Trades Industry Association that quotes Chris Dixon, the managing director of a company called Containers Packaging. He says:

         <para font-size="-=2">
          Our experience in investing overseas really makes us question Australia's whole process for winning and assisting the establishment of new investment. We've just set up a new plant in Virginia—the speed of approvals, the level of incentives and the overall efficiency of the process far outclassed anything we've experienced in Australia.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          It gives me no pleasure at all to read that sort of comment in the Australian parliament, but that is what important Australian companies and important Australian industry associations are saying about the way in which this government presently operates in terms of facilitating investment.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I have referred to the importance of creating investment and the decisions that have been taken in the TCF and auto industries, but there are a whole range of other areas in
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           which Labor is committed to developing strategic action plans: pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, medical and scientific instruments, information technology, telecommunications, metal production and fabrication, advanced manufacturing technology, shipbuilding, resource processing and environmental technology. These are crucial industries of the future that we do not hear anything about from this government. What we do hear, however, is the government talking up the possibility of a race based election. If one wanted to think of a scenario that is going to be massively damaging to this country in terms of its capacity to attract overseas investment, if one wanted to see something that damaged the social and economic stability of this country even more, one would have to go a long way to beat a government that is talking up the prospect of a double dissolution election on race issues.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The minister also talked about innovation, as of course does the Mortimer report. The Melbourne Centre for Strategic Economic Studies makes it quite clear that Australia has strong competitive strengths in R&amp;D. It is a much cheaper place to do R&amp;D than places like Japan and Germany. Yet industrial research and development over the next two years is going to fall from $820 million to $286 million. This is at a time when the best part of $1 billion is being cut out of this nation's higher education budget, which decreases our capacity to sustain the clever nation that is required to create that innovation.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In terms of exports, which is another important area the minister and Mortimer refer to, we have a situation where the government is chopping back the export market development grants. It is clearly failing to understand the importance of setting a direction and creating the partnerships that are needed to ensure successful manufacturing exports. Manufacturing, particularly elaborately transformed manufactures, is the fastest growing area of international trade. The government is failing in all these areas.

         The wording of this matter of public importance we are debating here today is quite bizarre. We do have a comprehensive policy.

          this year as an empty suit, someone who will argue anything. That just about sums it up in this country. Everything they did over the last 13 years was anti-business. They had no more damaging a policy than the one for interest rates. They were over 20 per cent, record levels for record periods of time leading to record bankruptcies and enormous hardships, the legacy of which we are still feeling in small and large business today. Since we have been in power—18 or 20 months—there have been five cuts in interest rates, and they are down to record low levels.

         On top of that, they had record debt. Their overseas debt when they were in power rose from $23 billion, which was high enough, to over $180 billion because business in this country, starved of capital, was forced to borrow offshore. As we heard the Treasurer (Mr Costello) tell the House this week, in the last five years they were in power, the Commonwealth debt rose from $16 billion to in excess of $90 billion with no plan to stabilise that debt at all, let alone pay it back—a shocking indictment. We are left with the legacy of paying the interest on that—$9.4 billion of interest every year.

         As the Treasurer said, if we did not have to pay off Labor's interest bill which they left us, we could abolish payroll tax in this country—and you could imagine what that would do for industry, how it would stimulate it. We could abolish the fuel excise. The people of Australia could be buying their petrol and diesel for 40c a litre if we did not have to pay the interest debt that Labor left us, most of which goes to overseas countries. Alternatively, we could halve the company tax in this country. That, more than anything else, would give industry in this country a tremendous boost.

          Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Amendment Bill 1997
         </xref>
         amends the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994 in order to implement refinements to the administration of that act to rectify certain problems identified during its initial implementation. The Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act gives effect to Australia's obligations as a party to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction, usually referred to as the Chemical Weapons Convention. The convention bans the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention, transfer and use of chemical weapons and provides for the destruction of all existing stocks of chemical weapons.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Australia has long supported the Chemical Weapons Convention as a key international instrument in the fight against the spread of weapons of mass destruction and was the sixth country to ratify it on 6 May 1994, following the passage of the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act three months earlier. Three years later, on 29 April of this year, the convention entered into force and less than 27 days later Australia's initial declarations were submitted to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Chemical Weapons Convention requires Australia to make regular declarations concerning activities with chemicals listed in its schedules and activities producing discrete organic chemicals. The Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act allows the Chemical Weapons Convention Office in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to collect, through a system of permits and notifications, from chemical facility operators the information required to compile these declarations. National inspectors appointed under the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act have the power to inspect chemical facilities to ensure compliance with obligations imposed by the act. Certain facilities are also subject to

          inspection by the Technical Secretariat of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.

         The task of preparing Australia's initial declarations has highlighted some aspects of the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act, which needs to be refined in order to simplify its overall administration, to promote compliance with it and to ensure more effective fulfilment of Australia's commitments under the Chemical Weapons Convention.

        <para first-indent="16">
         A key element of this amending bill is the provision it makes to automate the annual permit renewal process in the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act. This will simplify the compliance obligations for each company or organisation requiring a permit, but maintain the annual reporting cycle that is needed to fulfil our convention obligations. Simplification of compliance obligations should reduce the possibility of inadvertent breach of the act. It will also provide for continuity in the relationship of each permit holder with the Chemical Weapons Convention Office.

         This bill also provides for clarifications of some outstanding technical issues to be implemented through regulations under the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act. The Chemical Weapons Convention is a complex instrument and a number of technical issues related to its implementation remain unresolved internationally. Some of these issues bear directly on which industrial facilities should be subject to declaration and inspection requirements. Understandings clarifying these issues are expected to be reached by the organs of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.

         The bill also includes amendments which refine its secrecy provisions, streamline certain administrative procedures and provide for applications, notices or reports to be made by way of electronic lodgment.

          —I am continuing my remarks on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill, the government's proposal for a common youth allowance. During the few minutes I had available to me last week, I took the opportunity to outline the basis of the legislation and what it attempts to accomplish. I had then moved on to discuss a recent report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training which is entitled
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Youth employment: a working solution
          </emphasis>
          .

        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The committee took some 15 months to interview and consider submissions from employers all over Australia—from employer bodies, from educational institutions, from educationalists, from parents, from business people, from ANTA and from representative bodies of the education and training industry itself. We held forums where we interviewed 303 young people—themselves involved in secondary education—who are looking forward to some future and to getting a job.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the central themes of the common youth allowance is that we want young people to remain in formal education and/or training for as long as possible. There is a very good reason for that: Australia has an unacceptably high rate of youth unemployment. This report dealt with the other side of that equation—that is, youth employment, not unemployment—but there is no doubt that the two are interrelated.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We would wish that, when every young person has received at least an initial education—in terms of literacy and numeracy, in terms of understanding society and in terms of learning how to be able to learn again in the future—they be given the opportunity to continue with that education through training courses at our institutes of TAFE or with private training providers to obtain specific
         <break page="11341" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          skills for doing specific kinds of jobs in specific industries, or that they be given the opportunity to go on to university and to obtain a more broad based and higher level qualification which would prepare them either for some specific career or for a broad based generalist career.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is true that entry level jobs in Australia for young people have shrunk, particularly over the last decade. One of the reasons for that is that unskilled jobs have fast been disappearing from the Australian landscape. It is appropriate that young people obtain the right kinds of skills and education before they go out to enter the formal job market itself. Not only that; they also need to approach that job market with the right kinds of attitudes.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One common theme amongst the over 300 young people with whom we discussed these issues in great detail was that, if you want a job, there are jobs available. It did not necessarily mean, because they were young and they were still in secondary school, a full-time job or exactly the job that they wanted. But if you wanted to work, you had the right attitude to work, you could speak, you could write and you could read, then there were jobs available and you could get a job. It might not be exactly what you want: it might be clerking in Woolies or in Coles; it might be cleaning up in a hairdressers' salon; or it might be a skilled job at one of the McDonald's outlets—but, nonetheless, a job. I was highly impressed by the attitude of the young people that we talked to throughout Australia. We talked with young people not only in the capital cities but also in the regions and in the outback—indeed, all over the country. I was very impressive by their attitude to work.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Some of the recommendations that we made are perhaps appropriate to this debate on the common youth allowance. The first recommendation concerns the government's funding of labour market programs. That includes those programs which, one way or another, help find jobs for young people and pay for them to be in employment because, for some reason, they have either missed out on part of their education or they have not been able to find work for whatever reason. When labour
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          market programs are being developed, the government should favour programs which address attitudinal and other barriers to learning and employment in individuals. That is code for saying that labour market programs need to address pre&amp;hyphen;employment training. One thing that employers all over the country told us is that the first thing they look for in an individual they employ is attitude. The second, particularly with young people, is literacy and numeracy. The third, way down the list, is specific skills for the job.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is interesting that we had some debate in Victoria recently about the acceptance by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) of a training program for young people in school at the McDonald's training facility in Melbourne. Some of the trendies thought that was pretty terrible, because they seemed to hate McDonald's. The committee heard over and over that where an employer had a short list of potential young employees, if one of those individuals had worked at McDonald's, the chances of that individual obtaining a full-time job were greater than they were for any of the others. Why is that? Because McDonald's gives young people personal skills and attitudes, such as how to show up for work on time, how to work with colleagues cooperatively, how to approach customers with a smile and willing service, how to produce high quality work quickly and how to be responsive to your employer's needs and the clients' needs, the ones who come in to purchase. Those attitudinal skills are highly important.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another recommendation the committee made is that literacy and numeracy are of critical importance to our young people. That is another good reason for young people to stay in school. It is also a good reason for us to do a much better job in basic literacy and numeracy teaching in the very early, formative years of primary school, which are perhaps grades 1, 2 and 3. It has been recognised nationally, and absolutely accepted by everyone in the business, that if a young person has not achieved satisfactory levels of proficiency in reading, writing and maths by the time they reach age 7 or grade 3, the
         <break page="11342" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          chances of them being kept behind in their studies, ultimately failing and winding up on the dole scrap heap, in correctional institutions or on the streets or whatever are enhanced immensely.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We are saying that if we fail to teach any young child to read, write, count, add, multiply and divide, we have failed that child absolutely. Our recommendation is that literacy and numeracy teaching needs to be comprehensive, which means that you need to go about it every day in the early years of primary school. If that means it displaces some of the other curricula that has been crowded into primary schools, so be it; let us be done with the other curricula. There is also the quaint but important recommendation that you teach literacy in the morning, not in the afternoon after lunch when the children are sleepy and less attentive. It is the most important grounding element of their entire education program. Fancy trying to study Australian history if you cannot read. It is not difficult; it is impossible.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The committee recommended another very innovative device that would go with the common youth allowance. The committee recommended that the government institute a national youth guarantee, which entitles every Australian under 21 who has not attained year 12 at school to a funded place at a high school, TAFE or a recognised training provider to complete their year 12 education or its equivalent. As I recall, the common youth allowance says that if you leave school before you are 17, the dole is no longer available. You will need to stay in school or in training.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Commonwealth, through the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation and other programs with ANTA and the state, is working very hard to try to increase the availability of skills training in our secondary schools. That includes apprenticeship training or other kinds of skills training that will help lead young people into jobs or, if they do well enough in that extra training, get themselves back in shape to be able to study again, and then perhaps go on to TAFE courses or university at a later time. The committee believed it is important that if young people leave school early and find they need further
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          training, we say to them, `Look, as long as you undertake this work, by the time you are 21 we guarantee that you can have a funded place at TAFE, with a private training provider or back at school to get the equivalent of a year 12 education for yourself. This will help you to ultimately find a job and live a rewarding, self-satisfying and self-fulfilled life.'
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The committee made a number of recommendations regarding the standards of the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation and the portability of training outcomes. In this way, young people who take a course in one location can take that qualification to another state or territory and have it recognised. People will then not look askance at the piece of paper and say, `You're from Victoria and I'm in New South Wales, so we will not consider that piece of paper. You will have to start all over again.'
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another important issue that teachers tell us about is that, for some young people in secondary school, by the time they are in year 9 or year 10, the teachers know that they are likely to leave school without finishing. New programs are being developed—and the Commonwealth is beginning to fund some of those programs—to try to retain those young people who are likely to leave school without completing a year 12 qualification, with programs which are different, which will excite their imagination, keep them interested in the learning experience, and keep them in touch with formal education.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Most of those programs involve some experience with real work. The student might spend one or two days a week in a real job, and the rest of the time in formal training mode within the high school. The formal training time should also, in my view, include attitudinal and pre&amp;hyphen;employment type training. At least one hour a week should be devoted to trying to impart work skills to these young people who do not have work and real life experience—whose parents may not work, and whose grandparents may have never had a job—and to teach them about the things that employers are looking for so that they can successfully take their place in the employment market.
        </para>
        <break page="11343" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          If those kinds of programs are successful, then we will not need the common youth allowance, except to the extent that it replaces Austudy. Wouldn't it be a fantastic day if the common youth allowance were about helping students with their living expenses while they are studying? That would be a terrific day, because then we would not have high youth unemployment. We would not be destroying young lives. We would not be creating a situation where future generations of young people will not thank us because they will not have the work ethic at all.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The committee made a series of recommendations regarding a national youth wage. We said that it is time to do something radical, something different. While we made substantial recommendations regarding curriculum advice, which I think are perhaps the most important recommendations we made, nonetheless, it is clear that, with youth unemployment stuck at between 25 and 30 per cent, we need to do something radical. The coalition members of the committee believe that we ought to take youth wages out of the hands of the tribunals. We ought to take them away from the control of the unions, and we ought, by statute, to establish a system for a national minimum youth wage.

         To some extent, this bill tries to go to the heart of that problem. Recent statistics in the Wide Bay&amp;hyphen;Burnett area where I come from show that, with 36.6 per cent of young unemployed—that is an extraordinarily high and unacceptable figure—school leavers have never had more pressure on them to find a job which will lead them to a satisfying career. From their point of view, things look bleak unless they are better equipped.

        <para first-indent="16">
         With such high unemployment in the area, there is an added incentive for young people to drop their bundle and, in doing so, drop out of school. Research shows that there was strong school retention growth during the 1980s—the percentage had risen to 77 per cent by 1992—but that last year it started to drop away again, and it was down to 71 per cent. The male dropout rate was higher than the female rate.

         A second reason for wanting to keep young people at school and in training is not just to keep them off the street, as the common idiom has it, but to keep them focused and motivated so that, when regions like mine go through tough times, the young people are given skills with which to advance themselves when better opportunities arrive.

         If you provide unemployment benefits at a higher rate than Austudy, young people are not going to want to continue their studies or further training if there is some incentive for them to drop out or if they are not achieving well at school. The students' view often is that they do not think they will get a job anyway, so why bother studying or training. Young people need skills such as computer

         Many of these courses today are delivered either at a school or at a TAFE. Many schools are now taking up these school to work opportunities. In my electorate, the first of which came from Toolooa High School in Gladstone, we even have school to apprenticeship programs. But, if you do not keep students at school for grades 11 and 12, they are never going to get that opportunity. When we were young people—there are many people of my age group in this parliament—getting a job was not a problem. Today, young people are expected to have many more skills.

         Why are we replacing Austudy and unemployment benefits with a youth allowance? The government recognised there is an increasing number of young people who do not go from school straight to full&amp;hyphen;time work. Young people need to be able to make key decisions about education, training and employment without the pressure of losing financial support. Young people should complete or further their education and this bill removes the incentive to leave education early or to choose unemployment over education and training. Those young people whose circumstances change slightly will no longer have payments cancelled, thus giving them the flexibility in training and looking for work. For example, an unemployed person who undertakes training will not be required to switch to Austudy for short periods, nor will a student who drops a subject lose their entitlement altogether.

         This legislation also encourages those families who can to provide support to their children until they reach the age of financial independence. The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has said this legislation tries to defy diversity. I disagree. The legislation recognises the diversity of individuals more than the current legislation. Many young people do not find full&amp;hyphen;time work straightaway; they undergo training, part&amp;hyphen;time work and more training until they find a full&amp;hyphen;time job. This legislation

Why should someone be paid more for looking for work than a person who is studying? That seems to me to be illogical. This is a question many young constituents and parents often ask me. I put it to the member for Werriwa: what makes looking for work more important in terms of the amount of payment than studying or training or, to put it another way, investing in your own future?

         Keeping young people at school at 16, 17 and 18 years of age, or in training, is not a bad thing. We need to give children time to plan and to organise their lives. They need to know how to spell and to write a good letter. They need to know a bit about the world, about economics, about history, about how Australian government works, and so on. They need to know a lot about many things. While some of this knowledge is gained on the job, I could not employ a person who did not have at least some experience in computer skills and customer service. I think that is one of the reasons that at times over the years we have suggested in this place that perhaps we should have juniors in our office, but successive governments have not agreed to that. I think part of the reason for that is that, for young people to participate effectively in an electorate office, they must have those basic skills.

         The question that follows from this is: who benefits from this legislation? First and foremost, the whole community will benefit, including taxpayers. Seventy thousand young people who are studying or training and living away from home will get rent assistance. The average will be $31.30 a fortnight. Also, 41,200 students will benefit from the abolition of the $1,000 per annum Austudy minimum requirement. These aspects seem to have been lost on the member for Jagajaga. That does not bother me much because I know a few of my constituents will appreciate receiving even a few dollars a week to send their children to school or to university.

         Labor has forgotten how hard and how expensive it is to raise a family.

         Finally, looking over the whole ambit of this problem, we need to get those young people in the age group of 16 to 18 years of age better equipped to compete in a much more demanding work force. On all the inquiries I have been on with the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training that have involved young people and the suitability for education, one thing has come through clearly: disadvantage can be linked to literacy and numeracy, or literacy and numeracy can be linked to disadvantage. The experts disagree with comes first, the chicken or the egg in that instance. That there is a correlation between the two things is beyond any doubt. If we extrapolate from the young people that the member for La Trobe talked about at the very critical ages of their school development out to the 16&amp;hyphen; to 18&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds, it follows that if they are going to take advantage of the new programs, the new computer skills, the school to work opportunities, the TAFE opportunities, the university opportunities that are folding out before Australians, then there must be encouragement and support. That can be found in this youth allowance.

         The honourable member for Jagajaga expresses concern about the extension of the parent means test under the youth allowance to unemployed customers aged 18 to 20. However, she fails to explain why it is acceptable to means test Austudy recipients but not their peers who may be unemployed. This inconsistent treatment sends the wrong message to young people that they may be better off on the dole than in education or training. For example, in a family on $30,000 per annum with an unemployed child and a student child, both aged over 18, while the student would be paid $111.60 per fortnight, the unemployed sibling would be paid $174.80 per fortnight. That difference of almost $60 a fortnight could be a persuasive argument against taking up education or training opportunities despite the obvious longer term benefits to the young person of doing so.

         Two of the three amendments remove from the bill the authority for and all references to the secretary to the Department of Social Security being able to approve or not approve courses of education or study for the purposes of the new youth allowance. This power is to rest solely with the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. The third amendment is a technical amendment to better express the fact that the maximum age for youth allowance for a person undertaking full&amp;hyphen;time study is 25 years.

          —The opposition is not inclined to oppose any of the three amendments. I will make some brief observations about them. The first is that if Minister Kemp wishes to take away from the Secretary to the Department of Social Security the approval for courses of education for the purposes of the youth allowance, the opposition will not stand in his way, although I do suggest that the minister will be creating somewhat of a rod for his back. We will be following with great interest the sort of approval and disapproval that he brings to these particular matters.

         I can only join with his Victorian Liberal colleagues in suggesting that, contrary to 20 or 30 years of public rhetoric, he is in fact one of the great centralists of federal government and the federal parliament. I am told that, in the Victorian Liberal Party, to call him a centralist is the greatest insult that can be levelled. I am sure to be called a centrist or a centralist is an insult in the terms and conditions of the Victorian Liberal Party.

         The third provision concerns the maximum age requirements for youth allowance. The amendment provides that a person simply has to be undertaking full&amp;hyphen;time study and have turned 25 to reach the maximum age. It is poor indeed for the government to be moving amendments at this late stage which deal with fundamental questions like the maximum age for qualifying for the youth allowance. This is sloppy drafting which in fact is typical of the whole bill, and the opposition expects
         <break page="11350" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

          . The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) is currently supporting our legislation. His support for unconscionable conduct being included in the bill is unchanged. The member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) said that the opposition would try to amend the legislation to remove unconscionable conduct from the bill.

         After 13 years in government, 17 reports and reviews on fair trading, the ALP have not learned any lessons about small business. There is a history of procrastination, reports, reviews, white papers, et cetera, but they still have not learned that small business wants an end to uncertainty. This bill is about a new deal and a fair deal, which is what small business wants.

         The evidence presented to the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology inquiry further exposed the abuse of market power and unfair conduct in commercial transactions. The intent of the committee and the government was to make changes to induce behavioural change on the part of big business towards small business.

          introduce some changes. There has been an ongoing debate on the Trade Practices Act for something approaching 20 years. By way of confirming that I am not overly regulatory, the other major inquiry I did was in 1988 in the Victorian state parliament, an inquiry into `electricity supply and demand in Victoria beyond the 1990s'. That led to deregulation of the whole electricity industry in Victoria and was the forerunner to the establishment of the national south&amp;hyphen;east power grid in Australia.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I want to come back to the unconscionable conduct provisions and talk about the changes to the Trade Practices Act. The government has decided to establish a new small business provision in that act, section 51AC, that builds on well understood consumer protections against unconscionable conduct to small businesses and provides further protections against the business conduct issues identified by the standing committee. It is based on established legal doctrine in that there is already a body of case law on the protections available to consumers against unconscionable conduct. The approach will also provide small businesses with the protections they need against a range of unfair business practices.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The new small business provision is designed to induce behavioural change in dealings between large and small business and ensure the commercial dealings are carried out on a more equitable basis. It balances the need for fair conduct in commercial relations with the need to maintain an open market and does this without compromising the basic principles of contractual relations and commercial risk which remain at the core of our free enterprise economy. A bargain or commercial transaction will be deemed to be against conscience where one party is at a special disadvantage and the other party unconscientiously or without conscience takes advantage of the opportunity thus placed in their hands.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The key is still that a party has to be in a position of special disadvantage, so the new amendment will not provide relief simply because there is some difference in the bargaining power of the parties. The new legisla
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          tion goes beyond this base point, however. Our proposed section 51AC suggests the court must take a number of items into account when hearing a case of unconscionable conduct against the small business. Many of these items matched those proposed by the fair trading committee report in its suggested prohibition on unfair conduct.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In fact, our provision in the government's bill is an amalgam of the factors the court may have regard to in the existing consumer provision with the final five factors of the committee's recommendations. It is set out in the bill and it goes through all of the recommendations that were contained in recommendation 6.1 of the committee's report. Clearly, these items, as spelt out in proposed subsection 51AA(2)(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k) and (l), are the additional provisions which the court may take into consideration in deciding unconscionable conduct.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Clearly, all of those items go to the heart of the issues raised by the committee. One of the important things that I do want to mention about the work of that committee is the way the committee operated. I believe that one of the major reasons for the success of the committee in developing that report was the composition, the membership, of the committee. They had extensive experience in business both large and small but no formal legal qualifications. That was important. None of the members of that committee—I took the opportunity to check this—from either side of the House had any formal qualifications in law. So there was a very clear intent by the committee—and they did an excellent job on this report—for the recommendations to be formulated as clear statements of principle rather than formal legalese.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This led to the opportunity for the bill to be introduced into the House, which makes it very clear that recommendation 6.1 has been adopted with all of those enumerated factors which I went through included in it. An important adjunct to the inquiry that we conducted is the fact that the government has taken all of those things into consideration without destroying the intent of the committee.

          The government's response to those recommendations subsequent to the tabling of that report included good legal advice. I wanted to mention a couple of other issues as well which relate to the matter that I just raised—that is, the government's decision to establish a new small business provision, proposed section 51AC, in the Trade Practices Act.

          This particular matter had a very long history and went right back to the days of Charlie Blunt. Then there was the Beddall report and the Schacht report. In all, over the time of the previous government there were 17 matters of inquiry and no action for small business. Small business were very frustrated by the inaction of the previous government.

          I have taken great satisfaction from being able to work with the members of that committee. They were very clear on what their intent would be. I want to particularly mention them: the members for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), Petrie (Ms Gambaro), Lowe (Mr Zammit), Canning (Mrs Johnston), McEwen (Mrs Bailey), Mallee (Mr Forrest), Aston (Mr Nugent), Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin), Scullin (Mr Jenkins), Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), Rankin (Mr Beddall), Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) and Corio (Mr O'Connor).

          In conclusion, I want to place on record my thanks to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith). It is great to have a government which has small business representation in the cabinet. That has been very well received by the small business community in Australia. He is doing an excellent job. I compliment him for his open-minded approach to what appeared initially to be a very difficult task. No doubt with that open&amp;hyphen;minded approach we were able to introduce this measure which constitutes this legislation. It has been, as I indicated to the House, subject to ongoing debate for more than 20 years.

          and the amendment, I should firstly lay a few ghosts to rest. The suggestion has been coming through over and over that there were 17 reports under the previous government and that nothing was done. The Chairman of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), knows that is not true. He is very aware of that. In fact, the report goes through a lot of the changes that were made. He also quite rightly paid tribute to a number committee members who worked quite hard on this inquiry, and I agree with him on that. I note that my colleague the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) is on the speakers list. He is now becoming quite famous as the fatuous phantom from Paterson—fatuous because he trivialises most things he touches and phantom because he does not come to committee meetings. He attended one hearing. Of all the hearings we had, he came to one only because it was held in Canberra. If you look at his record, you will see that between September last year and February this year he did not come to one meeting at all. He missed virtually all the inquiries, yet he talks about what a great report the committee he is a part of produced. Phantom because he does not turn up; fatuous because he trivialises everything he touches. The fatuous phantom will be speaking later in the debate and we look forward to his comments.

         Those of us in the previous government who were involved in the inquiry in 1989-90 attempted to warn current government members what to watch out for. One of the things to watch out for was the word `unconscionable'; we had been got by it before. As the chairman of the committee well knows, the recommendations of the previous report, the
         <break page="11353" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Beddall report, were not adopted but they were modified. The spirit was picked up, as we were advised by the then bureaucracy.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What was asked for was not provided. What was provided was a new section on unconscionable conduct. Up until now, as the report demonstrates, that has not been able to be used. The committee very carefully, after a lot of advice and consultation, shifted to `unfair' because `unconscionable' does not work. It is a bit rich for the chairman to now tell us that `unconscionable' is okay. After going through all the discussions on that word, he knew that the bipartisan agreement was that `unconscionable' was not a goer. You have been tripped up by the bureaucracy again. And you have the gall to come in here and talk about previous governments and previous reports.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That report, which was a good report, had been gutted with your approval. Do not betray your own report. We were ignorant in 1996; we did not realise the implications of it. We are not lawyers and were not able to provide a legal response to it. We were advised that the word `unconscionable' was applicable when, in hindsight, it is clear that it was not and will not be in the future. The government's shifting of that one word is absolutely critical, as is the amendment to reinsert it. The adoption of the committee's report—the report which the chairman oversaw and spoke in favour of in the parliament when he introduced it back in May—is important.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is also important to go to the next step and to understand a couple of things. Firstly, the nature of business has been changing dramatically in Australia and in various parts of the world. Governments and communities have responded in different ways, as have the states. We have seen the contraction of the traditional small corner store and the small retailer. Corner stores are almost a thing of the past. The advent of shopping centres has been one part of it, but more importantly there has been a taking over by large chains of the areas of business that were normally supplied by smaller operators.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         An example is the expansion of Woolworths, Coles, Franklins, Bi-Lo, Jewel and the few others expanding into bakery products, confectionery and all kinds of things and
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          opening, in some cases, for 24 hours a day seven days a week. That is changing the nature of business entirely and causing major problems, which is one of the reasons why the report recommended a national code of tenancy. Part of all of this is to do with who can sell what in what set&amp;hyphen;up. Take, for example, a butcher in a shopping centre who discovers, out of nowhere, that Woolworths is suddenly selling meat, as is Coles, in the same centre. What is more, they are open 24 hours a day and selling it for less than he can buy it for.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In a similar situation, a shop that sells cigarettes and gifts finds that the Coles supermarket in the centre sells cigarettes at a lower price than it pays the suppliers, the manufacturers. In fact, in that one centre at Garden City at Kotara in Newcastle not only did that occur but also the shopping centre management allowed in a cut price cigarette retailer. So you had what was a reasonable business at one stage being cannibalised by the introduction of a competitor on a nation&amp;hyphen;wide franchise buying at nation&amp;hyphen;wide levels at a much better buying price than a sole trader. Subsequently, and partly in parallel, the chains operating in the same centre were selling at a lower price as well. So what has happened to that business? That business has suffered grievously. That is the kind of change that is occurring.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         With the report and the inquiry, we were trying to change the rules a bit to ensure that the giants—whether they be the giant chains or the giant managers such as Lend Lease, Westfield or AMP—were not simply consuming the small traders. `Consuming' is a very appropriate word. It is not an exaggeration. In the last 10 years we have seen the conversion of goodwill into rent. It was put to us very clearly that a business now has a business for as long as the lease lasts. When the lease is finished, you are finished. That was made absolutely clear during the inquiry.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In many cases people have paid good money for a business which on the surface was excellent only to find out that after the two&amp;hyphen;, three&amp;hyphen; or four&amp;hyphen;year lease was up for renewal, either they have had to pay higher rent, or rent which is not affordable, or they
         <break page="11354" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          have had to go. Cases have been brought to us. One example was given to us where a tenant attempted to sell the business and the buyer disappeared, but the buyer came back after they closed and went into that centre. We are seeing a conversion of what was goodwill into rent. The ratio of rent to turnover is increasing, and the figures on that are fairly evident. It may vary from centre to centre, but the overall trend is very clear.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Within that, we are also seeing a potential fraudulence in the value of these centres. Again, I do not say that lightly either. If we go to the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Hansard
         </emphasis>
         and look at the evidence of the Australian Institute of Business Brokers and the Institute of Valuers, we see that, in both cases when asked if centres were overvalued, the answers were yes. In fact, the Institute of Valuers was asked, `What's going to happen? What will be the result?' The answer was, `Armageddon.' In other words, disaster.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There has been a factoring in of rents at the surface level, at the gross level, into the valuation of the centres. It is distorting quite seriously the actual value, which in turn is putting more pressure on centre managers and owners to extract more and more rent. On the one hand, we are seeing the chains saying, `Let us sell what we like for as long as we like and for as many hours of the day we want or else we will go and open our own centres.' On the other hand, we have clauses and turnover figures which demand ever increasing profitability out of the same centre.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For example, in Charlestown Square at Newcastle, we have a situation where the centre management and a number of the tenants are now locked in combat in the courts, would you believe. Tenants are paying lawyers to fight their landlord. There are a few examples of this, but perhaps the most controversial example is the attempt to convert part of what would be the public space, the open space, in a centre into a coffee lounge or eating area.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In these centres, the open space, the amount of free space in which people can congregate, walk, and feel some sense of spaciousness, is now being converted into more and more rentable space. The Lake Macquarie council
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          rejected that application for 70&amp;hyphen;square metres, so Lend Lease appealed to the land and environment court. In the mediation process the council offered a smaller figure of 50&amp;hyphen;square metres. It was trying to seek a solution. That has been rejected by Lend Lease and they are back in court next week, I think.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Here we have the situation where tenants are paying lawyers to represent them against landlords. What kind of business are we in? What kind of mentality is it when people who have major investments for themselves and their families in these centres, and whose future depends on the success of the centres, are being forced into confrontation and legal battle with giants like Lend Lease? This did not happen last year. The events I am talking about now did not happen last year, before the inquiry, during the inquiry or four years ago. They are happening right now. Next week they will appear before an arbitrator in the land and environment court to make a judgment. The landlord versus the tenants—no-one wins.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are other parts that concern me, and this is why I think these amendments are so important. It is important that there is a national code of tenancy. It is important that there are national standards because, quite frankly, in many cases the landlords are bigger than the states. The variations from state to state have always been a problem and always will be. It will be very difficult to get a uniform code across the country. We need to have a uniform code. We are, after all, one country, not eight.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The need for a national code was canvassed strongly in the report and was adopted unanimously. The fact that the government is not supporting it is a grievous weakness on its part. It has been rolled by the big end of town. The government that supports small business has been rolled by the big end of town by that part of the report, and for many people that is the only part. For many people out there, the tenancy laws are the only things that they have. That is all there is. All the rest is for nought. If the landlord can dictate the terms and cannot be trusted, then all the rest is worthless.
        </para>
        <break page="11355" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          In that context I have to explain that, having now spent quite a lot of time talking with landlords and with tenants, I no longer have confidence in the management of the centres that I represent. I believe I have been misled in those situations and I believe that the tenants are not getting a fair go. I personally cannot act on their behalf unless there are laws made by this parliament to empower me and my colleagues. All of us need a federal code and federal laws so that we can make representations to federal bodies and to federal ministers. I am sick and tired of being helpless, watching things happen which are unjust and having no-one to turn to because there are no laws covering it at this level.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          An example of what is occurring right now happened in recent weeks. A particular tenant in Charlestown was having difficulty. The landlord was aware of that back in February or March this year. They spent a lot of time trying to improve that business and worked very hard at it. It was quite coincidental, but within a matter of days that tenant was visited by a prospective buyer who told him and his partner that, if he waited a fortnight, he would get the business for nothing, and that his fixtures and fittings were worth only $1,000—that was all he would get for them. He also had a letter from the landlord terminating his lease and a letter from his major supplier issuing a summons for unpaid accounts. So within days he had three major events.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I have talked to the landlord and I have talked to his major supplier and I accept that these things may have been coincidental. But I do not accept that, between May and now, when both the landlord and the tenant were trying to get that business to become successful, there were liabilities built up. When the tenant moved out, he gave a fortnight's notice, which was incorrect. The notice was extended for four or five days, almost a week, and they were charged an extra $3,000 for those days.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Having been in partnership since May, which we were all applauding, guess who pays the bill? The tenant was slugged for the whole lot. Those partners have no money. They have gone broke. They have had to walk out. But the landlord was getting a new
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           tenant instantly, therefore he was not suffering. The whole months of experiment and testing were then put down to the tenant alone.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          When the tenant put to his various creditors a repayment schedule offering particular cents in the dollar, having lost a lot of money himself in the meantime, guess who did not agree? The landlord. That means that the landlord, who has control, effectively has the potential to bankrupt these people. And for what? They have already lost their shirts. These are people with some pride and some dignity. They have been in a business and it failed. They have been punished more than enough.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          What did the landlord say to me? He said, `I have got a duty to my trust holders.' I said, `Your trust holders have investments in an organisation which is almost certainly overvalued. What are you doing about that?' The same management had put to me some weeks back that they would be sensitive to these people's misfortune and that they were very mindful of the circumstances. Yes, their actions were pre&amp;hyphen;emptory in the way it had been terminated and they had done things which could have been done better, if I can put it that way. When the departure occurred, the bill turned up for the full amount. Now they are settling for 50 per cent. These people have nothing.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The parliament may well hear some more about those matters because, between now and when this bill finally gets dealt with, we will see case after case brought forward—whether it be in Charlestown Square, Garden City or another centre in Australia. I am encouraging all my colleagues to keep this in mind because tenancy laws are fundamental.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This government cannot walk away from the most important part of the report. The bulk of the submissions were from tenants. The bulk of witnesses were tenants in centres. The bulk of the heartbreak was suffered by tenants. The bulk of the problems in small business that we were exposed to were to do with the need for a national tenancy code.

           examples. We put in place what the bureaucracy and the big end of town said would work. The report proves that it does not work. So what is the government doing? It is putting back unconscionable conduct, knocking out unfair trading from the report and not adopting a national tenancy code. Speaker after speaker has said how the report is being adopted in full. That is misleading—even more, it is deceitful. The report is not being adopted; bits of it are. The key part is not.

They are entitled to a uniform national system because they are all Australians. I am optimistic that the Senate will agree with us and adopt the report in full. Then the onus will be on those government members to come on board and support their own report. It was a good report. Let us not undo the good work by gutting it the way the minister has. If it is fully adopted, it will work. If it is only partly adopted, this battle and these troubles will go on and on. This is the one chance that many people will have and it must not be missed.

It was amazing to listen to the contributions of the first two speakers for the opposition: first, the shadow minister, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), who spoke for some 30 minutes about retail tenancy; and then the member for Newcastle also spoke about retail tenancy.

         The previous speaker talked about retailers and how they are getting a bit stiff at the moment. One of the reasons why they are getting stiffed at the moment is that they are not making any money at all; they are not making any profits. If they were making money and they were making profits, they certainly would not be putting submissions into an inquiry. One of the reasons retailers are putting in submissions is that their customer base has been destroyed by the policies of the previous government. That is why, in a general sense, they were forced out of their previous jobs, given big payouts by their superannuation funds and have gone into business without any advice at all. Then they expect to make a big profit, a return on investment within two years of the lease, knowing that the lease expiry was in two or three years—just silly things associated with going into business and not seeking appropriate advice.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Hardball business is, in fact, legal. The area between hardball business and unconscionable conduct is grey and uncertain, which is the reason why the committee developed its report and why the government has responded on this particular issue. This piece of legislation going through at the moment is very important for small business. It will protect small businesses against the predatory conduct of those who have power above them—whether they be big business or other small businesses.

        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill shows how the Howard government has acted quickly in responding to small business needs, unlike the previous speaker who suggested that we are not. We have given small business tax cuts, we have cut the red tape and we have done a lot of things—yet business wants more from us. But what small business really needs is a bit of certainty and security of tenure. That is what a lot of small businesses do not have at the moment under the current regime. They want to go

That is why the government has responded to the committee's recommendations.

In fact, in response to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Cadman) interjecting, `It didn't happen 18 months ago, though,' the member for Cunningham said in his speech on the second reading:

It is, regrettably, the first speech on a bill intended to do something in this area—the  Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997 . In Australia today, if you have a lease, the question of what legal rights that lease confers on you depends, according to the Liberal&amp;hyphen;National government, entirely on whether your lease is a pastoral lease or a retail lease.

          The member for Cowan just told the House that, at the end of the lease, as far as he is concerned, that is it. There is no such thing as goodwill. If it is a pastoral lease, according to the government, you deserve every consideration. For that kind of lease, your legal right to lease renewal, to keep everyone else off the property, should be absolute. Listening to some government members talking about pastoral leases, you would think that those leases were hardly any different from freehold.

           The fact that those pastoralists do not have freehold is just a minor oversight. If you are a retail tenant, to have a lease is to have a very precarious thing indeed.

          In 1995 Labor introduced the Trade Practices (Better Business Conduct) Bill, which was to prevent harsh or oppressive conduct by retail landlords and franchisors, and which was to give the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission greater powers to stamp out such conduct. Let us be clear about the history of this. The Liberal opposition refused to pass this bill. The fair trading section of their small business policy, which was released prior to the last election, said:

          So they would not support Labor's bill in government. So much for their claims that Labor did not act on this issue. Those claims are nonsense. And so it continued after the change of government. When Kim Beazley, as opposition leader, introduced a private member's bill in the same terms as Labor's original better business conduct bill, the Liberal government refused to pass it, nor would they put through their own bill. We would have been happy to support one if they were precious about the idea of who should claim the credit and be seen to be running the show. Instead, they said they would have an inquiry—the House of Representatives fair trading inquiry.

I have praised them in the past for their work on this report and I am happy to praise them again. I, and other Labor members, fully support that committee's recommendations. The problem was whether

The Labor Party did the small businesses of Australia an enormous service by exposing the conflicts of interest of this member and forcing his resignation, and the record has to show that. Following his resignation, retail tenants asked me, `What will the government do?' I said, `I think we have backed them into a corner. They now have to make a very public choice between their big business mates and small business. I think they will implement some of the report's recommendations with accompanying fanfare about how small business friendly they are, but they will leave enough loopholes to enable business as usual.'

It fails to implement key recommendations of the fair trading report and it will not solve the problems of retail tenants. In the first place, it does not provide for a uniform retail tenancy code. What the Liberal government has done is to handball this issue back to the states, and we all know how easy it is to get the states to agree on these things.

Labor proposes an amendment to this bill to set up a uniform retail tenancy code. To avoid duplication, the code will be integrated with existing and developing state and territory legislation to create a federal safety net for small businesses. The provisions of this code would cover precisely the things that the committee came up with in its report. For example, upon lease, renewal or extension, the code would require an independent market rent review jointly financed by the lessor and the lessee; the code would include a pre&amp;hyphen;contract disclosure statement, as per recommendation 2.5 of the fair trading report—disclosure would include disturbance to trading, retail tenancy mix, consultation with merchant associations, and a statement of outgoings; the code would provide for a step by step dispute resolution mechanism and also cover service stations.

I want to give the House one example of just what this means in practice. It comes from Pam Cleland, who set up a Granny May's business in Northland. In 1989, she put $180,000 into buying the franchise for Granny May's at Northland. In November 1992, she paid a further $74,000 for an enforced shop refit. She received no rent reduction while the shop was closed. In 1993, her trade was down 20 per cent despite a guarantee from Granny May's that this refit was going to improve the figures by 33 per cent. The business ran at a loss. She paid herself no wages but still she had the rental and outgoings put up by the traditional 8 per cent by Northland.

Now 1994 had been a better year but, if she did not renew, she would have had no business to sell and she had invested a large amount already. She was already risking a great deal of mon

Fosseys, an important store just across the corridor from her, closed and that site was empty for three months. Trade at Franklins, another large store nearby, was down 33 per cent on the previous year and so was Granny May's. She got no assistance from Granny May's management or from Gandels.

At times there was complete closure with no access to that part of Northland. There was still no compensation from Gandels. They still passed on the rent increase.

Gandels blamed Granny May's management; Granny May's management blamed Gandels.

Labor was at the end of a 13&amp;hyphen;year term during which it did absolutely nothing to help the small business community other than conduct 17 inquiries. Very little came of them. There was inquiry upon inquiry and, at the end of the day, nothing at all for small business. The Labor Party do not understand small business. They have never understood small business.

It is on that strength that most of the small business community just listen to contributions like that of the member for Wills and the ranting and raving that he often goes on with and understands that if the opposition was genuine in their concerns they would have done something about it.

It reminds me of the sort of relief that citizens of Canberra and Melbourne will receive shortly; the thunder that brings the storm, the great relief. This is the sense the small business community had when the coalition was elected to government in March 1996. It was the storm that broke a very hot spell of disinterest, harshness and indifference by the Labor Party. Since that storm in March 1996 and the relief that came with the rain and the cool change, the small business community has seen a government in power, led by some very competent ministers, most particularly the minister who currently has responsibility for small business, the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), who is interested in small business concerns and is actually doing something about it.

         Unusually, because of the community's reaction to the package of small business reforms introduced by the coalition being so positive, Labor's spokesman on small business, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) has actually endorsed these changes. Labor was even forced to concede that the minister had been `able to achieve through his cabinet far more than we anticipated.' And what was left off there, though, is that the minister has been able to achieve through a coalition cabinet things that could never be achieved through a Labor Party cabinet.

As I said earlier, if they had been sincere, if their concern and interest had been from the heart, they would have done something over 13 years.

The meeting provided a very strong message for us to take back to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business: small business wanted constructive measures from the coalition after the dry spell of 13 years of Labor inactivity.

         Retail traders at the meeting also expressed particular concerns. There was a good number of them, because the Dunkley community is the heartbeat of the retail community in the south&amp;hyphen;eastern suburbs of Melbourne. It is the place to shop. It is an outstanding retail community that those people wishing to make Christmas purchases should certainly consider—whether it is the Karingal Hub centre, Frankston's multitude of retail outlets, down in the Mornington community or the many other smaller retail centres around my electorate.

         These retail traders echoed the evidence presented to the Reid committee that smaller businesses often have to pay far more rent per square metre than larger tenants and were not able to get the sort of support that many of the larger anchor tenants enjoyed from centre management. There will always be some sort of premium on smaller space, but I wonder whether the in excess of 1,000 times quoted in the examples to the committee is fair. I do not think it is. Some of the community that I represent are also paying 35 per cent of their total sales in rent and outgoings. That is before they pay any wages, before they pay for their stock and the electricity and those sorts of things. They are paying 35 per cent of every dollar coming into their business as rent and outgoings to centre management. That is an extraordinary figure, but I hope

         Proposed new section 5lAC in this bill will prohibit unconscionable conduct by corporations against persons, other than listed public companies, or by persons against corporations, with the same exception. Effectively, the existing protections available to consumers under section 51AB of the Trade Practices Act will be extend to small businesses. The coalition government is undertaking these steps because small businesses and their situation are, in our view,  analogous to that of consumers.

However, with around 900,000 small businesses in Australia today, even .01 per cent of contracting parties acting unethically or unconscionably means almost 1,000 potentially serious disputes—serious disputes that can put people's investments, enterprises and, in many cases, their homes and family situations at risk.

As many of us in this place know, with banking institutions not being prepared to provide financial accommodation on business plans and sales performances alone, many of these small business people have put their homes, family savings and many of their other assets on the line to be entrepreneurial and to get involved in the small business community.

         There is an existing body of case law on unconscionable conduct. While the Reid report recommended the prohibition of unfair conduct in the Trade Practices Act, the government viewed this as a recipe for uncertainty because this legal term has not yet been defined by the courts. So what we are talking about is a reform, a practical measure, with certainty involved. That is a sensible compromise in my view. As the WA Chamber of Commerce and Industry correctly warned, an attempt to define unfair conduct would only land businesses, both small and large, in court. Billable hours for lawyers is the last outcome I would like to see from my contribution in this place.

         The government's overriding objective is to force a change in business culture and behaviour. It will encourage compliance rather than a reliance on litigation, which was a risk if the Reid committee's recommendations had been adopted in the manner proposed. There will also be $480,000 a year in funding made available to the ACCC to conduct test cases on small business matters, again strengthening that body of law. This will further encourage a business environment of certainty which will help small businesses to have the confidence to expand in an environment of rising retail spending—and I am pleased to add that Victoria is leading the way across the country, and certainly in the Dunkley electorate—low interest rates and small business lending costs starting to tumble with groups like Aussie

         The other major step forward in this bill is the underpinning of business codes of conduct. While the Reid committee suggested the insertion of a new section in the act for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to approve codes covering matters such as franchising, their recommendation was based around the words `unfair conduct'. That, as I explained earlier, would have created some legal uncertainty.

         On balance, the government has decided through this bill to insert a new part 9B and a new section 51AD in the act which will cover industry codes. These codes may be either mandatory or voluntary and can be specified by regulation. This will give the opportunity for industry to have substantial involvement in determining what is an appropriate level of regulation within their sector. The new codes of conduct enforcement unit will be established within the ACCC to offer educational explanatory material on prescribed codes, as well as assisting in carrying out those test cases I mentioned earlier. The Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs will have policy responsibility for the development of codes.

We are taking a leadership role in encouraging ministers like Victoria's Louise Asher to propose a fairer deal for small businesses. Why? As mentioned earlier, we would have to rely upon the corporations power ourselves to directly intervene legislatively in this area and, as many of us in this place know—and for the interest, I trust, of those on the opposite side of this House—these shopping centres are more often than not state listed property trusts.

         With the Small Business Advisory Network in Victoria led by Noel Johnson, I have been lobbying to ensure that other sensible changes, such as the core hour concept that is already available in South Australia and Queensland, are looked at for the Victorian jurisdiction. It is unfair for a few tenants to trade all night in a shopping centre and expect other tenants to be involved in contributing to the outgoings during those hours. Show me a more liberal concept that says to the small business community, `Get together within a shopping centre and agree on what is a spread of hours that everybody will undertake to be open. We can market the shopping centre as being fully operational at that time across those core hours and then, if it suits you to open beyond those core hours, do so, but you carry the commercial costs that go with that.' If the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) and I happened to operate a florist shop and on the eve of Valentine's Day think that there would be a lot of lovesick males trying to make the right move towards the ones they are fond of and we will stay open just so that everyone can buy some roses, then that is a call we can make. But that is a call we make on our commercial terms and, therefore, we do not impose our judgments, business acumen and decisions on other people.

Secondly, we moved to ensure consistent future treatment of golden handshake payments regardless of whether they are rolled over or taken in cash with rolled&amp;hyphen;over payments exempt from 20 August 1996 to 1 July 1997.

         I must say this was a matter of great concern amongst a number of people around Australia who had taken golden handshake payments in good faith and based on the statement made by the Treasurer at the time had rolled them over only to find that they were going to be subject to the surcharge whereas those who had taken them in cash were not going to be subject to the surcharge. So that was causing them great concern. In the interests of keeping the Treasurer honest, an important objective at any time, we supported these amendments in the Senate.

         First of all, the government cannot accept penalty rates of interest as will be the case if the amendment is accepted. It is not accepted by the government for that reason and the following reasons. The amendment would result in inconsistent consequences for the failure to quote a tax file number. In other legislation administered by the Commissioner of Taxation, interest is not applied to amended assessments after the quotation of a tax file number. The legislation already imposes significant requirements on the commissioner to identify members of superannuation funds before issuing a surcharge assessment on the basis of a non&amp;hyphen;quotation of a tax file number.

          In addition, the legislation provides that certain superannuation accounts are to be assessed at a nil rate of surcharge where a tax file number has not been quoted. The effect of this amendment is effectively to provide encouragement for people not to quote their tax file number for surcharge purposes. There are, therefore, no reasonable grounds for this amendment to be accepted.

          —The opposition does not support the government's motion to reject this amendment. What the amendment is endeavouring to do is to ensure that those superannuation funds that are entitled to a tax refund from the Australian Taxation Office because an individual taxpayer did not provide their tax file number and was hit with the full rate of surcharge tax will get the value of interest for the tax office holding those funds for a period. The need for this amendment in the first place highlights the absolute stupidity of the government's superannuation surcharge tax collection method. To illustrate how dopey and complex this collection method is, let me explain again how this tax is supposed to work.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As a general proposition, this is a tax on a third party—a superannuation fund—resulting from the actions of a superannuation fund member. The tax is assessed based on the adjusted taxable income of the member by the Australian Taxation Office which advises the super fund of its tax liability. The member is also advised of the tax liability by the tax office, but the member does not have to pay the tax. That is a problem for the super fund. The super fund then pays the tax to the tax office and may choose to pass the tax on to the member, but it may not choose to pass the liability on to the member. In some cases, it will not be able to pass it on to the member meaning the fund will have to carry the liability itself. In that case, you will see all members of the superannuation fund paying the tax regardless of their income level.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the situation where the member does not provide their tax file number to the fund the tax office will levy the full amount of the surcharge tax—that is, 15 per cent of surchargable contributions on the fund. That
         <break page="11374" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          means that low and middle income earners who do not provide their tax file numbers to their superannuation fund will pay the full 15 per cent of the surcharge tax. This is a terrible situation. As an example, someone from the emergency services superannuation fund said to me that he has about 23,000 fund members. He has to do all the calculations when 60 members end up being liable for the surcharge. If others in the fund do not provide their tax file number, they will end up paying the 15 per cent surcharge.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If the situation that I have described does occur, the member can subsequently provide their tax file number to the tax office and the tax office may reassess the tax liability on the super fund. This amendment is designed to bring some justice to the situation. Where a reassessment of the super fund's liability is made by the tax office after receiving the tax file number of the fund member, the fund may be entitled to a refund from the tax office of the amount of surcharge tax overpaid. This amendment will require the tax office to pay interest on the refunded amount.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the eyes of the opposition, that is fair and that is reasonable. The refund should include interest on that amount which the tax office was holding unnecessarily as a result of the government's complex collection method. It would have been earning interest had it stayed in the member's superannuation fund account. Again, the complexity of the government's collection method is still apparent in what the fund should do with the refund if it got the money. The superannuation fund paid the tax to the tax office but may or may not have passed the tax on to the member. If it did pass it on, then the fund should give the money back to the member. If it did not pass it on, then the fund can keep the money itself, but what to do with the interest payment? Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) might like to respond to that.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The government is telling us that low and middle income earners can avoid paying the surcharge tax simply by giving their tax file numbers to their superannuation fund. It is also telling us that the collection of tax file numbers is going well, with Senator Kemp

        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         I am not sure what `expectations' are, but that is contrary to the advice which some other superannuation funds are saying, which is that only a small number of people are providing their tax file numbers meaning that their superannuation provider will be subject to a tax liability which they will pass on to all those individual fund members who are not high income earners. Even if we ignore that advice from the superannuation funds and take the government at its word, which is a risk at any time, then what do we see in respect of the collection of tax file numbers? Reportedly, there are six million individual taxpayers in Australia who are covered by superannuation. That comes from the Senate Economics Legislation Committee hearing of 26 February this year.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If the collection rate for tax file numbers is as high as 65 per cent, which is the figure given by the tax office, we still have over 2,100,000 people unaccounted for.

The total surcharge collected by the tax office from low income earners on this basis would be some $220 million in the first year alone. Some 700,000 people may end up paying the 15 per cent surcharge which they should not have to pay because they have not provided their tax file number.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So our amendment will go some way towards limiting the impact that the surcharge tax will have on low and middle income earners. There will be a higher compliance cost to the tax office in processing the plethora of claims for the refund and the interest of surcharge tax payments that will certainly arise next year. The fact that low and middle income earners are going to pay this tax is an inevitable consequence of the bizarre collec

         Labor believes that the amendment we have here will provide low and middle income earners with some justice for having to pay the surcharge tax provided that superannuation providers pass the interest payments and the refund onto the individuals. For those reasons, we support the Senate amendment, and we hope that the government will be gracious enough to do so as well.

This shows that this is a government which supports low and middle income earners.'

         The 1990 report has laid the framework for much of the policy that is now before the House. When you read the fine print of the glossy literature of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) and look beyond the rhetoric, it is not as clear, as this minister would have us believe, that change has in fact happened. The legislation, unfortunately, does not go far enough. The small business people out there are looking for help and for some justice.

          The government's bill is moderate in its desire to help small business. It is also moderate in its implementation of the recommendations of the fair trading report. The Labor amendments will strengthen the bill and make it a better piece of legislation. Primarily, our amendments utilise the term `unfair' instead of `unconscionable' in line with recommendation 6 of the Reid report. This will have the very beneficial effect of widening the catchment of small business, enabling them to utilise the legal mechanisms in seeking redress when the balance of power moves against them. That is why it is such an important amendment. Some people may say it is semantics, but ask those small businesses and they will tell you that it is a very important change that needs to be made. It is not being done because big business has got to the minister and made sure that the net is as narrow as possible.

           I would like to add my concerns of the government's greatest failure in passing the buck for responsibility for retail tenancy. Of all the evidence our committee received, the evidence on retail tenancy was the most compelling. The minister says the solution is to gather together the states and territories to get a common solution. However, it is common knowledge that the states and territories will be unlikely to agree on a national uniform retail tenancy code. I wish the minister well, but I tell him from bitter experience that what will happen is that all the states will agree to a national retail tenancy code and then all of them will say you have to adopt that particular state's model. Therefore, you will get no outcome.

           This is clearly an area which cries out for national uniform legislation. It is now time to act and to impose a solution upon the states. It has been nine years since we first tried to address this issue and nothing has happened—in fact, it has got worse. Voluntary solutions have been tried before, as I said, and the minister is fooling himself and the small business sector if he believes that the states and territories will be able to agree on common ground. This is simply and utterly a nonsense.

           The government, as I have already outlined, appears to have watered down its approach to these issues. The Labor Party recognises the importance of the small business sector to the community, and the weak approach taken by the government is not the answer.

           The government's bill is moderate in its implementation of the recommendations, to say the least. The minister is often quick to criticise but, unfortunately, not so quick to deliver. There are many things in the response to the Reid report where the government—and I am quite keen to say this—has done the right thing but, in retail tenancy, they have squibbed it. The minister continues to claim that Labor squibbed the hard decisions. Here is the hard decision for him because, as I have said, he squibbed the issue of retail tenancy. For far too long the small business sector has been ignored. Now is the time, as the report said, to restore the balance.

After considering the Reid report, the government took the view that the Trade Practices Act should be amended to protect small business against unconscionable conduct in relation to certain small business transactions. This bill is not about protecting small business from the ordinary forces and commercial risks that are part of the cut and thrust of a competitive free marketplace.

         The bill is designed to bring about a change in large corporations' dealings with small business that will level out the playing field to provide a more equitable basis for business transactions across the business world. It balances fair trading with free trading. The definition of `unconscionable' may be determined by taking into account the factors set out in section 51AC. It includes those matters currently listed in existing section 51AB, which prohibits unconscionable conduct by corporations against consumers. In effect, small business will have similar rights to that of a consumer in their dealings with a large corporation. The bill does not remove from small business the obligation to do their homework before entering into a business contract. For many people, moving into a small business is simply buying themselves a job.

          There is no doubt that over the years small business has often been the milch cow for the banks and financial institutions, with homes securing business loans and overdraft interest rates at the top of the scale. But many small businesses are also not aware that banks can be negotiated with not just when a loan is required but at any time during a contract. How many small businesses, for example, contact their bank manager when sales are down and cash flows start to dry up? They usually wait in fear and trepidation for the bank manager to ring them. In fact, the best way to deal with the ebbs and flows of business is to have a forward plan, be hard-nosed about expected income streams, read all contractual documentation carefully and closely, including the fine print, always consider the worst possible scenario and communicate with your financial organisation.

Funding has been allocated to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to undertake test cases and representative actions on the new law. A franchising code of practice will be established, underpinned by and enforceable under the Trade Practices Act.

          A franchising policy council will be established to advise on the franchising code of practice, with dispute resolution mechanisms introduced into the code to minimise litigation and legal costs. A dispute resolution adviser will be appointed for the franchising industry to assist parties in resolving disputes, with a view to minimising—I repeat: minimising—litigation and legal costs. Those costs often prove to be a barrier to small business seeking legal redress for unfair trading, and they

          For many small business people, trading is simply their transferred PAYE income. Instead of working for an employer, they work for themselves, and frequently their income is less than it might be had they worked for an employer. They choose to work for themselves and they help to make this nation greater by doing so, but there are many times when life is pretty tough for them. When you trade with negative income for a while and have to live off retained earnings or borrow from a bank in order to eat, life ain't easy!

          In order to facilitate the process of businesses seeking redress, the government will develop an information kit for small business to promote alternative dispute resolution procedures.

          That is one of the most important issues addressed in this legislation. It is very important that the banking industry take some responsibility for small business. Take the bloke who has a little business while his wife stays at home to take care of the kids. He operates his small business out of his home and the bank takes his house under a mortgage in order to give him working capital to run the business. But the bank does not charge him the normal mortgage interest rate. The bank hikes it up four or five per cent—

Next week the Commonwealth Employment Service will shut down after 50 years of loyal and dedicated service to Australia. It will be replaced by what I fear will be a shambles. To try and convince us all that this is not a shambles, the government is about to embark on an $8 million advertising campaign with a theme song—wait for it—urging the unemployed to `search for the hero inside yourself'.

I suggest to the House that Dr Kemp can be a hero to the 800,000 Australians by admitting there are problems with the privatisation of the CES, taking a deep breath and calling not for another theme song but for a review of all the new jobs programs to make sure that they will work and make sure that it is all legal.

Dr Kemp, it is about time that you searched for the hero inside yourself rather than pointing the finger at and blaming Australia's unemployed and their families, rather than withdrawing services to the unemployed from regional Australia, rather than putting, as from next Monday, another 3,500 workers and their families on the unemployment queues. One in three long&amp;hyphen;term unemployed is a disgrace. The CES will be in a shambles.

          —Two weeks ago in his address to the Senate Economics Committee, Mr Brian Patterson, a partner with Coopers and Lybrand, produced a copy of the recently released Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. He predicted that many accountants and staff of the Australian Taxation Office would return to using the tax act for the first time in years, as opposed to the Australian Master Tax Guide, as a result of the TLIP rewrite. However, he qualified his comment by noting that they would do so
          <break page="11384" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         According to Mr Patterson, the trust loss provisions are a `massive retrograde step' that will `set back the rewrite to 1936' because of their length and complexity. Comments like that are not unique. In fact, in the 40 months since the introduction of TLIP, similar criticisms have been voiced with increasing regularity by the tax community.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         From the beginning, critics of TLIP have questioned the value in committing thousands of man&amp;hyphen;hours and millions of dollars to a rewrite of the tax act if it is to be made redundant by the eventual overhaul of the tax system. We know that tax reform is very much in the air and that the present government is committed to it—and more power to them.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Equally as valid is the perception that the rewrite project will amount to nothing more than a white elephant if tax legislation which undermines the simplification process continues to be introduced into this parliament, as it has been only this week. When speaking of the rewrite of capital works legislation in the first TLIP instalment, Mr Geoffrey Lehmann of Price Waterhouse noted that the rewritten legislation was `intended to be read by machines and not by human beings.'
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Soon afterwards, Mr Richard Humphry, Managing Director of the Stock Exchange, spoke publicly about the simplification of the Corporations Law. It was his opinion that the newly rewritten and supposedly improved Corporations Law `would not stand up to any form of competitive analysis against international law' because of its complexity.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In December last year, the government released legislation that would see substantial change to the capital gains tax regime. While the legislation represented a significant win for the small business sector, the President of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry noted that `it came at the expense of some 25 pages of brain numbing legislative amendments'. Mr Samuel went on to ponder why the Australian Taxation Office continued to sponsor TLIP, given its incapacity to `staunch the flow of legislative gobbledegook'
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

        <para first-indent="16">
         The fact that every one of the abovementioned examples has been characterised as cumbersome and unnecessarily complex makes a farce of the entire TLIP project. In a letter to the editor of the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         in May this year, an academic from the Communication Research Institute of Australia observed:

        <para style="Para">
         If his observation is indeed accurate—and I believe it is—and such a mind&amp;hyphen;set has embedded itself into the machinations of the ATO, then it is probable that we will continue to grapple with complex tax legislation like that of trust losses, capital gains tax and the Corporations Law. TLIP will not address the problem of our shrinking indirect tax base, nor will it make any inroads into the heavy compliance costs associated with it. It will not bring about any change to a system which falls most heavily on the PAYE taxpayer, nor will it reform our system which fails to effectively tax modern financial markets. However, it is likely that TLIP will improve the reading of the tax act and in this respect it should be supported.

The day was a great local tourist promotion as well, with many businesses reporting that there was a great buzz. Planning for the event began early in 1997 and its success was due to the hard work of the helicopter subcommittee which was coordinated by Terry Swanson and comprised Judy Lambden, David Osborne, Ian Bowley, Greg Boot and Geoff Rowell. Local businesses assisted with sponsorship, and service groups such as the CFA and Victoria Police helped with security and crowd control on the day.

         May I say it was a fantastic day. The skies above Mount Dandenong were awash with rotor blades. I am sure that the parents, the students, the principal, the teachers and everyone involved, particularly the school council at Mount Dandenong Primary School, are proud of their effort. I am sure they hope that it will be replicated in the year 2097. Good luck to them. They have done a fantastic job. I know that we all wish them well in the future. Hooray for a world record!

          my letter to BHP's Dr John Burgess relating to BHP's 1997 environmental report on Belmont wetlands. The response I received yesterday was not from Dr Burgess but from Graham Evans, who is the Group General Manager, BHP External Affairs and Company Identity. I am fascinated with his title, but the point I am making is that I wrote to the environment manager about an environment report and I received a reply from a different division altogether. It does remind me of Sir Humphrey, as I said last evening.

         This is the long section of wetlands between Belmont and Redhead in my electorate. As I have said previously, they are unique coastal wetlands that have been devastated over some five decades by BHP. They did not do it themselves; they presided over the devastation.

          BHP gained the mining rights to that area in 1923. They gained the surface rights in about 1963—and, as the older residents tell me, in dubious circumstances—for a peppercorn rental. I know from direct discussions with BHP that the land and the wetlands in question are not shown at any value in their books. They have got a zoning that does not enable anything to be done there, so it does not show at any value. Any gain from that site is fortuitous.

          I want to make the point that large corporations like BHP—not just BHP, but all those corporations—do have community responsibilities. They, more than government, have to be seen to be doing the right thing in respect of our environment. I find it quite incongruous that BHP publishes a glossy environment report telling the world how wonderful they are in respect of the environment. When I think back to what I have seen on the television screen about Ok Tedi—and it comes back to my mind quite regularly—and what I see in my own area, I can see that what BHP is effectively doing is playing off the city of Newcastle against the city of Lake Macquarie.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The wetlands area is in the city of Lake Macquarie, but BHP donates money to beautifying its own works in Newcastle; the wetlands at Kooragang, which are riverine wetlands off Newcastle harbour; and the Shortland wetlands, which are in the suburb of Shortland, not the electorate of Shortland. The Shortland wetlands is really a refurbished garbage dump; it was a garbage dump which was converted into a freshwater wetland.

          At the same time, BHP say they have to take into account the interests of their shareholders because of the commercial potential of the site. I ask: just how much interest must the shareholders get? They mined underground, they have royalties from rutile mining above ground, they have had revenues all the way through from the sale of sand and they are now seeking an exploration licence to re&amp;hyphen;search the area for heavy minerals. Another division of BHP is also trying to have the whole area rezoned for residential development. Mr Evans went on to say:

           What we have been trying to do, therefore, is to find a solution that accommodates all these interests squarely within the framework of the Company's core principles and policies that require us to act in a socially and environmentally responsible manner.
          </para>
          <para style="Para">
           I appeal to them in the strongest terms that I am able to utter: yes, please do that. Please have regard to the dividends that you have extracted year after year, decade after decade from this patch of unique coastal wetlands and make a contribution back to the community in that area from which you have drawn so much.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The development that they are proposing to put in there is in response to them being able to hand over the area to open space. In that area involved they calculated out about 130 hectares overall that would go back to public use. What they are really counting is the high&amp;hyphen;water mark of the beach. The beach is several kilometres long and, because of the old AA act, the land title went down to the high&amp;hyphen;water mark.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           To suggest that the beach, the dunes and the area behind them are some generous gift from BHP is beyond comprehension. It is misrepresenting the situation completely. It is improper of BHP. The beach and its surrounds are public areas and belong to the people of that region. Through an anachronism they appear on the title of the original land grant back in the 19th century. BHP are actually giving nothing away. I repeat my appeal, as I will continue to do, and express myself in every way possible, that this area is unique. It can be refurbished to an international standard and we want it back.

          —Last week I opened one of my local newspapers to find an article from the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) questioning my position on the Badgerys Creek airport proposal. While I appreciate her interest in an issue which obviously affects her constituents I was not impressed by her eagerness to come slinking into my electorate to try to score a couple of cheap political points, particularly
          <break page="11387" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           considering the consistency of my opposition to the airport.

        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In fact, I wonder why the member for Prospect has not been so enthusiastic in attacking her own colleagues, who in fact have been very vocal in their support for Badgerys Creek airport. Why was she silent, for instance, when the member for Chifley (Mr Price) spoke of `the magnificence of the decision  to build Badgerys Creek' and said it was `something I have been seeking for a long time'?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Why was she silent when the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) repeatedly berated the current government for not moving ahead quickly to build Badgerys Creek, or when the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) repeatedly stated his commitment to Badgerys Creek airport?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Why did she not respond when the members for Barton (Mr McClelland) and Blaxland (Mr Hatton) on a number of occasions over the past year criticised the government for delaying  Badgerys Creek, themselves urging the government to get moving on Badgerys Creek?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Why was she not critical of the repeated support of the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) for an international airport at Badgerys Creek, for curfew free operations? And why was she not critical of him for then criticising this government for delaying the airport through conducting an EIS?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Labor's position on this has been all over the place like a dog's breakfast. Particularly hypocritical have been local Labor MPs, ex&amp;hyphen;MPs and would-be MPs, who took one position when Labor was in government but a different one now that they are in opposition.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Despite repeated statements by Labor's transport minister over the years that they were planning a full international, no&amp;hyphen;curfew airport for Badgerys Creek, these same MPs are now deceitfully claiming they were thinking of something different. This is typical of Labor's cheap opportunism, typical of its lack of principle, typical of its cynical treatment of local communities.

        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          I have been consistent in my opposition to the Badgerys Creek airport proposal, both prior to the last election and since. I have repeatedly urged a consideration of other options and will continue to do so. If there is any chance of finding a more viable alternative, it must be given serious consideration. I have received close to 500 letters and a 5,000&amp;hyphen;signature petition from concerned residents. I have met with local residents groups and have faithfully relayed their concerns to the relevant ministers. I will continue to do so.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          However, it needs to be noted that in contrast to the position of Labor, the coalition has been consistent in its position with regard to Sydney's second airport. It promised a full, independent EIS, and that is exactly what it has been delivering. Further, for the first time in any Australian environmental impact statement, it has appointed an independent auditor to ensure the transparency, thoroughness and validity of the EIS process, a step that the former government would not even have dreamed of.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Compare this with Labor's arrogance, with the comments of the then transport minister, who said that Badgerys Creek would go ahead regardless of the findings of an EIS. Labor's position on this issue has been the same as it is on most issues, that is, they are, as usual, confused, chaotic and contradictory.

         At a time when we are having discussions about the need for Aboriginal reconciliation with post&amp;hyphen;European settlement, I think it is really an outrage that a member of this House said, `We should have settled with the Aboriginals for $20 and a packet of Jatz.' That is the sort of disgraceful performance which I thought that the Acting Prime Minister (Mr
         <break page="11388" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         To his credit, the Acting Prime Minister as the Leader of the National Party reprimanded the comments of Bob Katter during the election campaign in the lead&amp;hyphen;up to 2 March 1996. I think that the Acting Prime Minister has also shown in his stance on guns and on other issues such as racism that he is prepared to speak out. He has shown a commitment to speak out against the comments of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson).
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Unfortunately, however, maybe there is something that goes with being the current Prime Minister. Maybe, whilst he is Acting Prime Minister, he does not want to intervene in case he upsets the current Prime Minister, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), because the current Prime Minister has consistently refused to oppose the comments of the member for Oxley after her first speech. In fact, the Prime Minister gave a speech in Brisbane about the principle of freedom of speech.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Perhaps we are seeing that it is a disease which is contagious and that it is now acceptable for members of the government such as the member for Capricornia to speak about giving the original inhabitants of this nation $20 and a packet of Jatz. The original inhabitants of this nation in 40,000 years looked after this country in terms of its environment and the societies which they and their nations built up. I think it is an absolute outrage that we have a member of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs standing committee of this parliament making such a statement.

         It is that sort of statement which does damage to every one of us. We are all diminished by that sort of racist statement. And it is not just we as a parliament but we as a nation who are diminished, because the eyes of the world are on us whilst we have the debate about native title. I believe that there are very few people in this House who would agree with those sorts of sentiments. But the time is right for leadership, and I call upon those in the government to reprimand the member for Capricornia and expel him as

          —The Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 is part of a process of response to two disasters in civil aviation that occurred in 1993 and 1994, the first of which was the Monarch disaster and the second of which was the Seaview crash. Of course, a very substantial number of people lost their lives in those disasters and they have had a profound impact on the debate about aviation safety in this country. This
          <break page="11390" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           legislation provides for certain changes, essentially technical, to the regulation of carriers' liability on matters regarding insurance and how that liability should be enacted.

         It is worth considering some of the issues in the context of this legislation, some of the issues that have brought us to this point and some recent developments in the administration of aviation safety in Australia, because this piece of legislation, relatively limited and technical as it is, is part of a broader picture of political and legislative response to some of these very vexed issues that have troubled the administration of aviation safety in this country for six or seven years and to which, realistically, there is probably no immediate end in sight.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The disasters that I referred to have been subject to inquiries but a recent coroner's inquiry is still continuing with respect to the Seaview disaster, so the analysis of these two disasters is yet to be fully completed. But it is very clear that substantial deficiencies in the administration and implementation of aviation safety in Australia were revealed as a result of these two crashes and also that there were some deficiencies in the law—for example, with respect to the entitlements of de factos under insurance policies for people who are killed in aviation disasters. So, as I have indicated, this is part of an overall process of response to those problems, and there are substantial disagreements between the government and the opposition on precisely how these issues should be dealt with.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I wanted in passing to refer to some recent events in this area which give me some cause for concern. On 22 September this year, it was revealed by the opposition that the former minister for transport, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), had requested new appointees to boards such as Air Services Australia, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the like, to sign a statement which said in effect, `Notwithstanding anything in the act under which I am appointed, I hereby agree to resign if, at any time, for any reason, I am asked to do so by the minister', thereby effectively negating the impact of the act, which specifies in each case that the minister can only dismiss a member of the independent statutory board, be it the Civil Aviation Safety Authority board or the Air Services board, in certain specified circumstances, such as manifest incompetence, poor performance and the like.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When this matter was first raised by me in parliament, the minister affected not to know what was being referred to and indicated that he did not have details available at the time and would report subsequently to the House. He had not reported by question time on the following day, so I asked again and at that point he revealed that most of the people he had appointed to various boards, including the two boards I have mentioned, had signed documents of this nature. He then accused me of scaremongering about the issue and possible legal doubts with respect to the composition of those boards as a result of his actions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I also asked the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) a question in relation to this issue and the Prime Minister stated in response that he had immense confidence in the then minister for transport and that the minister enjoyed his total support. Of course, less than 24 hours later, he asked the minister for his resignation with respect to other matters. The legal advice that the opposition received on this issue indicated that the actions of the minister in seeking these secret resignation agreements were ultra vires his powers under the act which, as I indicated, specified special circumstances in which he can seek to dismiss individual board members.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We recall the attempt by the then minister, in January and February of this year, to dismiss the entire board, as it was then constituted, of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. People on all sides would agree that it is not an easy matter to dismiss board members from an independent statutory authority. The minister ultimately did not persist with that particular
         <break page="11391" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          attempt. Clearly, his asking his own appointees to sign an agreement to resign whenever he asked them, was intended to get around the perceived problems.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         How extraordinary it is that he actually felt the need to ask people whom he was appointing to sign this letter. It is understandable that a minister may have some concerns about appointees to statutory boards who were appointed by a previous government of a different political persuasion, but it is extraordinary that a minister would want to seek to have his own appointees sign some sort of statement indicating their preparedness to resign at any time if he so asks them.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In any event, the opposition's legal advice indicated that there was a serious risk that any board which included a person who had signed such a statement could potentially be vulnerable to legal challenge on the basis that it was improperly constituted. There may have been what is technically termed a perceived apprehension of bias or, indeed, the perception of external control over board members who are intended to be autonomous and independent in the exercise of their judgment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These boards make controversial decisions of some significance, such as the Air Services Board which deals with immensely controversial issues like flight paths and operational arrangements at Sydney airport—which are rarely off the front page of the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Sydney Morning Herald
         </emphasis>
         . Of course the Civil Aviation Safety Authority board also has to make a variety of major decisions which, as we have seen, are of considerable controversy. It is not beyond the realms of possibility that these sorts of matters can end up in court, with various aggrieved parties seeking to challenge a decision of the authority and to overturn it. Therefore, any doubt over the composition of the board clearly presents at least a potential legal avenue for an aggrieved party to pursue. Although nobody is certain about what the outcome of that would be, it is certainly an unwise thing to do.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It was part of a broader response by the then minister to the problems that had emerged in the Civil Aviation Authority, as it then was, and which were perceived to have carried on to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority—one of its two successor bodies. I think it is worth reflecting on this issue just for a moment. I would be interested to know the Prime Minister's view on the issue and whether he regards this sort of behaviour by a minister as acceptable.

          —I will move on. I think I have made my point on that matter. I return to the specifics of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the legislation. We have now seen a dramatic change occur in the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. On 25 September—in events that can only be described as rather extraordinary—the director of aviation safety, Mr Leroy Keith, was the subject of a motion of no confidence by the board, as it was then constituted, which was upheld by four votes to three. He was one of the three, of course—and the other two board members were appointed by the previous government, including the chairman, Justice Fisher—who then promptly resigned. No substantive reasons were given at the time or subsequently. I think it is a great pity that this occurred.

         <para first-indent="16">
          It is interesting to note that, throughout the whole debate we had about the Monarch and Seaview issues, the issues in the legislation today and the former minister's approach to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and reforming aviation safety in Australia, the former minister continued to express confidence, along with me, in Mr Keith as the director of aviation safety. He is a person with a background of many years in the equivalent organisation in the United States. He is highly respected and, certainly from every observation I had made, he had been making substantial progress in improving the situation in the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, where clearly improvement was very much required.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Unfortunately, we then had what I have described as a bit of a wild west shoot-out. All of a sudden, there was no longer a director of aviation safety and two board members had disappeared, and we now have an acting chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority in Dick Smith. Time will tell what the consequences of this wild west shoot-out will be, but it certainly does raise some concerns about the administration of aviation safety in Australia. We have to reserve judgment on what impact these events will have, but I certainly am very disturbed about the impact they will have on our reputation internationally. It does not look good amongst aviation safety administrators in other parts of the world to have these sorts of events occur, and certainly Mr Keith had an international reputation and unsullied standing of the highest order. I have no doubt there are people in the aviation safety administration area in other countries scratching their heads a bit about this and asking, `What on earth is going on in Australia?'
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Nonetheless, we have to judge the organisation and the government on their merits and on what actually eventuates from these events. Now that we have a new Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Vaile), we have to judge the actions of the new minister on their merits. I am extremely disturbed by these events and fear that the administration of aviation safety is in some serious turmoil now, and it will be increasingly difficult for CASA and its staff to go about doing their job when you have these sorts of extraordinary events occurring at the top level. It is always very difficult for anybody in a large organisation to remain unaffected by these events.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Nonetheless, the legislation that is before us today is welcomed. It is part of an overall process where, in many respects, there is agreement between the government and the opposition on dealing with some of the issues that have emerged from the Monarch and  Seaview disasters and how we ought to as a society approach the issue of aviation safety regulation.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In conclusion, I will make a couple of points about the broad philosophical approach that is required here. The first is to emphasise just how critical it is to have rigorous and unbiased administration of aviation safety. All of us who represent Australian people in this parliament fly quite a lot for one reason or another—some more than others, but we all fly quite a lot. We are all accustomed, I think, to more or less taking for granted the safety of flying in Australia. Some of us get a bit nervous when we hop in a nine&amp;hyphen;seater Piper Navaho or whatever. I am sure the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) does a fair bit of flying and there are plenty of circumstances when you look out the window and think, `Oh. I don't know about this.'

            of economic benefits and a lot of social benefits—flow from the fact that in spite of these problems, Australia still has very safe skies compared with the rest of the world. It is a benefit that we should protect as much as possible. We should ensure that the administration of aviation safety is never in question in the way that it has been in the past.

          So regardless of whose is the correct approach—and clearly there are very substantial differences between the government and the opposition on these issues—it is of fundamental importance to the proper functioning of our society, both economically and socially, that we protect aviation safety and maintain it at the highest possible level. It is an important part of Australia's competitive advantage with respect to the rest of the world. For example, we have a growing pilot training industry in this country, which is one of the many services exports that are starting to become quite prominent in Australia's overall export effort.

         <para first-indent="16">
          One of the key reasons why we have a great competitive advantage in this area is that we have a reputation for safety. Clearly, Australia is seen by the rest of the world as a very good place for people to come and train as pilots because, amongst other things, our skies are comparatively safe compared with most of the rest of the world. That is just one specific example of how important it is to maintain a proper level of aviation safety in this country, leaving aside the obvious consideration that we do not want people dying in plane crashes, which hardly needs to be stated. But there are a lot of indirect ways that economic and social activity is affected by aviation safety that tend not to be acknowledged or recognised unless a plane falls out of the sky and people die. Then, of course, it is too late.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The final comment I will make on the broader philosophical issue relates to the perspective from which aviation safety administration should be approached by a regulator. On this matter there is some degree of philosophical difference between ourselves and the government, although pinning it down and defining it may not be easy. It was encapsulated very well by the former chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, Justice Bill Fisher, in the midst of the debate that occurred earlier this year: CASA is not there to serve the industry as its  customers; CASA is there to regulate the industry. It is the policeman; it is not there to facilitate or foster aviation. We did have a piece of legislation earlier in the parliament whereby a change to the objectives was made with us recording our disquiet at the particular change, even though we did not in the end seek to knock the legislation off.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The objectives of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority should not be to foster, facilitate or promote aviation. That should be a role that is performed by others. The objectives of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority should be essentially to regulate the industry, to protect passengers and to protect people on the ground who may in some way be affected by accidents or aviation activities. That is a fundamental philosophical difference between ourselves and the government. I do not think it is particularly germane to the current piece of legislation that is before us, but it is worth noting that, ultimately, all issues in this area do come back to a philosophical base of difference about precisely what sort of role or approach we should be taking to the question of aviation safety administration. I commend the bill to the Main Committee. The opposition supports the bill.

         The air charter industry, in particular, is important to both the economic and social fabric of the Northern Territory and it is important that charter operators and their customers are aware of their obligations and rights. It is also important to ensure that large domestic airlines operating around the country are subject to stringent safety standards and compensation measures. No&amp;hyphen;one can forget the horrors of the recent air crashes involving small operators. The Seaview plane which crashed in 1994 en route to Lord Howe Island claimed nine lives. The Monarch plane which crashed near Young in New South Wales killed seven people. Four lives were lost just recently in Katherine. These shocking and avoidable accidents highlight some of the problems of the system, particularly in relation to air safety standards and compensation claims. The families of the victims of these crashes face long and complex proceedings in order to access what was very limited compensation for their loss. A number of initiatives have been introduced in the past three years to address these deficiencies.

         The minister for transport currently has the authority to demand that operators provide evidence of insurance arrangements consistent with the requirements under the act.

Insurance is required under the carriers' liability act. Our amendments will ensure that CASA would then have the power to suspend or cancel AOCs if this condition were breached. AOCs are used by CASA to regulate safety in the aviation industry.

         I have a great interest in the liberalisation of the development of the charter industry in this country.

         Whether they are used to carry supplies out to people living in remote areas not serviced by roads, or when roads are under water for long periods of time as a result of the wet season, or whether they are used to carry tourists to the many famous natural attractions in the territory, the charter industry is very important. The Top End of the territory, in areas like Kakadu, is at its best during the wet season, and charter flights over the park to view the waterfalls and the escarpment are very popular.

         In fact, the Northern Territory Tourist Commission has had a promotion over the last few years suggesting that tourists see the territory in the wet, because the wet season has many wonders and a natural grace in the different climatic conditions. I suppose a lot of people in the southern capitals think, `We can't go to the Northern Territory because it rains every day during the wet season,' but that is not quite right. We are almost into the wet season in the territory now, and today it will have a clear blue sky and a temperature of some 30 degrees. The humidity might be about 82 per cent.

If I may elaborate a little further, Mr Deputy Speaker, as the member for the Northern Territory I have to use charter services to get into the very remote areas of the territory that are probably some five to six hours away from major communities. The only way to get to them is by air charter, and I am very pleased to know that we are putting mechanisms in place to ensure that proper compensation factors are there, not just for myself but more so for the other people who are normally travelling in the aircraft with me. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) did make a point when he said that on this topic I would probably be one of the most experienced people in the parliament because of the number of charters that I would use.

Health and community workers, building contractors and medical evacuations also rely on air charter services. I welcomed in June 1996 the introduction of updated guidelines for charter flights in Australia. Charter airlines in remote Australia have the potential to provide some healthy competition to scheduled airlines, particularly in the area of tourism. There are operators in the territory looking at expanding their services into tourism, and this legislation will ensure consumers can have every confidence in their safety.

         I am also particularly excited by the potential for expansion of tourism in Central Australia. Alice Springs is a two&amp;hyphen;hour flight from all Australian capital cities, and with the natural beauty of the area there is scope for increased charter services. While this bill essentially makes only mechanical changes to carriers' liability insurance arrangements, it will strengthen enforcement of the scheme and streamline its administration by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. This legislation will ensure that passengers can feel confident that carriers in this very competitive industry are now required to uphold a higher standard of safety enforceable by larger fines  or suspension, and that they can access adequate levels of compensation in the event of an accident. I commend the bill to the House.

         In fact, the subject of their lobbying involving civil aviation was Badgerys Creek airport. It is true to say that if Badgerys Creek were to go ahead then planes coming under the provisions of this act would be required to have that level of mandatory insurance per passenger. However, I have to say that I sincerely hope that there is never a claim from a passenger catching a plane at Badgerys Creek, not because I believe in the very fine safety record we have in this country but because I hope the airport at Badgerys Creek never goes ahead. What so many of my constituents are concerned about, rather than the $500,000 compensation in the event of a fatality, is the fact that their lifestyles are going to be changed so unalterably.

         Just the other day I had an answer to a question from the Minister for Education, the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp),  confirming that, by using a methodology that is not disclosed, some 63 schools would be affected if Badgerys Creek were to go ahead under one of the options. It is a pity that the department was not a little bit more frank and disclosed exactly how many students that translated into. I have used a very conservative methodology and found that it is in the order of 35,000 students who would suffer educational disadvantage in the western suburbs of Sydney should that airport go ahead. I need to say, because the methodology is not disclosed, that I suspect that the figure of 63 schools is very, very conservative.

         We have in the Main Committee today the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), a person who takes a great deal of interest in educational issues. I do not have to convince him that students in the western suburbs of Sydney already suffer educational disadvantage and that the challenge of providing them with an equality of opportunity is great enough under present circumstances without another overlay. I am sure he would be horrified if in the city of Adelaide there was a measure that would add educational disadvantage to 35,000 students.

         My concern is that the people who now strongly advocate an airport at Badgerys Creek and who want this legislation to come into effect for passengers who might alight at Badgerys Creek are in the main from the inner city area or from North Sydney. What I find most  objectionable in their approach is that while they tell the House repeatedly about the disadvantage that they suffer in terms of noise and air pollution as a result of operations at Kingsford Smith airport, they have the temerity to tell us in the western suburbs of Sydney what we should accept in terms of noise pollution, air pollution, or even educational disadvantage.

         I also put on notice a question to the member for Gwydir, Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) as the minister representing the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill), about air pollution and, more particularly, the standards relating to fine particle pollution. Some may say, `So what', but fine particle pollution is that matter in the atmosphere that lodges in people's lungs that they are unable to discharge.

         It is not like smoking where, providing the person is sufficiently young, if you give up smoking there is a chance that the lungs may not further degenerate and indeed they may to some extent recover. With fine particle pollution, what lodges in the lungs stays there forever. In the western suburbs of Sydney, we not only have a treasury of young people—Australia's
         <break page="11398" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         If, given that situation, fine particle pollution is increased amongst the population much longer&amp;hyphen;term health problems are going to be caused. Although this bill offers $500,000 in the event of a passenger dying as a result of an accident, there is no compensation being offered to those children or adults as a result of any fine particle pollution. This is an area, too, that is in a sense relatively new amongst the public health experts. For example, there is really not an international standard in terms of trying to ensure that fine particle pollution does not exceed a certain level—in fact, the World Health Organisation stresses that it is only guidelines. Probably the United States has the toughest regime and, whilst Australia at federal and state government levels is trying to work through some Australian standards, it is the case that those standards have yet to be set for Australia and therefore for the EIS at Badgerys Creek.

         I have said on a number of occasions in this place that I am very much opposed to an airport at Badgerys Creek. I suppose I could argue that I merely reflect the views of my constituents but I would be remiss in not mentioning the two councils—Blacktown City Council and Penrith City Council—and all the state members who are in the western suburbs of Sydney, not only in my own area but broadly across the western suburbs of Sydney. They include quite a number of ministers in the Labor state government.

         The EIS is due for release in December and we have got a three&amp;hyphen;month period in which people can respond. I think it is also fair to say that when you release something in December you are really hitting the silly season. People are focusing on Christmas and the holiday period and really do not function again until about February. This poses a real problem if we are to get meaningful participation in the EIS process which I think is absolutely critical. I sincerely hope—and indeed that is what I was talking to the alliance about—that our biggest challenge really is not particularly lobbying federal ministers or the coalition members, who I wish would stand up and be counted, or the opposition who live in or represent the western suburbs of Sydney seats. The real issue for us in the EIS is ensuring that the mums and dads of western Sydney really understand the issues involved.

I went there, and it is one of my pleasures—and I think it is a pleasure that all federal members enjoy—to go to a school and talk to young schoolchildren. Rather than it being a one&amp;hyphen;way conversation, I always ensure that the students have plenty of opportunities to question me about the issues that are of most concern to them.

I always say that, when you speak to young children, they are a much tougher audience than are adults, because their questions are so direct. I congratulate them on that. I also congratulate the school on preparing a petition about Badgerys Creek and getting it signed. I have always said, if we want to just set aside the issue, that our young Australians are much more aware and knowledgeable than we were at their age.

The first is by authorising the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to administer directly both the Commonwealth Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act and complementary state legislation rather than be under delegation from the Commonwealth and state ministers responsible for transport. The second is by allowing Australian governments to self&amp;hyphen;insure their risks under the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act instead of requiring them to take out commercial insurance. The third is by imposing conditions upon air operator certificates, which require that the operators continue to hold a mandatory non&amp;hyphen;voidable passenger liability insurance required by the carriers' liability act, and empowering CASA to suspend or cancel air operator certificates for breach of those conditions.

         It is true that the terrible Monarch crash in Young in 1993 highlighted some extraordinary difficulties that arise in relation to obtaining compensation for people who have been bereaved by the loss of loved ones and also who have suffered loss and damage consequent upon the deaths of people who were killed in that very sad crash in 1993. It is only too true that, time and again over the years, insurers have avoided liability in this area by pleading technicalities, by arguing that the airline concerned had violated safety regulations, sometimes on very technical grounds, sometimes on much more overtly and obviously unsafe grounds.

         This is a real area of avoidance mechanisms for insurers. It certainly did insurers no credit over the years, in my view, in the way that they have avoided liability and pleaded various technicalities to avoid paying just compensation to people affected. We do not have, fortunately, many crashes in Australia. Indeed, given that there are 40 million passenger movements every year, international and domestic, we have a remarkably good safety record.

          This morning, I picked up my ticket to return to Brisbane and looked at the back of the ticket. I took some copies of it. I have never read the conditions on the back—I dare say most of us rarely have—but when you look at those conditions, you find some very interesting fine print. I think one area where perhaps some future international action is required is in relation to international passengers. There, the limit of liability, including costs, is $75,000. Here, we are talking about half a million dollars.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I think that that is not having regard to costs either, so we have costs on top of that. But here, including costs, is a limit of liability of US$75,000, which is just extraordinarily absurd, and a figure in relation to a matter involving loss of life and consequent loss to relatives and dependants of people who are killed in accidents. It is certainly something that needs to be looked at and done at an international level to bring some reality into those sorts of figures. I would imagine there would rarely be anyone who would take legal action on where costs were not added on to an amount as low as that. Seventy&amp;hyphen;five thousand dollars is what you would be bound to pay in costs before really blinking on an action like that, so I think it is really absurd when one looks at that. Perhaps that is something that we should look at in the future.

          I was going to mention too the question of air safety and the change in routes and how that can affect electorates. Recently, I had a meeting with officials responsible for air traffic control in Brisbane, arising out of some complaints I received from my electorate, where there had been a shifting of aircraft routes. That involved aircraft as they were coming into Brisbane, as they were descending. Previously, a couple of years ago, they were passing through the electorate of the honourable member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro) and further out east of that—in fact, over Deception Bay and into Brisbane that way—where there was little effect.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          But because of changes in the last couple of years, the route now—the tracking of those aircraft coming in—has moved it into areas such as Bray Park and Warner, and that has occasioned a lot of personal anguish by people living in the area. I say this from the point of view of people who have bought properties on the basis that there is not an air traffic noise problem; they now find themselves with an air traffic noise problem, a devaluation of their properties.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I understand the air safety implications of these things, that there is the need to shift these tracks from time to time. But what I would urge upon those responsible for air safety is to  set up a register whereby people who are buying properties could search a register that would be maintained by air safety authorities or CASA itself to determine whether or not properties were affected by air traffic. It is not just the air traffic noise. There is also a potential danger, a remote one, of aircraft coming down and causing havoc on the ground. So it is important that a register be set up so that people buying properties can have their solicitors search a register to determine whether particular areas are going to be subject to air path travel. That is something we should look at.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I understand that after the meeting with those officials, because of concern in my electorate, a committee was in existence where people could make complaints to the particular committees about traffic movements. I did notice, however, when looking at the committee, that there was no representative from the Pine Rivers Shire Council in my electorate on that committee, which I found quite extraordinary because this particular path is now going straight through my electorate and it does not touch certain areas where there are representatives on the committee. I thought that was an inequity. I call upon the minister to look into this matter.
          <break page="11401" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           In fact, I have had some preliminary discussions with his office about it already. That is a matter that has to be looked at in terms of overall safety, both in the air and also on the ground.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The issue of air safety is one where Australia can justly be proud, but it is obviously one where we can never rest on our laurels. We must ensure that those people who travel are adequately protected, more particularly their relatives because, as of course it is fairly trite to say, very few people do survive air crashes. Air crashes are obviously most serious and survival rates are extremely low. The families of the victims are often left in dire positions because of those incidents, as the Monarch and the Seaview crashes demonstrated recently. We have to make sure that our legislation is designed to ensure that people who travel—the 40 million who travel on our routes in Australia every year—feel good and feel safe in terms of the compensation side of things for their families, as well as those who are looking to ensure that their safety in the air is protected by the great safety record that we do have in this country.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Putting all of that together, this legislation is useful legislation, with the reservation that I have made, which may not be one that need concern us too much; it may be a matter that will be explained fairly simply. I would urge the minister to consider very urgently that question of a register for people who live on affected ground. I know that members in the Main Committee today are also very concerned about air traffic movements and so forth. It may be something that, as a concerted effort, we can look at so that people who purchase properties are given notice of where air traffic is going to be and where it is perhaps even likely to be, because changes can also have a great effect, as was shown in my own electorate. I commend this legislation to the House and would urge that all members support it.

          which is essentially about giving insurance to people on planes. But there is a second group of people who should not be excluded, and they are the people on the ground that the planes fly over. In my electorate of Grayndler, which is the most densely populated area in Australia and the most aircraft noise affected area in Australia, the residents I represent would want me to make a contribution on the issue of aviation safety and the impact of aircraft continually flying above their homes, schools and communities.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I want to make a couple of points in particular because the long&amp;hyphen;term operating plan of Sydney airport comes into being on 4 December of this year. It is the result of substantial community consultation, but I think that it will also raise some considerable disappointment from some of my constituents. In terms of the plan, I do not suggest that runways should be closed; I do not suggest that one section of the community should be subject to the totality of the noise. I certainly acknowledge that the chair of the Sydney Airport Community Forum, Joe Hockey, the member for North Sydney, has worked quite hard in listening to people's concerns.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Nonetheless, the major problem with the plan, as I have continually pointed out, is the number of take&amp;hyphen;offs to the north on the main runway. There will be at least four flight paths veering off to the north&amp;hyphen;west of the airport so that they will go over suburbs such as Dulwich Hill and Ashfield and four flight paths over the electorate of Lowe. This is contrary to the commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) when launching Putting People First, the coalition's airport policy, during the election campaign, which was launched in the electorate of Lowe, where he promised there would be no new flight paths.
        </para>
        <break page="11402" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          The people who will suffer after 4 December have a right to question why this is the case. I think it is the case because, clearly, if you have landings from the north, as opposed to take&amp;hyphen;offs to the north, landings from the north have to go in a straight line for a considerable distance and therefore effectively have to fly over the electorate of Bennelong, the Prime Minister's electorate. Clearly, what is occurring is take&amp;hyphen;offs being favoured to the north because then you can spray them off to the north&amp;hyphen;west and therefore put them over the western part of my electorate—my electorate cops it anyway—and over the electorate of Lowe. It is not appropriate to have partisan politics reaching the flight path decisions.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          At this point I would like to indicate that the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) has actually written to people in my electorate quoting me selectively in saying that there are many admirable things about the government's plan in terms of greater fairness of aircraft movements. I do not shy at the fact that I think that the major political parties have all failed the residents of Sydney in failing to build a second Sydney airport and in failing to operate flight paths in an equitable way in the past. I think also that the grandstanding from minor parties and independents, who seem to be more concerned with that grandstanding than with actually achieving change, very much means that the No Aircraft Noise Party and the Greens have been part of the problem, not part of the solution.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          So I do not shy at the fact that, as much as in adversary politics we are supposed to say that everything the government does is bad and everything that the Labor Party stands for is good, I have not taken that attitude on the issue of aircraft noise because I think that that attitude is not honest. Whilst this government is here for the short term, I will continue to work as best I can and make a constructive contribution to try to represent my constituents.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I put on the record here in the House, as I have said privately to the member for Lowe, that I do not believe that it is in his interests as a marginal seat holder to start a letter writing campaign in my electorate. If that occurs, the marginal member for Lowe will receive substantial letters from me, as the member for Grayndler, in the very safe Labor heartland of the inner west of Sydney. I do not think he will be as comfortable about me writing to his constituents quoting the situation of the Prime Minister's commitments and the breach of those commitments as I am about him selectively quoting what I have said in the House. I put that on the record. As a matter of courtesy, I indicated to him that I intended to put that on the record and I have indicated to him that I will be sending this speech to Mr Dominic Ogburn, for one, of Dulwich Hill and others to whom he has written and selectively quoted me.

           —I will, of course, come back to the bill, Madam Deputy Speaker, as I note every other speaker in this chamber so far has referred to the bill in a minor way. I congratulate and thank the minister for visiting my electorate of Sydenham, the area most affected by aircraft noise of any area close to the airport in Sydney. The minister spent a morning, along with the member for North Sydney, and met with the local council to discuss the Sydenham project and what will happen to the area that has been demolished because it was uninhabitable due to the level of aircraft noise. The minister gave Marrickville council a good hearing about the open space project and community facilities which should be provided there.

          The minister also met with people whose houses have been insulated in Sydenham. They are weatherboard houses in Unwins Bridge Road, on which the government has spent $45,000.
          <break page="11403" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           The government may as well have burnt this money because you cannot insulate weatherboard houses which are close to the airport. The insulation has had a minimal impact on the level of noise.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The minister saw first&amp;hyphen;hand the situation and discussed it with residents. I urge the minister to make a decision. Only yesterday, I got a phone call from a woman who owns a weatherboard house on the corner of Henry and George streets in Sydenham. She has to make a decision. She is under pressure to get her home insulated if it is not going to be the subject of voluntary acquisition. Even from an economic rationalist perspective, it is absurd for the government, whether this government or the previous government, to spend what is now $47,000 insulating a weatherboard house. The only thing to do is to knock it over and build a new home. In a very limited way, the offer of voluntary acquisition, which I have campaigned for, should be supported by the government as an issue of compassion on the grounds of economic rationality and commonsense. I urge the minister to make a decision, based upon his own first&amp;hyphen;hand observations of what is required.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The minister also met with small businesses which have a legitimate claim for compensation. Over half of the small businesses in Sydenham, of which there were approximately 17, have closed since the opening of a third runway and since the acquisition of the houses. Commonsense suggests that, if you acquire 151 houses from a local community, the newsagent, the post office, the hot food bar, the hardware and the florist shop will close because homes have been taken out of that local village style of community. The small businesses there not only have not been eligible for insulation but also have got no compensation whatsoever. By and large, they are families, many of them of Greek origin, which came to Australia in the postwar period. They built up their small businesses and, due to outrageous government decisions—unfortunately supported by both major political parties—to build the third runway, they have suffered. They are entitled to just compensation. I urge the minister to make the decision on that issue as well.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I raise the issue of Sydenham in particular because I want to draw to the minister's attention what we could call a tale of two cities. On the one hand we have this working&amp;hyphen;class community in Sydenham, who have suffered greatly, yet in spite of what they had suffered the minister was well received. They were appreciative of anything that they got in terms of someone from government showing enough care to actually go down and visit people and see what the problems are. On the other hand you have the community of Woollahra, who seem to believe, through the mayor, Councillor Greg Medcraft, that there is some correlation between people's income and property values, and their level of hearing.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The people of Sydenham do not argue for no planes. They do not argue, `Shut Sydney airport.' They are people from outside the area, by and large. They know that Sydney does have aviation needs, and they do not argue the case. However, there has been a concerted, well&amp;hyphen;funded campaign by the Woollahra council and by some of the elite private schools in the eastern suburbs to suggest that they should be aircraft free, that there should be no planes whatsoever over their communities.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In a letter from Councillor Medcraft to all the residents of his municipality, of course the issue which is highlighted is a significant reduction in property values. He has argued on radio, as we hear and see from transcripts as well, that the real problem is that these are million&amp;hyphen;dollar houses that we are talking about, these are the elite of the community. These are lawyers and doctors, and very important citizens. I happen to believe that my constituents of Sydenham
          <break page="11404" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           are just as important as his constituents in Woollahra, and the planes are going to be a hell of a lot higher in the air when they are over the eastern suburbs than when they fly over Sydenham and Marrickville.

          I remember, during a previous visit of the SACF to Sydenham, a resident of Turramurra saying to one of the residents of Sydenham, `Well, I think the planes are just as loud in Turramurra as they are here.' Well, they are a hell of a lot quieter when they are thousands of feet up in the air. The reality is that the chair of the Sydney Airport Community Forum will have support from me, as a Labor Party representative, in arguing that Woollahra has to cop its share of noise and will have support from me in arguing that the rich private schools in the eastern suburbs do not have greater hearing needs or greater ability or greater desire to be aircraft free than does Tempe High School or does Dulwich Hill Primary School, or does St Paul of the Cross at Dulwich Hill, or does St Brigid's at Marrickville, where the planes are a lot louder.

          I went with the chair of the Sydney Airport Community Forum and many other people, including His Eminence Cardinal Clancy of Sydney, to the opening of a noise insulation project at St Pius at Enmore. It is symptomatic of why I am proud to represent my electorate and why I would prefer to represent my electorate than the people of Woollahra, because people there were just pleased to have got a few crumbs from the table in terms of an insulation project. It was multiculturalism at its best. The Catholic school there has done a fantastic job in working with the government and working with the community to ensure that the impact of the noise on the education of the students there is minimised. The school has worked with government, both the previous government and the current government, to achieve that. The opening on the Friday night was indeed a splendid occasion.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I am not saying that I do not have sympathy with people from Woollahra or Hunters Hill. As someone who lives in Marrickville, I have sympathy with people who suffer from aircraft noise, but I suggest—and I say this to the media as well—that the media is much more prepared to report the noise problems of a rich, elite private school in the eastern suburbs than they are to report the noise problems of the local Catholic school in my electorate. That is a tragedy, because it distorts the picture and invokes a perception that somehow the elite of Sydney deserve better treatment than anyone else. My concern about the number of take&amp;hyphen;offs  to the north and therefore the protection of the electorate of Bennelong at the expense of my electorate and the electorate of Lowe comes from that perspective.

          Because previous speakers have raised Badgerys Creek, I want to conclude by saying this: the Labor Party's policy was, and is, to support an airport at Badgerys Creek, subject to an environmental impact statement. The draft ALP platform released by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, last Friday supports a second airport in Sydney, subject again to an environmental impact statement. I am very confident that, with the support of myself and the member for Watson (Mr McLeay) and other fair dinkum people, the January national conference of the Labor Party will support that proposition.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          If we are talking about the impact of aircraft noise in the very short term rather than in the long term, we can argue about where flight paths should be, but the reality is that a second Sydney airport is absolutely necessary. Governments have backed away from actually building it, but it has been on the plans since 1986 when the Labor Party made its decision.

          I certainly will continue to support an airport at Badgerys Creek and I will continue to support the Labor Party's policy and to campaign for its implementation. It is unfortunate that

           some of my colleagues take a view that they do not have to do that. Perhaps, for a member of the Left, that is a useful precedent in terms of the attitude towards party policy and whether or not it is binding. But if people insist on essentially putting forward their own views then they are not being fair dinkum.

          I do not call for the closure of Sydney airport because of the jobs that Sydney airport creates and because I am realistic. But other people have a responsibility as well to agree that Sydney airport does have problems, that planes do make noise and, yes, that these factors will have impacts. Let us work together to ensure that the impact on residents is absolutely minimised, whether it be at Sydney airport or at a new western Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek.

         This government is determined to ensure that the people of Australia can rely on the highest standards in aviation safety regulation and that those in charge of that regulatory function have the appropriate qualifications. This government is presently involved in a fundamental and comprehensive review of civil aviation in Australia. The review involves the full participation of the industry itself through a series of technical committees which have as their focus the rewriting of rules to ensure that they are comprehensible and consistent.

         This government also demands full accountability from our airline operators, and the  Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 1997  addresses the issue of aviation consumer protection by enhancing the scheme, providing uniform, non&amp;hyphen;voidable national insurance coverage for fare paying aircraft passengers and including intrastate as well as international and interstate air travel.

         The full purpose of this legislation is to amend the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959, the Civil Aviation Act 1988 and other aviation related legislation to allow this initiative to take the fullest possible force in the protection of aviation consumers anywhere in Australia. This is a national initiative and it will make it mandatory for all commercial airline operators—international, domestic and now intrastate—to carry non&amp;hyphen;voidable passenger liability insurance of $500,000 per passenger.

This tragedy occurred in February 1980 when 12 passengers on board an Advance Airlines of Australia commuter flight from Sydney to Temora died when their aircraft crashed just after take&amp;hyphen;off at Mascot airport.

That has not helped the victims of the Monarch crash, who are still waiting for acknowledgment and settlement of their claims against the insurer  of the operator. The changes to the legislation were made largely necessary because of the disgraceful treatment they have suffered, and still suffer, at the hands of the Monarch's insurer.

           This bill is a further important part of the government's ongoing commitment towards the protection of all Australians who travel by air across our vast country. In January 1996, the government made a legislative requirement for all domestic and international airline operators to have non&amp;hyphen;voidable passenger insurance cover of $500,000 a passenger. However, only interstate and international travel was covered by that legislation. Later in 1996 the states, actively encouraged by the federal government, passed legislation to extend the protection to passengers on intrastate travel.

           Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 1997

          amends the civil aviation legislative regime, and its purpose is to amend the mandatory passenger liability insurance regime that is imposed upon the operators of aircraft in Australia. As a consequence, in general terms, it is linked to safety and passenger safety; but the notion of civil aviation also throws up the contrast which can be made with military aviation. I would like to make some general comments today in respect of civil aviation and Western Australia—in particular, Perth airport, and the operation of military aircraft in Western Australia, particularly from the RAAF base in Pearce.

         There is a connection with this bill, because it has as its substance the notion of passenger safety. For members of this house from Western Australia who may be familiar with the operation of Perth airport, Perth airport is immediately to the south of the RAAF Pearce base. One of the difficulties that air traffic controllers have in the operation of Perth airport—as that goes to the amelioration of noise, the safety of passengers, and the safety of civil aviation—is with the configuration of the Perth air space for civil aviation and the RAAF Pearce military air space.

         In recent years, since I became the member for Perth, I have drawn to the attention of the Civil Aviation Authority the difficulty that the juxtaposition of that airspace causes for residents in the suburb of Beechboro.

         A reconfiguration of the airspace between Perth and Pearce does have great potential to improve the usage of Perth airport and to ameliorate adverse noise consequences for those residents who live around Perth airport, particularly to the north and the north&amp;hyphen;east.

         Aircraft that now depart on the main Perth airport runway—runway 01—to the north, which occurs more often in the summer with the north&amp;hyphen;easterly wind prevailing in Perth, are now forced, because of the configuration of the Perth&amp;hyphen;Pearce airspace, to veer to the west immediately after the suburb of Beechboro. A better configuration which will arise, hopefully, out of this agreement will see there no longer being a need for aircraft taking off to the north to deviate to the west. As a consequence, that will leave the suburb of Beechboro in a much better situation so far as aircraft noise is concerned.

         Close consultation with local government is required, because Perth airport does have the advantage of a very well&amp;hyphen;developed Perth Municipalities Airport Group, which is made up of representatives of a number of relevant local authorities. The ones that I mention today include

         It may also be the case that the residents of the suburbs of South Guildford and Guildford, who are, in very many respects, those residents of the suburbs around Perth airport to the north of the airport most adversely affected by airport noise, may well see some slight amelioration of aircraft noise as a consequence of these prospective changes. I regard this as a good development but very much as the start of the process.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I look forward to those detailed consultations, which I hope will have the effect of improving the operation of civil aviation around Perth airport and the operations of military aircraft around Pearce military RAAF base. Also, in the context of this legislation, it should have a good impact so far as the safety of the operation of those respective aircraft is concerned. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), the opposition spokesman on these matters, has made clear our general support of these provisions. I commend the bill to the chamber.

           Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 1997

          is basically to rectify deficiencies that exist in relation to the protection of those travelling and, of course, for the families of passengers on commercial aircraft. This bill fixes a problem that has existed in the country for far too long. Everybody who is a fare&amp;hyphen;paying passenger on an aircraft has the right to expect safe conduct of the flight and to arrive at the destination safely with minimal risk to life and limb, and as efficiently as operationally possible.

        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill addresses one of the many areas that need to be addressed to make aviation safer and efficient for all. These amendments are necessary because of the lack of attention paid to aviation by the previous Labor government. Aviation is a vital and necessary facet of the Australian way of life. Most Australians have used and will use the major airlines in this country to travel during their lives.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To get to the heart of the matter, it is one thing to say that it is unfortunate that we need to have a passenger carrying aircraft crash before we see the inadequacies of the current  passenger liability insurance arrangements fixed, but it is bordering on criminal to allow the problem not only to continue but to allow further aircraft accidents to happen without taking any legislative or regulatory action. This is what the previous Labor government allowed to happen. The Monarch Airlines crash at Young in New South Wales in 1993 killed seven people. We could discuss whether the aircraft was airworthy, but that is not the purpose of this amendment and has been canvassed in this place on many previous occasions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What makes this negligence by the former Labor government even more despicable is that the then shadow minister, the member for Hume (Mr Sharp), made the then Labor minister for Transport, the member for Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton), fully aware of the consequences of non&amp;hyphen;action, and that more might die. Guess what happened next? After the Monarch crash in 1993, we saw the Seaview crash on 2 October 1994. The then Labor government was made fully aware from sources all over the country, and in this very chamber, that these crashes were likely to happen.

         In this modern era, it takes more than just being a well&amp;hyphen;meaning person with a good heart to be involved in making decisions. We need to have the capacity and technical competence
         <break page="11411" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          to grasp the complexities of aviation. This is where the former Labor government fell short by appointing non&amp;hyphen;aviation people to the CASA—the Civil Aviation Safety Authority—board. Not only did it mean that the board did not have people who were able to make value judgments on aviation, but it sent the wrong message to the aviation community, that the government did not take aviation seriously.

         What the coalition has done is appointed people to the board who are sufficiently qualified—people like Mr Dick Smith. Mr Dick Smith was not appointed because he was a nice bloke or a mate—this was not a job for the boys, as happened under the previous Labor government—but because he had sufficient aviation experience. I commend the appointment of Mr Dick Smith to the position. Not only is he an experienced pilot; he is a person who has the willingness and the capacity to make difficult decisions.

         What this amendment is about is ensuring that passengers of regular public transport can have the benefit of increased passenger liability insurance. During the Labor years, until October 1994, the maximum amount of cover for death or injury would have been $180,000. I ask you: what would $180,000 do for a family losing a breadwinner or facing the economic cost incurred in losing a home maker? If the surviving family invested $180,000 at bank interest of, say, five per cent, then the interest income would be $9,000 a year, or $180 a week. No&amp;hyphen;one could be expected to live on that. It was as a result of the efforts of the member for Hume, John Sharp, in particular and of the conservative parties in general during 1994 that the limit was increased to $500,000. Further, in 1995 legislation introduced mandatory no&amp;hyphen;fault insurance cover.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is the general approach and attitude of this government to consult and consider the opinion of all the stakeholders who are affected by legislation. In keeping with this philosophy, we have contacted the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. Mr Bart Beech, who is the executive officer of AOPA, has made us fully aware of some of the anomalies that this amendment may cause. I think it is only fair enough, if we are going to introduce legislation, that we ensure that it has been put across the community, and consultation and comment has been given.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Although everybody involved in the aviation industry is positive about this amendment, there are some complications that occur because of the nature of the aviation industry. It is important  to understand that in many cases the owner of the aircraft is not the operator and the provider of the passenger services. Many times the aircraft is hired to the operator by the owner, and the operator conducts the charter or the airline business. So there is an anomaly as to who, in effect, should be the holder of the insurance. Should it be the owner of the aircraft, or the provider of the passenger service?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The interpretation given by regulators of the act, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, is that the carrier is the provider of the passenger service and that that person has the responsibility of providing insurance. This could cause the need for both the owner and the operator to hold separate insurance policies for the same cover. In fact, at time of claim, since there would only be one claim, it is possible that the insurance companies could have a legal battle between themselves as to who is going to actually pay the claim. As Bart Beech says:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         There is one aspect of the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act which is causing considerable problems to many operators and which is not addressed in the amendments . . .
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         and he alludes in detail to this anomaly. He goes further to add:
        </para>
        <break page="11412" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para font-size="-=2">
          . . . the spirit of the Act which is to ensure passengers are carried by non voidable insurance . . . and the actual requirement of the Act for carriers to hold insurance.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          The problem is that it is usual for the aircraft owner to hold the insurance, and this could cause real problems. If the owner who already has in place an appropriate insurance on the aircraft hires that aircraft to the carrier, the current interpretation by CASA is that the holder of the passenger liability insurance should be held by the carrier. The reality is that this may not be possible. The problem could simply be solved if there were a slight change in the wording, such as `It is a requirement for the insurance to be in place—not necessarily to be contracted by the carrier, but simply so that the carrier is responsible to ensure that the non&amp;hyphen;voidable insurance is in place.'
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I return to the matter of the amount of $500,000 insurance. Although the Labor government increased the insurance, I wonder how the government actually came about the figure of $500,000. It sounds impressive—it is half a million dollars—but does it provide for the family of the victims of aircraft accidents so that they could maintain the lifestyle that would have been in existence if the passenger were still alive and providing for the family? If we invested half a million dollars at bank interest at, say, five per cent, we would get an investment income of $25,000 per annum. This does not take into account any personal or home loans that may need to be paid out, the cost of education, or allowances for increases in the cost of living. I find it timely to encourage people to consider their financial needs in case of death or injury, and to seek advice on how best to protect themselves, whether by insurance or financial investment, because the likelihood exists that there could be a higher financial need than the amendment actually provides for.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Furthermore, it would be important that passengers recognise their common law rights and have the right to take further legal action against the airline operator. I have the view that the amendment should include a clause which allows for regular increases in the cost of living without the need to change the legislation. It is quite a task to get legislation to recognise that need exists for continual adjustment. As time changes, legislation needs to change, as well. A good example of this is to look back and see how long it has actually taken this amendment to come before the House. It would be more efficient to include, for the people in charge of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority or whichever department is going to be responsible for regulating this legislation, the option that the level of mandatory insurance be increased in step  with the consumer price index. My reading of the amendment is that the level of cover of $500,000 is the maximum ceiling for death or injury and may mean that in the case of injury, the full $500,000 may not be paid. In the case of total disablement, there is not only the loss of income and saving capacity, but also the extra cost required for ongoing care and use of facilities.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The legislation needs to clarify exactly what amounts are paid, under what circumstances and at what level of injury, with the option that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority can alter the requirements as circumstances arise. Although the need for insurance is very necessary, it is quite simply a fall back or last resort situation. I would prefer that the occasion never came about where my wife collected the insurance money, because that would mean that I could be at best injured or at worst dead.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As a pilot, I have studied many aircraft accidents where the aircraft have hit the deck. There is not much give because the aircraft hit at such a fast pace. If an aircraft is in an uncontrolled descent, people do not often walk away.

           The member for Hume, in his capacity as shadow minister for transport while the Labor government was in office, on many occasions in this place alluded to instances where, under the old Civil Aviation Authority, certain airworthiness inspectors were not as diligent in their duties as the law provided and, in some cases, they flouted the law. This was an obstruction to air safety, despite all the funds and all the infrastructure that was in place.

           It takes more than a change of name and some restructuring to make an effective Civil Aviation Safety Authority. It takes the right people, with the right expertise and the right attitude. To get that, you need the right leadership. The Labor government was not about providing the right leadership.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Although many may think this amendment is a simple formality, in reality it is more than that. It is sending a message that we are serious about aviation and about providing leadership. From a private flying and small carrier perspective, one of the biggest threats to aviation safety is the high cost of flying, which prevents pilots from being able to fly enough hours to maintain competency. People not involved in aviation assume that flying aeroplanes is naturally a costly exercise. This does not need to be so.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           I will give some examples of things which unnecessarily add to the cost of flying. Firstly, there are some burdensome airworthiness directives and certification requirements required by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, which are already completed in other countries, particularly in the USA, from where most small aircraft are imported. So the work has already been done, but we are doing it again. This is nothing but an unnecessary, burdensome, administrative duplication of regulation.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Secondly, we have overly complex and restrictive regulations which require the widespread issue of exemptions. These exemptions are granted on an individual basis, giving enormous power to CASA officers. I believe that there is room to simplify the regulations without compromising safety. In fact, I would be prepared to say that making the act more complex and complicated could jeopardise safety.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Thirdly, we have a legislative monopoly in the provision of aviation services. If these services could be exposed to competition, it may be that we would have reduced costs, with increased efficiencies and effectiveness as well.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Finally, Australia has a vast amount of military airspace which causes aircraft to divert, and this adds unnecessarily to the high cost of flight. We need to consistently review the existing regulations with a more focused, more results orientated approach. The review must be undertaken by people who know what they are basically doing. Obviously, the review  must be undertaken by people who do not have vested interests in maintaining their jobs and by people who understand aviation. The objective must be safety and efficiency.

         Surely the people of western Sydney have a right to expect the Howard government is being advised about Badgerys Creek in a manner that is sensitive to their needs and concerns. The people of western Sydney have a right to expect that, just as airport passengers have liability insurance covered—as this bill outlines correctly and astutely—those who have the ear of our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development will display at least a modicum of consideration as to how an international airport will affect their lives so dramatically.

         This founding member of the John Stuart Mill Society, a man who likes to be seen as championing the cause of small `l' liberalism in Australia, is an arch authoritarian on this issue. He wants us to blindly follow his view that we should build that airport at Badgerys Creek and that we should do it now. The member for North Sydney has exposed himself and sitting here today has shown us time and again the hypocrite he is on this issue. He ridicules colleagues of mine on this side of politics for rethinking their positions, for concluding that Badgerys Creek is not an appropriate site for an international airport, when underneath all the vitriol, behind the very hairy&amp;hyphen;chested performances in and outside the House, he knows what they are saying is the truth.

          —Mr Deputy Speaker, I am always pleased to cooperate with you. The reason why this debate is so passionate, and the reason why it is such an important debate, relates to the congestion and the safety concerns, at the end of the day, about the congestion at Kingsford Smith airport. There is no doubt that by 2005 Kingsford Smith airport will be operating at its peak—no doubt about it. As the member for Grayndler said a little bit earlier,  it is vitally important that the new flight paths that start at Kingsford Smith airport on 4 December represent a fair sharing of the noise. But of course safety is the primary concern when there are changes to flight paths put in place.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The flight paths which start on 4 December are a result of over 18 months of community consultation with thousands and thousands of submissions from the broader community, and we overlaid on those submissions the concepts and principles that we went to the last election promising: that is, a fair sharing of the noise—of course safety was the primary concern—trying to increase the number of movements over non&amp;hyphen;residential areas and water and, importantly, providing respite. That is what we promised, and it is a vital concern. I reiterate that safety is laid on top of that. I would like to publicly thank CASA for their support in the drafting and the preparations for the flight paths that come into effect on 4 December.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But the fundamental problem is that the congestion at Kingsford Smith airport is increasing. The fact is that there are more planes coming in. The government has introduced very responsible legislation that ensures that there is a legislated cap put in place that guarantees
         <break page="11423" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          regional airlines a certain number of slots in the slot apportionment. It ensures that at the end of the day Kingsford Smith has a final point.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         With that result, all we are doing as a government is putting in place what was Labor policy—that is, the commitment to a second airport at Badgerys Creek. I know that sits very uncomfortably with the member for Prospect. It sits uncomfortably because she has to realise that she was a part of the Labor government that was committed to Badgerys Creek, that chose the site in 1985, that went through a whole range of environmental studies—

That is, for example, that the mayor of Woollahra, who has absolutely no understanding whatsoever of aviation, distributed a letter to his residents recently saying that there will be one plane every seven minutes over the people of Woollahra between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m. He lied to the people of Woollahra.

         What it comes down to is that with new flight paths being introduced in Sydney—which I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, is the most important aviation gateway to Australia, a vital aviation gateway representing 40 per cent of domestic flights and 50 per cent of international flights—when irresponsible community leaders start running campaigns about the number of flights, or even safety concerns about those flights, then they are quite simply acting in a very irresponsible and negligent manner.

         May I take this opportunity, Mr Deputy Speaker, to reaffirm the commitments and the comments made by the member for Grayndler a little earlier about Woollahra Council. I am glad the member for Grayndler has come into the House at this stage because he has been a strong advocate for fairer flight paths, he has been a strong advocate for safe flight paths, and he is a strong advocate for Badgerys Creek. Unlike the member for Prospect, who seems to walk away from Labor Party policy, the member for Grayndler has been responsible. He has

We will continue to be committed to flight paths and aviation policy that is primarily safe, that is efficient and that ensures  that all the beneficiaries of an airport do suffer some of the pain associated with their operations.

         The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), the shadow minister, made some comments about the promotion and fostering function in relation to CASA. I am just a little surprised about that because he should be aware that the government has moved in recent amendments, and amendments that are before the other place at the moment in relation to amendments to the Air Services Act, that indeed the promotion and fostering function is very much with Airservices Australia, and I am just not sure in what context he was putting that.

But it seems that the shadow minister might be confused about who has responsibility for the promotion and fostering function. I am sure that he will cast his mind back to the comments made by former minister Sharp following the Monarch crash about the very strong need to separate CASA's responsibilities and, indeed, to put this safety aspect and the protection of the fare&amp;hyphen;paying public into an organisation that looks after that responsibly and solely. Airservices Australia has that, so I might need to have a chat with him after the debate about this apparent confusion.

         This bill makes a number of technical and minor policy amendments to the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act 1991. These amendments support this government's regulatory reform agenda as they help the authority take control of its business and prioritise its agenda.

         The Australia New Zealand Food Authority is a Commonwealth statutory authority which develops uniform food standards for Australia and New Zealand and undertakes related functions. It operates under a unique Commonwealth, New Zealand, state and territory partnership arrangement based upon a 1991 cooperative agreement in Australia and a 1995 treaty with New Zealand. These arrangements see standards, developed through the Authority's statutory processes, uniformly adopted by reference and without amendment into state, territory and New Zealand laws.

         The amendments seek to facilitate the cooperative arrangements between the governments and, at the same time, retain the community consultation, accountability, openness, transparency and timeliness which characterise the authority's operations. They give the authority greater flexibility in its operations, simplify and clarify its procedures, and confer powers appropriate to a modern statutory authority.

         The authority currently has a full&amp;hyphen;time chairperson who is also the chief executive.

This improved management structure will bring more accountability to the authority's operations and will enhance its capacity to provide leadership within the cooperative Commonwealth, New Zealand, state and territory food partnership.

These are matters which this government will continue to hold dear. I present the explanatory memorandum and the bill to the House.

         In 1995 this role was expanded when parliament passed amending legislation which enabled New Zealand to be represented on the board of the authority and within the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council, and so the Australia New Zealand Food Authority was born.

         The Australia New Zealand Food Authority plays a key role in our food industry by developing food standards, coordinating national food surveillance and recall systems, conducting research and assessing policies about imported food, and developing codes of practice within industry. It is the work of the authority which is largely responsible for Australia having one of the highest food safety records in the world.

         The issue of food standards and the way they are determined is paramount to my electorate of McEwen, where the food industry is the cornerstone of many local communities. McEwen is fortunate to have a strong and diverse food industry, which includes wine and grape growing, horticulture, sheep, poultry, beef, dairy industries and aquaculture. Any measures to streamline the operations of the authority and simplify procedures will have a direct benefit for producers within these industries, especially those in the electorate of McEwen.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The Australia New Zealand National Food Authority Act 1991 governs how the authority operates. Under its provisions the authority is required to follow complex processes for handling food standard applications. Anyone can make an application to the authority for a change to a standard. When an application is received, the authority embarks on a lengthy procedure which involves a preliminary assessment, public submissions, a full assessment and inquiry. It then makes a recommendation to its council of Commonwealth, state, territory and New Zealand ministers, the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council. It can take up to a year from the time of application until a recommendation is made. Once ministerial approval is granted, the variation to the standard is gazetted and it becomes part of the Food Standards Code.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The procedures to vary the Food Standards Code are complex and arduous. Under current legislation, the authority has to commit all available resources necessary to complete the  assessments within the required 12-month period, without taking into account the relative public or commercial importance or value of each application. In practice, this has meant valuable resources have been diverted from important reform tasks such as the review of the Food Standards Code.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Australia New Zealand Food Authority is embarking on three major tasks as part of its regulatory reform program. It is conducting a three&amp;hyphen;year standards review work program which aims to set priorities for reviewing food standards up to the year 2000, when a joint Australia&amp;hyphen;New Zealand standards code is due to be completed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The new code is planned to be simplified and more generic, moving away from the prescriptive standards of the present system which are so detailed that variations based on safe innovations in food require new standards to be continually set up. For example, there is one standard for jam, one for jelly, one for spreads, et cetera. Under the review, wherever possible,
         <break page="11428" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          the authority will replace standards regulating individual foods with standards which apply across classes of food. In addition, the authority is working towards the introduction of uniform hygiene standards and a review of food regulation across federal, state and local government.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These reforms are clearly an important priority, especially following the recent series of major lapses in industry hygiene. We all remember the headlines which littered the press earlier this year referring to salmonella outbreaks and food poisoning. Recently, there was another food scare in Melbourne where nearly 60 people became ill.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Despite the urgency for these reforms to be completed, the authority is bogged down in tedious, drawn out procedures to vary standards. Authority chairperson, Ms McCaughey, has said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The processes or the obligations that are specified in the current ANZFA Act mean that the very infinite resources of the authority must in all cases be devoted to assessing applications to vary the food standards code ahead of the other important reform tasks, irrespective of priority or merit.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         This can no longer be allowed to continue if Australia is to maintain its reputation as having one of the highest standards of food safety in the world. The proposed amendments in this bill will allow the authority to plan, manage and prioritise its workload, smoothing the way for it to continue its all important reform program.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The amendments streamline the administration of applications to vary the code by moving away from process for process's sake. The bill aims to simplify the directions for information required to support an application, giving applications more guidance and flexibility.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill also proposes to streamline the procedure for giving the reasons why proposed new food standards have been rejected. Under present legislation, this automatically requires a formal, lengthy statement to be gazetted. The amendments will require the authority to publish only the means to obtain a statement. The statement may not need to be prepared unless it has been requested, therefore saving the authority time and resources but still retaining openness and transparency, which characterise the authority's operations.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In order to further reduce the time taken to develop new standards, the bill proposes that the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council must make a decision within six months of receiving a recommendation from the food authority. The time period could be extended if the council requires more information from the authority. At the moment there is no such time limit for the council, and decisions frequently take longer than six months. According to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee's report, the  worst delay so far encountered has been an extraordinary 23 months. The need for change is obvious and welcomed by industry and the authority alike.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The amendments will also give the authority the flexibility to extend the 12&amp;hyphen;month time limit where decisions are challenged, with an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal providing an important safeguard. Finalising applications to change the food code will be further streamlined by allowing the authority to use an assessment, technical information or, where applicable, evidence obtained from public inquiries which is supplied by government agencies in making a decision. This will fast&amp;hyphen;track applications where a suitable resource of reliable information has already been prepared, once again saving time and resources.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill updates the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act to broaden the powers and functions of the authority as a modern statutory body. Under the bill, the authority will be given scope for greater involvement in food matters. The authority will be able to increase

         These amendments simplify and clarify the procedures to vary the food code by allowing the authority the ability to prioritise its work and to fast&amp;hyphen;track applications. The bill smooths the way for the authority to dedicate its important resources to its regulatory reforms.

         In the lead&amp;hyphen;up to the year 2000, the authority must be given the opportunity to dedicate its attention to its work in reviewing food standards, introducing uniform hygiene standards and reforming food regulations across federal, state and local governments. This bill represents a commitment from this government to the authority's reform agenda and protects Australian's reputation as having one of the highest standards of food safety in the world. This is a reputation which is vital to food processors, such as those within my electorate of McEwen, many of whom depend on this reputation for their livelihoods. I commend this bill to the House.

The government has also agreed to drop a number of proposed amendments relating to the powers of the food authority to charge fees. The opposition is pleased that the government has apparently responded to our concerns that the fee charging powers were not sufficiently specific and could, in the worse case situation, allow the government to withdraw its funding to ANZFA and force the food authority to pick up the shortfall through higher charges. As a result of the government's agreement to make these changes in these amendments, the opposition is happy to allow passage of the bill.

          —I beg your pardon. I thank the member for Dobell. It will be early this afternoon. As all speakers have indicated, this is a non&amp;hyphen;controversial piece of legislation. We are dealing with the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill. This is a statutory authority. The changes that are proposed in the bill before the House are both of an administrative and housekeeping nature, as outlined by the shadow minister.

         It is important, however, to recognise that this organisation and the changes that this bill introduces allow a great deal of cooperation to exist between both Australia and New Zealand, particularly on the question of food standards. The member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey) made much of the importance of food standards. I think it is repetitious for me to venture into that area this afternoon, but the bottom line remains that food standards are of the utmost importance to every Australian producer and processor and much of our reputation as an effective exporter has been built on the image that we have as a clean and green country.

         It is almost two years since the treaty between Australia and New Zealand was signed on 5 December 1995. The treaty, which is the background to this legislation, had bipartisan support and provided for the establishment of a joint standards agency, the Australia New Zealand Food Authority, with officers and operations in both Australia and New Zealand. This was a landmark achievement which will set standards across two countries and, by removing regulatory barriers to trade in food, work towards creating a larger single market. The Australia New Zealand Food Authority unites the nine governments of Australia and New Zealand in open, consultative and efficient processes for setting and revising national, and now bilateral, food standards.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The creation of the authority has led to food standards that are nationally uniform and are becoming gradually less prescriptive and more open to modern food technologies. The authority is currently in the process of building a completely revised food standards code to move us towards fewer, simpler, more generic standards to better meet industry and consumer needs and harmonise food standards between Australia and New Zealand. Standards developed by the new authority are now recommended to a joint council of health ministers known as the Australia New Zealand Foods Standards Council. It comprises ministers from the Commonwealth, New Zealand and the states and territories. When food standards are adopted by the council they will be published in both countries and be adopted by reference and without amendment into the food legislation in Australia and New Zealand. It is a model that has attracted worldwide attention.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Of particular significance, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that the model removes a number of trade access issues which have been frustrating Australian exporters, reduces compliance costs and  provides for a larger and more secure market in processed foods. The system will ensure that closer economic relations with New Zealand remain at the cutting edge of trade policy. It provides a worthy example for similar processes of trade facilitation in the APEC region and in the wider multilateral context.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is in this area of removing trade barriers and increasing trade access that I want to make a brief comment before concluding my remarks. As the representative of a largely horticulturally focused electorate, I have had instances of producers, particularly of mandarins, having difficulty gaining access to New Zealand. It is true to say that the New Zealanders have been bound by the arrangements entered into under our various trade protocols but that they have in fact frustrated my exporters by using a number of non&amp;hyphen;tariff barriers and by slowing down the rate at which these mandarin processors gain access to New Zealand. The particular
         <break page="11431" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          group I have in mind is just over the border outside my electorate in Victoria and has therefore been deemed to be in a fruit fly threatened area although in reality fruit fly has never entered that area. The nearest outbreak would be at least 120 kilometres away but for all of that they found it difficult to gain access. I think the level of cooperation that ought to have been extended by our trans&amp;hyphen;Tasman neighbours has not been extended and I would therefore challenge the Australia New Zealand Food Authority to look at not only the standards of our food but also the way in which non&amp;hyphen;tariff barriers have been used to frustrate some Australian growers.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am also aware of an instance in the electorate represented by the member for Murray (Mrs Stone), who is not now participating in the debate, where protocols for tomatoes to be exported from Australia to New Zealand had in fact not reflected the modern tomato growing standards that apply in Australia and where, in a number of instances, tomato growers had found difficulty getting access because the protocols had been established for varieties that have now been superseded.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would join previous speakers, Mr Deputy Speaker, in commending this bill to the House, indicating the support of the parliament for these changes and wishing the authority every success as it enhances the reputation that Australians have as the processors and producers of quality food.

          —This bill is not controversial in any shape or form but it does provide the opportunity to focus on the role of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority and the role that it plays between  governments, industry and the community in developing a safe and wholesome food supply. I recently had the privilege to launch national food safety awareness week in my electorate at the opening of the Barton TAFE office in Bendigo which is putting on programs for the safe, competent and efficient handling of food products in the Bendigo region.

         It is important that the responsibility for food safety awareness is highlighted. The work of the Food Safety Campaign Group—which brings together a wide range of groups representing all levels of government, industry and consumers, with a common purpose of raising broad community awareness about food safety—is particularly important, in view of recent occurrences in Victoria, where people have suffered as a result of contaminated food which, in one instance there, led to the death of some people. That really did highlight how important it is to be aware of the need to have clean and safe food, particularly in the production of it but also in the handling of it. The responsibility for keeping Australia's food supply safe is one that we all share: primary producers, manufacturers, restaurateurs, food outlet owners,  regulators, and even household cooks—as I try to be at times in my own home—need to know how important it is.

          —Truly, I am trying to be. But it is important. With all of the matters that are coming under the authority of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority, it is important to remember just how serious these outbreaks of food poisoning and food contamination can be. We had an unfortunate series of happenings in Australia recently, of which every consumer and every producer should take note. Anyone who has any role in the food industry should take note of it.

         Keep kitchen utensils clean and cook food properly. Consumers have a real and important role to play in the food safety effort. It is estimated that 20 per cent of food poisoning incidents in Australia can be attributed to the mishandling of food in the home: not reheating food to the correct temperature, or cutting up cooked and raw food using the same chopping board or the same knife. It is important that people are aware of the importance of food safety and that they apply those principles in their daily lives.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (1) Government funding for residential aged care is a contribution to the cost of care. Under the previous nursing home system, providers were fully reimbursed for the salary on&amp;hyphen;costs they incurred—provided they kept full records and submitted a detailed annual claim form. This form, which was used to reconcile nursing and personal care staff costs as well as salary on&amp;hyphen;costs, ran to more than 30 pages.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        In contrast, under the previous hostel system, funding for salary on&amp;hyphen;costs was fully integrated into the overall rates structure. Subsidies were not acquitted and providers did not have to put up with such a burden of red tape and form filling.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        The Government has simplified the administration of all residential care funding. Funding for all levels of care is paid as a straightforward, non&amp;hyphen;acquitted subsidy that addresses all the costs of delivering care for all categories of need. In the transition from the old system, funds that would have been paid to nursing homes to reimburse their salary on&amp;hyphen;costs have been incorporated into the rates for higher levels of care. The rates for lower levels of care continue to address salary on&amp;hyphen;costs in the same way as hostel subsidies did previously.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (2) Salary on&amp;hyphen;costs are addressed in every category of the rates structure. They are not
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         additional costs. Funding is paid continuously, as the costs are incurred. Former nursing homes will be protected from excessive deficits in the transition from full cost reimbursement by a system of capping losses. These caps will be initially set to protect the 5 per cent of homes with the highest costs, with the proportion protected reducing over 5 years as the caps are phased out.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (3) No. All residents pay the same basic fee and additional fees are determined under an income test based solely on the capacity of a resident to pay additional charges.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (4) It is open to service providers to withdraw from Commonwealth funding and regulatory arrangements and operate independently, as they see fit. This would necessitate opting out of the whole system, not single elements of it. There, would, of course, be consequences in such a decision for the approval of care places that they hold. It would be unlikely, however, for service providers to make such a decision, especially nursing home providers whose residents are mostly at the high care levels. The average Commonwealth subsidy for a nursing home is about $30,000 per place per year.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Opting out may be a more realistic option for providers at the very low care levels (for example, there are significant numbers of supported accommodation houses, some of whom offer a level of personal care, outside Commonwealth funding arrangements). However, any reduction in the number of Commonwealth funded places in an area of need would be addressed by the planning system which controls the allocation of new places.
