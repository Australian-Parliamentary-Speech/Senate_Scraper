          —This bill puts into place key elements of Labor's textile, clothing and footwear plan. It is the first stage of locking in bipartisan support on assistance to this crucial industry. It is totally consistent with the motion moved by the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) and the member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey) and therefore should on this occasion be supported by those members. When given the chance on the last occasion, they did not.

        <para first-indent="16">
         But it is a commitment that goes further than simply the freeze of tariffs. The bill gives industry certainty by ensuring that TCF tariffs remain at the year 2000 levels until at least 31 December 2004. However, Labor has never seen the level of tariffs as the whole solution for industry. That is why we have had schemes in place to get us competitively into export markets—the import credit scheme and the export facilitation scheme in the case of automotive industry. We have consistently argued that these be retained and it seems now that the government supports us in that regard.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But, given the importance of the import credit scheme to the industry, I also foreshadow today that, if the government's response on this replacement scheme is inadequate, Labor will introduce a further private member's bill to keep that scheme in place but in a way that is consistent with our commitments under APEC.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Labor also differs from the government on the matter of the review of what should happen post 2005. Come the next election, whatever John Howard would like to happen, there will be a clear distinction between where the parties stand on this issue. The
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the coalition support automatic reduction of TCF tariffs, no matter what our trading partners do. He is for delaying what we do for five years but he is still committed to unilateral disarmament.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         By contrast, Labor will use our position to press other countries to adhere to their commitments. We will ensure, if elected, that we will have a comprehensive review in 2004 to determine the assistance needed beyond 2005, taking full account of the impact on regional Australia and the progress of our trading partners in reducing their barriers.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Finally, we will also tie further assistance to this industry not only to investment, exports and job obligations, but to a satisfactory resolution of the outworker issue. Against Labor's plan, industry has committed to job security, investment growth and export growth—the three most pressing economic issues facing the nation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government has now adopted our position on TCF tariffs to the year 2005. Having always talked tough on tariff reductions, they have now accepted Labor's sensible export and job friendly policy. The only position the coalition has ever held on tariffs is that which Labor has put in place and advocated. Labor has led the way in terms of its support for the automotive and TCF industries.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Last year we rejected the ideologically driven and isolated advice of the Industry Commission on the automotive industry. We have consistently argued a position on these industries which is now adopted. We rejected the calls to walk away from Australia's 150,000 TCF and automotive workers, but at the same time we did not walk away and we will not be walking away from our international trade commitments.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Following the government's cave&amp;hyphen;in on these issues, we now have an element of bipartisanship. It is now up to the government to prove its commitment to that bipartisanship by supporting this bill. We want this legislation in place before the next election. In theory there is no need for the TCF legislation until the year 2000, but Labor does not want to see this become another non&amp;hyphen;core promise to be discarded as soon as the election is over

         If Labor wins the next election, we will ensure that industry has the certainty inherent in Labor's TCF and auto plans. But just to be sure, we want it in place before the next election, otherwise we will see more of the recent confusion which has been so bad for security, investment and job opportunities.

         Mr Speaker, you would be aware that it has been the past practice of the former Minister for Defence and, I trust, the new one to select
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          members of this parliament—that is, members of this House and senators—to visit Australian peacekeepers at the place of their operation. Both you and I were privileged to go to Somalia and again to Rwanda in company with the then Senator Loosley and Senator MacGibbon. All of us who travelled to see our Australian peacekeepers, I believe, felt it a distinguished honour that we should be so selected and felt it important that the Australian parliament should have representatives to witness first&amp;hyphen;hand the good work that these peacekeepers did.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Rwanda was no different from Somalia. There the Australian peacekeepers performed outstanding work and were very highly regarded in a country we previously had no connection with. In particular, in relation to the camp at Kibeho that we visited, it is salutary to think that some of the people that we saw there were amongst the 5,000 who were subsequently massacred.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I applaud the ADF for their acknowledgment of the gallantry of those Australians involved in the camp. But I regret that the history of bipartisanship has been misunderstood by the relevant minister. It was never a suggestion when I asked you a question in this place about the awarding of the gallantry medals that a visit to parliament should have been a substitute for the investiture at the Governor&amp;hyphen;General's residence. All I was seeking was information as to why perhaps those who had visited the theatre of operations were not invited there. Having accepted that we were not invited, I was seeking an opportunity to have the parliament acknowledge the good work of the peacekeepers.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Unfortunately, in response to question No. 1473 that I asked the minister on notice, she maintains the belief that I was asking for a substitute service or presentation. That is not true. Secondly, it was really disappointing that, in her answer to my question, she suggested that the cost of $17,000 in a budget of $10 billion was too much for the defence forces to bear. Last but not least, anyone who has the slightest connection with defence understands there is the possibility of opportunity flights for the RAAF which would cut
         <break page="7977" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          down the individual transportation costs of the officers involved.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I regret that the minister appears to be or has given the appearance of being very mean&amp;hyphen;spirited in failing to understand what were basically good bipartisan intentions in wanting to have these officers' service duly recognised by the parliament. I hope in the future that we can learn from this and understand that there are members of parliament on both sides of the House who are always keen to see in particular the outstanding peacekeeping operations of the ADF appropriately recognised. We can do that now on the floor of the House by inviting them to attend.

         In his concluding remarks the honourable member mentioned that the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) gave the appearance of not being interested, or to that effect, in these service personnel. I would point out to the honourable member in the House that the minister actually attended the investiture ceremony at government house and conveyed her heartfelt thanks to these people on behalf of the parliament and the nation on a one on one basis and in a very personal manner. She also acknowledged in question time the role that they played with the Australian forces in Rwanda. In no way does she belittle the awards that were made and the efforts undertaken by these people. It is a shame that you should feel that way and that you have politicised what really is a fabulous effort by these four personnel and should be recognised as such.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What is not understood by many Australians is that when we have sent personnel overseas in the past it has been predominantly to fight wars. Terrible as that may be, the fact
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          is that the battle lines are drawn and the rules of engagement are quite clear—you shoot to kill. You shoot to protect yourself, your ground, the men around you and the cause for which you are fighting. What is not so easily understood is that when our personnel have been undertaking operations in places such as Rwanda those rules of engagement are somewhat different. When you start to wear the blue beret of the United Nations these lines become very fuzzy and very grey indeed. The pressures that they put on all personnel operating in these areas are quite immense.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For one of the gentlemen who has been awarded a gallantry medal here, the words spoken of him are `as he stood in front of a wounded Rwandan national as he was about to be killed'. Those sorts of scenarios very rarely would come up in conventional battle. He had to put his own life not just at risk but at great peril in order to protect this person. It was not the traditional method of killing, of defending or of attacking. In this case, it was defending somebody's life, as you might in the street from thugs or whatever else. Quite often the people they were confronted with there were no more than thugs and murderers who were not so much for a cause as looking for their own opportunism.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It says a great deal about Australian service personnel that throughout the years, regardless of where they have been asked to represent this great nation of ours, they have always performed to the highest possible standards. In Rwanda, Somalia and Cambodia, in all of these fields, the challenges that have beset them have been quite different.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As an ex&amp;hyphen;serviceman, I know full well that even in training for these activities it is always difficult to draw the line between the rules of engagement that apply and your instincts in the training that you undertake which says `protect yourself'. It is little known that these people are not to fire unless they believe their lives are directly affected. Can you imagine for one moment a man standing there, protecting a person who has already been shot in the leg, with someone—probably more than one person—armed in front of him? Does he retaliate immediately and fire, or does he use the strength, courage
         <break page="7978" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          and commitment and the training and self-discipline that he has been taught through the defence forces of Australia to protect that person? What a judgment. It is not one that I would ever care to have thrust upon me.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It is absolutely exemplary of the training Australian defence forces have. We may be only a small force, but these four people have done us extremely proud. We can be reassured that, whenever Australian troops represent us in whatever forum overseas, they do it with the professionalism and the dedication that the Defence Force of Australia has been renowned for for nearly 100 years.

         Looking at the exclusion from eligibility for repatriation benefits, it has been constantly stated by the navy that HMA ships were never allocated for operational service. However, a letter from the Department of the Navy to the Treasury of 11 November 1955 says:

         That was well within the time period of which we are talking for these servicemen. There was other supporting evidence, which the government will well know of by now. This evidence was given to the Navy Office in late 1995, and I understand that it has disappeared.

         Many statements have been given, and many retired service people have been involved in this discussion.

What they are asking for is very basic. I understand it will not cost the government huge amounts of money. It would be reasonable to think that these service people have been properly compensated for being away from their families and friends in service of their country.

It is true that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 have not had access to benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 introduced by the previous Labor government, but that is about to change.

          Hon. Bronwyn Bishop, who is at the table at the moment, and also the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon. Bruce Scott.

         As a result of a joint Defence and Veterans' Affairs review of 15 areas of overseas service, the government announced in the 1997 budget that compensation benefits would be extended to 12 new areas of overseas service. One of these new areas is indeed seagoing naval service with the Far East Strategic Reserve during the period 2 July 1955 to 27 May 1963 inclusive. In total, another 10,500 veterans will now be eligible for compensation in the form of disability pension, treatment for war-caused injury and illness, and a defence service home loan. The legislation providing for these benefits is currently before the House.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is important that the House not just recognise that compensation benefits have been provided but also recognise the very important service that the Far East Strategic Reserve veterans gave their country. The reserve was established in 1955 for the purpose of defending Malaya and Singapore and their surrounding waters. It was made up of an infantry brigade including both Australian and British troops, bomber and fighter squadrons and a carrier group to which Australian ships would be attached.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The primary role of the reserve was to defend Malaya during the course of the Malayan emergency against external communist aggression. Its secondary role was to assist in suppressing the communist insurrection within Malaya. The navy's contribution to the achievements of the reserve is highly regarded in the annals of history. They were an effective blockade and a powerful deterrent. Furthermore, on two occasions, Royal Australian Navy ships—HMAS

          The review to which I referred earlier found that naval service with the Far East Strategic Reserve did incur risk beyond that of normal peacetime conditions. Consequently, the service will be reclassified as `operational service' and compensation benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act will become available.

          There were many lessons for Australia from our participation in the Malayan emergency. The experience—a tragically costly one for the 36 Australians who lost their lives—emphasised the value of training, skills and discipline and the necessity of leadership. These qualities were all to be found amongst those who served within the Royal Australian Navy as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve. There was another important outcome for Australia: Malaya, then as now an area of considerable concern to Australia in terms of security, survived the communist threat.

          I would also take this opportunity to outline and recognise the other areas of overseas service which will be covered by the Veterans' Entitlements Act as a result of the government's review. They include service in the permanent defence force with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan during the period 3 January 1949 to 30 June 1951; RAAF service at Ubon air base in Thailand from 31 May 1962 to 31 August 1968; ADF personnel deployed to north-east Thailand over the period 31 May 1962 to 31 August 1968 for airfield construction work as part of our commitment to SEATO; and embassy guards and RAAF evacuation personnel who served in Vietnam between 12 January 1972 and 29 April 1975.

         Australia's contribution to the Thai currency swap was decided with undue haste and without consultation. The contribution which this government decided to make without consultation was also disproportionately large.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The Japanese economy is much bigger and much healthier than ours and Japan is purported to own over 40 per cent of Thailand's $US73 billion commercial foreign debt. Yet while the Japanese have so much at stake with their substantial involvement in the Thai economy, the very wealthy Japanese were only forthcoming with $US4 billion—almost nothing to them.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The Australian parliament and the Australian people should have been consulted. However, now that this government has forced this decision on us all, it is incumbent on the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to make the terms and conditions of the swap clear and open to the scrutiny of the Australian people. Presumably, if the risk is carried by the Thai government and not by Australia, then Mr  Costello
         <break page="7981" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          will be pleased to tell us this. The fact that the terms and conditions are secret cannot help but make Australians suspicious of the implications this deal poses for our country. The Australian people can only view this as either potential exposure to a large financial loss should the Thai currency suffer further devaluation, or, worse, the total write&amp;hyphen;off of $1 billion should Thailand experience complete economic collapse.

         The more you consider the lack of information and consultation relating to this matter, the more apparent it becomes that this is but another example of the complete lack of concern the Howard government has for the thoughts and wellbeing of the Australian people. As a matter of interest, Thailand will also be one of the countries seeking to export cooked chicken meat to Australia. Will we consider further job losses and the threat of disease for our own poultry industry as a little `thank you' for this loan?

It accelerates the rush—so eagerly and deliriously pursued by politicians in successive Liberal and Labor governments over at least the last 25 years—to globalisation.

         We seemed to be listening to a speech that completely overlooked the fact that Thailand has been a long&amp;hyphen;term friend of Australia. The Thais have had very close connections with Australia. Many Australians and Thais have developed lifetime friendships. To do nothing now would be a bit like saying to a neighbour when he is down, `What are we going to do? We will just kick you a bit harder and walk straight past.' I found it quite unbelievable, listening to the sort of drivel that came out of the member for Oxley. It showed a total lack of understanding of what this is all about.

          Monetary Fund, we are joining with a number of other countries. As part of this package we are joining with other good neighbours and friends in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia. Clearly, that is very much in Australia's interests. To make one obvious point, Australia's exports to Thailand are now around $1.7 billion. Apart from the fact that we happen to live in the same region, we have a very direct interest in this matter.

Its terms are going to be negotiated by the Reserve Bank—and what body is better able to do something like that? It is going to have market related interest rates attached to it. Also, as has been pointed out, we expect that in due course the money will be repaid.

          —This is a government that was elected on the promise that it would raise parliamentary standards and make the government more accountable to the people. The problem is that here we have $1.3 billion worth of taxpayers' money committed to a rescue bailout without recourse to the parliament. The member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) may well be right; it may well have been in the best interests of Australia, but we do not know because we do not know what the conditions are and we do not even know the exact financial terms of the exchange interest rates that will be applied in this particular case.

         I would have thought, given the interest of the coalition before it got into government in trying to raise the scrutiny and accountability of government, that the least we could have done is have some sort of debate—even if we had had a ministerial statement with which we could debate this matter. Here we have a private member's motion where we have five minutes apiece to speak on it when we are dealing with $1.3 billion worth of taxpayers' money. Although that might well be safe at the end—we are not sure—it still represents a commitment of taxpayers' money to the rescue of the Thai economy.

His chicken farmers and those others who may be competing with Thai businesses may be interested to know whether or not the subsidy to the Thai economy will mean a net subsidy to businesses that are competing with Australian businesses.

Much of the heroin in Australia—this country is awash in heroin—comes from the Golden Triangle, of which Thailand is an integral part. I would have thought that one of the basic things we should be insisting upon as part of the rescue is a much more substantial clampdown on the heroin trade. I would have thought that that is absolutely basic. Here we have an enormous social problem, particularly amongst young people, and we have not even got the gumption to impose conditions when we are actually sending $1.3 billion worth of taxpayers' money to help out another economy.

          —The appeal of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), albeit apparently waning in recent months, has been a reaction, I suspect, to the mismanagement over 13 years of the Labor government. However, we need to distinguish between listening to people's concerns and between ill-informed populism. While it is important—indeed, essential—for members of parliament to listen to their constituents, it is also the role of parliamentarians to lead, which means considering more than slogans and cliches, and sometimes it means swimming against the tide.

         The member for Oxley's motion expresses a fearful and xenophobic isolationism which Australia simply cannot afford. We cannot and must not shut Australia off from the rest of the world like some latter day Albania. For good or ill, Australia is part of the world community. We are not an Asian country; we have a singular status. We are a small people drawn from every corner of the world but with a strong Anglo-Saxon foundation. We are a piece of Europe in the Pacific, living cheek by jowl with Asia, the fastest growing economic region in the world.

         The first point about this motion is that we are not giving Thailand $1.35 billion to prop up its haemorrhaging economy at all. We are taking part in a currency swap. The money comes from foreign reserves already held in the Reserve Bank, which will transfer money held at present in some other form, such as US treasury bonds. Thailand agrees to swap the currencies back as conditions permit over the next three to five years. The transaction is made at no cost to the Australian taxpayer and may never even be called in. It is there to give confidence to the Thai currency, which will help all Australian exporters, including our farmers. The risk involved here is therefore very small.

         It is important to understand that the bailout of Thailand, to the tune of $US14 billion—of which Japan contributed $4 billion; Australia, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore $1
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          billion each; and Indonesia and South Korea $500 million each—is attached to a rigorous IMF plan for economic reform of the Thai economy. The money converted to baht to shore up the Thai exchange rate by these countries is entirely conditional on Thailand adhering to the IMF plan.

         The Thai government has agreed to stringent demands to slash government spending, to raise consumer taxes and to set targets for cutting inflation and its trade deficit. Before the bailout, the baht had lost 26 per cent of its value since 2 July when the government stopped pegging it to the United States dollar.

         The crisis immediately began to spread to other countries in the region, prompting a slump on the Malaysian stock exchange and falls in Malaysian and Philippine currencies. The Thai economy had simply become overheated. Such a complete financial debacle experienced by a country in the region would have caused economic shock waves around the Pacific rim. It is likely that it would have caused a domino effect in neighbouring states and would have had a major impact on Australia itself. Australia could not contemplate such a tidal wave without taking pre-emptive action.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The IMF was set up after the Second World War for precisely these reasons. So Australia had very precise economic reasons in its own interests for being a party to the Thailand bailout. Thailand bought Australian goods worth $1.7 billion last year and is an increasingly important trade partner with this country. Australian companies have massive investments in a broad range of industries in Thailand, with annual trade earnings of $600 million a year. Australia's goods and services exports to ASEAN nations last year totalled $15.68 billion—of which Thailand's share was $2.1 billion. Australia's investment in ASEAN countries to mid-1996 was $9.25 billion—or 6.1 per cent of Australia's investment abroad. So this is something which is quite clearly in the interests of Australia.

          even Asian tigers sometimes need a visit from paramedics. We should be a significant part of the infusion being given to the Thai economy because it will give us a leverage in the region—a leverage which is important, and much more important than all the rhetoric we could speak about having a place in the fastest growing economic region in the world.

          —I second the motion moved by the honourable member for Murray (Mrs Stone) and I congratulate her for bringing this important debate to the chamber. It was interesting that this debate follows the discussion about the appropriateness or not of Australia contributing to a bail&amp;hyphen;out of the Thai economy. While everyone has their own views on that, I happen to think it was the correct thing to do. Australia is also making a contribution in many ways to the wellbeing and the health of the people of Thailand which, in turn, will hopefully help with the economy.

         It is often difficult for us in Australia to appreciate the enormity of the population problem in so many parts of the world, especially in Thailand and Vietnam. It is also
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          very difficult for us to appreciate the challenges that the governments and the peoples of these countries face. It is difficult because of the population differences, if for no other reason. Thailand has a population of 60,271,000, Vietnam has a population of almost 75 million and Australia has a population of around 18 million people. The interesting thing about Vietnam and Thailand is that both are basically young countries—the people are very young. The birthrates have not yet peaked. Countries like Australia and Japan are talking of a declining population in a few years time. These countries have yet to reach their peak in population.

         Like the other speakers in this debate, I recently visited Thailand and Vietnam to see at first hand how they are dealing with these population issues. The trip was ably led by the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), and I pay tribute to her leadership. Obviously the question of HIV&amp;hyphen;AIDS was discussed and we saw several programs, especially programs where Australia has made a contribution.

        <para first-indent="16">
         For each of us on that trip, there will be a different highlight, and for me one of the most impressive aspects of the visit was visiting the Royal Inthanon Agriculture Station and the hill tribes outside Chiang Mai. This was especially important as this was a poppy growing area not so long ago. The hill tribes are now growing fruit and vegetables rather than poppies and thus are no longer contributing to the opium trade of the world.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is also important that the hill tribes there, as part of a scheme which is under the patronage of His Majesty the King, are also receiving health care and are discussing population issues. Just as their own health is improving in that area, so indeed, by their no longer growing poppies and adding to the opium trade, is the health of the world so much improved.

         I guess that no&amp;hyphen;one who visits Thailand and meets Mechai, of cabbages and condoms fame, can fail to be impressed not only by his remarkable vigour but also by his vision. He has been awarded the Order of Australia and has had close connections with Australia, having attended Geelong Grammar School and Melbourne University, from which he has
         <break page="7988" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          a degree. He has also received many other awards for his work in family planning. His innovative approach to sex education is perhaps something that we here in Australia can learn from. It uses not only high profile people but also hundreds of workers throughout Thailand who are doing so much to make health planning and healthy, useful lifestyles a reality.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The campaign of Mechai to promote the use of condoms has helped to significantly reduce sexually transmitted diseases, thereby preventing the spread of AIDS. But the battle is far from won. The World Health Organisation estimates that almost 20 million people worldwide have been infected with HIV, the virus that causes the disease. Thailand has recorded more than 13,000 cases of AIDS since 1979. WHO says the virus is spreading fastest in South and South&amp;hyphen;East Asia. Since 1993, HIV infections in the region have doubled to three million.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Mechai believes that Asia has yet to feel the full force of this epidemic. He predicts that AIDS will soon be more prevalent in Asia than it is in Africa, where an estimated 11 million people are HIV carriers. He says:

         During the 20th century, Thailand underwent a rapid increase in the rate of population growth. From a population estimated at the time of the first census in 1911 to be eight million people, Thailand now has nearly 60 million people, and that population is increasing all the time. It was very interesting for me, as a male there on that trip, to see that family planning in both Vietnam and Thailand was not regarded as purely an issue for women.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Vasectomy is now widespread in Thailand. A few years ago there was no vasectomy at all, and that was very much because of the misunderstanding of the males as to the actual meaning of the procedure. During that time it
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          is estimated that only a few hundred vasectomies occurred each year, but now many thousands of vasectomies are carried out every year. Although I and the other male member of the group were invited to participate in this, we actually declined the kind offer that was made to us. The other important aspect is a coordinating role that Thailand plays in this part of the world. Having been more advanced in this area than other countries, it is now giving its expertise to many other countries.

         Vietnam, in the past two decades, has succeeded in achieving a high rate of economic growth and it also has experienced a significant decline in population growth and fertility. But Vietnam still has severe problems in this area. We were very privileged while we were there to visit one particular project. We visited many projects in which there was Australian involvement, but one that particularly impressed me was one where the women are taught economic management. In that way they have a bank and, by being freed from economic constraints, they invest more and more. Family Planning Australia was very involved in this project, and it shows what can be achieved. We saw examples of chicken rearing and various aspects like that. You do not have to have a great, grandiose plan—you can go in there with a very simple idea and a simple plan. Not only are they learning economic management; they are also learning aspects of health and reproductive health. So that is very important for the country.

         As has been mentioned, we have in this parliament an all&amp;hyphen;party group on population and development, of which I am pleased to be a member. This group acts to bring issues of population and development before the parliament. We recognise the need for a population policy not only in Australia but also in many other countries whose problems in this field are so much greater than Australia's. It is important that this group acts as a forum to visitors to Parliament House. We also work very closely with the Reproductive Health Alliance and Family Planning Australia. I would suggest to honourable members that they consider joining that group, if they are

         The trip was funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, and other groups that were involved were the Australian Reproductive Alliance and the Asian Forum of Parliamentarians on Population and Development, also known as the AFPPD.

         AIDS is probably one of the most serious problems faced by Thailand. By the year 2000 it is estimated that some three to four million people will be infected by the HIV&amp;hyphen;AIDS virus. If these projections are accurate, one in three deaths will be caused by AIDS and the mortality rate due to AIDS will be the leading cause of death, particularly among infants and the young age groups.

         We were very privileged to meet Mechai Viravaidya, who is the Chairman of the Population and Community Development Association. He was quite a dynamic man. His first job was with the government's national planning agency. He resolved to do something very concrete about Thailand's huge population growth, which at that stage was 3.2 per cent per annum. In 1978, he introduced some very spirited campaigns on family planning, which the member for Throsby was speaking about earlier. Today Thailand's population growth remains at its 1991 level, which is just over one per cent, and it is a really successful model for some of the developing countries in the region.

         In recent years, Mechai has also established the Thai Business Initiative in Rural Development, known as T BIRD.

         First of all, I was extremely proud as an Australian member of the delegation to see first&amp;hyphen;hand how well spent our Australian aid dollars are. Empowerment is the word. When you talk to these people and you go out into the villages, whether it be in Chiang Mai or Chiang Rai province in the north of Thailand or whether it be in the provinces out of Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City, you see very distinct examples of when you are able to give the people in these areas the rare dollar—and it is rare to them—and you can see the huge advantages that they can then make from that money.

By choosing to make his own views public, it strikes me that the Chief Justice has applied interesting standards. One criterion is that he can justifiably criticise the political processes, including the Attorney-General's reluctance to speak out on the court's behalf, if indeed that was the Attorney-General's decision. Effectively, while a member of the High Court would not speak out publicly about the judgment of a colleague or colleagues, by some hitherto unknown to me convention, the Attorney-General is somehow bound to publicly disown the expressed opinions of his ministerial colleagues.

It was largely through the efforts of Deidre Grusovin by continually highlighting the problems of child sexual abuse and paedophilia that the New South Wales Wood Royal Commission was eventually established. Recent allegations

          —I would like to bring the attention of the House to a bungled inquiry in the air force that is reportedly costing taxpayers $6 million. This inquiry is into the leadership style of a squadron leader in the RAAF who is in charge of the only continuously operational unit in the RAAF, that is, the P3 Orion detachment at Butterworth that conducts patrols into the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean. He was in command of a handful of men, all members of the military, and there appears to have been a personality dispute. There is no body, there is no rape, and there does not even appear to be an assault which, under the Defence Force Discipline Act, can adequately be dealt with in a few days for a few bucks.

         However, in this case, $6 million later what do we have? Another inquiry. At what cost to the taxpayers? It seems to me that the only winners are the lawyers. The witch hunt that has been conducted into the command of the unit and everybody associated with it is an example of how the lawyers in this ever more litigious society have so paralysed people that even the chain of command in an operational unit in the military is so afraid of acting that a simple matter like this can be drawn out for this long at this great expense. Heaven help Australia if the same paralysis occurs in wartime or in life and death operational manoeuvres.

It is a most attractive parcel of land and one can see a number of uses for it. The point I wish to make to the minister is that there is significant military heritage value to parts of this land that may well be neglected if it is not handled with considerable care.

It is also the burial site of what I am told was the only horse from the Light Horse that returned to Australia after the First World War, a horse called Sandy. There is a very strong view in the community that takes an interest in military heritage matters that the significance of this site ought to be very much commemorated as the defence department disposes of this land and that the department should ensure that it is given suitable recognition from that point of view.

         The owner has alleged breach of contract on the basis that the subsequent payments may not have been made and is seeking to regain ownership of the development.

          Mother Teresa was born in 1910 of Albanian parents at Skopje in central Europe. She was just 17 when she travelled to Ireland to join the Sisters of Loreto and, after staying in Dublin for less than a year, she was posted to the Loreto Convent in the city of Darjeeling in north&amp;hyphen;east India. She became the principal of St Mary's, a school for girls, and stayed there for 19 years. It was during this period that she took the name of `Teresa', after Little Teresa of Lisieux.

She opened her first school in the slums of Calcutta in 1949—almost 50 years ago. From these humble beginnings, her work and her simple message have been heard around the world.

          Mother Teresa was, in all senses of the word, a remarkable human being. She dedicated her life to the service and to the caring of others. She lived out the Christian ideal in a way that none of us in this House could ever hope to do. She was a shining example that faith, individual commitment and personal sacrifice in the service of others can still be the most powerful force in the world and can

         Her life was one deeply honoured in its latter years. Looking at the remarks that might have been made here on this occasion, and drawing from them to place on the record from this parliament Australia's sentiments of sorrow and loss at her death, there are many you could choose to quote from. They are statements of the powerful and the powerful honoured her. President Clinton, for example, described her as `one of the giants of our time' who `showed us the stunning power of simple humility'. President Reagan, when he awarded her the presidential Medal of Freedom, described her as a `heroine of our times' and a `saint of the gutters'.

         There have been honours extended from our system of honours that the Prime Minister referred to, as well as honours from many other countries across the globe. One cannot help but think, however, that all these just washed over her. She remained, throughout her life, a person of humble faith. A person of deep belief in the Catholic church and in her mission associated with the Catholic church, she believed that everything that came to her was something to advance the causes

          for which she stood. Everything that she had was to be used to support her mission; every piece of recognition was to be used to support her mission. As the President of the United States said, Mother Teresa showed us all the stunning power of simple humility.

         You cannot help but think, though, what exactly it was that we were making a statement about through all of those honours. I can say `we' because we in Australia extended some of those honours to her. There cannot be any doubt at all that the most notable feature of her life was that she was, if you like, counter the 20th century. She was counter the evil of this century, which has seen the most horrendous human bloodbaths, which has seen the most appalling examples of human neglect, and which has seen the most vicious and savage political ideologies extend their sway beyond narrow borders to very substantial parts of the globe. Mother Teresa stood out against all that in her simplicity.

         She was aware, throughout, of the possibilities of being used or misused and the possibilities of being introduced to agendas that she did not share because her mission was so simple. One of her critics suggested to her once that she could do more for the world by teaching people how to fish rather than giving them fish. She said:

         It was that profound conviction, when she herself was recovering from an illness, which changed her from being one of the magnificent Catholic educators in India at the time and since into being a simple person of the streets, picking up those from the streets, and giving succour and comfort to the most terribly affected proportion of our humanity.

          A friend of mine, the Reverend Keith Dowding, who is the father of a former Western Australian Labor premier, actually worked near Mother Teresa in Calcutta between 1963 and 1965. He was concerned with a mission to a number of refugees. He sent a note to me, in which he said of her:

          It has been said about some of the great reformers that they loved humanity but could not stand people. That does not apply to Mother Teresa. She certainly loved humanity, but she loved people—loved each person with a total commitment. She embraced humanity metaphorically. She also embraced the poor and the wretched, the filthy and the repulsive—embraced them physically. Each person mattered to her—the newborn baby found in a rubbish bin, the leper chased away with stones from a food queue and the old man dying in the squalor of a slum gutter. I saw with near incredulity the loving care she gave to the lonely and the neglected children she cared for in her children's home, the gentleness and warmth which she and her nuns gave to the old ones she took to her home for the dying.

We acknowledge, too, that these characteristics are not necessarily reflective of political systems.

The details of a motion appearing in full on the

That discretion was extended, I understand, by the chair later on 4 September when a member, in speaking to a motion to refer the proposed changes contained in the  Native Title Amendment Bill to a parliamentary committee, may have been viewed as anticipating the adjourned second reading debate on the bill which had just been introduced. No objection was raised at that time. I do believe that the member for Hotham was present. In my view, the exercise of the chair's discretion on that occasion was appropriate.

         I want to take the opportunity of saying a few things about the national interest so far as greenhouse gas emissions are concerned. I commend to those Labor members opposite who represent coalmining constituencies in Australia to listen rather carefully to the reality of what is involved in this particular issue. I was fascinated at the weekend to see some of the remarks of the Premier of New South Wales. He apparently thinks we should be out there agreeing with what the Europeans want at the forthcoming Kyoto summit.

         Let me make it clear at the very outset that this is an issue that very directly affects Australia's national interest. Those who argue that we should be taking a more pro-European stance, those who argue like the Labor Party that we should roll over in the face of international pressure, those who argue that we should give in to the most extreme view on this issue are completely ignoring the very drastic consequences that this country would suffer.

         For example, the European Union is arguing for a 15 per cent reduction by the year 2010 in relation to the 1990 level of greenhouse gas emissions. My government—and I would hope all Australians who study this issue—cannot possibly accept the approach adopted by the Europeans. They would discriminate that approach against Australia because they would have a much harsher impact on the Australian economy than other economies.

         I would like to tell the constituencies that are still represented by Labor members what the implications of some of those changes would be. For example, if we accepted those targets, planned investment in energy intensive and mineral processing industries—in gas, aluminium processing, nickel processing, magnesium smelting and iron and steel processing—in the next five years would be threatened, losing the potential according to some estimates of 90,000 long-term Australian jobs. The impact on demand and prices would mean that coal output by 2010 would be 20 per cent lower than otherwise planned and aluminium smelting would be 25 per cent lower than now.

Apparently that is the sort of outcome that the Labor Premier of New South Wales wants.

          —My question is to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. I refer the minister to the results of the first national school English literacy survey, which found that approximately one-third of primary school students cannot read or write to an acceptable level. The problem gets worse from year 3 to year 5. I ask the minister: what action is the federal government taking to improve literacy standards for Australian students? What is his response to public comments that have been made?

          —I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. I am pleased to acknowledge to the House his longstanding interest in and leadership on the issue of literacy for Australian school children. Literacy is an essential skill for life. Every child in this country should be reading and writing to a satisfactory level by the end of year 3 of their schooling. By the end of year 3 they should not be learning to read, they should be reading to learn.

         What has been demonstrated beyond serious question by the first national English literacy survey in 16 years is that one-third of Australian school children in year 3 and year 5 cannot read or write to a satisfactory standard. It shows that boys are behind girls and that the great majority of indigenous students fall well below the national standard.

         Earlier this year, the federal government instituted the first national literacy plan, which all the state and territory ministers agreed to. The response of the state and territory ministers to this survey has been disappointing. What they have sought to do has been to defend the lowest standards embodied in the state tests against the national standard.

         Every person in this House needs to know that the national standard was developed by a benchmarking task force, whose membership comprises representatives of the states and territories with the Commonwealth, in consultation with Australia's top literacy experts and that it was applied to the most comprehensive English literacy survey for 16 years by Australia's most expert body, the Australian Council for Educational Research.

         A number of misleading comments have been made by the opposition about the policies of the federal government on this matter. In fact, continually misleading statements have been made that the federal government is reducing funding for schooling and for literacy. Neither of those statements is at all correct. Funding for literacy has been increased. The statements are demonstrably false. Funding for special programs for literacy has been increased by this government by $50 million over the four&amp;hyphen;year period.

         More than that, Australian taxpayers put $12 billion a year into schooling and that money is there, first and foremost, to teach young people in this country to read and write. Literacy is not an optional extra. It is not a matter of providing another $&amp;half; billion from the Commonwealth to teach young people to read and write. The $12 billion that are already going into schools from the pockets of taxpayers should be used to achieve that purpose.

The $517 million AAA package will help farmers take advantage, firstly, of the solid economic foundations that the government is laying for them through lower interest rates and reforms in the labour market and so forth.

         The package has a substantial number of important elements. I just want to touch briefly on some of them. There will be, firstly, the establishment of a single tax&amp;hyphen;linked farm management deposit scheme, which will be run by the financial institutions for the first time; secondly, help for farmers to further develop their business management skills under the $50 million farm business improvement program, or Farmbis; a continuation of demand driven exceptional circumstances assistance for farmers; very substantial assistance in the area of allowing older farmers to transfer ownership of the family farm to a younger generation and enjoy immediate access to the age pension; a farm family restart scheme worth $120 million starting from 1 December this year, which will involve income support, professional advice on the viability of businesses and re&amp;hyphen;establishment grants; and an improved rural communities program of around $40 million offering a range of things from telecentres through to credit care and rural finances.

The suspension was invoked under the terms of Daiwa's agreement with the Commonwealth.

         The government wants to acknowledge that the investigations of Daiwa by the Japanese regulatory authorities are ongoing, and that no charges of a civil or criminal nature have been brought against Daiwa. However, the government is of the opinion that the paramount issue is public confidence in the integrity and probity of the process—that is, the Telstra sales process—and of all those who are engaged in the sale. The suspension of Daiwa at this stage, pending further advice and information, will protect that public confidence in the process as critical stages of the Telstra sale approach.

         As I mentioned previously, Daiwa had been engaged to assist in the sale of Telstra shares and the rest of the world tranche, which means outside Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom and Europe. With the suspension of Daiwa from the selling syndicate, the firms currently working as joint global coordinators on the sale, which are ABN AMRO Rothschild, CS First Boston and J.B. Were, have been appointed as joint lead managers for the rest of the world tranche. In the event that further investigations indicate that it is appropriate to do so, Daiwa's suspension will be lifted and the firm will return to its role as a joint lead manager, alongside the newly appointed firms.

         I am pleased to confirm that the government is on track to sell one-third of Telstra on the Australian Stock Exchange in November. I am sure all honourable members would appreciate that there is significant public interest in the sale, as is evidenced by some 2.3 million reservations of the offer document. Further information will be released on that offer document in the near future.

         Those comments from the shadow minister are in fact an endorsement of the position that the government took to the recent safety net wage case. We actually took that position to the safety net wage case and you actually opposed it. When you go back to the track record of the previous Labor administration, what a contrast that makes to what has actually happened for the low paid since we have been in office. If you look at the recent decision by the commission for the low paid of a $10 a week wage increase, in fact that represented a real increase of 2.6 per cent over the year to the June quarter 1997. That is a very fair and very good position for the low paid.

         What we have seen in the last week or so is a graphic demonstration of the hypocrisy of those opposite, because rather than supporting the low paid—who of course would be beneficiaries if we had a more efficient waterfront—these guys are supporting the MUA.

          The MUA is not the low paid. This is supposed to be at the throbbing heart of the labour movement, but these people are on 80 grand plus a year. These people are on five weeks annual leave and 27&amp;half; per cent annual leave loading. Is this the throbbing soul of the Labor Party and what is at the heart of the Labor Party? These are the rorters' supporters.

         The benefits that the MUA have picked up for themselves over the years are absolutely incredible. I will take just one set of benefits which are available today in Queensland ports, in particular in respect of the clothing which is provided under agreements to people who are working on the waterfront in Queensland. This is a real live today example. I do not mind people getting safety boots and safety material, but under the agreement these people get shorts or trousers, shirts with long or short sleeves, overalls issued clean at work daily, winter jackets, sunglasses, sun blockout and work gloves. That is fair enough but one pair per shift. They even get a laundry allowance of $13.90 per week, but of course the company is required in fact to provide the laundry for your overalls anyway.

         Just to top it off, employees are required to wear hard hats when they are at work, but under the agreement they are still issued with the Akubra broad&amp;hyphen;brimmed hats. They have to wear the hard hat, but they also get the Akubra. So if you ride a bike to work and you do anything when you get to work, you never actually get a chance to put your Akubra on. In fact, under this agreement you could turn up to work in your jocks and socks and they would be required to clothe you for the whole day. These are the rorts which you people are supporting. So much for the heart and soul of the Labor Party. At the heart and soul of the Labor Party is a rotten core, not interested in the low paid in this country but in looking after your mates.

          —My question is to the Prime Minister. Is it not a fact that the 2,000 BHP workers in Newcastle who will lose their jobs—workers who have paid their taxes all their lives and many with families to support—will, as a result of changes made by the government last Saturday, get no assistance until they get down to the last $2,500 of their redundancy payments? Why is the government forcing those workers to use up their hard earned annual and long service leave to be cashed out in their redundancy packages before accessing help from the Commonwealth? Is it not a fact that such workers would generally use their entitlements to pay off their mortgages, fix their gutters or paint their houses but that this government will make it almost impossible for them to do that now? Why has the government punished these workers and their families so harshly?

It has to be said that the absence of an effective commercially operated farm management deposit scheme was one of the great failings of Labor's national drought policy. Their government was big indeed on the rhetoric of farmers needing to become more financially self-reliant and preparing for drought and other downturns, but it did not give them the tools to do so. We have.

          Of course, these are far from rebadged. The proof is in the fact that farmers had stopped using them. They were so inaccessible and so unworkable in the form that you left them, and they were gutted just in time for the drought that hit in the early 1990s.

          On the second part of the question, the broad record of the Australian farm sector in improving productivity is simply second to none, both globally and here domestically. But recent research conducted for the National Farmers Federation has confirmed there is a very strong link between education and training and the levels of productivity, profitability and innovation achieved by individual farm businesses.

          All professions today, whether it is medicine, teaching or anything else you care to think of, sees a constant need for skills upgrading, and the farmbis program provides a realistic and very substantial framework for promoting a positive approach to change across the farm sector.

          In `A National Focus', a paper put together by the NFF, it was established that farm businesses which participate in at least one training event in a 12-month period have a higher gross operating surplus than those which do not—in fact, it gets on to double the figure. It established that farm businesses which engage in training are more likely to make changes to their practice which improve or are expected to improve long-term profitability and viability. So it goes on. The point out of all of this is that Labor's rural assistance scheme was based on interest rate subsidies.

        Royal Australian Navy: Repatriation Benefits
       </title>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        To the Honourable the President and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament:
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        There are two forms of benefits for ex&amp;hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&amp;hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&amp;hyphen;

         members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        It is claimed that:
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&amp;hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&amp;hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which cannot, allegedly, be found;
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (f) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for `active service'. The fourth,  for `military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Your petitioners therefore request the House to remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act thereby restoring justice and recognition of honourable `active service' with the Royal Australian Navy in direct support of British and Malayan forces during the Malayan Emergency between 1955 and 1960.

         This petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are still the only Australians, sent overseas on active service, whose service has not been recognised in three important areas:

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         3.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          R.A.N. service is still not acknowledged as eligible service for the Australian Service Pension, while service by Commonwealth and allied veterans from 55 other countries is.

        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         In the 1997 Budget the Government partly recognised that R.A.N. service was `operational' and accepted responsibility for disabilities resulting from that service. Those affected appreciate the belated, partial recognition. However, government departments are still resorting to old, and inventing new excuses, to deny the above 3 points.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Your petitioners therefore request that the House acts to help remove the injustice of 40 years and fully recognise R.A.N. service by providing the same recognition and benefits for that service. The cost will be minuscule, being mainly a transfer of pensions from `age' as paid by the Department of Social Security, to `service' pensions, paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs.

         The Petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that under the Quarantine (Animals) Regulations of the Quarantine Act 1908, approval is given for the importation of free ranging exotic animals such as lions, tigers, bears, elephants and non&amp;hyphen;human primates to be used for entertainment purposes in circuses and mobile displays. The issue of circuses using animals is very complex and includes: Transportation of animals, where the animals are kept in tiny cages, often travelling in extremes of temperature over long periods; stressful training techniques, often based on fear, deprivation and brutality and often inhumane living conditions, which do not allow any display of instinctual behaviours. We also believe that inappropriate messages are put forward by forcing wild animals to perform circus tricks. It is certainly not consistent with the focus on environmental awareness for people, especially children to learn that it is acceptable to exploit wild animals for human entertainment. We therefore humbly ask that the House prohibit the importation of all animals including those listed under CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) for use in both international and Australian circuses. We ask this based upon the inhumane conditions that the animals are kept in, the conditions under which the animals are transported, the often cruel training procedures, and the inappropriate messages conveyed to children by forcing wild animals to perform circus tricks.

          In 1994-95, 76,954 cases of child abuse were reported in Australia; 30,615 of finalised cases were substantiated; and in 11,973 cases the abuse was committed by a family member, 9,479 of whom were parents. Tragically, these figures are only the tip of the iceberg. We need to continue to raise the profile of the disease so that people become so enraged they will force us to fight until it is eradicated.

          We have all heard the figures that one in four girls are sexually abused as are one in 10 boys. Why are we not all waging a war against this national tragedy? A report from the Children's Commissioner of Queensland into paedophilia was tabled in the Queensland parliament last month. It seems that the overwhelming majority of paedophiles come from mainstream Australia. The report stated that doctors, teachers, lawyers, judges, dentists, scout leaders, public servants, police officers, housewives, child care employees and possibly politicians were allegedly involved.

          The Wood royal commission in New South Wales also made revelations about its widespread extent. Mrs Franca Arena MLC, an ardent campaigner against paedophilia in New South Wales, has made some very serious claims relating to that commission. As an elected representative she is obligated to make these claims if she truly believes that such a cover-up has taken place.

          Mr Terry O'Gorman of the Australian Council of Civil Liberties warned that she is out of control. He is also reported to have attacked the report of the Queensland Children's Commissioner, referring to its contents as `simply a joke.' I do not believe that there is anything funny about the report at all. The legal system of which Mr O'Gorman is a part is supposed to protect our rights and liberties. It certainly works well for the paedophiles and child abusers; it is not working for the abused children.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The Australian Institute of Criminology reports that there is no precise information on the number of paedophiles in Australia. Information on the police reports and convictions for sex offences against children is scattered. We do know that, in 1996, there
          <break page="8025" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           were 2,264,253 girls and 2,383,650 boys under the age of 18. If the figures that we have all heard are correct, this means that, in 1996, 953,460 girls and 238,365 boys under the age of 18 had suffered some form of sexual abuse. And what about the adults carrying childhood scars? The convictions do not reflect anything like these numbers even though we are told that one paedophile can be responsible for multiple abuses.

         </para>

          Mr O'Gorman's criticisms highlight the fundamental problem inherent in a legal system that does not know how to give children an effective voice and ensure that they are heard in the place designed to deliver justice—the courtroom. Many of my constituents have told me about their situations and their attempts to negotiate the system to protect their children, which highlight its abject failure. Child abuse convictions are rarely successful because young children are not considered reliable witnesses. Details required for convictions elude them, particularly when they do not immediately report the abuse to someone they trust.

         <para first-indent="16">
          When the abuse has been perpetrated by a parent, the child is often ordered by the Family Court to be handed over to the offender in public car parks. The only other choice for the non-offending parent is to be held in contempt of court. The balance has to change; the focus must shift to our children.

          I have been championing the cause of a commissioner for children since entering this parliament.

          —The publications of the findings of two state inquiries into the sickening practice of paedophilia have captured the nation's attention. It is fair to say that ordinary Australians watching the reports on television and reading the front pages of the newspapers over the past months have been deeply shocked and disturbed. We are definitely shocked that organised paedophile rings have been operating in this country. We are also deeply disturbed that children in the care and protection of the state have so often been those at most risk.

         When we listen to the stories of these children, we feel a profound sense of injustice. But we also feel something else, and that is anger at the failure of governments to exercise their responsibilities. That is why it is important to remember that paedophilia is one aspect of a wider issue, and that is the way in which our society cares for children whose families cannot care for them. When we as a society fail to provide care for these children—the most vulnerable Australians—we make it easier for practices like paedo

        <para first-indent="16">
         It is the national government working with the states that must give expression to that national responsibility. For those who believe that it is always the responsibility of the family alone to take care of children, irrespective of the circumstances, government action in this area will be long coming. Similarly, for those who believe that the rights of adults always take precedence over the rights of children, government policies which put children first will be long in coming.

         For those of us who believe, as I and the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes) do, that there will always be families who need our help and that our first priority is the children in those families, governments will have an agenda for the welfare of Australian children. What this will require is a national approach to fighting poverty, a strong public education system, affordable health care and a jobs policy, particularly for disadvantaged Australians, as well as a national network of child protection services dedicated to preventing abuse, reporting abuse and treating children who are abused.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Each element of such an agenda is under threat from this government. The costs to children of winding back support for families should not be underestimated. In today's papers there are a number of articles quoting research that showed that the numbers of children in poverty are growing in this country. As the article in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Age
         </emphasis>
         says, `trends in state and federal government policies towards user pays education and a harsh means test for Austudy mean poor families are being disadvantaged'.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Another serious matter that has been well canvassed in this parliament which will have a detrimental effect on children who are subject to child abuse is the split in responsibility between the Commonwealth and the states for legal aid. It is now the case that the states' legal aid system will be responsible for child abuse and the Commonwealth legal aid system will be responsible for Family Court matters.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          It will be the case, as many lawyers in legal aid circles have already pointed out, that children who are subject to abuse will fall through these cracks that the government has created. Not only is there an immediate cost whereby families who are struggling with children find it much harder to make ends meet; there is also the longer term cost whereby people no longer expect governments to act in the specific interests of children.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The decision by the government to weaken the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which has the responsibility for the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, is a step in this direction. Our children deserve to have their voice made stronger, not fainter. It is the very foundation for a national agenda for children.

         As has been indicated by previous speakers, there has been a tendency for Australians, particularly those on the conservative side of politics, I think it is fair to say, to regard children as chattels of the family and having that mind&amp;hyphen;set has caused the philosophy that it is inappropriate to interfere or intervene into what is happening within the walls of the family home. Regrettably, as has been indicated more frequently than not, the abuse happens within the family home. The community as a whole has a responsibility to address that issue.

         I can give an example as to how child abuse affects all localities. The New South Wales commander of the Child Protection Enforcement Agency recently conducted a phone-in called Operation Paradox. The information revealed 1,520 victims of child abuse and 1,448 suspects, with 623 victims younger than 11 years of age. In terms of my own electorate, in the St George and Sutherland region, there were 12 calls, and the information identified 15 suspects and 11 victims. So it is certainly something that touches all of our electorates, and we have a responsibility to do something about it.

         Not only has there been reference to reports concerning Queensland and the Wood report in New South Wales but since 1988 there have been at least nine major reports in Victoria identifying significant problems in policy, practice, legislation and funding with respect to child abuse. However, in June 1996, the Victorian Auditor-General issued a report evaluating the effectiveness of the protection of children and found that the services were wanting in the extreme. So we have a situation where, in our three largest

         Perhaps a way forward is an initiative that has been taken by the New South Wales Department of Education which has set up a national register of teachers who have been involved in child abuse. I note that the Premier of New South Wales, after receiving the report of the Wood royal commission into paedophilia, has called on the federal government to establish a similar general register on a national basis.

         In a letter from the Premier of New South Wales to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Premier cautions that the only proper response is federal legislation actually setting up the register and that anything less than federal legislation will be completely inadequate. Those on the other side cannot be too precious about states rights when it comes to doing something about paedophilia; the problem is too chronic. I seek leave to tender a copy of that letter from the Premier of New South Wales to the Prime Minister, which letter was also tabled in the New South Wales parliament last week.

         The history of SBS in Australia dates back to 1975 with the development and transmission of a radio service which expanded into television in 1980. Since then SBS has grown to provide an excellent combination of multilingual and multicultural services which entertain, inform and educate all Australians, recognising the various cultural backgrounds of Australian society. In line with the coalition's pre&amp;hyphen;election commitment, the government has spent a further $10.63 million in expanding SBS television throughout regional Australia since being elected to office last year.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In the first round of funding, five regions benefited from this expansion commitment by the government. These included the regions of upper Murray, Grafton&amp;hyphen;Kempsey, upper Namoi, Central Tablelands and Rockhampton. It is estimated that an additional 700,000 people are receiving SBS television as a result of the coalition's latest expansion program into these regions. With these regions receiving the service, the coverage of SBS television across Australia has been lifted from 75 per cent to 79 per cent of the population.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As outlined in the coalition's communications policy, the government believes that as a national broadcaster SBS should be available to viewers across the country and the government is committed to ensuring that coverage is lifted to 100 per cent. The government is determined to reach that goal, and it will do so in the context of future budgets.

         The demand for SBS television across Australia is very high. Where the previous government failed to expand the service into major regional centres, a number of local communities have paid for a self&amp;hyphen;help, low power service. Some of the areas that have taken this action include Griffith, Wagga Wagga, Taree, Young, Orange and Bathurst—to name just a few. Although it is some time since Griffith obtained SBS, I would like to congratulate Mr Tony Dal Gigante and his committee on their fundraising work. From memory, the cost was in the vicinity of $60,000, but other donations in kind were also received. No doubt this has been the practice in many other areas.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, the ongoing cost of providing and maintaining the service is considerable and representations to the Minister for Communications and the Arts are continuing on behalf of the Griffith City Council to obtain some level of financial assistance, as was readily available to other centres that obtained the SBS television service without cost to the viewers. I am hopeful this situation will be addressed by the minister in future budgets.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Because of the large number of people living in regional areas from non-English speaking backgrounds, particularly in areas such as Griffith and on the mid North Coast, which is represented by the member for Lyne, we believe that interest in the SBS service has been substantial. This is one of the main reasons behind the government's commitment to expand SBS television through regional Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Given the widespread community support and the government's firm promise to increase community access to SBS television, I encourage the minister to continue his efforts to ensure this promise comes to fruition. The coalition government and the minister have already achieved a great deal during the past 18 months in expanding SBS television services. I have every confidence this expansion

          which catches one's eye. This one in particular brightened up my day. What we have here is a member of the government moving a motion seeking recognition for the government's efforts to expand SBS services in rural and regional Australia. I think if that were the case no motion would be more worthy of bipartisan support than this one.

         Almost all of the upper Hunter in my electorate is without SBS coverage. Indeed, in addition to that, it is without Triple J and Classic FM coverage on radio. I have been raising that point with the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) for some time. In December of last year I submitted to the minister a petition from 268 Murrurundi residents—that is a very large proportion of that town—and I thank Murrurundi's Fred Lane, who was responsible for seeking and obtaining all of those signatures.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So I will be delighted to support any motion which seeks to apply pressure on the government to accelerate the expansion of SBS services in regional areas like Muswellbrook, Scone, Merriwa, Denman, Murrurundi and Quirindi in my own electorate. But, unfortunately, that is not what this motion is all about. This motion is about patting the government on the back for something it indeed has not done.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The motion goes on to ask the House to affirm its support for a continuation of the program. That, of course, is something that I am delighted to support. But we need to have
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          a look at the record of the government on this issue. After taking government in March 1996, it did not do too badly and retained the funding levels of the previous government. But what was the budget allocation when we came to the 1997&amp;hyphen;98 budget? A big fat zero. Of course, it was a big fat zero because this government proposes—and indeed has already put it in train—to sell the National Transmission Agency.

         The five areas that are either currently undergoing expansion or about to receive expansion, including the Riverina, the upper Murray, Grafton, Kempsey, the upper Namoi, the Central Tablelands and Rockhampton, will be the last to receive SBS coverage under the government owned National Transmission Agency. The fate of those below those on the list—and there are about 24 of them, including Cootamundra&amp;hyphen;Wagga Wagga, Mackay, Taree&amp;hyphen;Port Macquarie, Shepparton, Bunbury, Griffith&amp;hyphen;Leeton, Mount Gambier, Mildura, the South Coast in New South Wales, Southern Downs, Murray Valley, Central-Western Slopes, Renmark&amp;hyphen;Loxton, Central Agricultural, Northam, Broken Hill, Horsham and so on right down to the Upper Hunter at No. 23—will rest with a privatised National Transmission Agency.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I said, I am delighted to come in here and support a motion that seeks to expand the services of such a reputable broadcaster as the SBS into rural and regional Australia. All Australians are entitled to be able to access the service and the only thing that will provide that access to the people in areas such as my own electorate is a rural funding commitment to the SBS. I say again that I am happy to come in here and fight for the expansion of SBS into rural and regional Australia, but I am not prepared to come in here and support a motion that seeks to give credit where credit is not due.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another point I would like to make is that the National Transmission Agency was planning to move its Sydney transmitter from Gore Hill in Sydney to Artarmon. I am advised that that move alone would have extended SBS services to tens of thousands of people in rural and regional Australia because it would have lifted the height of the transmit
         <break page="8031" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
          ter some 85 metres. Why isn't the move now to be undertaken? The move is not to be undertaken because there is no money left in the budget. The government has slashed the funding for that proposal simply because of its plans to privatise the National Transmission Agency, and it has decided not to extend any further funding to the organisation until after that sale has transpired. So the way this motion seeks to pat the government on the back is out of order, but I am happy to support the expansion of SBS services.

         I know that it is a bit of a cliche, but it is true that our children are our future and there can be no more important areas of government policy than those which have implications for the ability of younger Australians to reach their full potential. These are the decisions which affect their opportunity to receive a decent education, their ability to secure work,

         By providing policy advice and scrutinising legislation which has implications for younger Australians, an Office of Children and Young People within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet would assist in ensuring that the government gets it right for younger Australians. The establishment of the Office of Children and Young People would also send an important message to the community, and that is that the government is committed to improving the policies and programs which enhance the community's ability to protect and provide for younger Australians, to give them a voice and to provide them with an opportunity to work, to play and to make a contribution to society.

         The proposition that I am putting to the House today is not novel or unique. The New South Wales government already has an Office of Children and Young People and I understand that a number of states have similar bodies.

         The office is a central point of contact for peak organisations representative of the views of children and young people, and this enables it to be alert to the issues of concern to younger Australians and to ensure that those issues are taken into account when the government is developing policy—policies like the government's position on the heroin trial, for example, or policies like the government's new youth allowance, which must represent a larger threat to younger Australians than any of the decisions we have hitherto seen from the Howard government, whether they be cuts to university funding, changes to HECS or indeed cuts to child-care funding.

An Office of Children and Young People would have set alarm bells ringing over the new youth allowance and, hopefully, would not have allowed the allowance to become legislation. Policy initiatives like the new youth allowance serve only to increase youth cynicism of politicians and the political process.

Our youth are simply crying out for the opportunity to be heard.

They seem more tolerant and able to understand the role of politicians whilst not always agreeing with their actions. Indeed, young people can sometimes be the greatest critics of politics, yet the criticisms are often touched with a sense of reality and truth.

         There is a framework for Australia to establish an Office of Children and Young People and that is through Australia's ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. There are many on the conservative side of politics who still regard that treaty as the consequences of a New Age globalist plot to corrupt the youth of this country and to override the rights of parents. Nothing could be further from the truth. The preamble to that convention states that the parties are convinced:

         . . . that the family, as the fundamental group of society and the natural environment for the growth and well&amp;hyphen;being of all its members and particularly children, should be afforded the necessary protection and assistance so that it can fully assume its responsibilities within the community.

In my former life as a lawyer, I had cause to act on behalf of a number of workers who had developed mesothelioma from exposure to asbestos. That exposure was 25 or 30 years ago, and I can say that regrettably 20 or 30 years later is too late to rewind the clock.

         So in circumstances where a risk has been identified—indeed, the government is giving some money to further research—you do not go anywhere near children with these towers. This is one of the things that a commissioner or an Office of Children and Young People could look at. It is a simple measure to prescribe a no&amp;hyphen;go area around schools.

          —I have spent a lot of time since winning the seat of Capricornia in developing stronger links between the government and youth by involving them in the political arena, basically to get a first&amp;hyphen;hand view of how the parliamentary system really works. In the first months of office I conducted a youth employment program known as the YEP Gathering. Seventy&amp;hyphen;five unemployment youths between the ages of 16 and 19 attended, and together we worked to develop their individuality and assist them to focus on their future by stimulating their minds to develop a sense of self&amp;hyphen;worth and pride, to trigger personal motivation and to project themselves so that they could develop their goals and work towards gaining employment.

         Another initiative that is working is to give them the opportunity to pick a subject that interests them, write a view on the topic, discuss it to see how it would affect the community and submit it to the media and see the response from the various letter writers within the circulation area of the local newspaper. This is working well. The youth have the opportunity to come into my electorate office and we sit down and go through it with them. Some of them are working currently in the Central Queensland University studying journalism. So it is a first&amp;hyphen;hand opportunity for them to experience exactly what happens. I commend that as working very well.

         The first part of the motion recognises the important role that today's children and younger Australians will play in determining Australia's future prosperity. It is important that we as a nation give our young people the opportunity to have input into their future. We must strive to re&amp;hyphen;establish that tired but not yet worn&amp;hyphen;out cliche `the clever country'. This means we must provide a pathway that encourages young people, no matter what their family background, to excel in school, work and society. We must give young people an opportunity to develop their talents and skills far beyond the school classroom or playground. The Australian Institute of Sport is a great success as far as sport in this country is concerned and, if we can channel this type of set&amp;hyphen;up into the fields of academia, science,

         The third part of the motion recognises that younger Australians are growing increasingly cynical towards politicians and the political process, and increasingly pessimistic about Australia's future. It is not surprising that young people are cynical about politics and politicians, considering we have had to weather 13 years of Labor government and the biggest cynic of all, Mr Paul Keating. If we could eliminate gutter politics and politicians who bring the House into disrepute, then the media and the public would regard politics and politicians with much more respect. But that respect must first be earned.

         The fourth part of the motion recognises that such pessimism is likely to affect the attitude of younger Australians towards key aspects of Australian society.

         If there is one thing the young people of Australia require, it is a leader and a government which is more in touch with their needs and their concerns. We all know how out of touch this Howard government has become over the last 18 months. However, one key section of Australian society which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has never quite had a handle on, and one from which he remains hopelessly detached, is this nation's youth. Apart from mouthing the usual platitudes about how young people are the `future of the country', this Prime Minister has shown himself to be bewildered and uncomfortable when dealing with matters affecting our youth.

         I remember just prior to the last election campaign when the Prime Minister launched a bus tour with some of the supposedly youthful members of the coalition who were aiming to `connect' with the nation's young people; how well I remember it! I think the member for Wentworth (Mr Andrew Thomson) was probably the youngest member they had on the trip and, in all politeness, he is hardly what you would describe as youthful in the terms of this motion. Seldom have I seen the Prime Minister more uncomfortable than at that particular launch. There he was, in his regulation casual uniform of conservative slacks and open&amp;hyphen;necked shirt, talking about the needs of young Australians with all the depth and understanding of a garbage

         And after 18 months, what do we have? The Prime Minister has not improved his relationship whatsoever with younger Australians. If you want evidence of this, Mr Deputy Speaker and other members in the House, you only have to take a look at the Prime Minister's youth appointees to the Constitutional Convention: six law students, one medical student—some of them plucked straight from the ranks of young Liberals—and only one young woman with any solid experience of life outside the cloistered halls of academia. The Prime Minister sees these delegates as being representative of young people and their views on a republic.

         It is not surprising that the young people of Australia are becoming more and more disenchanted and disconnected with their leaders and the political process. They feel taken for granted. They feel disenfranchised. They are pessimistic about what the future holds for them. They see a government which offers no solutions on youth unemployment, just punishment in the form of work for the dole.

         In electorates such as mine, nothing compounds the notion among young people that they have a government unsympathetic to their needs more than the government's continuing failure to combat youth unemployment. In my electorate youth unemployment is a gut&amp;hyphen;wrenching reality, whether the Prime Minister wants to hear it or not—and it pushes desperate young people to delinquency and to drugs. These are terrible choices which often lead to destructive ends. Faced with the daunting task of finding a job, any job, government initiatives such as work for the dole are seen by young people in my area as laughable, completely useless tools aimed at winning their parents' votes rather than

         The fact that young people are lumbered with a government which ignores their interests when making its decisions is shown up elsewhere. Take the Howard government's stance on greenhouse gas emissions. If there is one issue in which the needs of young Australians should be paramount it is the environment. Yet the Prime Minister's refusal to do the right thing on greenhouse gases just shows how little the future of young people has figured in his equations.

         With a Prime Minister so out of touch with Australian youth, there has never been a greater need for an Office of Children and Young People within his department to provide him with advice. The young people of this country need to have their hopes and aspirations heard by their leaders. An Office of Children and Young People within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet would go some way to achieving this. If the Prime Minister really wants to live up to his platitudes on young people and the future of this country, is not this office the least they deserve?

         As previous speakers have said, when one talks with the youth of this country, one understands and appreciates their concerns at first hand. Less than one hour ago, I had a school group visiting with me. One of the first questions they raised with me was: why is this government persisting in building Badgerys Creek Airport? I had to take a great deal of time in answering that and other questions because they were concerned with the environmental effects; they were concerned that they were not consulted; and they were concerned that, as they are to be the future of this country, they will be bearing the results of that decision.

          The broad notion of what is happening in terms of the demographics of our nation and its families, and the children which grow up within them, is an important consideration in this matter before the House.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is possible to describe a series of trends affecting families throughout the industrialised world. There are at least 10 in number which I would like to recount. First, we are aware of the fact that people are marrying less today than they did in the past. In Australia in 1947, 44 out of every 1,000 women had been married compared to just 29 in every 1,000 by 1991. The crude marriage rate fell to 6.2 per cent in 1994, almost as low as it was during the Great Depression and half the rate it was during World War II. The number of people aged 15 and over who were married fell from 65.4 per cent in 1976 to 57.4 per cent in 1994.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Secondly, those couples who do marry do so at an older age. Going back to 1947 again, the median age of marriage was 25.3 years for grooms and 22.5 years for brides. These ages dropped to 23 and 21 in the early 1970s, but by 1994 the median age had risen markedly to 29 years for grooms and 26.6 years for brides. In 1972, one-third of women had married by the time they turned 20 and eight in 10 reaching 25 had married. By 1991 just one in 20 had married by age 20 and less than half by age 25.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Thirdly, tragically there has been, as we all know, a dramatic increase in divorce. In Australia in 1950 there were five divorces per thousand married women, a figure that fell during the 1950s to just 2.8 in 1961. It rose following the introduction of the Family Law Act to 18.8 in 1976 before falling to 10.6 a decade later. The rate has gradually crept up again to 12 in 1994, quadruple what it was three decades before.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Fourthly, as a consequence, the number of children involved in divorce has continued to grow since the 1970s. To quote from Kate Funder and Simon Kinsella from the Institute of Family Studies:
         </para>
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          <para font-size="-=2">
           Parental divorce disrupts the lives of nearly one in five young Australians under the age of 20, a disruption related to long-term social and economic disadvantages.
          </para>
          <para style="Para">
           Fifthly, the rates of remarriage have fallen also over the past 20 years. According to the sociologist Peter McDonald, the Australian remarriage rate has more than halved in two decades, falling for males from 246 per thousand divorced persons in 1971 to just 120 two decades later and, for females, from 215 per thousand to just 101 in 1991.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           We all know the sixth trend: families are having fewer children. The well-known population pyramid that we grew up with is rapidly being reversed in most industrialised countries.

          —My grievance is in respect of the decision by this government to close the Rockdale Medicare office. That decision is a blow for residents and small business in my electorate. The decision has been made despite the fact that in my electorate of Barton we have a major teaching hospital, the St George Hospital. Indeed, we also have a newly opened St George Private Hospital. In answer to a question on notice earlier this year, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) confirmed to me that the number of doctors in the Barton electorate made the district the eighth largest in Australia.

         We have medical practitioners galore in my electorate but, despite that fact and the two significant private hospitals in my electorate, the government has made a decision to close the Rockdale Medicare office. In that same reply to my question on notice, when I asked the minister in light of the number of doctors that we have in my electorate whether he would consider opening a second Medicare office in the Kogarah shopping centre, the minister replied to me that the question of location of Medicare offices was `a matter solely for the Health Insurance Commission'. Indeed, he specifically said that those decisions by the Health Insurance Commission are made `independent of any government interference'. So we have an extraordinary about&amp;hyphen;face, which also says something about the minister's accuracy in the way he responds to questions on notice from members of the House.

         The Rockdale Medicare office is one of 17 suburban offices which have been closed; 14 of those offices are in Labor held seats. It is no coincidence that the decision has been made by the government at a time when it is losing support rapidly in rural Australia. One perhaps has to look at the consequences of the drift to the One Nation Party together with some other issues, including the removal of tariffs in the sugar industry and the general lack of assistance to the rural community.

For many elderly people and mothers with young children, that is going to be almost an impossible task. When they arrive at Hurstville or Miranda, they are going to face longer queues as a result of the closure of not only the Rockdale office but also the Sylvania office. The patrons of those centres obviously will have to now focus on Hurstville or Miranda.

         The other issue which has been dumped particularly on the suburbs of Rockdale, Arncliffe and Bexley in my electorate is this government's decision to reopen the east&amp;hyphen;west runway at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. It was reckless in the extreme, I might add, for that decision by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) to adopt a long-term operating plan to have been made without undertaking an independent safety audit as recommended to the minister by the Airservices Australia report. Recommendation 27 recommended, as a precondition to the plan being adopted, that an independent expert be retained to provide a safety review of the whole plan. The minister has gone ahead and adopted the long&amp;hyphen;term operating plan despite the fact that we have currently, on average, about five safety incidents reported each week at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport, as confirmed to me in a reply to a question on notice which I asked the minister earlier this year.

And that is stated for the record. I think the minister has enough knowledge to know that and, partly as a result of that fact, the whole concept of sharing the noise has proven to be a complete and utter fraud.

I say that in the context of children in my electorate who are suffering from 11 a.m. until 3 p.m. and then, parents are reporting to me, their concentration is suffering because they are being kept awake until 11 p.m. because of planes flying overhead.

They sell whitegoods generally and some parts. They are popular, friendly and customers like them. They give personalised service, which has made them well respected. Like many other people in small business, they have had to struggle in recent years to earn a living but they have managed with the ups and downs because they are straight and trusting.

An elderly shop assistant had tried to pacify him. The customer's companions begged him to leave. Before he acceded to their plea he spat in the face of the elderly shop assistant. He hurled further abuse and obscenities at this old gentleman as he was driving away. The shop assistant said:

         Unknown to Mr and Mrs McFarlane, Hill complained to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission on 22 November 1994. The complaint was the refusal to supply goods on the grounds that he was an Aboriginal. The first notification of the complaint was when Liz Bond of the commission telephoned Mr McFarlane on 17 September 1996—21 months later. A letter was sent to the McFarlanes on 20 September 1996. When the McFarlanes spoke to Liz Bond they did not know that Bond would purport to make a record of the conversation; they did not know of their rights. They were not warned that anything they did say would be taken down and might be given to Hill and that it might be used in evidence against them at some later time.

         Section 143 of the act provides that if a complaint is accepted the commission `must promptly notify' the respondent in writing of the complaint. The commission was required to likewise promptly notify Hill as to whether the complaint should be accepted. The commission's records reveal that it notified Hill on 14 December 1994 and it notified the McFarlanes on 17 September 1996. That is discrimination—ignore the mandatory requirement on one side, the small business side, but follow it slavishly on the other side, the side of the unmeritorious complainant. The McFarlanes had to engage a solicitor at their

         The Hill complaint is a curious one. The first complaint alleges that the McFarlanes wanted to sell him the pump, not a part. He claimed that they were sarcastic and that they raised their voices. He believes that they did this because he was Aboriginal. The complaint could not hold water because it was established beyond any doubt that the McFarlanes did not have the part in stock, nor did they sell the part in the course of business. But Hill made another statement, and this is the most extraordinary statement of all. He claimed that he was treated abruptly as compared to a previous customer. He got angry when Mrs McFarlane asked the salesman to call the police. Hill thought Mrs McFarlane did that because he was Aboriginal. Hill even thought it a good idea.

For this reason I spat on him and also I was embarrassed by the whole incident.

        <para style="Para">
         If credibility was strained at the first statement then the commission would surely have baulked at this point.

         But what about the new basis for the commission proceeding against the McFarlanes? The commission letter of 14 May 1997 said:

        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         Note the use of the word `service'. The act says `services'. Is the commission trying to amend its own act so as to fit Mr Hill's complaint? Section 46(1)(d) of the act states:
        </para>

        <para style="Para">
         What is established is that the McFarlanes could not supply the part, so how is there said to be a connection between the supply of goods and the unfavourable treatment? The capacity to supply goods is the key. To take an example where the act would quite neatly fit: you have the goods but I am not supplying you with this part because you are Aboriginal, or the normal price of this part is $10 but to you it is $500 because you are Aboriginal. Those are clear breaches and this is what the act is for.

         Then the commission has the hide to purport to conciliate this claim. Would any reasonable person expect another to sit down and conciliate and negotiate with a person who has spat in the face of an elderly employee? For `conciliate and negotiate' read `pay money to'.

         In summary, the commission has demonstrated a woeful and shameful incapacity in this matter in the several particulars. It failed to properly notify the McFarlanes of the complaint, even though it promptly notified

          Hill of its acceptance, and this is in breach of its own act. It failed to warn the McFarlanes when engaging them in conversation.

It is acting as an oppressive instrument of the state, supporting a totally unmeritorious complaint and complainant who admitted spitting in the face of an elderly shop assistant. It misquotes a section of the act by referring to `service' instead of `services' in order to stretch its application to the case in question. It misconceives the application of its own act in order to capture the McFarlanes in its nasty spiral by failing to demonstrate a connection between unfavourable treatment and the supply of goods.

          —I rise tonight to speak on a number of subjects, time permitting: first, some problems with subcontractors on road construction work in the electorate of Richmond and, second, an update on Coolangatta airport. One of the main achievements of the coalition, certainly in New South Wales, has been the enormous amount of money going into the upgrade of the Pacific Highway. There are a number of major projects happening right now on the far north coast.

         One project that I would like to mention is the Brunswick Heads bypass. Around $21 million has been earmarked for this project
         <break page="8044" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          and at the moment the bypass is half way through construction. Unfortunately, the chief contractor on the job, Civilcon, which was the successful tenderer about a year and a half ago with the RTA, has gone into voluntary liquidation and has appointed an administrator. The consequences are quite profound on some of the subcontractors that have been supplying Civilcon to date.

         The Brunswick Heads bypass, as the name suggests, bypasses the town of Brunswick Heads from the Brunswick River down to near the turn&amp;hyphen;off to Mullumbimby. This bypass will add vastly to the economic environment of the region. I believe that the RTA and the New South Wales government need to reconsider the tendering process for road projects, because this is not the first time that this particular subcontractor has been caught. You would think that, if you were working on a government job, it should at least be on the premise that you would be paid.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the situation with Civilcon, one of the subcontractors is Batson Sand &amp; Gravel Pty Ltd, a very reputable company in the Byron shire. It employs over 40 people and is one of the largest employers besides the Byron shire council. Batson Sand &amp; Gravel has been having a very difficult time due to the work required on EISs in the extraction industry and also due to the moratorium that Byron shire has put on any type of DA. Now the potential situation is that the company could be caught with up to a $260,000 non&amp;hyphen;payment by Civilcon, which is obviously being paid by the RTA.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This has been the second time this has happened to Batson Sand &amp; Gravel in less than a year. The first time was down near Grafton when this company was working on the Heber Street flood mitigation works to raise the flood levee. On this project the manager was the RTA, the head contractor was Moreverk Pty Ltd and Lynx Construction was a subcontractor. Batson Sand &amp; Gravel worked for Lynx Construction, which went broke. In that instance the Australian Taxation Office garnisheed the payments to Lynx from Moreverk and no subcontractors working for Lynx were paid. On that project this company, Batson Sand &amp; Gravel, lost $28,000
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          while Moreverk were paid, the ATO were paid and the RTA got its road built. None of the subbies got paid.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The same situation may unfold on the Brunswick Heads bypass. They have a credit arrangement with Civilcon which extends for 45 days. The RTA do not pay Civilcon up to the same period. In this case, for 90 days they have had an outstanding amount of up to $260,000. The sad thing about this is that in some ways the members of the RTA knew of the financial difficulties that this company was involved in when another subcontractor contacted RTA in June concerned about the cash flow and liquidity of this company. However, it continued to trade.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One has to wonder whether there was an appropriate duty of care by certain members of the RTA or whether the whole process of monitoring the contract was deficient. As a result, whilst there is legislation in place in New South Wales which is meant to avoid this situation, the fact is that it is too loose. In many ways the government should be paying Civilcon faster, which is the case in many other road projects, so that they can pay their subbies faster.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As the legislation now stands, you are meant to sign a statutory declaration to say that you have made your payments to subcontractors. That is okay until the last payment—in this case where these people have been caught. The whole economy of the region has been put into a bit of a spin. The fines that the government has imposed are $200, which is inconsequential. Certainly the timing difference between the requirement for the lodgment of a statutory declaration by the head contractor stating that all subcontractors have been paid and the 45&amp;hyphen;day credit provision means that 90&amp;hyphen;day work can be undertaken without contravening the Statutory Declarations Act. Section 4.2 of the New South Wales government green paper on the security of payment requires government agencies to actively follow up on claims of non-payment made on their projects. The RTA response to non&amp;hyphen;payment of claims has directly contravened its policy on both the above projects.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I urge the New South Wales government and the RTA to ensure that this situation is
         <break page="8045" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          resolved—that subcontractors are paid 100c in the dollar; that the Brunswick Heads bypass, which will save time and fuel, is completed; and that there is a better system in place. This company is now in voluntary receivership. Myrtle Gully was another project in which they experienced difficulty. The RTA was paying in advance because of this, and there is now Lake George.

         We must also continue to pressure the New South Wales government to continue the momentum which is on a bit of a go slow now with the Brunswick to Chinderah motorway—a $220 million project, half of which is to be paid by the Commonwealth, just as half of the Brunswick Heads bypass has been paid. It is absolutely essential that this process be sped up. It has been quite some time now since the election. The irony is that the route will probably go back to being very similar to the one that was designed in 1994.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are a lot of positive elements that could come out of such a route. One is the enormous fuel savings. Every day up to 15,000 vehicles travel up and down that section of the Pacific Highway, which is just north of the Brunswick Heads bypass. There is a four to one ratio between trucks and cars. Therefore, the saving alone would be about 39,000 litres of fuel per day, or 14.2 million litres per year. At 67c per litre, this works out to be a saving of $26,000 per day, or $9.5 million a year, to road users.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There has been a lot of discussion on greenhouse gases. This bypass will mean a reduction in carbon dioxide by 93.4 tonnes per day, or 34,000 tonnes per year. It is good for fuel, and it is good for reducing greenhouse gases. It will also save time—about 15 minutes off the journey to bypass the Burringbar Range. Most importantly, it will save lives because it will be a divided highway. A divided highway reduces the accident rate by up to 85 per cent. It is estimated that the deviation will prevent up to 130 accidents per year. With the average accident cost at $60,000, the Chinderah&amp;hyphen;Billinudgel deviation could save at least $8 million per year. I urge the New South Wales government and all those players to get moving to start to build it.

          I have a quick update on what is happening at Coolangatta airport. Coolangatta airport is the sixth busiest airport in Australia. It is a vital part of the economy for tourism, but likewise there are many residents who live around the airport who are affected by aircraft noise and the traffic operations. A number of things have happened since the coalition has been brought to government. We now have full intersection take&amp;hyphen;offs for jets and we will have more with general aviation. The preferred runway status—which was detrimental to New South Wales with too many aircraft travelling over New South Wales vis-a-vis Queensland—has now been abolished. Noise abatement procedures have been put into place to get faster rates of climb for aircraft particularly taking off to the south, which affect up to 25,000 residents around the Tweed basin.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We have completed the noise monitoring review, which is very positive, although further work has to be done to get night time operations out of Coolangatta airport, particularly the mail planes. This is one of the main bugbears for people who live around the airport. Finally, the Airservices review has been running for sixth months. A final meeting of all interested parties will be in October. From this period on hopefully consensus will be reached on the allocation of flight paths, particularly over the southern part of Tweed Heads. Certainly there are principles that must be adhered to. We must get air traffic across the water as quickly as possible away from the bulk of the population. This may mean Airservices re&amp;hyphen;routing significant parts of the air corridor around Coolangatta airport, but this is absolutely critical.

It is hoped that we get a positive resolution which is absolutely essential for the residents of the Tweed.

          —I want to use the time available to me in the grievance debate to talk about three issues that are very current and causing great concern in my electorate. The first is the Hunter Valley No. 1 mine dispute, the second is the rate at which general practitioners in my electorate are ceasing to bulk-bill, and no-one will be surprised to learn that the third issue—one very close to my heart—is the applications by Denmark, Thailand and the United States to import cooked chicken meat into this country.

         In my first speech in this place I warned that the government's then proposed Workplace Relations Bill threatened to wreak havoc in this country's coalmining industry. It is one prediction that I would have been happy to have got wrong but, unfortunately, and sadly for Australia, I was right. The 440&amp;hyphen;strong work force at Rio Tinto's Hunter Valley No. 1 mine have now been in dispute with the company for about four months. Their colleagues—their brethren—at the company's Mount Thorley mine are gearing up for a similar dispute.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The company would have us believe that this is a dispute about the terms of an enterprise agreement, but we all know that that is not what this dispute is about at all. This dispute is about one thing and one thing only: it is about Rio Tinto's desire and the desire of this government to break the back of the trade union movement in this country. It is about no more or less than that. Of course, Rio Tinto seeks to achieve its objective by an age&amp;hyphen;old tactic—divide and conquer. Rio Tinto knows that, without the opportunity to bargain collectively, the trade union movement has nothing at all. Throughout the dispute both Rio Tinto and the Howard government have shown a preparedness to stop at nothing to achieve that goal. During question time today the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) was unashamedly indicating that, with respect to both the current CFMEU and MUA disputes, he and
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          the government are standing firmly behind the companies.

        <para first-indent="16">
         What a contrast to the rhetoric we heard from the minister for workplace relations when he was struggling to get his Workplace Relations Bill through a hostile Senate. Back then it was all consensus and claims of benefits for all, but today it is union bashing at its very best. Union bashing is the ultimate aphrodisiac for members of the Liberal Party.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The strike at Hunter Valley No. 1 has become a battle for the hearts and minds of the Hunter community. Bolstering the morale of the company is the constant stream of support and advice from the minister for workplace relations and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). I think it is common knowledge now that Rio Tinto has a hotline to Minister Reith's desk. But I am pleased to be able to say that the company's tactics to break the minds of the men and their families have hitherto failed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The majority of the Hunter's community understands that in those negotiations between companies and individuals the parties to the bargain are not equal and what the company offers to individuals today will be tomorrow's king hit. They understand that what the member for Flinders and the Prime Minister would have us believe is that human nature has now changed and no employer at all would ever seek to exploit employees if given the opportunity.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Today I want to send two very clear messages to those doing battle with Rio Tinto in the Hunter. The first is that the Australian community understands that they do battle not only for themselves but for all Australian workers who rely on the trade union movement to protect them from those who would seek to exploit their limited power as individuals if given the opportunity. The second is that in their battle with Rio Tinto they enjoy my support and they enjoy the support of the federal parliamentary Labor Party and will continue to enjoy that support.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Moving on, there have been no less than seven general practitioners in my electorate who have ceased to bulk&amp;hyphen;bill in recent weeks. Why is that? It is because over two budgets now the Howard government has frozen the
         <break page="8047" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Medicare rebate at $20.85. The Medicare rebate is the amount that the doctor receives for his or her service if he or she bulk-bills or the amount rebated to the patient if he or she is charged for the service.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Today I do not rise to bash the doctors; I believe that, like all Australians, they are entitled to incremental pay increases which reflect the general increase in the cost of living and, of course, reflect the additional costs they incur in running their business and in providing those services. What I do do tonight is rise to attack the Howard government for its obsessive hatred of Medicare. Shy after being bitten at the 1993 election, they went to the people in 1996 with an absolute commitment to leave Medicare alone. But what we are witnessing in the freezing of the Medicare rebate and in other matters, such as the cuts in funding to public hospitals, is an undermining of the Medicare system. They hate its popularity, they hate its success, they hate its universality and they are intent on doing it over through the back door.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But what impact is their obsession having on pensioners, the unemployed and low income earners in my electorate and in many others? It means that people in Abermain, Weston and Kurri Kurri, in particular, where there appears to be a very fast cessation of bulk&amp;hyphen;billing services, who do not enjoy access to a Medicare office, now need to find up to $35 for a visit to the doctor. Of course we are talking about much more money in the case of a low income family which may have more than one member needing to see the doctor at any one time.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Today I am calling upon the Howard government to take its hands off Medicare to give it the opportunity to thrive and to take a realistic look at what it is paying in terms of the Medicare rebate. I intend to call a public meeting in my electorate on the matter. It is such a hot issue. I will be extending an invitation to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) to attend that meeting, and I hope he gives it some positive consideration.

         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          to learn that the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) had invited the Hunter chicken growers to share lunch with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson).

         What he did not tell the chicken growers is something that he has been trying to cover up for some time now—that is, that the delegation that travelled from Australia to Thailand to inspect those plants that would be processing the chicken meat found that not one of those plants met world acceptable hygiene standards, not one of them. They were the plants nominated by the Thai government not selected by our delegation.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We also now learn that at least one of the applicant countries has threatened to take the federal government to the Federal Court if denied access to our market on the basis that the current legislation provides that the decision is a decision for the Director of Quarantine and not the government. On that basis, I am calling upon all members of this place, particularly those who have electorates containing chicken growers, to support my private member's bill, which seeks to place the power firmly back in the hands of the minister so that, if by some miracle he now does a backflip under pressure and denies those applications, he is now protected by the legislation and the way in which it empowers him to make such a decision. I call upon all members of this place to get on to their leaders and have my private member's bill brought back on and to give it their support.

Many thousands of community hours have been spent helping to beautify the area of Harkaway by the President, Ian Chisholm; Secretary, Judy Wallace; Research Officer, Ian Laurenson; and others of the group.

         The point of my grievance debate tonight is that Kurll Park has sat there now for 26 years and nobody knows about it. It is a degraded piece of land with the most magnificent outlook. It should be available to the citizens of the City of Casey and to the community in broader places to come and enjoy its ambience.

         The Friends of Harkaway Reserves have spent their time and effort as a voluntary organisation corresponding with the City of Casey about the park, pointing out to them its historical significance and ensuring that they understand that they are the owners of the park. They have also corresponded with the Rotary Club of Berwick, which has been involved in helping to place a cairn and a beautiful bronze plaque on top of the cairn pointing out distances to surrounding areas. The cairn and plaque are now run down and in need of repair.

         To the city's credit, some of the cars and rubbish from what was a nearby council tip have been cleared and the grass has been mown once, which has got rid of some of the vermin. But there is a long way to go. In their plans for the park it looks like it may be four, five or six years before we begin to tackle any of this work. This is the kind of project that should have been available to proceed under the  Natural Heritage Trust Fund Bill . We should have been able to get funding under that proposal in order to bring this park to a standard that the community can use and enjoy in future years.

          —Until today I have refrained from commenting on the area of justice and the portfolio of the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams) in any considered and detailed way, but it is impossible now not to look back in anger at what has occurred in the first 18 months of this government's term. The Attorney-General has now become the first Attorney-General ever to lose the confidence of the judiciary. He has not met the benchmark responsibility of an Attorney-General to speak for the role of the judiciary against the political comments of his own partisan frontbench.
          <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
           I come sad into this grievance debate. During the last government there was a period when Kerr and Lavarch put together the action plan: the Justice Statement. It was a fertile period of some of the most impressive reform in the law since the Murphy&amp;hyphen;Whitlam era. I sold the idea to Michael Lavarch that we needed to throw off the cobwebs of many reform ideas and to develop an action plan. We sold it first to the Prime Minister, then through the ERC. Sackville reported on it and we had a comprehensive action profile going. We have seen those initiatives undermined and the legal aid system that was to be improved and expanded upon brought to its knees and gutted. Initiatives in a range of areas have not been proceeded with.

         <break page="8050" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          area today. There are two areas where we have seen massive run&amp;hyphen;downs: firstly, in the Australia Federal Police and, secondly, in the National Crime Authority. There has been a sharp decline in funding for the Australian Federal Police. Morale in the Australian Federal Police is at rock bottom; senior officers are in virtual rebellion and Mick Palmer, who I think is one of the most experienced and dedicated of police officers, is struggling with an organisation that is treating him as if he were personally responsible for the funding decline which this government has forced on him.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There has been no follow&amp;hyphen;up of the law enforcement board reviews so that there is resistance in the force to the restructuring arrangements. The reports that were expected from the Office of Strategic Crime Assessment, and which were to be made public, have not emerged. Why not? Because, if you found out what was happening in the AFP, you would see there is a run&amp;hyphen;down in resourcing of overseas offices, particularly, for example, for postings like Cyprus. There are transfers of many matters away from investigating officers back to departments—matters which simply cannot be investigated and proceeded with by the AFP. In one of the key areas upon which this parliament says there should be a focus—we have had today, for example, discussion on paedophile activities—there is not a single officer full time in the Australian Federal Police dealing with paedophile matters despite the fact that we passed legislation to deal with child sex as a federal offence if people are guilty of that whilst overseas.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We have, of course, the almost inevitable cutting back of investigations, which is flowing through to the availability of hard drugs on our streets, and the Australian Federal Police Association has set out exactly the consequences and costs of those cutbacks and what they mean in terms of heroin which is now so readily available, with the price of a deal approximating that of a pack of cigarettes. The Attorney-General says that the AFP has to accept its fair share of these cuts. I do not think the community thinks it is a fair thing that its community safety, the interests
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          of innocent children and the interests of those who are subjected to this kind of organised crime are being subjected to these cuts.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If I may turn to the National Crime Authority, we have had inaction there. It is nearly two years since Betty King resigned as the third member of the National Crime Authority. She has still not been replaced. I hope the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General will act on my comment and move rapidly to replace her because it is a three&amp;hyphen;person board and the axe is still over its head.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         You have got to ask why the reviews were held of the National Crime Authority. I suspect it is because this government is still too dominated by the views of John Elliott, who has used the processes that were brought against him to come back and suggest that there was a vicious vendetta against him. He suggested a conspiracy, but what kind of conspiracy? A conspiracy which was initiated by an intergovernmental committee of the National Crime Authority in which all governments, state and federal, are represented. A prosecution initiated and maintained not by the Commonwealth but by the Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions. It was a circumstance in which an indicted accomplice pleaded guilty and was given a substantial gaol sentence on the basis that Elliott was a principal in that multimillion dollar fraud. In that situation John Elliott spent some of his vast wealth in a determined effort to exclude evidence that was entirely inconsistent with the account that he was seeking to make of his innocence.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I see this situation as a product of what Bosch identified as a `cowboy culture'. Bond, Quinn, Skase and Elliott are all of the same age in that context—some got to gaol and some got lucky. It is true that Mr Elliott's acquittal on an extremely narrow technical interpretation of the laws of reception of evidence in his case has meant that a verdict of not guilty was directed. There has not been a trial on the merits, but Mr Elliott now sees this as a vindication of his complete innocence. It is about the same vindication of complete innocence as Mr Skase could regard the Spanish court's finding as a clear definition of his current state of health.
        </para>
        <break page="8051" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          I think that the Australian public will regard the role in which Mr Elliott is setting himself in the same light as what Joh Bjelke&amp;hyphen;Petersen said of crows and socialists. He said, `If they fly like a crow, squawk like a crow and look like a crow, they are probably a crow.' Use the word `crook' in the case of John Elliott and you are probably right.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We actually have a situation where John Elliott's attempt to turn the spin on this—where he has obviously lied either to the investigators or in materials that he has provided subsequently; where his indicted co&amp;hyphen;conspirator went to gaol naming him; and where the prosecutions were tasked by a number of different authorities—is now bearing down on the Commonwealth agencies responsible for crime. It is absolutely disgraceful that the Australian Federal Police and the National Crime Authority have been treated in this shameful way. I would conclude by saying that these are crucial agencies if this government is going to be able to address the serious problems that exist in our community. It is not acceptable that we continue to have this funding reduction.

          —My grievance today is on behalf of people living on parts of the Monaro, specifically a
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           region of about 3,500 square kilometres just south of Cooma, and for the people of Cooma and surrounding areas in general. I speak today for a number of reasons. The Monaro region of my electorate is hard country but good country. The people are tough people but good people. The country and the people together produce some of the best fine wool in Australia. They produce high quality merino breeders that are sold all over Australia. It is acknowledged that if they survive on the Monaro they will thrive elsewhere. Their breeding stock is first class. The same can be said for beef cattle. The Monaro's reputation is very high in this regard.

         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But for the Monaro the last few years have been tougher than most. It has seen drought conditions for that time, compounded by plagues of wingless grasshoppers and very low commodity prices. This would be bad enough, but the impact has been greater as, during the years following the last major drought, which ended in 1982, the community, along with the rest of Australia, endured the Labor induced recession we had to have, extraordinarily high interest rates and then a collapse in the wool market.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Given all of this, producers have been forced into selling stock at low prices. They were certainly doing this prior to winter, as they were faced with the situation of no feed on the ground and limited financial resources to purchase feed. This was clearly very responsible, but it will place those farmers in a difficult situation when the drought breaks, because they will then have to buy that stock back, more than likely at higher prices.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         With this background, it is no wonder that an application was prepared by people of the region for assistance for exceptional circumstances under the provisions of the rural adjustment scheme. After many months of negotiation with officers of the New South Wales Department of Agriculture, an application was finalised in May this year. Representatives of this region included in this application, together with Mr Bruce Bashford, a rural financial counsellor in Cooma, met with me at the time of their sending this application to the New South Wales government.
        </para>
        <break page="8052" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          The application was for exceptional circumstances, not drought exceptional circumstances. This was because of the many things that had impacted on the region, not just drought. As I mentioned earlier, a series of events all coming on top of each other has created the hardship many are experiencing. It is a series of events that has seen sheep numbers fall by 40 per cent and cattle numbers by 45 per cent on the properties studied for the application; a series of events that has seen yearly average net income fall from $2,920 in 1993&amp;hyphen;94 to minus $20,378 in 1996&amp;hyphen;97 for those properties studied; a series of events that has seen fodder purchases drop to almost nil over the past four years; and a series of events that has seen dams and bores dry for the first time in people's memories.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I should also comment here that the meteorological circumstances on the Monaro are quite unique. Severe frosts during winter, on top of four years of drought, means that there will be little if any spring growth, even if we get rain. It is going to take good spring rains to give summer growth any chance. But we are also facing the effects of the El Nino phenomenon. Also on the Monaro you often get very strong winds which too often eliminate the value of rain. Unfortunately, a common comment is that we got two inches of rain and then we got three inches of wind. So rainfall figures do not tell the whole story.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The situation is clearly not good. The application, as I said, was lodged in May with the New South Wales government. That is how the system works. The state department of agriculture assesses the application and then makes a recommendation to the federal government. Unfortunately for the people of the Monaro, the New South Wales government took from May to August to make the assessment, with a lot of toing and froing between times. I should also say that, even before the application was lodged, the state member for Monaro, my colleague Peter Cochran, had been badgering the state Minister for Agriculture to do something about the problem. He did nothing and then took three months to assess the application after he received it.
         </para>
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          <para first-indent="16">
           Finally the matter was referred from the New South Wales government to the federal government in August. I immediately contacted the minister, John Anderson, and asked that he address the application as a matter of urgency. I also wrote to the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council, asking that they get on site and have a look. The minister responded to my request and asked RASAC to deal with the matter quickly. RASAC members toured the application area last Monday. Besides looking on the ground, the committee heard submissions from a number of people, including Patrick Litchfield, a grazier of Cooma; Neil Walters, a grazier and manager of the Cooma saleyards; Ian McGuffick, an accountant of Cooma and Jindabyne; Christine Venning, a vet in Cooma from the Rural Lands Protection Board; and many others. It was obviously a very comprehensive briefing.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The concern the locals have, though, is that the RASAC committee have been asked by the New South Wales government to assess the application as drought exceptional circumstances, not exceptional circumstances as originally requested. We do not fully understand why the New South Wales department has changed this. However, the people of the Monaro can be assured that I will be explaining it all to the minister.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           In many respects, the difficulty in differentiating these circumstances has already been acknowledged by our government in our new rural policy, Agriculture—Advancing Australia, which was launched last Sunday week in my electorate by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson). In this very progressive and well received policy, drought exceptional circumstance payments have now become just exceptional circumstances. Now that the RASAC committee has visited the area, I will be requesting the minister to act as soon as he receives the necessary information.

           At the start of my contribution to this grievance debate I said that there are a number of reasons for me speaking on behalf of the people of Cooma. The impact I have described has not only affected those farmers

            but has also flowed on to the town of Cooma. But Cooma has also suffered in another way as a result of what I must say was a very puzzling decision by the New South Wales Labor government. That decision was to close Cooma Gaol—a decision which will see 60 jobs lost by July 1998 and several million dollars lost from the Cooma economy.

          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The reason the New South Wales government gives for this decision is that proper care and programs are not available for the inmates, who are predominantly sex and drug offenders. Instead, they will move them mainly to Sydney into mainstream gaols where the so-called `correct programs' are available. The reason for my saying this decision was puzzling is that this gaol at Cooma was, in fact, highly successful. It traded profitably and was successful in its rehabilitation program.

        <para style="Para">
         Mr Deputy Speaker, so say all of us. TAFE does have a vital role to play in providing employment skills and opportunities for lifelong learning; of course it does. TAFE has had a role to play in the vocational education training sector for a very long time—and it is a very positive role that it does play.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         From time to time I have had some criticism of TAFE, particularly in years past when it seemed to me that TAFE was attempting to
         <break page="8055" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          be a bit of everything to everyone—too many courses, too much spread of qualifications attempting to attract too broad a representation from the community to its offerings and without concentrating on any specific task or any specific area where it thought it had very special expertise.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         TAFE has modernised a lot, it has changed a lot. While there are different models that have evolved around the states, I am more familiar with the model in Victoria. I understand, as I travel the country nationally, that most of those in the training business around Australia, and most employers that I have talked to, recognise that the Victorian model is the most advanced, the most progressive, and is probably doing the most effective and the best job both for our young people and for adults.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The shadow minister goes on in his amendment to the bill to condemn the government for a whole lot of things—for dumping on TAFE, cutting money and all kinds of other things—but he is going to pass the bill. I have a few differences of opinion with the member for Werriwa. In his speech during the second reading debate he referred to `cuts to spending to TAFE'. We have said over and over again that we are not cutting vocational education; we are increasing expenditure on vocational education. I will deal with that later in my few words of contribution. He said that the cuts are being introduced under the interesting label of benchmarking efficiencies which are described in a budget measures table as providing an incentive to the states to achieve efficiency gains in their vocational education and training operations by, for example, benchmarking their activities against the most cost-effective states.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Why wouldn't they improve? Why wouldn't they get better? Some TAFE practices were founded back in the 1970s, some in the 1980s. We are now at the end of the 1990s. It is time for them, like other organisations around the country, to get better, to get more effective and more productive. He then goes on to talk about the Victorian model:

        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         That is nonsense. The Victorian government has made no decision about collapsing 14 TAFEs into eight or five or any other number. A research paper has been produced for the Victorian Minister for Tertiary Education, Mr Honeywood. That research paper offers quite a number of options for change because we cannot sit still forever. The world is marching on, technology is changing rapidly and communications technology puts us in touch increasingly with the rest of the world day by day.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We cannot sit here and wait. We cannot pretend that time does not march on and things do not change. TAFE is going to have to change too. It is a discussion paper. It is up to the Victorians and the minister whether to implement that paper or any parts of it. So the shadow minister got it wrong.

         Hear, hear! Well done, member for Werriwa. That is what this Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill is all about. It is about funding security to vocational education and training in Australia. A whole range of initiatives have been undertaken by this government and by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training that are well worthy of consideration by this parliament, that are now taking place and that are challenging TAFEs. Only recently I was discussing with one of the directors of one my TAFEs the challenges he faced in the new year as they adapt to the changing environment, needing to make themselves more relevant to the present and less relevant to the past.

I spent some time demolishing, I think quite satisfactorily, the arguments of the member for Werriwa, who led the opposition in the debate on the second and third reading of this particular bill. His contribution was largely to spend time attacking the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training and the government for so&amp;hyphen;called cuts to vocational education and training funding from the Commonwealth, which is a giant furphy; it is not true.

          I am reminded of the merry&amp;hyphen;go&amp;hyphen;round of employment programs put on by the former Labor government under the Working Nation banner. They really were merry&amp;hyphen;go&amp;hyphen;rounds: they led to no certification and no outcomes. They were simply training for the sake of training—not for a job. You could take a course on how to drive a forklift when there was not a forklift within 100 miles of where you live—and you had no intention of shifting location. If that did not work, you took a course on how to operate a computer, or you tried a course on Horticulture 23 or Basket Weaving 47, a terrific course that led to all kinds of unusable outcomes for those poor, disadvantaged people who could not find a job. But Labor said, `We will give you hope. Here is hope. Here is a training course'—with no outcome, no jobs and no relevance to what employers want.

          This government is trying to make vocational training relevant to what industry is looking for so that the people who need the courses and want to access employment will have skills that are up to date and are what employers want. That seems to me pretty basic and important. The member for Werriwa professes in our daily newspapers to be a modern, lateral thinker, but in future direction he is stuck in the past. He wants us to go back and provide Working Nation type solutions for vocational education.

In addition to maintaining their operations, they will then schedule their courses and their students for an increasing off&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;job component. At the same time, they will be contesting these places with new companies—sometimes the firms that may employ the trainees and sometimes group training companies. Sometimes private training institutions, which believe that they have the skills and the expertise to provide vocational education and training at a standard equal to or better than our TAFE colleges, will want to contest this market.

         The government is strongly committed to the development of an efficient and effective vocational education and training system. This bill is one element of the total program that the government is bringing into place, and that program reflects the commitment that the government made before the last election to give young Australians quality training opportunities that would lead them on to real jobs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government is very conscious of the fact that Australia, looking now towards the 21st century, requires a highly competitive industry that will stand on its own two feet and that will be able to compete with the best in the world. It will not do this unless it has access to a pool of skills which it can draw on that are equal to the best skills that can be drawn upon by industry anywhere in the world. The training arrangements that the government is now putting in place, and in particular the new national apprenticeship system, aim to provide young Australians on the one hand and industry on the other with those world&amp;hyphen;class skills.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill before us is part of a package of measures the government has brought forward which increases vocational education and training expenditure to over $1.3 billion compared with expenditure of $1.2 billion in 1995&amp;hyphen;96. The figures show that the government has increased its overall allocation for vocational education and training by $144 million or almost 12 per cent. So the claim we have heard during this debate by members of the Labor Party that there has been a reduction in funding by this government for vocational education and training is not correct. It is based on a misunderstanding of the place that this bill has in the total funding for vocational education and training which the government has made. The bill before us supplements funding for the vocational education and training sector by $17.938 million in 1997 and it will appropriate $890,585,000 for 1998 and 1999. This is part of that total package and only a part.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It is very important, from the government's point of view, that we get full value for the investment of taxpayers' money. I believe that
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          the state colleagues in this area and colleagues in the territories agree with the Commonwealth that there are efficiencies to be gained in the expenditure of this money within the TAFE systems. The Commonwealth has written to the state governments, making the point to them that we believe that there is an opportunity for significant growth in places in TAFE in Australia through the making of these efficiencies.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Earlier this year the state and territory ministers agreed that there was scope within the training budgets of the states and territories to achieve significant efficiency gains. These gains would have reference to the agreements reached by the ministerial council on training priorities. The states and territories have already agreed to give high priority to the funding of off&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;job training for new apprenticeships within their TAFE systems, and the Commonwealth welcomes that commitment by the states and territories.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The Australian National Training Authority ministerial council will, at its meeting in November 1997, agree to the final allocation of the funds appropriated through previous legislation and continued in this legislation. I have written to all the state and territory ministers saying that the application of the principle that growth be derived from efficiencies can and should reflect the individual circumstances of states and territories. There has been a certain amount of comment in the public debate which does not accurately reflect the Commonwealth's position, which is that the Commonwealth is very prepared to take into account the differences in the relative levels of efficiency within the different states. On the information available to the Commonwealth, I am happy to acknowledge in this debate that we do see Victoria as being the benchmark state in terms of efficiency.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The interest of the Commonwealth in achieving growth in places through efficiencies would not preclude, for example, states and territories having the flexibility to apply at least some of the immediate gains from efficiencies to short&amp;hyphen;term measures which would enhance the prospects of further efficiency gains in the medium term. It would not be my intention that the Australian National
         <break page="8059" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Training Authority would seek to be involved in the decisions of states and territories on these matters.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The decisions that the Commonwealth government is taking are not merely expressed in terms of this very substantial financial investment, which the appropriations in this bill represent; the government has also embarked on fundamental reforms of industry training in Australia. The main objective of those reforms is to ensure that industry can readily access the kind of training it needs to increase productivity in the workplace and that it can get the training it wants from public and private training providers, customised to the needs of the particular workplace. One of the reasons why employers these days, following the Keating recession, are so unwilling to take on apprentices is that many employers see that the off&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;job training that those apprentices will require during the terms of their apprenticeships will not add a great deal, or indeed add anything, to the productivity of the particular workplace within which the apprentice is employed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Employers are also concerned that the traditional four&amp;hyphen;year commitment to an apprenticeship exceeds their capacity to be confident about the future of their business. The reforms that the government is making therefore will ensure that, from 1 January next year, under the user&amp;hyphen;choice arrangements being implemented by the states and territories, employers will be able to access off&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;job training from either a private provider or a public TAFE provider and so ensure that that off&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;job training is training which meets the needs of their business.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Training providers will have the opportunity to customise that training, in consultation with the employer and the apprentice, to ensure that the apprentice gets a nationally recognised qualification and the employer gets the training that is required to enhance the competitiveness, the productivity and ultimately the profitability of the business which is employing the apprentice.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government is also taking steps outside this particular package—but I think it is important to see this in context—to expand resources available to group training com
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          panies in Australia. Group training companies have the capacity to give flexibility to the apprenticeship arrangements beyond those which an employer receives if the employer enters into a direct contract with an apprentice.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is easy, of course, to fall into the traditional terminology when talking about apprenticeships and to discuss apprenticeships as if they are time based. But under the new arrangements an apprenticeship will be competency based. Therefore, an apprenticeship that previously would have taken, say, four years could even be completed in, say, 2&amp;half; years. The apprentice, having gained the necessary skills and qualifications, could then move into post&amp;hyphen;apprenticeship employment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are very significant flexibilities coming into the national industry training arrangements as a result of the reforms put into place by this government. The new apprenticeships will be based on training packages, which currently are being developed in consultation with industry. These training packages will include a detailed specification of the competencies and skills required by the industry and the way in which these competencies or skills will be assessed so that the certificate can be awarded.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the great features of the new system is that a training provider recognised in one state will be recognised in all states and, once a training provider is a recognised provider, they will be able to issue nationally recognised qualifications. So an interstate company will have no difficulty in making its training arrangements in an efficient way and will not have to enter into new training arrangements in each of the states in which it employs people.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Another significant aspect of these reforms is what we call the one&amp;hyphen;stop apprenticeship shop. Presently 18 pilots are being undertaken in Australia. There is one operating in the electorate of Bendigo, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid. I know it has your great support and, indeed, your encouragement. I am quite sure that that is seen to be a very valuable addition to the institutions in Bendigo, giving both businesses and young people the opportunity to obtain quality training.

          In the debate a number of statements have been made which have not been correct or are based on misunderstandings. While I do not want to go through those in great detail, I might just mention that the member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield) used quite inaccurate figures relating to the impact of the common youth allowance. It was suggested that some 162,000 additional places might be required in TAFE as a result of the common youth allowance coming in from 1 July next year. The reality is that the Commonwealth expects, on its own assessment, that only some 1,500 young people will be seeking vocational education and training through TAFE as a result of the changes to the common youth allowance.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Comments have been made on the number of apprenticeships and traineeships being taken up at the present time. While there has been some slowing in the last couple of years in apprenticeship commencements, the government would like to note that what this demonstrates is the desperate need for the government's new arrangements. The sooner they come into place the better. The government, since the last election, has gone out of its way to facilitate the expansion of the traineeship system. In 1996-97, 51,348 traineeship commencements were recorded, compared with only 36,152 commencements in the 1995-96 year. That is a very substantial increase in the number of traineeships.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          To some extent, what is happening here is that employers are seeing the traineeship as perhaps an alternative or a prelude to the first year of an apprenticeship. Employers are preferring, to some extent, the flexibility of the short&amp;hyphen;term traineeship to the longer&amp;hyphen;term commitment that they see implied in an apprenticeship.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Let me make it quite clear that the government wants to see a proper integration between traineeships and apprenticeships and wants to encourage all industries to look beyond the shorter term traineeship to longer term quality training. Over the next couple of years we are certainly going to see coming into place training arrangements which are neither the existing traineeship nor the traditional apprenticeship but training arrange

           ments which perhaps extend over two years and provide apprenticeship level qualifications. The government is also keen to encourage businesses to use the new industrial relations arrangements, and Australian workplace agreements in particular, to define training arrangements.

We would and we will abolish that position in government. But, for so long as it exists, we have profound concern about the way in which it operates and the way in which it is being operated by the incumbent.

          I want to discuss an issue which was most prominent last week and which was at the forefront of public concern about the operations of the Workplace Relations Act. I am referring to a major change in the way Australians conduct industrial relations: the attitude to arbitration under the Workplace Relations Act and the change in the access which Australian employers and employees have to arbitration to resolve intractable disputes. That is not the only aspect of arbitration that is of importance and needs consideration, but it is the one that has been in the public spotlight.

          The particular clause that was under discussion last week in relation to the so-called Hunter Valley No. 1 dispute—the coal industry dispute between Rio Tinto and the CFMEU being conducted in the Hunter Valley—does not really flow from an amendment to the Industrial Relations Act of last year because the clause in question was in the Industrial Relations Act. It was introduced in the first draft by the government in its proposals to amend it and to renominate it as the Workplace Relations Act. It emerged unscathed from the Democrat-Liberal deal—the Kernot-Reith deal—which eventually led to the passage of the bill.

          What has changed dramatically in so far as it affects that dispute and the public perception of arbitration is the way in which that section is being interpreted and applied. It goes far beyond the act, although the minister was correct last week when he said that some of the amendments which were introduced by the Workplace Relations Bill and which became part of the Workplace Relations Act did significantly limit the power of the Industrial Relations Commission to arbitrate on many matters. That is a cause of serious concern to us and  is something which we opposed at the time, which we oppose now and which, if we were successful at the next election, we would move to change.

We have a choice in Australia, we have a choice in this parliament, we have a choice as a nation. Do we want to go down the route which I observed in the United States earlier this year, where during a visit to that country I spoke to a group of workers who had been on strike for five years? Is that really the circumstance we think is in the national interest? Is that the direction of Australian industrial relations? It never has been. We have had a lot of industrial disputes. Until the election of the Hawke government in 1993, we had far too many. We had very high levels of industrial dispute right through the seventies, the early eighties and before.

That is not something that a responsible government should look at lightly, but their attitude is, `So be it.' That is what they said in the commission in one of the most profound abrogations of national responsibility by an Australian government in industrial relations that I have seen in my lifetime.

It should have looked at the problem of increasing unfairness in Australian workplaces and the evidence that the gap in incomes in Australia is widening beyond the ambit of this legislation. I say briefly by way of background that the most obvious widening is in the massive increase in executive salaries. Second, there is a gap between employees winning negotiated increases and employees winning award increases only. Any examination of the data shows that that gap is widening and it is leading to more unfairness in our society, and this legislation ignores it. This first opportunity that the government had to recognise the problems being caused and exacerbated by its legislation has been ignored. This was an opportunity to protect the weakest in our industrial relations system.

We could say, `Let's stop the world; we want to go back to how it used to be.' That is not possible. The world will not wait for us, nor should we wish it to.

         There are really three groups of amendments to the act. The first group is not contentious in any manner that the government is aware of. That is to say that both the ACCI and the ACTU, through the Committee on Industrial Legislation—a subcommittee of the National Labour Consultative Council—essentially signed off on group one amendments, which is a raft of fairly minor amendments. The shadow minister did, however, say that the opposition does intend to oppose some of the amendments relating to disamalgamations—there are several minor amendments in the group one amendments that affect the disamalgamation procedures for unions which wish to dissolve their relationship under the amalgamation provisions of the former government. Perhaps the ACTU as the working party of the ALP opposition did not get it quite right.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is a group of recommendations which the ACTU said they did not like very much and would `suggest' to their working party, the opposition, that they oppose. They included such things as making it clear that the 14&amp;hyphen;day period provided to employees to consider a certified agreement is not affected by new staff commencing work within the period. Another one is to expand the definition of an `AWA official' to include all staff of the Office of the Employment Advocate so that it is not just the Employment Advocate himself who has to go out into the field—a totally sensible provision. My understanding is that the opposition and the ACTU oppose that amendment because they are opposed to AWAs. How silly. The parliament said, `We want Australian workplace agreements.' It is clear. There are provisions for it in the act. It will enable the Office of the Employment
         <break page="8067" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Advocate to oversee and supervise Australian workplace agreements, amongst other things. To now oppose an amendment that will make the provisions of the act work more clearly and better is just a nonsense.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another one of those group two amendments is the clarification of the rights of entry and the power of authorised officers of the Office of the Employment Advocate. The last one is to clarify reference to a `relevant award' in section 152 to make it clear that relevant awards are relevant `state' awards—simply a language oversight in the original bill.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The group three amendments are largely opposed because, except for two issues, they deal with AWAs. The first of those issues is an amendment that clarifies the application of state laws on termination to employers covered by federal awards. My understanding is that the opposition is opposed in some manner to that amendment.

         The most significant amendment that is dealt with in this bill is an amendment to ensure that an agreement may not be approved when it includes a preference provision inconsistent with the Workplace Relations Act freedom of association provisions and to provide for the removal of void preference clauses in awards and agreements. That is a very important amendment because we have the absolutely ludicrous situation where the AIRC has evidently made the odd determination here and there where parties to an agreement—the employer and union representative of the employees—have, through industrial muscle or for whatever reason, agreed to a certified agreement or to change an award and have included preference clauses for union members in it. That is clearly not the intention of the Workplace Relations Act. Freedom of association provisions in the act made it clear that we were done with the days of preference, we were done with the days of monopoly and we were going to allow a contestable market as industry and education have contestable markets and indeed as we in this political arena in the parliament have a contestable market.

         The opposition spokesman on industrial relations matters has had a few things to say recently about the ALP's, the federal opposition's, new industrial relations policy platform.

          The entire intent and objects of the workplace relations legislation are to try to allow employees and employers, to the largest extent possible, to make agreements that suit themselves, arrangements that suit them and that are fair. Yes, we have left umpires in place. We have left safety nets, boundaries and constraints in place. That is one of the reasons the bill is as long as it is: to make sure that the guarantee that we gave the Australian people in the lead&amp;hyphen;up to the last election was actually kept not only in the intent of the legislation but also in the working bill itself so that the parties to all of this conformed to what parliament had in mind.

He wants to go back to the forties and fifties, reregulate the system and give the commission powers to arbitrate whenever a union or an employer says that they do not agree with the other party.

Ten years ago that would not have been true.

That says to me that we are starting to get our act together. It says to me that increasingly managements are becoming more modern and more focused on what happens out there on the factory floor and that they are working with their employees to achieve overall total results that are of benefit to the company, to the employees and, indeed, ultimately to the nation.

          out there who actually need the assistance of an independent organisation, namely, the Industrial Relations Commission, to try to assist them in establishing decent and reasonable rates of pay. I might also say that the Australian community's record on job creation in the last decade—a system that is not as deregulated as the American system—stands us in good stead when one does an objective comparison.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I think it is about time that some people understood the actual safety net increases and current rates of pay that those people who depend on the award system actually receive. I must say that I would not want to bring up a family of a couple of children, with all the associated costs of education and health, on rates of pay like the following rates of pay. I know they are an embarrassment to the member for La Trobe, who speaks a lot about these issues but is not really interested in the facts.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is for that very reason I want to place the following facts on the table this evening. I think it is a bit tough that the current government opposes minimum wage increases for the particular types of workers who are dependent on the safety net. Take for example a female clothing worker in a garment factory. What is her current base rate? I will tell you what it is. It is not even $10 per hour. It is a gross rate of $359.40 for a 38&amp;hyphen;hour week. I would like to see the member for La Trobe try to bring up a family on a gross rate of $359.40 a week.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We then go to hospitality workers—and I must say that in the past I have negotiated on behalf of hospitality workers. What is their gross rate for a 38&amp;hyphen;hour week? Again, it is $359.40. These very workers are an example of the low paid worker, whose capacity to achieve reasonable increases on a reasonable base rate of pay—after proper argument and determination on merit, with the assistance of the safety net—the member for La Trobe and the Minister for Industrial Relations want to undermine.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We then go to a child&amp;hyphen;care worker—and I know that everyone wants child care. But the problem is that some people out there in the Australian community believe that child-care
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          workers ought to operate on the basis of charity. This is what a child&amp;hyphen;care worker currently receives: for a 38&amp;hyphen;hour week, a gross wage of $366.60. Finally, I refer to a process worker in a manufacturing plant who, for a 38&amp;hyphen;hour week, receives a gross wage of, again, $359.40.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I place those facts on the table because I think it is about time that some people on the other side of the House understood that no-one in this chamber is opposed to enterprise bargaining. However, the real issue is ensuring that there is an adequate system in place to protect those who cannot achieve reasonable improvements in their wages and conditions of employment through enterprise bargaining.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The types of workers we are talking about, I might say, very much include women. Significant numbers of women are clothing workers, hospitality workers, child-care workers, and process workers in a variety of manufacturing establishments around Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         On that note, I say that I believe this bill seeks, on an ad hoc basis, to give more powers to the ill-conceived Office of the Employment Advocate. We all know that the Office of the Employment Advocate is shrouded in secrecy, yet the intent of this bill is to give it more power and, in doing so, to undermine the rights of employees under the existing act, under the so-called guise of technical amendments.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The position of Employment Advocate was created by this government; it was created as a completely inadequate substitute for the Industrial Relations Commission—that independent organisation that has so rightly served the Australian community through thick and thin over many, many years. I only hope that, one way or another, there is a role for the Industrial Relations Commission in seeking to solve the problems currently confronting the Australian community in the Hunter coalmining dispute.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The truth of the matter is that from time to time we need an independent organisation to actually intervene in the public interest and sort out disputes where there is a lack of capacity by the parties themselves. I know, as
         <break page="8071" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          do you, Mr Deputy Speaker, from your previous experience, that it is not always possible for whatever reason for the parties themselves to adequately sort out their differences. The Hunter dispute may end up being such a dispute, and we must have the capacity in the Industrial Relations Act to ensure that the commission can involve itself to act in the public interest and actually broker an outcome between the parties which will serve both the parties themselves and, perhaps more importantly, the community at large.

         For that reason, I suggest that the position of the Employment Advocate was part of the Howard government's Workplace Relations Act passed by the Senate—not because of the support of the Australian Labor Party, but because of the support of the Australian Democrats—last year and eventually passed by this chamber on 21 November of last year, despite our strong opposition and concern about the intent of the bill. One of the main effects of the Workplace Relations Act was to reduce substantially the role of the Industrial Relations Commission and to strip back the role of awards in protecting conditions of employment, especially those of workers such as female clothing workers, hospitality workers, child-care workers, and process workers in manufacturing establishments.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Perhaps the bill did not go as far as the coalition government wanted it to in 1993 in their famous Fightback package—a package which the people of Australia rightly rejected at that time. But I do suggest the bill goes far enough to ensure that a lot of workers will definitely be worse off as a result of its effect. For example, it specifically ensures that, by losing some of their award conditions from June 1998 by being forced onto individual contracts and by losing protections against unfair dismissal, a lot of workers will be worse off.

         The Howard government watered down the Industrial Relations Commission in order to weaken the historic role this institution has played in promoting equity of earnings and employment conditions in the Australian workplace—equity between women and men, between younger and older workers, between well organised and less well organised groups

          of workers. The Howard government decided that it wanted to dispense with all this and, instead, take us down the path of labour market deregulation—an approach very much supported, for example, by the previous speaker, the member for La Trobe and, I might say, the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) with respect to changes on the industrial relations front in Australia.

         The problem is that the token office it has now established to provide some so-called protection for employees is completely ineffectual and a farce.

He is not acting accountably to the national parliament, as the recent Senate estimates process proved.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I would also remind the House that, in his first headland speech, the Prime Minister, prior to the last election, talked a lot about rebuilding trust in government—his words, not mine. He said that he, himself, would clean up government and clean up parliament. We have all seen how he has applied this statement to ministerial standards in the operation of the government in its first 18 months. Yet the main office bearer under his prized Workplace Relations Act has been treating the national parliament with absolute contempt. This bill would further remove the Employment Advocate from proper parliamentary scrutiny and accountability.

         There are some very disturbing trends now occurring in the Australian labour market under the more deregulated regime of the government. They demonstrate the need for an Industrial Relations Commission with real powers. Casual employment, for example, has now risen to more than one quarter of total employment in Australia, giving us almost the highest rate of casual employment in the OECD—second only to Spain. Under the new regime of labour market deregulation, casual employment is becoming an officially sanctioned alternative to awards.

         The trouble is that it does not come with many of the benefits provided by awards. The
         <break page="8072" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          industrial relations conditions of many part-time workers, who now overlap substantially with the casual work force, have deteriorated. Jobs generally have become increasingly less secure—the major problem confronting the Australian community at the moment. It is not just a question of jobs growth but also a sense of security in people's lives, be those people with a job or without a job. There is an increasing divide, I suggest to the House, between the conditions of core and peripheral jobs or the primary and secondary labour force, the type of labour force that is very much encouraged and sought by the government of the day. There has also been a trend to more self-employed people and independent contractors. Clearly, the world of work has changed dramatically in Australia in the last couple of years.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another negative feature of labour market deregulation is increased inequity in working hours, an issue that I have raised on a number of occasions over the last 18 months. Every week almost half of all full-time employees in Australia are working overtime and more than a third of this work, unfortunately, is unpaid. Too many employers are now increasing the amount of unpaid overtime from their existing workers rather than putting on additional workers and thereby creating the so necessary important jobs that we need in the community at the moment.

         The Howard government's Workplace Relations Act is making this problem worse by removing all social considerations from the allocation and regulation of work. In that context I refer to the first independent study of the non-union individual contracts agreed to since the act came into operation by the University of Sydney. That independent study indicates that employees are being made to work longer hours.

         The most recent findings of the Australian Workplace Industrial Relations Survey, released and widely publicised a couple of weeks ago, dramatically confirm that work is becoming more intense, Australian workers are becoming more stressed, and it is getting harder to balance work and family life. That is the end result of some of these changes. Workers are more stressed, Australian workers

         Alternatively, unlike the government, the Labor Party is putting forward policies, referred to previously by the shadow minister for industrial relations, which seek to reverse these undesirable trends. And undesirable trends they are. The shift in policy to a singular emphasis on labour market deregulation since the Howard government was elected has done nothing to reduce the unemployment rate. It is interesting to note that 18 months into this first term of office of the Howard government, it is a government in disarray when it comes to the issue of jobs. I refer to a few facts. I know the government does not like to hear these facts when it comes to the issue of jobs and the all important question of unemployment and security in people's lives. Unemployment fell by more than a full percentage point in the last 18 months of the Keating Labor government.

         By contrast, what has occurred in the first 18 months of the Howard government? It is interesting to note that it has not fallen but, more importantly, despite the fact that the Prime Minister when pressed, was first to concede that he had inherited a strong economy, it has actually risen by 0.3 percentage points in the first 18 months of the Howard government. I dare suggest that if the Howard government had managed the strong economy that it inherited we would have been talking about, at the end of this three&amp;hyphen;year period of government, an unemployment rate of seven per cent or so—not 8.7 per cent, as we are now talking about 18 months in, effectively half of a normal term of government.

         Last week we saw the unemployment figures for the month of August. They show that there is no relief in sight. I know that the minister for employment likes to look at the clouds and hope that the drought breaks in the near future, but the figures of last week show that there is no relief in sight. Long-term unemployment—people unemployed for 12 months or more—last week reached a 28-month high. There are now 247,700 Australians who have been unemployed for 12 months or more. That is the highest number of long-term unemployed people in Australia since the month of April 1995.

         It is also interesting to note that for every consecutive month since May of last year, when the Labor Party's jobs programs were cut, long-term unemployment has grown in Australia.

         I refer to some of the other changes on the budget front that the Howard government has made since it was elected in March of last year.

I would have thought that full-time employment would have seen some improvement if we had listened and believed the Prime Minister in August of last year.

         Those figures also came out recently, in the last 10 days. It is an absolute disgrace.

So much for the government's commitment to overcoming unemployment and the so-called impact of these potential changes on the industrial relations front. As if 60,000 full-time jobs since August of last year were not bad enough, we also recently had the unemployment figures for the month of August.

That was clarified and put beyond any doubt at a recent CEDA meeting where the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, spoke in the following terms. At that meeting, she said: `You have to have a freer industrial relations system. You have to have—it might be described as—lessened job security.'

Unfortunately for unemployed Australians, he has no suggestions about how to tackle unemployment. Giving the Employment Advocate more powers will not help to create jobs. It will only add to people's insecurities, further undermine the award system and ensure that the low paid in this community, who need a helping hand from the Industrial Relations Commission, are denied that helping hand.

         Both the shadow minister, the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan), and the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) have attempted to justify the Labor record since 1983 and, what I think is even more revealing, have attempted to justify their `back to the future' policy. They seem to think that they can have one policy when they are in government and another when they are in opposition. I do not happen to think the Australian people will fall for that line.

         My concern is along the same lines as that of the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles). If we believe in this country that the old industrial relations club of the ACTU, the Industrial Relations Court and the ALP can offer a better choice to the Australian workplace than the millions of Australians who are actually out there working in the workplace, with their employers, then we must think again. It is a proven and known fact that the Keating government moved down the path of a more deregulated labour market. In fact, going back as far as the Hawke prime ministership, this deregulatory approach was seen as our best hope in an emerging market economy in the international trading environment.

         Politics is part of all of our lives as we come to this place, but ultimately the responsibility is to provide the best possible standard of living and the best opportunities for every Australian. We would expect to have genuine debate and genuine differences about how we might do that among the historic parties of this parliament, but there are some fundamentals which we cannot escape. For example, the member for Batman referred to the minimum wage of four categories of workers: $359 to $366, whether you are a hospitality worker, a child&amp;hyphen;care worker or a process worker. I would submit that, as someone who has worked for most of my working life for less than that, it is far better to offer people the opportunity to have a wage than to confine them to the welfare system.

That is not something that I dwell on with pride or with any sense of gloating, but I think we have to be realistic enough in this place to acknowledge that the previous government in no way had the answers. We will never forget what Mr Keating said when he was at his peak as the Treasurer of the day: the `recession we had to have'. It just showed the difficulty that governments have, particularly the Labor government, in coming to terms with how we actually deal with the issue of unemployment.

         The accusation is made of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that he is not coming to terms with changing realities. Let us look at what the Prime Minister's realities were when he came into office—a man who has given well over 20 years of political service to the parliament of this country; a man for whom I have enormous respect, especially his undiluted commitment to the issues of Australia over that period; and a man who, through a whole range of adversities, came to be Prime Minister in March 1996. Let us look at the changing realities that he and the cabinet have had to deal with. The deficit is well documented. There has been a long period of high interest rates. There is a long history of balance of payments problems and a history of a culture which had, for too long, relied on welfare.

         The  Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1997  itself makes some quite objectionable amendments, albeit to many separate areas of provisions in the Workplace Relations Act.

         Overall, the bill makes amendments to a system of industrial relations which is itself objectionable.

Indeed, he refused to provide the committee with any of the agreements that he had so approved or rejected and hence removed himself entirely from any objective scrutiny. That is certainly a very cosy position for any bureaucrat to be in. Of course, we know that the Employment Advocate makes his decisions in a situation where there is no right of intervention of any objective party to voice their argument as to whether the Australian workplace agreements are in accordance with modern industrial norms.

         The government's approach in this bill is extremely short-sighted. While the employers will unquestionably have the upper hand in areas where there is high unemployment or in areas where the work force is unskilled, that is certainly not universally the case. Governments throughout modern history have known that unrestrained wages break&amp;hyphen;outs have a devastating economic effect. The first recorded attempt to restrain a wages break&amp;hyphen;out was the 1349 Statute of Labourers which was passed after the great plague wiped out so much of the European population and caused a labour shortage.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Since that time there have been labour shortages because of war or other economic circumstances. But it is not only those economic or historical circumstances that result in a situation where labour has the upper hand and the opportunity to cause a wages break-out. While we do have high unemployment in a great number of industries in Australia—indeed, in the majority of industries—we still have a number of very affluent sectors.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have the communications sector; we have the mining sector which, by and large, is still affluent with high levels of employment; and we have the petroleum industry with high levels of employment. It is fair to say that workers in those industries, unionised workers, have the upper hand and if Australian workplace agreements are struck they are beyond the scrutiny which previously existed where the commission was required to consider certified agreements or enterprise flexibility agreements in terms of the public interest, including the flow&amp;hyphen;on consequences

         The reason this government is so short-sighted is that removing agreements from scrutiny necessarily means removing all agreements from objective vetting, including those ones where workers will have the capacity to cause wages break&amp;hyphen;outs. Those wages break&amp;hyphen;outs are not necessarily going to be confined to those specific industries. They invariably have flow-on consequences. That is where this government is so naive and shows such short-sightedness.

         While the government has an industrial relations framework perhaps suitable, from its perspective, to limited sectors in the historical and economic circumstances that confront Australia at the present time with high unemployment, that is not going to be the case in perpetuity. The whole tide will swing back, and the government will be caught short. I think it is fair to say that one of the reasons the Liberal government lost power in the early 1980s was that a wages break&amp;hyphen;out under the former Fraser government in the late 1970s led to the economic recession in the early 1980s and hence the demise of the Fraser government.

         The Australian Industrial Relations Commission has provided a unique service to this nation, resolving complex industrial disputes. The competent commissioners—and there are many—have an instinct for weighing up the hidden agendas of both parties. Whether they are internal political machinations within the union or whether they are internal power plays within the employer, they have the knack to cut through all that and get to the crux of the problem.

         : `Welcome to arbitration nineties style'. It was a reference to the appointment of Geoffrey Giudice as the President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. That was indeed an appropriate reference: `Welcome to arbitration nineties style' because it is 1890s style. This is the precise history that occurred in the 1890s before our constitutional forefathers gave federal parliament the power to resolve industrial disputes. They are exactly the same issues—the issues about so-called freedom of contract and union busting tactics on the part of employers.

         Our constitutional forefathers saw the massive economic devastation that that period of intense industrial conflict caused. They said that something had to be done about it. There had to be introduced the rule of law into a situation of industrial anarchy. Last week, rather than encouraging and advocating the rule of law in bringing about commonsense, the government was standing at the edge of a bushfire throwing petrol on the fire, saying to the firemen, `Stay right away from this fire; let her erupt, let her go.' We are waiting now to see where that bushfire takes us.

         In terms of that headline about arbitration nineties style, the minister recently adopted the catch-cry that we have now come to an
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          era where management have the right to manage their own enterprises. What he is talking about is not so much the rebirth but the misconception of managerial prerogative. Let us again look at the time warp that the minister is in. I refer to the comments in 1913 of Acting Chief Justice Barton, after whom my seat was named. In terms of this concept of managerial prerogative in respect of the employer in that case, he said:
         </break>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         His freedom to contract in such matters remains to him . . . The employer and not the employed must prevail . . . the decision what to do with his own property and therefore the conduct of it, belongs to the employer . . .

        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         So we are not talking about 1990s concepts; we are talking about 1913 concepts. In terms of the morality that has developed in Australia regarding so-called managerial prerogative, there has been a recognition that workers have a legitimate interest, and indeed right, to have a say in their employment destinies. More recently, Justice Wilson said in the Federated Clerks case on this same topic:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . consultation between employers and employees, preceded by the distribution of adequate information, is not only sensible but essential if commerce and industry are to meet the challenge of progress in a spirit of harmony and with some regard to human dignity.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         This government has no regard for human dignity. That is obvious and plain for all to see. The Full Bench of the High Court of Australia said in Cram's case:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         No doubt our traditional system of industrial conciliation and arbitration has itself contributed to a growing recognition that management and labour have a mutual interest in many aspects of the operation of a business enterprise. Many management decisions, once viewed as the sole prerogative of management, are now correctly seen as directly affecting the relationship of employer and employee and constituting an "industrial matter".
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         This government does not recognise that. Whether something is or is not an industrial matter is quite irrelevant to it. It is saying that the management has open slather. Indeed, it is out there cajoling management to take on workers, despite the fact that in many cases enterprise agreements exist and exist for several more years. This government is effectively trying to induce breaches of contract.

          The reason this government must attack the role of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is that, of necessity, if it has cause to intervene in a dispute situation and to arbitrate a fair outcome between the parties, that in itself is of course an interference with management prerogative, because it is not the managers' prerogative that has the ultimate say. But this government is not about achieving a fair outcome where workers have an interest and a say and are consulted with respect to their futures and their security. This government is about compelling workers to negotiate terms of surrender, not about maintaining their working conditions.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Why would the government go about such a radical change in a situation where Australia has achieved very significant gains in productivity? I have two cases in front of me: a case involving Heinz and a case involving Nestle Australia. These are two cases under the former Labor government's regime where the Australian Industrial Relations Commission actually rejected enterprise agreements because the commission was not satisfied that the productivity offsets offered by the workers was sufficient and, hence, they did not grant the pay rise. That regime applied right through the last decade. Indeed, the proof of the pie is in the eating in this regard.

          The Productivity Commission recently released a research paper assessing Australia's productivity performance. The report of the Productivity Commission found that Australia's productivity over the last decade has been considerably in excess of our OECD competitors. They say:

They are picking off the high wage earners and trying to cause resentment among the lower paid. That is one aspect, but they are actually evoking industrial disputation to give themselves an issue. While they are running to the election for that purpose, they are not running this country in the interests of Australians.

          —It is always a pleasure to follow the member for Barton (Mr McClelland) on this area. His knowledge and background is quite extensive. Indeed, he practised as a solicitor and did a lot of work in this area over a number of years. I certainly do not want to get into a debate about his expertise, nor do I want to be critical of some of the points that he made, some of which were quite fair. I do think that there is, nonetheless, with all due respect to him, a mind-set about industrial reform on that side of the parliament.

         Industrial relations policy and reform is something that is needed in this country as part of a total package of trying to improve the economy. It is one facet—and an important one—of trying to improve the economy, trying to create more employment and trying to develop a fair and equitable system that does not have a section of the work force in a really privileged position as opposed to another section of the work force which has similar skills.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is one of the areas that the opposition does not seem to want to address in this debate. Take, for example, the waterfront. To me, it is incredible that in 1997 workers on the waterfront control how many people work, for example, in Cairns. There is a control on the numbers. Even the previous government, in 1990, as we heard, attempted to break those shackles. It is the union, not the employer who was good enough to offer these people a job, who says, `There shall be X number of workers on the waterfront.'

          That concept, that notion, has no place in Australian society, in my view, in 1997, nor does a section of the work force getting benefits that are out of kilter with any other section of the work force. It has been said—and I think quite fairly—by the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) that executive salaries are also outrageous. I agree with him that in some areas they are outrageous. Some of the amounts that executives have received—and, indeed, it has been said that they have granted to themselves—are really not fair and equitable. Nobody can justify granting and receiving such incomes.

         <para first-indent="16">
          So there is an argument there. But that is not an argument for there to be no reform. It is all very well to say that you want to reform the waterfront or reform the construction industry, but you have to look at the executive salaries. You cannot hold up the reform of thousands on the basis of what may be seen as excessive salaries paid to a few. Nonetheless, that is a matter that is justifiable to mention, but it should not hold up the reform process.

          I have listened to most of the speeches in this debate and it seems to me that when we are looking at this area we always seem to go back to the past. We think there might be a wages break out, that there might be flow-on consequences or that we need the AIRC because we have always had the AIRC—we think it is essential because we have always had it. We always go back to the circular argument: we have always had it, therefore it is essential.

          I do not think that argument holds water any more. The argument treats workers like buffoons, like people who cannot contract on their own behalf. Many of the business people in my electorate take the view, `Why do we have any unfair dismissal law? I don't want to dismiss a worker who is an asset to my business. Why would I? I want to hold on to that worker. That worker is a priceless asset. But I do want to get rid of somebody who is dragging my business down.' So those business people say to me, `Why do we have that law?' I suppose we have to strike compromise on so many things, and that is one area where

          When you look at what changes, if any, have occurred under the new act, I would suggest that in some areas those changes have not worked through to the extent that one would have hoped. I say that in particular about the construction industry. I was in a rather lengthy conversation with an employer in that industry when the new act was proposed. He took the view that any real change in that area would not be brought about easily and that the act, while laudable in its goals, would not provoke the sort of change that was needed to flow through to the smaller subcontractors and people of that nature.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          For example, think of a single subcontractor in the construction industry who has a few employers and reached agreements with those employees. He tenders for a particular subcontract on a large building site. When the head contractor looks at the situation and is reminded by the construction union that these people are not union members and that they are not particularly happy with the sorts of conditions that they have accepted, how will the head contractor take to the potential for a dispute, which might only be a little one but one which could close the whole job down?

         <para first-indent="16">
          You can see the forces that are at work there that could very easily be brought into play to shut out the little subcontractor and thereby continue the perpetuation of the system. Unfortunately, it seems the practice is continuing in the construction industry. Reform is needed in that area. The reform is needed so that more people will ultimately be employed. That is really the bottom line here. That is what we are talking about. The old

          The amendments to the act are largely supported by the ACTU and the opposition, notwithstanding some of the overall general comments that have been made. They are also generally supported by the ACCI. The changes will give effect to the major reforms of the Workplace Relations Act. Over 1,600 new agreements have been certified since this act came into force on 1 January, 47 agreements have been made directly between employers and employees and over 500 Australian workplace agreements have been approved.

          The amendments reflect the legislative objective of having the parties reach an agreement without arbitration. An unintended consequence of limiting access to arbitration is that it may prevent the commission from varying an award to include a safety net adjustment. The amendment makes it clear that the limitation on the commission does not prevent the commission from exercising its arbitral powers to deal with an application to vary an award to include a safety net wage adjustment.

          The time period for the approval of an agreement is 14 days. The time will not be extended if the employer takes on new staff during the approval period. The agreement and its effect have to be explained to the new staff. This avoids delay and the expense of having to restart the approval period each time new staff are hired. In effect, if this provision were not amended the time limit for the approval could stretch out indefinitely. What would happen if, for example, new staff were employed 13 days into the approval time? The time starts again. What happens then if another staff member is employed

          The ACTU would rather the AIRC be given the ability to waive the time limit if it believes it would unreasonably prolong approval and was not being used as a device to avoid the approval process or to allow new employees five days to consider the agreement. Again, this would cause unnecessary delays. This brings about all sorts of problems as to what the definition of `unreasonably' would amount to. A subjective test, such as the ACTU is suggesting, opens the matter up to court proceedings for the determination of its meaning. As happens in most court cases there are varied opinions as to what this particular word means. No doubt both sides would interpret the word differently. The amendment makes it clear and not open to further debate between the parties that the period to consider the agreement is to be 14 days. Both parties know exactly where they stand. A decision one way or the other will be made within that 14&amp;hyphen;day period.

          The present situation in relation to authorised officers who are investigating possible freedom of association breaches is that they can only enter premises where they believe relevant documents may be located. Officers investigating Australian workplace agreement breaches and department of industrial relations inspectors investigating breaches of awards or certified agreements may enter premises where relevant work is being performed and interview employees without being limited to premises where documents may be held. The amendment corrects the anomaly—authorised officers may enter places of business for the purpose of interviewing persons in connection with possible breaches of the freedom of association provisions of the act. No access to a private  home is permitted and the right to interview does not mean that the person is compelled to answer. In my view this amendment is a fair one. If an investigation can sort something out in the early stage and warnings be given it is then less costly to both parties and avoids problems in the future.

          I see that time is advancing. I did have a few more matters to refer to but, generally speaking, these amendments are to be welcomed. It seems that both sides generally agree with these particular amendments. There has been a reservation mentioned by the member for Canberra. It has to be remembered when one has heard some of the contributions from members opposite that industrial relations law and the industrial relations system are not sacrosanct. The people of Australia are looking for change; they are looking for flexibility. The Workplace Relations Act is the first step in that direction but there are a lot more steps to go. It is only one small step. In the ultimate scenario I believe that these amendments and more, we would hope, in the future will bring about a system of industrial relations that will benefit the people of Australia and will produce more jobs for those people who are unable to get work. I commend the government amendments to the House and oppose the opposition amendment.

         On 5 June 1997, the member for Sydney took a point of order during a minister's answer to the effect that attributions should be placed in context and in the light of other quotations. Later, during a personal explanation, the member advanced an interpretation on his comments different to that of the minister. On 17 June, the minister again quoted the member for Sydney, who at the time was absent, and a number of points of order were taken that the member for Sydney had earlier made a personal explanation which disproved the minister's conclusions. I advised the House:

          —The Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) promised a draft environmental impact statement process on Badgerys Creek which was not only open and above board, but a study that was comprehensive, with no stone left unturned. Given the revelations contained in the NSW Environment Protection Agency's report into Badgerys Creek, which was released over the weekend during a large protest meeting, the Howard government's supposedly transparent

         In fact, the New South Wales Environment Protection Agency report has exposed the minister and his promises for what they really are, and that is fraudulent. Following the minister's decision to reject Holsworthy as a site for Sydney's second airport, he stated about Badgerys Creek in this House:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         The draft EIS completely dispels the concerns that many of us had when we came into office in regard to Badgerys Creek airport. The draft EIS clearly indicates that Badgerys Creek is a superior site. It also indicates that Holsworthy is an inferior site for a second airport for Sydney when compared with Badgerys Creek.

         That was on 3 September this year. Only yesterday he reiterated his position by saying:

         It quite clearly states that an airport at Badgerys Creek would be a major source of the pollutant, nitrogen dioxide. It goes even further.

         What sort of a monstrosity is the minister for transport willing to inflict upon the people of western Sydney?

         To top it all off, I believe deep down that, despite the minister for transport's assurances that Badgerys Creek is the best site for an airport, he knows quite well the negative results contained in the New South Wales EPA report are correct.

The draft EIS is a long and complex document. If my information is correct, it includes some 15 technical papers. Why is the minister for transport willing to reveal its contents only during a time when many western Sydney residents are away from their homes on holiday or while many are caught up in finalising their very important family arrangements for the Christmas&amp;hyphen;New Year period break? Why is the minister only allowing 12 weeks viewing time when, if he was being realistic, he would allow six months in order to give all interested parties the opportunity to adequately prepare their submissions on the draft?

         What have the minister and this government really got to hide? I believe it is because the minister for transport knows exactly what he is dealing with in regard to Badgerys Creek.

I believe he knows what sort of damage he is going to do to the health and wellbeing of many Australians who

I urge the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron), the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly), the member for Macquarie (Mr Bartlett) and the member for Macarthur (Mr Fahey) to listen to their constituents, many of whom were at yesterday's Blacktown Civic Centre rally, and confront the Minister for Transport and Regional Development and the Howard government and urge them to take the same action before it is too late. There are other alternatives that should be considered. This airport must not go in the Sydney basin.

          —I spoke this afternoon in the grievance debate on the situation in Cooma and on the Monaro in general. I did not quite finish the remarks I wanted to make. I spoke about the application of exceptional circumstances as a result of the many adverse events that have happened one on top of the other in that region over the last four or five years. The area has been in drought for four or five years and has suffered very low prices in wool and beef, and the net effect has been quite disastrous in many ways. I went on to say how this crisis not only has impacted on the farmers of the region but also has impacted quite substantially on the town of Cooma.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I also referred to another impact on Cooma, which was the closing of the gaol by the New South Wales Labor government. I found this closure very puzzling as this gaol, which is for sex and drug offenders, has operated very successfully for many years. I started to quote some evidence in relation to that from Professor Freda Briggs of Early Childhood and Family Studies at the University of South Australia. She wrote, back in 1993, to the Commissioner for Corrective Services in New South Wales after carrying out research at Cooma Gaol on the particular sex offender program that they operated there called the
         <break page="8086" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          SOAP program, sex offender assessment program. I quoted her on how excellent that course was and how good the results were. She went on to say:

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I have written to the Executive Director of DCS South Australia informing him of our findings, as I am convinced that your model is worthy of emulation. I do realise, however, that your achievements are the result of many years of solid teamwork by a group of committed experts, along with highly professional, humane custodial personnel. This kind of teamwork and expertise cannot be easily reproduced elsewhere.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         I am aware that some people in Child Protection Services oppose the allocation of funds to the SOAP program and they would prefer that the money be used for victims. This is a case of putting the cart before the horse. You are obviously operating on a shoestring budget, and yet there are enormous benefits arising from it. The program should clearly be expanded rather than curtailed. Incarcerated sex offenders have often damaged hundreds of lives, and without a program such as yours will damage many more.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         That was the letter from Professor Briggs to Corrective Services on how successful the program was. But the New South Wales Labor government have said that they cannot provide the necessary program there, that they do not have the expertise. It has obviously worked; the reoffending rate is virtually zilch for those offenders. But they have decided to move them all and spread them around the mainstream gaols in Sydney, and as a consequence have taken $3 million or $4 million out of the economy of Cooma.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I also have a letter from the Commissioner of the Department of Corrective Services to the Governor of the Cooma Gaol at the time, saying, `Here is a copy of the letter from Professor Briggs.' It adds, `My personal congratulations to you and your staff on a job well done.' That is the hard&amp;hyphen;core evidence, but the New South Wales government says, `Oh no, we cannot provide the goods.' I say it is puzzling, and I think many questions should be asked by a lot of people as to why they have pulled that gaol out of Cooma.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But Cooma is a very stoic town. It has had that suffering from the rural recession and the drought they have had for four or five years, plus now 60 people and $3 million or $4 million out of Cooma from the closure of the

So the hardy people of Cooma and the Monaro will ultimately win, and they will have my support all the way.

A recent study of the impact of Melbourne's Crown Casino found that, although it had not yet adversely affected business activity generally across Victoria, some specific Melbourne areas had suffered economic downturn as a result of spending redirected to the casino.

         Recent debate about drug use, despair and even suicide by young people asks the same

          question: why? Although there is no easy answer, society's enthusiastic promulgation of the shallow, materialistic imagery of casino based gambling is one of a number of contributing factors. In fact, I would go so far as to suggest that we are living in a society that is failing—and in that sense we are not alone, I would put to you, Mr Speaker, as evidenced by the fact that we have amongst the highest suicide rates by young people in the industrialised world. Whatever one's attitude to it, we are a country obsessed with the debate about euthanasia; we have a level of drug use, both legal and illegal, that has reached unprecedented proportions in Australia; and we are also a country that is engaged in what has been described as a `race debate'.

         Historically, these are things that are associated with countries and societies that are in a degree of trouble. When you add to that the importance we place upon gambling, I think it suggests that we need to have a long, hard look at the kinds of values we are adopting. In fact, I have often thought that the problem with young people today is not that they have not learned our values but that they have.

         The marketing strategy for casinos is encapsulated by Crown Casino which invites patrons to have `the time of your life'.

         I do not mind a bet myself. I bought a lottery ticket recently. I certainly do not want a culture of moralistic wowserism. However, it would seem equally clear to me that every society needs a mesh of values and beliefs which hold it together, which sees young people, especially, through the ups and downs of life. The gambling culture represents one of a rapidly increasing number of enlarging holes in this net.

          —Many people have claimed that the circumstances surrounding the death of Diana Spencer and her funeral have no significance to the institution of the monarchy or to the issue of an Australian republic. That claim is patently absurd. The perception of the monarchy and its relevance to contemporary Great Britain has undergone a significant reappraisal. Twenty per cent of the British would abandon the monarchy now. A larger proportion believe it should disappear with the demise of the present incumbent. A majority believe that if it persists the throne should pass to Prince William, bypassing Charles. According to reports, Charles is not amused.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are two bases of the current reappraisal of the monarchy. The first concerns the relevance of this anachronistic institution with all its associated pomp, pageantry, privilege and inherited wealth. In addition to that, we might question the relevance to contemporary values of an institution that ensures that the British head of state can never be a Catholic or a Buddhist, can never be chosen on the basis of personal qualities and competence, must always be chosen by right of birth and can never be a woman, despite her own qualities and age, if the current monarch has a son, no matter how junior to his older sister he may be, no matter how less intelligent or fitted for the role he may be.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is even more objectionable and offensive that these same provisions determine who shall be Australia's head of state. Despite the absurd posturing of the monarchists among us, who claim that the Governor-General is our head of state, they cannot explain why the International Olympic Federation will not allow him or her to open the 2000 Olympics,
         <break page="8089" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          a role that is preserved for the head of state, or why our Governor-General is not accorded head of state status anywhere in the world and is seated behind the princes, presidents and potentates of other countries at any international gathering or forum. Would we have the Queen open the Sydney Olympics and then join the cheer squad for the British contestants?
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second basis for reappraisal concerns the qualities and inadequacies of the present incumbents. The exposure of these inadequacies has been encouraged by a less reverent community, an intrusive media and a mass market with an insatiable appetite for titillation. Like 2&amp;half; billion people around the world, I watched the funeral of Diana Spencer. I heard the sobs and cries of anguish from many of the two million who lined the streets to express their affection and, for most, to purge their guilt. Why was Diana Spencer, in the company of her lover in a speeding car driven by a drunk driver, in a Paris tunnel? Why was the former wife of a possible future king of England and the mother of a possible future king of England in such a situation?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The reasons include the fact that for the institution of the monarchy she had served her purpose. The monarchy needed an heir to the throne. An heir for a whole range of reasons could not be supplied by Mrs Parker&amp;hyphen;Bowles. Having fulfilled her purpose, she was subsequently expelled from The Firm and banished. She was denied a royal title, which would have at least ensured that she would have been provided with proper, continuing protection and security. Diana Spencer was cut adrift.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The royal family was not united in grief. Like many of the two million people who lined the streets, they were united in guilt. I have still not heard the Queen say that she grieved or was even sorry about the death of her former daughter-in-law, mother of two of her grandchildren. The royal family was dragged out of Balmoral to retrieve its own image.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let us make no mistake: there are many who are taking secret comfort in the knowledge that the possibility has been removed that a future king of England might have had

         The disgust of Charles Spencer was apparent in his magnificent eulogy for his sister when he referred to her blood relations and observed that she needed no royal title to do her good deeds. We should remember that those comments were directed against the royal family, and especially the Queen, who is his godmother.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The death of Diana Spencer was tragic. She will always be the young, vibrant, sensitive, beautiful and wronged princess. But her loss to her children is no greater than the loss to the children of any other mother who is tragically killed on the road or anywhere else. The great tragedy surrounding the death of Diana Spencer was that this young woman was betrayed by her husband, expelled and isolated by the royal Firm, hounded and exploited by the media and the public, and left without the care or support, or even the concern, of the family into which she had married and from which she had been so unceremoniously banished.

        It should be noted that the above percentage figures do not present an accurate or meaningful summary of the Commonwealth's commitment to addressing substance misuse. The National Drug Strategy does not represent the Commonwealth's total response to the problems of drug and alcohol misuse, nor does it represent the Commonwealth Government's total contribution. The National Drug Strategy did not replace the existing prevention, treatment and law enforcement programming to deal with drug problems. Large amounts of funds outside the National Drug Strategy continue to be spent on the treatment of disease and trauma caused by the misuse of drugs, and for law enforcement efforts to restrict the supply of drugs. These expenditures—which amount to much more than the total National Drug Strategy continue to be spent by governments.

        (1) Australia currently contributes only a small proportion (around 1.4%) to global greenhouse gas emissions. However, the Government regards the threat of global warming as one of significance and is committed to responding in an effective manner. While we have not conducted research specifically into the impacts of our own contribution to global emissions, Australia has actively participated in the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, particularly, its Second Assessment Report, which reported comprehensively in 1996 on global impacts. The Government has also commissioned several greenhouse related studies in the following areas since April 1995:

        (c) Contracts for 1997/98 have the same purpose of funding as the contracts for the previous financial year. However, the Department will shortly begin working with organisations to develop individual outcome based contracts for all organisations (other than seed or interim funded groups). This process will result in the addition of a 1997&amp;hyphen;98 Funding Schedule to each contract which will be more specific about outcomes to be achieved by the organisations.

        (2) During 1997&amp;hyphen;98, AusAID would expect to recruit in the order of 20 staff. This estimate does not include the recruitment of Graduate Administrative Assistants. Austrade's budgeted staffing for 1997&amp;hyphen;98 is 1027, and its current staffing is 1007 (including overseas engaged employees) hence there is limited scope for any tangible recruitment intake, other than to cover normal staff turnover.

        In April 1997 the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade established a task force to examine Departmental structures and resources, including future staffing needs. The recommendations of the Task Force indicate that there is likely to be very limited recruitment into DFAT through the 1997&amp;hyphen;98 financial year. On current planning it is likely to be limited to between 20 and 30 people under the graduate recruitment program, and approx. 12&amp;hyphen;15 officers with specialist skills as a result of ad hoc vacancies. Additional recruitment will depend on the holding of bulk promotion rounds and any recruitment action that results.
