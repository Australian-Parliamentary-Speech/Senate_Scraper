         The purpose of this bill is to amend part 3 of the Migration Act 1958 which provides for the migration agents registration scheme. The bill amends section 333 of the Migration Act which contains a sunset clause. Under this clause, the migration agents registration scheme will terminate on 21 September 1997, after having operated for five years. The amendment will have the effect of terminating the scheme on 21 March 1998.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Members will be aware that the migration agents registration scheme was recently reviewed by a task force within my department. The task force was guided by a reference group headed by Mr Ian Spicer, former
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The review recognised that the migration agents registration scheme had provided a measure of consumer protection and had removed a number of incompetent or unscrupulous operators from the migration advice industry. It was supportive of the industry moving to self-regulation, where its members voluntarily join an industry body and agree to meet the competency and ethical standards set by the body. The body, in turn, sets in place procedures for disciplining members who breach its code of conduct.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In considering the task force's report, the government recognised that the migration industry is disparate and lacks a body with sufficient coverage and infrastructure to take on the task of self-regulation at this time. Consequently, the government has decided to introduce a form of statutory self-regulation as a transitional stage, with an eventual move to full self-regulation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Under statutory self-regulation, regulatory power is delegated to an industry body and, subject to an agreement between the body and me, the body takes on the administration and enforcement of regulation. The Migration Institute of Australia is prepared to take on the role of industry regulator and is aware of the parameters under which such an agreement would operate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In addition to improving competency standards and providing an enhanced consumer protection focus through a complaints resolution process, the industry body will also be able to impose disciplinary sanctions against agents who behave in an unethical or grossly unprofessional manner.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The proposed six months extension of the existing scheme to 21 March 1998 will enable the government to develop and introduce legislation shortly for this transitional period of statutory self-regulation for the migration advice industry. It will also allow the Migration Institute of Australia time to establish the infrastructure to take on this new self- regulation role. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.

         The bill contains no new policy but overcomes technical deficiencies in the way Commonwealth and state family law legislation and rules of court have applied in Western Australia. Western Australia is the only state to have its own family court. The bill is designed to complement Western Australian legislation addressing these deficiencies from within the legislative capabilities of that state.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill will create family law rights and liabilities for the many people who may be affected by a recent decision of the Full Court of the Family Court of Australia in the matter of Horne v. Horne, 13 February 1997, Appeal No. WA 13 of 1996. In that case, the Full Family Court held that the family law rule that purportedly allowed registrars of the Family Court of Western Australia to exercise the power to make consent orders was invalid. As a result, many consent orders made by registrars in Western Australia are ineffective.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill will overcome this problem by ensuring that all affected people in Western Australia obtain enforceable, statutory family law rights and liabilities that mirror the rights and liabilities that would have been created by valid registrars' orders. The approach taken in the bill is based on a similar one approved by the High Court in R v. Humby ex parte Rooney (1973) 129 CLR 231, and subsequently in cases such as Polyukhovic v. the Commonwealth (1991) 172 CLR 500. This approach does not attempt to validate the purported orders made by registrars. Instead, it creates new statutory rights and liabilities

          I spoke about how the Townsville Suns in the basketball are in fact third in the national league at the moment, which is a very creditable effort. I spoke about how they have established a professional sports record with 58 consecutive sell&amp;hyphen;out home games of 4,500 people in the Furnace, which is in the Townsville Entertainment Centre. I alerted the parliament to the fact that, because we are filling these 4,500 places, we are going to extend that Entertainment Centre to 6,000 places—which is a great result for Australia's largest tropical city.

We also have the Operational Deployment Unit, which is the unit that responds, within a set period of time, in the case of a national emergency. There is an awful lot of money going into that particular sector of the Townsville economy—millions and millions of dollars in terms of 10 Terminal Regiment, 5 Aviation Regiment, the Townsville Field Training Area and the new, modern, high frequency communications system which is based in Townsville.

Milne Bay Air has established flights into New Guinea, which I certainly trust will be a great success.

          Stemming directly from the government's financial responsibility, home buyers and small businesses in Townsville and throughout Australia are now beginning to see some real benefits. Interest rates have fallen 3.55 per cent since the coalition was elected. That is starting to filter through to my electorate. The real estate industry tells me that they are looking forward to a very good year. Home buyers can now access home loan rates as low as 6.99 per cent, meaning that home buyers in Townsville and Thuringowa can make interest savings of $292 per month—and that is after tax. It is the equivalent of a $100&amp;hyphen;a&amp;hyphen;week wage rise.

          For small businesses, after years of rising taxes, it has taken a Howard coalition government to start turning that around. Provisional tax has been cut; fringe benefits tax has been cut and, on 1 July, capital gains tax will be cut, representing a significant easing of the burden on small business. The coalition certainly has paved the way for strong and consistent growth and, in time, Townsville—and indeed all of Australia—will benefit.

They generally wind up on the unemployment scrap heap. They may wind up in our penal institutions; they may wind up with drug and alcohol dependency problems.

That is precisely what it was designed to do. It will recompense every Australian, regardless of their income level, some amount for their savings, but those who receive the greatest benefit are those on low and moderate incomes.

I do not have records going back beyond that. I think the accounting system changed around 1950 anyway. Unfortunately, the budget papers that this government produces stop at 1984-85.

Most of the countries in Europe have a much worse budgetary and debt situation than does Australia.

Gross domestic product—that is, how much the national cake will grow by, how much more wealth we will generate in this country, the growth of the things we make—in the last year we were in office grew by 4.1 per cent. Last year, the first year of the Liberal government, that fell to 3.25 per cent on the budget's own estimate. A year ago when the last budget was introduced the government and the Treasurer said that they would get growth going along at 3&amp;half; per cent. That is, their aim was to have slower growth.

         We had it running at 4.1 per cent just two years ago. Last year their ambition was to slow the economy down to 3.5 per cent because they were not capable of maintaining the growth. Growth is critical if you want to maintain jobs, particularly with an increased participation rate with more Australians wanting work. Last year they set out not to make the economy grow faster than it did in our last year in office, not even to make it grow as fast as we did, but to slow it down to 3.5 per cent, and they could not even do that. Their own budget now shows it running at 3.25 per cent. It went from 4.1 per cent under us to 3.25 per cent in the space of a year. They have slowed the economy down. That is why jobs are not available, that is why people are losing job security and that is why the unemployed are finding it hard to get a job.

         So what do they think is going to happen with growth in the economy in the next 12 months? The budget papers predict that they will have a leap from their current abysmal performance of 3.25 per cent and that it will grow half a per cent to 3¾ per cent. They have now set themselves a target of growth which, based on their efforts last year when their ambition was not to make the economy grow but to make it smaller—and they could not even achieve that low ambition—few observers believe they will achieve.

The budget papers demonstrate that unemployment is now expected in this year to average out at 8¾per cent. It has gone up. So what do they say is going to happen in the next 12 months? They predict that unemployment will fall from its current high of 8.75 per cent down to 8.25 per cent. They reckon they are going to take half a per cent off unemployment while the economy grows at less than four per cent. There is no&amp;hyphen;one in the economic community who believes that is possible unless, of course, through other measures, such as removal of child-care support and a whole range of other things, they actually force people out of the marketplace—people who are looking for jobs today and say, `I give up.

Even if all of their predictions come true—and, given that they got them all wrong last year, you do not hold out much hope that they will be right this year—and even if everything they wanted came true, their own estimate, their own target, is that the economy will grow at less than the required four per cent. No&amp;hyphen;one is going to take that seriously. These are the principles that underpin the budget, and the people of Australia, unfortunately, are going to bear the brunt of those false assumptions.

For someone who has got a job but has just seen a third of the work force—their workmates—lose their job through a restructure, redundancy or government downsizing, they do not have the job security to think, `Yes, I'll go out and take a loan and I'll buy a new car or I will go on a holiday.'

People today have no job security because of what this government has done in the last budget where it deliberately set out to reduce gross domestic product.

          I also want to comment on one of the planks that the government heralded with its budget: the savings plan. The savings plan means that, if you happen to have $60,000 in the bank, you can get a $450 tax deduction. When? In the year 1999. Just in time for you to buy your ticket to the Olympic Games, I imagine. But you have to have $60,000 in the bank.

          I do not know about members on the government side, but I do not have too many friends or constituents who have $60,000 in the bank. The average person who has $3,000 in the bank at five per cent will get about $22 a year—about 50c a week. That will make a big difference. That will improve the savings. But the important thing is that this has been done at the cost of superannuation. Ordinary working Australians have lost their best

           chance at retirement funding, which was the superannuation scheme. You have traded that in for this program. What is worse, it has a negative effect on national savings. This will not increase Australia's national savings pool, and the government knows it. The Treasurer knows it. He has evaded questions on it.

         The budget is designed to help families who, heaven knows, after 13 years of Labor need some help. It is aimed at boosting small business, encouraging savings and repaying debt. The budget has been widely accepted and praised in all sections of the community. The reaction has been positive, which is not surprising given the government's economic strategies. With a forecast $1.6 billion surplus in next year's budget, this means a staggering $12 billion turnaround in the Australian economy we inherited from Labor in March 1996.

We can all recall the painful and destructive interest rates spiral of the early 1990s.

Savers will be eligible for up to $450 per annum and there will be a transitional rebate of up to $225 in 1998-99. The coalition government is the first Australian government in history to offer a tax break on savings to give Australians an incentive to save.

          —One of the major shortcomings of the government's budget for 1996-97—that is, the current budget—was the total absence of initiatives that might have encouraged an increase in private savings. In this way, that budget mirrored successive budgets of the former Labor administration. Despite its election promise to the contrary and at the expense of domestic savings, the Howard government continued to shore up the Treasury's coffers in the 1996-97 financial year by increasing existing taxes and introducing new ones under the guise of levies, surcharges and user pays schemes.

         By contrast, this budget incorporates several measures which, for the first time in more than a decade, have the potential to attract meaningful levels of savings back into superannuation and other savings vehicles. Some have argued that the proposed 15 per cent tax rebate on savings is not the most effective means of boosting domestic savings. But the government deserves commendation for engineering a scheme that is generous and easy to administer; that has negligible compliance costs; and which will apply to all taxpayers, regardless of income.

         The broad based savings rebate rewards current savers and should promote a greater level of savings in the future. This measure at last gives something back to the people who voted the coalition into office at the last election but who got next to nothing from the new government in its first budget. It is true that the rebate on savings held in banks will mostly benefit higher income earners. But the application of the rebate to the first $3,000 in personal contributions to superannuation means that lower and middle income households will also gain from this initiative. The rebate will have the dual effect of reducing an individual's tax liability in the immediate term, while encouraging more Australians to become self-reliant in the longer term.

          The government has suggested that this rebate could be used to help finance private health insurance, and so reverse the trend which is seeing a record number of Australians relying on the public health care system. Hypothetically, this makes good sense. But the reality is that the maximum $450 rebate is insufficient to cover the annual cost of most private health insurance premiums, or even recent increases in those premiums. In some cases, increases in the cost of private health insurance will still exceed the combined benefits of the savings rebate and the new private health insurance rebate.

It sees the continuation of a long awaited and much needed budgetary reform process that sets out to restore some balance to the nation's finances.

          In contrast to the budgets of the early 1990s, which bore little or no relationship to Labor Party policy, this budget is consistent with the coalition's election commitments—although by no means comprehensively so.

           By way of further contrast, the Labor Party's approach to fiscal policy was a sham. It refused to acknowledge the need for a broadening of the tax base, and continued to lean hard on personal and business income tax for revenue. In its relentless pursuit of revenue, the previous government did not only introduce new taxation measures, such as the fringe benefits and capital gains taxes; it expanded the scope and rates of the wholesale sales tax as well.

            The 1997&amp;hyphen;98 budget is premised on a more responsible fiscal platform, one that recognises that a reduction in the deficit must occur through the control of public expenditure and the encouragement of domestic savings, and not through increased taxes. But, while unemployment levels may be contained in the short term as a result of the government's decision not to increase the levels of income  tax, it is no substitute for a sensible and thorough reform of our taxation system.

            The decision to reward workers who defer their pensions for up to five years should impact positively on aggregate savings and in a small way improve our balance of payments score sheet. The maximum tax&amp;hyphen;free lump sum of $21,251 for a single person and $35,450 for a couple is the equivalent of 47 per cent of the pension entitlement over a five&amp;hyphen;year period. This initiative will cost the Australian taxpayer half of what it would cost to fund a full pension over the same period—a pretty substantial saving.

            More than 80 per cent of people over retirement age currently rely on aged or service pensions as their principal source of income, and any easing of that funding burden should be welcomed. It will also mean an increase in compulsory personal superannuation contributions for each additional year of employment. Given that the participation of older men in the work force is undergoing a long&amp;hyphen;term decline in Australia, the importance of initiatives such as this one should not be underplayed.

            To those who argue that this initiative will encourage older Australians to remain active in the paid work force at the expense of employment for younger Australians, a recent publication from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Western Australia, the CCIWA, on the factors affecting youth employment give that supposition some perspective. The CCIWA makes it clear that conversations about youth unemployment figures are often based on misinformation. It shows that not only have the number and percentage of young people looking for full&amp;hyphen;time work in 1996 decreased from 1981, but that 40 per cent of all 15&amp;hyphen; to 19&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds who were unemployed in August 1996 were in full&amp;hyphen;time education and looking for part&amp;hyphen;time work.

            The only solution to the perennial curse of unemployment is to improve national savings, reduce the budget deficit and foster business growth and investment while keeping inflation in check.

            The government has indicated that it favours stronger economic growth to improve employment opportunities rather than policies specifically geared towards resolving the unemployment problem.

            It may be that a growth rate of less than four per cent  will prevent unemployment levels from worsening, and it does seem unlikely that economic growth will do much more than preserve the status quo in the  foreseeable future.

            But while industry might breathe a sigh of relief that assistance programs have not been further slashed, there is little in this budget that will directly promote a greater level of business investment. Take, for example, the infrastructure borrowing scheme. While the scheme has been maintained by the government, at least for the 1997-98 financial year, its eligibility criteria are now so narrow that less than 10 per cent of the projects currently in the pipeline would now qualify for the tax concessions.

         I would like to take the opportunity to provide honourable members with evidence of economic growth and job opportunities within the Northern Territory. Firstly, the Northern Territory's economy continues to grow at a fast rate and is expected to continue to go even higher. The Hon. Mike Reed, Treasurer of the Northern Territory, states that the economic growth rate will be sustained at around five per cent per annum over the next few years. I am proud to say that this rate of growth in the Northern Territory is a testament to the responsible government of the Country&amp;hyphen;Liberal Party over the last 23 years. The sensible fiscal management of the territory has meant that the territory is now enjoying a rate of growth significantly higher than that of the national forecast of around 3.7 per cent.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I am in no doubt that the territory's economic growth rate has been sustained by the flow&amp;hyphen;on effect from the economic and fiscal policies of both the federal and the territory governments. In this context, and in terms of the territory government's specific budget
         <break page="4226" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          policies, it is important to note that the private sector is a major contributor to the territory's economic growth. Private capital expenditure over the past few years has increased dramatically and is expected to continue to do so. As a consequence of business confidence, the territory's unemployment rate of 5.5 per cent is the lowest in Australia. This is more than three percentage points lower than the national average. It is evident to most of us that the private sector orientated policies do provide jobs. It follows that our policies have resulted in the territory's higher than average participation rate for its labour force. In particular,  employment growth has been, and continues to be, positively influenced by the continuing expansion in tourism and an impressive growth in the mining and transportation industries, plus sustained growth in the rural sector with particular emphasis on the live cattle export trade to South&amp;hyphen;East Asia.

It is likely that the existing bridge will be replaced by a high level crossing which would improve the flood immunity of the Stuart Highway and therefore allow easy road access to Darwin in the event of a cyclone or other flooding emergency. This bridge is expected to cost in the vicinity of $2.5 million. The overall strengthening of the infrastructure capacity of the territory and the importance of these and other territory roadworks to our industries generally is reaffirmed by this budget.

You yourself know that, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, because of the broken promise in your own electorate of Bendigo with respect to the issue of job creation and the promise given by the Prime Minister to construct that all important art gallery—the big black hole in View Street, Bendigo.

The government said to the Australian electorate that it was going to go out of its way to create jobs, jobs and more jobs and, in doing so, lock into Australia a sense of job security.

Australians are now starting to understand that those public servants are not employed in Canberra; they are actually employed in their local suburbs, in their towns and in their local regional centres. Those people were employed in such important work as providing essential services to Australians—the local Medicare office; the local CES office; the regional Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs branches; the local family law court in Tasmania; and the local branch of the Australian Taxation Office in Cairns.

         It is interesting to note that, in the first year of the Howard government, youth unemployment has not decreased; in actual fact it has jumped—not by half a per cent but by two per cent, from 27.4 per cent to 29.4 per cent. It is not just the figures we look at. What does that mean in human terms? It effectively  means that, after one year of the Howard government, 91,600 young people are on the jobs queue. But that is just the young people. In actual fact, officially registered, there are 802,000 Australians of all ages who are now regarded as unemployed and 246,400 of them are classified as long-term unemployed.

The facts show that today, for example, that there are 146,000 unemployed 35&amp;hyphen; to 54&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old men.

That represents the first ever serious and sustainable attack on public debt by federal government, which has inherited a legacy of endemic overspending, endless deficits and rising debt.

            In 1992, the Kennett government came to power in Victoria with a sweeping mandate for fiscal repair. It cut government spending, reduced the public sector and engaged in an ambitious privatisation program. The combined effect of these actions has been to halve Victoria's state debt, to run consistent sustainable budget surpluses and to move steadily towards restoring Victoria's AAA credit rating. More importantly, the Kennett government received an electoral dividend, being overwhelmingly re&amp;hyphen;elected in 1996 with a renewed mandate for sound financial management.

         There are two strains of political philosophy within the coalition. We have just heard one from the Son of Newt—the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur)—quoting Newt Gingrich from the United States. This is the economic libertarian strain within the coalition, which holds out the answer to insecurity as individualism: the idea that individuals alone can somehow manage to combat economic and social insecurity. The truth is that the widespread insecurity in our society can be met only through collective remedies—by people working together, by finding in the public sector an expression of their values and interests held in common. So the economic libertarian strain, whether in the United States or in Australia, has had its day. It is a failed political ideology from the 1980s.

         The other strain within the coalition is the sort of conservative populism we get from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)—very much the politics of nostalgia.

Where now are all the reforms and ideas he hoped to place on the agenda from the 1980s? He has backed away from his reputation in Australian politics as an active reformer with a cogent set of ideas and answers for the Australian people. His brilliant career as a policy reformer has been cut short yet again, by the outbreak of electoral success and actually holding office.

It was left to Labor to bring Australia out of its slumber in the 1950s and 1960s. Again, we find in the 1990s the Prime Minister has no answers to the main challenges we now face as a nation—that is, the challenges of widespread economic insecurity.

         There it is from the man appointed by the government, one of the acquaintances of the Prime Minister no less—someone chosen by the government to conduct the main review into higher education in Australia. What was his analysis of primitive Vanstonism in the university sector? Further cuts equal a further decline in quality. All this posturing we have seen in recent times from Senator Vanstone and in this House by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Dr Kemp, about the state of the university sector is nothing but bunkum and an attempt to mislead the Australian people about the true impact of their cuts to universities.

         The figures that have been cited by the minister and by her junior minister show that they are very much in a state of delusion and denial about the impact of their policies on the university sector.

         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          per cent. Enrolments in second, third and fourth year courses are taking place as a product of fear. The fear of students dropping out of university in 1997 and being affected by the changes to HECS has made them stay on in much greater numbers through the university changeover from years one to two, two to three and three to four than would normally be the case.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Even that increase in commencing first year courses of one per cent reflects the fear struck throughout the university sector of these policy changes. Universities always over enrol as a matter of course. This year the university sector has over enrolled more vigorously than ever out of fear of the potential impact of the HECS changes turning students away and out of fear of future funding cuts most of which, the $400 million cut, impact in 1997.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The government is in a state of denial and delusion by arguing that on these preliminary enrolment figures all is rosy in the university garden. The truth is that students are fearful of the changes. That is why the retention rate through years two to four at universities has been so high in 1997. They are so scared of dropping out for fear of then facing the Vanstone HECS system if they were to subsequently resume their university studies. The institutions are fearful of these changes. They are more vigorously over enrolling, compensating for Vanstonism, to the point where there has been a very small increase in first&amp;hyphen;year enrolments.

         The minister has made use of these figures, as has her junior, who is now in the chamber. Amanda Vanstone had this to say last week at the University of New England and also earlier in the month of May, `Higher education is thriving.' Try telling that to Roderick West, who she has appointed to investigate the university sector. He has been to every single Australian university to examine the impact of her cuts. He does not say that the university sector is thriving. He says that the university sector is essentially in crisis—losing courses, losing campuses, losing opportunities, losing students' places, losing academics. Right across the sector there has been a simple equation that this government needs

         After the failure of Fightback in 1993 to establish its credentials with the Australian people, we now have the Fightback policy by stealth—Fightback through the back door, these swingeing funding cuts which, according to Roderick West, will lead to the privatisation of the Australian university sector.

So Roderick West has let the cat out of the bag. The smelly cat that Dr Kemp set running in 1993 in Fightback is back out of the bag.

Amanda Vanstone arguing that less is more is almost Orwellian—that $800 million of cuts in education somehow produces more places. It is straight out of an Orwellian novel—less is more.

          It is not only the fact that the government has a lack of direction in university policy and that it sees university funding as a narrow cost on the government budget instead of a sound investment; it is the fact that the policies are not only wrong but also backward looking without a philosophy of education or any clear public purpose for where universities in Australia should head. This reflects a broader problem for the government. It had a big intellectual investment in Fightback but then only a political strategy for trying to win government—not knowing how to govern according to a mandate for policy change given to it by the Australian people.

          One of the tasks for the Labor Party is to not only point out the policy failings of the government and its regressive impact on a university education but also build a positive alternative. We believe passionately that nothing matters more to the Australian nation than the education of its citizens. Learning and social progress have always gone together, and the power of reason and knowledge exposes people to virtues of rational thought and problem solving. But now, in the new economy, education is much more than a tool of social enlightenment; it is, with the changing nature of work and production, the dividing line between the economic winners and losers in our society.

The quality and equality of our society depend on the success of this transition.

          —Having just listened to the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) deliver this appalling speech, I feel constrained to make a few comments on his continual misrepresentation of the facts and the highly distorted perspective he presented. I suppose that one of the remarkable features of the speech we have just heard from the member for Werriwa, the shadow minister for education and youth affairs, is its very great concentration, first of all, on university policy.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Let me say, for a start, that the government is very proud of its policy for universities and the reforms that have been introduced. Of course, what the shadow minister completely failed to mention was that enrolments in the university system are up this year by some 12,000 students, and the total resourcing of the university system is up very substantially this year. In fact, the universities are estimated to have obtained in the course of the year an additional $250 million through their teaching services alone. So we have, under the government's policies, a more accessible system, with more students in the system and better resourced universities.

        <para first-indent="16">
         As somebody who has come out of the university sector, no-one would be more aware than me of the way in which that sector was run down by the Dawkins policies; it was starved of resources. The amount spent per student fell throughout the Labor years, as the Labor Party squeezed the universities but refused to give them the freedom that they needed to provide places for those Australians who were prepared to invest in their education.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It was the Labor Party that believed `equity in higher education' meant shutting out something between 20,000 and 40,000 qualified Australian students every year, while allowing students from overseas to obtain places in Australian universities. It was the Labor Party's distorted sense of equity that believed in charging university students who were doing the less expensive courses with
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          lower income prospects at the end a much higher proportion of the cost of those courses in HECS charges than they were prepared to charge students going into courses with much higher income prospects.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That strange concept of equity, of course, arises out of the peculiar ideology the Labor Party promotes that, somehow or other, you must not allow people the freedom to invest in their own future, that you must not allow institutions to do something according to their own mission, that they must be tied into a system of bureaucratic central regulation which only leads to the running down of and the reduction of access to the system.

         This government is very proud that it has expanded access to university education and that it has produced better funded universities. I challenge the Labor Party to go to the next election with a policy of reducing the universities' flexibility to raise resources for themselves.

         One of the features, one of the greatest failures, of higher education policy under the Labor Party is that the number of people from low income backgrounds accessing universities remains at around about 15 per cent of the total. Of course, with the fixation on universities that we heard again today in the speech from the member for Werriwa, we see that old Dawkins message coming through again that if you are not going to university you are not going anywhere. The problem is that those going to universities out of school are only 30 per cent of the total students leaving year 12. What about the other 70 per cent of students? What about those young people in the member for Werriwa's own electorate who have chosen another course?

          We know that under the previous government the number of apprenticeships and traineeships, as a proportion of the work force, fell to the lowest level for three decades. We know that there was no effort whatever to make sure that young Australians gained the basic literacy and numeracy skills they needed to get jobs. We know that there was no effort made whatever to make sure that the schools were offering the appropriate vocational courses to the students who were not going on in the academic stream.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In other words, the Labor Party throughout its entire 13 years in office abandoned the great bulk of young Australians and, as we know, condemned so many of them to long&amp;hyphen;term unemployment. So let us not have any of the cant and hypocrisy that we hear and the sorts of remarks that were made by the member for Werriwa as he tells us how much more the government is going to tax and spend on the universities, totally ignoring the fact that, by freeing up the system, the government has expanded places and resources for the university system.

          Let me direct attention to the educational and training interests of the 70 per cent of young Australians who are not going from school into university.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Our vision recognises the importance of a quality, accessible national training system—and, of course, many young Australians are now choosing to go into that training system rather than go to university. The member for Werriwa regrets that because he believes in the old Dawkins' saying that if you are not going to university you are not going anywhere. But the number of places in TAFE this year will be up by 55,000. Not only is the number of university places up but the number of places in TAFE is up by 55,000 this year.

          The government has embarked upon a major process of reform to vocational education and training to develop a new system that will generate confidence in business and individuals.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This system will be built on an ongoing partnership between the training system and industry, under industry leadership. Of course, that is another dramatic difference between this government and the former government, because the former government believed that, after all, training was in the hands of the suppliers and that businesses should not be allowed to choose who was going to offer the off&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;job training to their apprentices; they should be denied that choice. This government, under its training reforms, is opening up that choice. The former government believed that the more you multiplied paper and regulation on small business the better. It is no wonder they destroyed jobs. Under our arrangements and reforms, 12 different forms

         <para first-indent="16">
          The centrepiece of the government's reforms to vocational education and training is, of course, the new apprenticeship system. The new national apprenticeship system is bringing the concept of quality training, as embodied in the traditional apprenticeship, into new industries in a new and flexible way. New apprenticeships are being developed to expand the number of training opportunities for businesses by moving traineeships and apprenticeships beyond traditional occupations into new industries to take advantage of growth and employment potential. This is going to provide increased opportunities for young people who are looking for a career without going on to university.

          As I informed the House on Monday, a historic agreement was reached last week in Adelaide between the Commonwealth and state ministers to introduce a new national system for apprenticeships and traineeships from 1 January next year. For the first time since Federation, Australia will have one national system of apprentices and trainees operating across all state and territory boundaries. Appropriation Bill (No. 1) includes funding to support the key elements of the new national apprenticeship system.

Let me place a few facts on the record regarding the impact of the budget. These are facts that are already on the public record; they are in the portfolio budget statements.

The decline in apprenticeship numbers during the recession years, induced by the economic mismanagement of the previous government, is one of the most disappointing facts, one of the greatest failures, of that government.

The total number of apprenticeship commencements and recommencements for 1996&amp;hyphen;97 will not be known for some time because of delays in the collection of data. At present, the numbers are tracking at a marginally lower rate than 1995&amp;hyphen;96, but we still expect to have some 47,000 apprenticeship commencements or recommencements in 1996&amp;hyphen;97.

          Some of the significant agreements that underpin the new national system include, firstly, simplified regulatory arrangements which massively cut the red tape and workload for employers. This includes significant rationalisation of the paperwork involved in taking on trainees and apprentices. As I have mentioned, previously employers were required to complete up to 12 forms to take on apprentices and trainees. In the new national system they will have only one form to fill in.

          —Any hopes that Australians have had that the government can reduce unemployment are dashed by those members of this House who espouse their own ignorant views about the causes of unemployment. The member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) stated in her first speech:

However, there are 30,000 more unemployed people in Australia since the Liberals came to government. The Liberal government will not admit that it has failed them—it boasts that it has kept their faith. The member for Oxley is providing false answers to the questions the Liberal government refuses to respond to.

         The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) last year acknowledged research results which consistently prove that immigration has a neutral effect on a number of key aspects for economic life, including real wages and inflation, living standards and the balance of payments. This argument was based on the assumption that the balance of immigration under Labor was wrong, that it was too focused on allowing Australian residents to marry people from overseas and to have their families join them in Australia. This argument ignores the documented evidence that family ties are important for the establishment of a strong and cohesive nation and the successful settlement of newly arrived immigrants in Australia.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The Liberal government believes that skilled migrants are more important for Australia because they have lower unemployment rates than family reunion migrants. The government cannot have it both ways, however. It cannot tell us—to justify a reduction in programs—that migrants take jobs and then change the intake quota to improve the capacity of migrants to get jobs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What is worse, this argument places the priority on fundamentally flawed concepts of an economic rationalist migration program which has been proven to be wrong over the last year. If the so&amp;hyphen;called balance that the government has achieved in giving priority to migrants who are skilled is the correct balance, why is it that unemployment is still at 8.75 per cent? The answer, clearly, is that migration has, at worst, a neutral impact on jobs.

          The Liberal government has recanted on its original statements on immigration and has now cut the program, after telling us last year that its program was a better balance which would reduce unemployment in Australia without reducing the number of migrants who arrive in Australia.

          The current immigration cuts proposed by the government in its 1997&amp;hyphen;98 immigration program represent only 0.03 per cent—or one&amp;hyphen;third of one per cent—of Australia's population. Is such a small cut really worth all of the angst, division and racism which has been beaten up in this country by the anti&amp;hyphen;immigrant campaigners?

          The government does not really even believe its own propaganda, in my view. If it did, why would it adjust its figures by statistical manipulation, counting concessional family entrants as skilled migrants? The truth is that the government knows that immigration does not create unemployment. Its stance on this issue is patently an attempt to convince people who are hurting that it is not the government's fault. The government's approach shifts blame away from itself onto migrants who come to Australia to start a new life.

          Last year the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs also noted that the demand migrants create for goods and services when they arrive in Australia creates at least as many jobs as they occupy. When the government denies migrants access to social security benefits for two years after they arrive in Australia, they are creating a pool of essentially slave labour that will have to work for a pittance under the industrial contract system. Migrant outworkers are a clear example of migrants having to find any work that is available, even at severe risk to their health and safety. The two&amp;hyphen;year waiting period entrenches a society where migrants are seen as a second&amp;hyphen;class labour force. The member for Oxley says she is about equality but really, in my view, she is about cutting support for the most disadvantaged.

           The Liberals argue that they have maintained the exemptions to the waiting period which the Labor government established when it was in office. This is blatantly untrue. Spouse migrants make up nearly 40 per cent under the 1997&amp;hyphen;98 migration program. Under Labor, this group of migrants were never required to serve a waiting period before they could access social security benefits, because the Labor government recognised that Australians should be allowed to choose who they marry and that they should not be punished for marrying people from overseas.

          The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has said what we all know to be true—that the member for Oxley's anti-immigration agenda is more accurately described as an anti&amp;hyphen;Asian immigration agenda. The member for Oxley suggests that Australia is subject to an invasion by people in the Asian region, claiming that, by the year 2040, some 53.6 per cent of our population will be Asian. The actual projections, based on current migration and growth patterns over the next 30 years, show that the Asian&amp;hyphen;born population of Australia will be around 7.5 per cent—nowhere near 53.6 per cent.

          The member for Oxley has been telling Australia that she is running the government's immigration program. And who could really reasonably disagree? We have a Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs who, under the Liberal government, was removed from cabinet—the government's key decision making body—and it appears that the member for Oxley's incoherent and discredited statements are now guiding policy on multicultural affairs and the immigration program in this country. What sort of new life can migrants make for themselves in the current environment? The race debate in Australia is damaging the very social fabric of our society. It rips away social cohesion and reflects the petty prejudice of those who feel that society owes them more than those who are systematically disadvantaged by racism and discrimination.

          It has been estimated that, without a serious effort on the part of both the government and the private sector, and without the injection of funds to make this effort possible, unemployment amongst indigenous Australia will reach 47 per cent by the year 2006—more than five times the current national unemployment rate.

          I would like to turn briefly to part of my own electorate. The government is beginning to move some of its focus onto health and education for Aboriginal people. However, the Prime Minister is still talking about models of dependency rather than empowerment. The only effective model for real community development is the model that empowers Aboriginal people, and the model that Aboriginal people have adopted themselves has been that of land rights.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Booderee, formerly known as Jervis Bay, in my electorate is an excellent example of how an Aboriginal community has begun to be empowered by the partial realisation of their land right claims under the former Labor government, how they can work to effectively develop themselves. The model used by the community in Booderee has established a community which is beginning to regenerate itself. Houses are being constructed to replace the tin sheds which had no access to sewerage, water or power and that have been there since the thirties and the forties in some cases. This process is not complete, but it has been embarked upon. The community still needs help, but the recognition of land rights has increased the dignity and the capacity of the community to regenerate itself.

          Clearly, this is a superior model than waiting for an ever diminishing socialised wealth which has been progressively cut by the current government. The empowerment model is a model which has been embraced by the Aboriginal community at Booderee. It depends on the land rights that they have been able to assert over the area. Land rights are a feasible vehicle for empowerment over dependency, which is why the Labor Party

          The budget goes against all of the values espoused by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. In his article, the minister recently debunked some of the myths that have been generated about migrants and their contribution to this country.

What has changed in seven months?

          These cuts have targeted the legal processes of the commission—the protection the commission provides to people who are victims of racial vilification and racial discrimination. The minister criticised recent racist statements as, at best, misconceived or ill&amp;hyphen;informed and, at worst, damaging to Australia's interests. Language training is one of the greatest tools for engendering a sense of cross-cultural understanding.

          In the last budget, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs announced a $5 million anti-racism campaign and promised to review progress and consider further action in this year's budget to `build up on the momentum created in the 1996-97 budget'. Those were his words. Not only has there been no momentum to `build up on'; there has been no campaign, no extra money to get the campaign up and running this year, and half a million of the original $5 million essentially was lost by a sleight of hand.

          That campaign is essential, particularly at the moment, to ensure that all of Australia appreciates the commitment and contribution that the entire society makes.

It needs to encourage Australians to engage in a multicultural society by learning

          There is widespread agreement that Australia must meet its international obligations to humanitarian entrants and refugees.

Why has the government cut nearly $3 million from the asylum seeker assistance scheme and foreshadowed a further cut of $6 million in forward estimates? Is the government's widely discredited economic rationalist agenda more important than our undertakings under international law, national law and common human decency?

          In the same way that human development self&amp;hyphen;empowerment models have contributed to a small but growing independence of the Aboriginal community in my electorate, these models can and should be used—and have been in the past—to assist migrants in settlement. The Liberal government came to power last year with a commitment to a settlement program which would flourish with further grants to community workers who assist migrants to make the transition to a new life in this country. The commitment was backed up by a promise to provide $20 million directly to the community over four years. Why then has this government ripped $1.4 million out of the community sector which provides settlement services directly to migrants? This equals approximately 40 community workers. That is 40 communities which will not have access to the same rights as others.

Like many of the cuts this government has introduced across the board, the cuts are not planned in any logical manner to support the rhetoric it mouths as policy.

It is important that the government is aware that, despite the respect within the Hughes electorate for the strength of our commitment to and record of responsible economic management, there is also a great sense of betrayal felt by the people of my electorate in that my constituents feel a tremendous threat to their families, to their homes and to their local neighbourhood communities at the prospect of an international airport almost within their backyards.

         The United States military uses the term `collateral damage' to mask any unavoidable negative impacts when some more `affordable' objective is deemed to be necessary. The affordable objective in this case is the consideration of the option of locating Sydney's second international airport within the Holsworthy defence area. In this case, unavoidable negative impacts include serious levels of atmospheric and surface pollution, amongst other things. A Boeing 747 does not simply waft into the air in a manner similar to hot air balloons. To get an aircraft weighting just short of 400 tonnes up to minimum flying speed of 300 kilometres per hour takes some effort.

         One of my constituents is a Qantas 747 pilot who holds a degree in applied science. He informs me that, in order to complete a single take&amp;hyphen;off, these massive jets expel more exhaust into the atmosphere than two million suburban lawnmowers, each running for 20 minutes. Figures from the Department of Transport and Regional Development air traffic forecasts for Sydney dated February 1997 predict the number of aircraft movements in Sydney to rise from 270,000 in 1996 to over 565,000 in the first quarter of the next century.

         My constituent also informs me that, if the airport is centred at Holsworthy, the direct consequence of these movements will eventually be that around 594,000 litres of jet exhaust fumes, soot, combustion residues and raw, vented jet fuel will fall directly over the Woronora Dam and catchment area every year. And this figure will rise as operations increase. The bulk of these emissions will include minute particles of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxides, water vapour and a lethal mix of organic compounds. From the nitrous oxides we can expect various forms of nitrates such as nitric acid—otherwise known as acid rain.

          —Despite its seeming innocuousness, the second Howard-Costello budget actually compounds the assault on decent social standards that they began in the first. It is another step toward producing a society characterised by private opulence for the few and public squalor for the many. It is built on the same dubious assumptions and mindless ideology and accelerates the destruction of consensus and generosity as the basis of public policy.

         This budget demonstrates yet again—if we needed convincing—that the Howard government has uncritically embraced the ideology which insists on the necessity and rectitude of reducing government expenditure and of removing government from key areas of policy. This at a time, interestingly, when there are clear signs that the orthodoxies of economic rationalism and market based resource allocation are being challenged, often by those who were their most enthusiastic proponents to begin with.

         Familiar too in the assumptions shaping this budget is the pressure to reduce government involvement in policies affecting the quality of people's lives and to replace joint government action with individual decisions made in the marketplace, allegedly allowing the market to better allocate resources throughout the community. Accompanying these cuts here, as elsewhere where it has occurred around the world, is the crude rhetoric of `getting government off the people's backs'.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This rhetoric is predictably associated with mantras extolling the virtues of private sector efficiency and greater competition as the justification for cutting government expenditure, for selling public assets and for contracting out services, with the resulting loss of control over both the quality and the cost of those services apparently to be ignored. However, a recent analysis by Hodge of 245 studies of the effects of contracting out amongst some 20,000 enterprises found that, in reality, in areas such as policing, health and environmental management, changes in performance `were not significantly different to zero'.

         One of the results of this government's obsession with smaller government is a substantial reduction in the size of the Public Service and, of course, a corresponding reduction in the expertise that is available for public policy and for service delivery. Recent insulting observations about the level of expertise in the service by Max Moore-Wilton highlight the inevitable consequences of his and the government's favoured strategies of `contracting out, downsizing, outplacement and right sizing'. All of these insidious concepts, many now repudiated by their originators, are basically code for removing people from jobs that they previously held and either replacing them with contract workers or requiring fewer people to do the

         A common associate of many of these free&amp;hyphen;market nostrums that we are hearing from the government is that labour markets should be made more flexible—where have we heard that before?—for which read: it should be easier to sack people and pay them lower wages. Indeed, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) recently indicated that greater flexibility could mean lower wages for some—it has taken a long time to get that concession from him. The new Reserve Bank Governor was apparently unashamed, however, to recommend greater labour market flexibility while recognising very clearly that this contributed to greater inequality in Australian society.

         This same outcome was also recognised by the Confederation of Industry which suggested the effect could be ameliorated by further taxpayer funded payments to the working poor—this while simultaneously recommending huge cuts in public service expenditure, except apparently when it benefits business. If the government's savings initiative introduced in this budget and the private health insurance and family tax rebates introduced in the last are indicative of their approach to assisting those on low wages, then it is clear that the real battlers—as opposed to the ones the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) likes to refer to—are unlikely to get much at all. Most are ineligible for the private health insurance rebate since they do not have private health insurance; many would not obtain part B of the family tax rebate since both are likely to be working, at least part time; and the savings benefit is insultingly small to non-existent for those with little saved.

         Underpinning these budget and policy prescriptions is the proposition—and this is very clear—that individual gain and not the collective good should determine which services are paid for from taxes and which from individual incomes.

         Much of the government promotion of smaller government and private provision uses, misleadingly, the rhetoric of choice to disguise that shift away from collective provision. Funds are being removed from government hospitals and schools ostensibly to give people greater choice to purchase these services with their own resources in the private sector. While the notion of greater choice is superficially appealing to a great many people, the possibility of choice, however, rests heavily on the individual's income.

         The inevitable result is a two-tiered system of service provision: one for those who can exercise `choice' because of their wealth—with private health insurance, private education or private aged care—and a second tier which is clearly residual or marginalised, the charity system for the indigent. For working families, this choice is hardly a free one. The massive cuts to child care over two budgets—we have some $820 million removed—and the flow-on increases in the costs of care have swamped any financial benefits that may temporarily result from the much vaunted reduction in home mortgage rates for those buying their own homes. In some child&amp;hyphen;care centres right now weekly fees have risen more than $50 per child, and some parents are either having to abandon work or study altogether or having to `choose' inferior, informal care. This, of course, is no choice at all, but a government enforced reduction in their self-determination and in their standard of living.

These effects, of course, are not being felt uniformly with older established universities, which are typically better endowed, likely to manage the cuts and attract more full fee&amp;hyphen;paying students.

          A very ugly side of this value set is the tendency to blame the victim. Those in society who have fewer resources are to be blamed for any disadvantages they suffer. For example, if you look at the official statements surrounding unemployment, which is one of the most involuntary statuses that we as a society can confer on anyone, it encourages us to think that the unemployed are `ripping off' or `bludging on' the system, to use two much used phrases. The last time the word `dole' was used as an official government description of unemployment benefits—at least until its recent disinterment—was in the early 1980s, when we were encouraged to think that the 10 or 11 per cent who were unemployed were taking the rest of us for a ride.

          Many have observed that the unrestricted operation of the market can produce perverse, not to mention socially damaging results. For instance, when contracting out occurs, the costs of contract development and the monitoring of performance of contractors is often not acknowledged. The result is the development of another tier of government which is not delivering a service or developing a policy, but monitoring those who have been contracted to do the work. What emerges is a very extensive bureaucracy devoted to auditing, managing and evaluating contracts over which effective control has been relinquished.

Those who voice objections to this view of the world are derided as economic pygmies or ignoramuses who are out of touch with right thinking.

          It is fair to say that, wherever these experiments have occurred—for instance, in the UK, New Zealand and the US—growing inequality has been their hallmark. Governments should intervene to reduce and remove inequality. Where governments do not intervene, or where they intervene less effectively than in the past, the result is, and will be, growing inequality. Cuts to government programs and benefits will further widen these gaps.

         On 13 May, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) delivered the second Howard&amp;hyphen;Fischer budget in this parliament. The Treasurer made it very clear that the government had not forgotten the reasons why the people had elected this government. They were concerned about the state of the Australian economy. They were concerned about the debts that had been run up over a number of years. They were concerned about the effects that was having on the Australian people, particularly with high levels of unemployment. They were also concerned about the effects that long&amp;hyphen;term debt would have on this country.

         Long&amp;hyphen;term debt is not just a problem for the generation that we represent in this particular parliament.

         During the election campaign, the state of the budget was debated very actively, especially what the financial position of the country would be, no matter who won the election. It was made very clear by the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), as finance minister, that everything was okay. He said that we would have a balanced budget, that the Keating Labor administration was managing the country very well, and that there was no need to be concerned.

         As we clearly found out with the change of government, and with the first Howard&amp;hyphen;Fischer budget that was presented last year, the accounts were different from what we were told before the election. Instead of having a surplus, as was claimed at one particular stage—and then that was revisited and we were told we would have a small deficit—in reality, the budget came down with a $10.3 billion deficit.

         One can only think that the previous government knew they were not going to be re&amp;hyphen;elected and so went out and spent to try to buy their way back into government. To hell with the consequences; the next administration would have to try to straighten out the

         I think it is to the credit of the Treasurer that he could announce in this year's budget that, while we are still to have a relatively small deficit this year of $3 billion, by the time the term of this government is completed there will be a surplus budget in this country, estimated at this stage at about $1.6 billion. That is really a remarkable turnaround under the circumstances. I think that sets the stage for business and the community to go forward with confidence, knowing full well that we are not going to carry on going down the track of borrowing more and more money overseas.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The fact that this country now has very low interest rates, very low inflation and the budget under control puts us on a very sound footing and enables us to go forward. In fact, the Treasurer made it very clear in this particular budget that, through the sale of assets, $5 billion worth of debt would be repaid. How different that is from some of the asset sales of the previous administration, the proceeds of which were put straight into the current account to be spent in the one year. That is like selling your house and spending the proceeds in one year. It was totally irresponsible—selling off the farm and doing nothing about debt that might be accumulated. That was a totally irresponsible economic situation.

         This government obviously has a different agenda. It is determined to hand over to the future generations of Australia a country that is in good condition and a country that offers some incentives and opportunities. Not only did we show in this particular budget that we had addressed some of the fiscal problems of this country; we also started to show that this government understands some of the things needed to get individuals and the economy moving.

         Whenever you are trying to save, you do not save a lot in the first year, but as you continue to add to that then obviously your income from savings increases.

I think this will be of great benefit to Australia in the long term.

         This measure affects many other areas. There is always a very valid criticism in this country that we are losing too much of the control of our own companies, that overseas people are buying out our companies. The reason overseas interests are buying out Australian companies is that we in this country do not have enough savings and do not have the ability as individuals to invest in our own companies. If you look closely at our near neighbours in the Asian region—Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore—you see that there is a much higher level of investment by those individuals in their own companies because there is a much higher savings level. That is something we must address in this country. This government has certainly taken a very positive step in that direction.

         In an electorate such as Page, on the north coast of New South Wales, anything to do with pensions and superannuants is very important as it is an area with a high percentage of retirees. In this budget the government has honoured the commitment it gave to pensioners during the election campaign—I think the legislation has been introduced to this place—to legislatively guarantee pensioners 25 per cent of male average earnings. Added to that is the fact that we have low inflation and should have—I think there is probably some debate about it—low increases in costs. That is of great benefit to that particular section of the community.

         Harking back to statements by the member for Fremantle, something the Labor Party never seems to be able to come to terms with is that you cannot be a compassionate society and you cannot look after those who are in need in society if you do not look after the income you generate in society. If you do not have anything, you cannot be compassionate. I think that is a very important ideological difference between the coalition parties and the Labor Party.

         Because I am a regional member, I will devote quite a bit of my speech to regional issues. I commend the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), and I dare say the Treasurer and Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey), for the allocation of $800 million for roads in regional Australia, part of the infrastructure that is vitally important to this country in light of the need these days to compete on a so-called level playing field. We need to be able to transport our produce, particularly to the ports but also in reverse, in an efficient way and we need to ensure that country people have access to different areas. In this regard, the federal government is looking more at the national highways, at the roads of national importance, which is a new category, and at an agreement with the New South Wales and Queensland state governments for the Pacific Highway.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The Pacific Highway between Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane is the busiest highway in Australia. It is not a national highway. Some of the road alignment between Brisbane and Sydney is not adequate for a highway of that category. There is no doubt that the commitment given by the federal government in conjunction with New South Wales and Queensland state governments will see a very big improvement in the Pacific Highway. I believe that will be a great advantage to the country and its economy.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The other area that is very important for regional Australia is that of roads of national importance. The one road in my particular electorate that has had some benefit from this scheme is the Summerland Way, which takes off at Grafton and moves through the towns

          of Casino and Kyogle into Queensland. This is a very popular route for heavy transport. It is a substandard road which has a number of problems; for instance, the very fact that it must go up the main streets of the towns of Grafton, Casino and Kyogle. Some of the alignment is impossible for a major highway, which takes a considerable amount of heavy traffic. The $25 million that has been allocated over a five-year period will certainly be of great benefit in this regard.

There is no doubt that this is a road of national importance. I urge the government to acknowledge that and commit funds towards it.

There will be no end to the number of claims that can be made and allegations that can be made that the conduct and practices of an earlier generation, judged at the time to be acceptable by people on both sides of politics in that earlier generation—let that not be forgotten—are now in the light of different attitudes to be regarded differently.

         I can inform the House that the St George Bank yesterday announced that its variable home loan rate would fall from 7.55 per cent to 7.05 per cent. The St George Bank has passed on the full half a per cent interest rate reduction in its standard variable mortgage rate. This reinforces the cuts which were announced by the ANZ Bank yesterday and which proved that, amongst the big four banks, ANZ is certainly the most competitive when it comes to home loans. Yesterday it announced more than the half a per cent reduction; it announced a 0.56 per cent pass&amp;hyphen;on in relation to standard variable rates, taking its standard variable rate down to 6.99 per cent.

          —I thank the member for Hindmarsh for her question and for the interest she has shown in the visit by Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji because this visit, as I reminded the House earlier this week, is the most important visit to Australia by a Chinese leader since 1994. There is no doubt that both our side and the Chinese side believe the visit has been an outstanding success.

        <para first-indent="16">
         This is a visit that has underlined the strength of the bilateral relationship between China and Australia and also the breadth of that relationship. It also illustrates very strongly the government's deep commitment to our own region and the way in which week by week Australia in broad terms, not just at the level of government but across the board, is building those ties with its own region.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This visit particularly strengthened the economic relationship between our two countries. The Chinese side gave a commitment to invest in joint ventures in the direct reduced iron industry, and two memorandums of understanding were signed. They agreed to buy more wool from Australia and to reduce wool tariffs, which is very important to all those members here who represent rural electorates. I think they would be pleased to see the coalition government once more doing something constructive for wool growers. The visit also led to the announcement by China that they would issue a new licence to an Australian law firm to operate in China in the form of the firm Blake Dawson Waldron.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Can I also mention that in the discussions with the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism there was progress made towards Australia being defined as an official tourist destination for Chinese tourists. As the minister would be happy to tell the House, if the opposition were to show an interest in the issue, the potential for tourism from China is
         <break page="4263" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          simply massive. So I was delighted with the progress made in those talks.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Finally, let me say that there were three other issues that came out of the visit. Firstly, both sides confirmed that the human rights dialogue Australia and China are to enter into will begin in August of this year. We are delighted that we have been able to put together this initiative as quickly as it has turned out to be. Secondly, Zhu Rongji made it clear that China would have no objections whatsoever to Australian participation in the Asia-Europe summit meetings. Thirdly, there have been some press reports critical of the Australian alliance with the United States and suggestions that somehow China disapproves of this relationship. I can just say that in response to an article that appeared in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          China Daily
         </emphasis>
         a couple of days ago, Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji said that that article did not reflect the views of China's leadership or the Chinese government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So this was a visit which was truly a very substantial success and which has taken the relationship between Australia and China forward significantly. But, I suppose, above all, this is a very good illustration of the breadth and depth of Australia's engagement with Asia.

It will introduce strong protections for residents and it will create incentives for providers to invest in and to maintain the buildings and the stock. It will ensure that access to quality care is based on the needs of the people in the community, not on their means, as those people would go out and have people believe.

As honourable members would probably be aware, at the time of the budget it was announced that the government would outsource its information technology on a whole of government basis. This sets the scene for a significant opportunity for small and medium enterprises and it will also save the Commonwealth some $1 billion over the next seven years. The initiative is designed to improve the delivery of service, to reduce the duplication of management and to standardise and consolidate information technology across Australia. The initiative will be undertaken through multiple competitive tendering processes over the next two years.

         It is important to note that part of the criteria for the outsourcers will be to demonstrate a commitment to providing employment in regional Australia and a capacity to partner with local small and medium information technology companies. Already regional Australia is embracing this concept. I have

A group of some 16 small to medium enterprises have formed a partnership in the Australian Capital Territory under the name of Outsourcing Information Technology Pty Ltd and they are going to be ready for the opportunities that will be provided. The multinational EDS has formed a consortium with a small business here in Canberra, a company called Select Computer Technology, also to respond to the opportunities that are there. So this means opportunities for jobs in regional Australia.

         To address the second part of the honourable member's question, relating to privacy, I should state firstly that the property remains with the government. The property in the hands of the contractors remains the property of the government. The contracts will provide very stringent obligations to ensure that privacy is protected. But, perhaps even more importantly, the government has made it abundantly clear that it will extend the Privacy Act to cover the contractors, to cover the outsourcers.

         A second concern was that the data processing might occur offshore. I can indicate quite clearly that, following further examination of that particular matter, the tender documents will contain provisions that all data processing occurs in Australia. I should add that this outsourcing of information technology was the policy of the Labor Party. To outsource information technology was in the industry statement that was made by the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and in a document released in 1995 by the now Leader of the Opposition

Despite all the scare that the Labor Party have tried to whip up on the question of privacy, supported by their friends in the CPSU, was there any breach of privacy in that five years? There was one. It seems that the Labor Party arranged—and this was told by Senator Faulkner in the Senate last year some time—to let go of the names and addresses of all the veterans in Brisbane so that the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Alderman Soorley, could have a Christmas card list of some size.

          Sexual offences against the person

         which was developed for public consultation by the representatives of the New South Wales government on the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee. All states and territories, as well as the Commonwealth, are represented on that committee. It is important to note at the outset that the contents of the discussion paper do not represent the views of this government or any of the governments, or even any of the individual Attorneys&amp;hyphen;General.

         The officers committee will, in due course, report to the Standing Committee of Attorneys&amp;hyphen;General, SCAG, which will no doubt take into account community views expressed on the issues in question. It is also important to bear in mind that, under the federal system, primary responsibility for the offences dealt with in the discussion paper rests with the states and territories, and the governments ultimately will deal with the matters.

         In the letter, the Australian Christian Coalition is disseminating extremely misleading information about the proposals in the discussion paper. Several of the recommendations attributed to the officers committee are quite outrageous. The allegation referred to by the honourable member is an example. One of the claims made by the Australian Christian Coalition is that the discussion paper proposes that it be lawful for adults to engage in sexual activity with children. This is absolutely untrue. Under the draft legislation proposed in the discussion paper, it would be illegal for an adult to have sex with a child under 16,
         <break page="4269" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          regardless of whether the child consented or not.If an adult has sex with a child—and even if the adult genuinely believes that the child is consenting—that adult would be guilty, under the proposals, of a serious offence and subject to severe penalties.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         While public comments on the actual proposals are welcome, the circulation of misinformation does not assist the committee in formulating final recommendations. The interests of Australian children and the protection of important family values are not served by grossly misleading material that deceives rather than informs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am aware that some of the committee's recommendations which deal with quite sensitive issues have given rise to legitimate community concerns. As the Prime Minister indicated earlier this year, this government will only support proposals for change which reflect and take full account of the values of the broader Australian community.

As he said, in late February this year the Oombulgurri community suffered extensive flood damage, which resulted in the evacuation of all 375 people to Wyndham. I was asked for help in March by the Western Australian Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Originally this was to be an emergency fix to the barge landing site to get people back from Wyndham. I am pleased to say that it was able to be included eventually in one of the six pilot sites for the ATSIC army community assistance project announced later by Minister Herron.

         Fifty&amp;hyphen;five army personnel, mainly from Darwin, went to Oombulgurri on 23 April. All the equipment was brought in by barge. They had graders, a crane, medium and light bulldozers, rollers, water tankers and dump trucks. They installed a new barge landing area in a better location allowing easier access and improved the lighting and refuelling capacity in the town. They levelled and resheeted the airstrip, upgrading it to allow larger aircraft to land, as well as doing ongoing maintenance to the community's 33 houses. That included plumbing and electrical services. For extracurricula activities they reactivated some of the waterlogged vehicles along the way.

I can assure you and members of this House that the army is equally appreciative of the opportunity to be involved.

But also it is a plan that will give to the mining industry and to the pastoral industry of Australia the security and the guarantees to which they are entitled. It will underwrite an increase in investment in Australia and it will deliver the fair balance which, demonstrably, the Labor Party's Native Title Act failed to do.

         Australia is, in fact, one of the world's pioneering democracies and is today one of the great democratic nations of the world. How many Australians, I wonder, realise that this nation was one of the first countries in the world to remove the property requirement from voting; that in Australia women got the vote nationally decades before they obtained it in the United States or Britain; that secret voting in elections is known in the United States as `the Australian ballot'; and that it is this democratic heritage which requires that we cannot have other than policies such as a non-discriminatory immigration policy, and that has made this country such a successful and tolerant society.

         Talking further to Discovering Democracy, the government civics and citizenship initiative I recently launched, I want to make the point that this initiative establishes a very strong historical focus on the history of Australian democracy. The students will study the responsibilities of the different levels of government, how and why the basic freedoms of speech in Australia were established, and the history and role of indigenous Australians. The federal government will be providing some $17&amp;half; million over the next three years to establish the civics curriculum.

I said at the conference that was mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition that we were honouring our promises. I also pointed out that, as the proposal was to award the ASM to people for active service as distinct from non&amp;hyphen;active service, or non&amp;hyphen;warlike service, there was a required change by Her Majesty the Queen to the regulations to allow the ASM to be awarded for active service. I then instigated the process to obtain that concurrence.

         In the course of that, discussion arose as to the question of double medalling, and it was indeed then discovered that those people had been awarded an Imperial Medal at the behest of the Australian government, and therefore it was an Australian medal rendered in respect of that active service given in Korea, in the Malayan emergency and in the Indonesian confrontation. Accordingly, the government made a decision that that would represent
         <break page="4275" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          double medalling and that that would not be done.

         The government gave the reason that it was important to protect the integrity of the medal already given and therefore the decision was made. However, all the other medals as promised regarding the lessening of time for the receipt of the ASM 1939&amp;hyphen;45—down from 180 days to 30 days; the awarding of the ASM 1945&amp;hyphen;75 in respect of the Far East Strategic Reserve, in respect of Papua New Guinea, in respect of BCOF—the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan—and in respect of the Berlin airlift, were all honoured and have been awarded.

         There was some publicity in the press that said that those medals would be affected. In fact, they will not. I repeat: the reason that the government made the decision arose from the process that I had instigated to obtain Her Majesty's concurrence, and it was then that the discussion on double medalling arose and the government took its decision that no double medalling would be made.

         Australia exports around five times as much food as we import. There are some 400,000 people directly employed in producing agricultural product and another 200,000 people in the manufacturing sector in food processing alone. That is the largest single sector in manufacturing in this country. This strategy will undoubtedly bring more investment and more jobs to rural and regional Australia. That is the key message out of this for the bush.

         The government has committed total funding of some $11.8 million to help implement the strategy. There is $2 million per annum, for example, to be used to fund a technical market access program. That will see, amongst other things, two AQIS technical access experts—one in each of Japan and Korea—to vigorously pursue Australia's access concerns in those and other Asian markets. Members will be aware of the broad parameters—some 78 new products now enjoying access to some 35 different countries throughout Asia as a direct result of activities in recent times.

         Then there are working groups, one of which, for example, is the Asian Marketing Working Group.

         For those things that we are responsible for I apologise, as Leader of the Australian Labor Party. This is a terrible, terrible record. This record does not deal with the experience of Aboriginals in good&amp;hyphen;hearted homes with kindly foster parents. There may be some reference to that and the consequences of that, which of course were the consequences which were the least difficult to bear for the Aboriginal people. Many very decent people took up that fostering status, and they did so without maliciousness and with the very best intentions. This report is not really about them. That is the truth of the matter.

         It does refer to them of course in the context of the extent to which those people nevertheless, without knowing it, were implicated in a deculturalisation of a race, with all the loss of identity that flowed from that and the extraordinary difficulties that they confronted.

          I raised a question earlier on: the question of compensation for the situation in which the Aboriginal people of this country found themselves. The question of compensation is a question which governments consider repeatedly. They consider it in relation to people who have committed acts, either whilst in government or in private organisations, without any maliciousness at all. The people who invented particular breast implants procedures, for example, did not invent those with an intention to do malicious harm to women in our community. Yet compensation is expected of them. What about the people who originally planned, for example, situations which saw folk who were not actually orphans, nevertheless declared such, taken out from Britain and settled in Australia, and themselves experiencing some of the things—not all of the things, but some of the things—that the Aboriginal community experienced? There are committees of parliament in other places in this nation which are contemplating the compensation issues related to that. There is no maliciousness there. There may have been abuse experienced in some circumstances, but no maliciousness.

          To take it a point further, there are equivalents elsewhere in the community of acts which are detailed in this which were perpetrated upon members of the European community, if you like. The Catholic Church is struggling with the issue of compensation now to deal with very equivalent acts to that.

The third part of the easy way is to deal with this, possibly, in the way in which the land fund has been dealt with—there is an opportunity not to do the compensation on budget, but to draw down from it from time to time. The fourth part of the easy way is to get a formula in place, as suggested at length in this report, whereby, for various types of problems, people's situations are assessed and dealt with.

         This bill represents the culmination of a process aimed at providing the Australian wool industry with a clear direction for the future. It is the final stage in preparing the industry to stand on its own feet, unencumbered by unnecessary government regulation and direction. It heralds the end of an era in Australian wool, an era that has been marked by significant debate and controversy.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Last year, this parliament passed a bill providing for the final stage in the disposal of the wool stockpile which was created during
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          the last years of the reserve price scheme. The bill I now present establishes the wind&amp;hyphen;up procedures for Wool International, through liquidation, and the distribution of equity to wool tax payers in Wool International.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Above all, this bill represents the success of the consultation process established in the early months of the life of this government which has had the ultimate aim of developing, with industry, a clear future direction for Australian wool, including finalisation of the sale of the wool stockpile, retirement of the associated debt and deregulation of the industry. Furthermore, the government will provide for the distribution to wool tax payers of equity in Wool International, providing wool growers with much needed, and deserved, entitlements to profits from the sale of the wool stockpile and associated assets. The granting of entitlements to wool tax payers will also provide a more secure basis for those wool growers in most need to either sell, or borrow against, their entitlements.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A further, related, development in the wool industry has been the emergence of the proposed wool marketing joint venture, Global Wool. This proposal will only be developed, on a commercial basis, with the concurrence of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the government. I emphasise that the government has no direct role to play in Global Wool. If the venture proceeds, Wool International's only proposed involvement would be by way of establishing the vehicle for wool grower investment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill provides a package of measures which will see wool growers given entitlements in Wool International. As well, it will see the development of a loan facility which will allow growers to better use their entitlements as security for loans; provide for the liquidation of Wool International; enable interim and final payments of Wool International assets to wool tax payers; and offer a mechanism to allow growers to invest their equity return in a growers' investment trust, which might participate in the proposed Global Wool wool marketing joint venture. It will also introduce the corresponding changes to the objects and functions of Wool Interna
         <break page="4284" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
          tional and reduce the size of the Wool International board.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The first and most fundamental of the amendments is that of giving wool tax payers entitlements in Wool International. When Wool International was established in 1993, it was intended to corporatise and then privatise the organisation by 1 July this year. Although the act never provided for this to happen, this government has made a commitment to provide growers who paid the debt component of the wool tax from 1 July 1993 to 30 June 1996, including voluntary contributions, with an entitlement to equity in Wool International.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         All wool tax paid up to 30 June 1996, including voluntary contributions, is to be converted to units. Wool tax payers are to be issued a statement of unit holding on the basis of a unit for every dollar of wool tax paid. Depending on the net assets of Wool International, each unit would then have an implied value which can be used as a basis for trading units.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This will give wool growers not only a right to the equity of Wool International, which has been an intention of the act since 1993, but the ability to trade their units. Similarly, wool tax payers will be able to offer their entitlements in Wool International as additional security when taking out a loan with a financial institution. Wool International will maintain the wool tax register to record changes in ownership in future equity and, in the case of a loan over the units, the register will record the financial institution's interest in the units.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Wool International will issue wool tax payers with a consolidated wool tax record in early June this year. Wool tax payers will be required to respond as to the completeness and correctness of this wool tax record as soon as possible. I cannot overemphasise to wool tax payers—I must stress this—the importance of a prompt response to ensure they gain their correct entitlement to Wool International equity. When finalised, this register will be the basis for entitlements and equity distributions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Further, the legislation will allow Wool International to arrange, through a public
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          tender process, a loan facility with a financial institution for the benefit of wool growers who hold entitlement to equity in Wool International. It is expected that this arrangement will produce more advantageous terms than would otherwise be available to borrowers negotiating individually. In performing this function, Wool International will be required to complete the tender process by 31 December 1997.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Having provided wool tax payers with rights in Wool International, the scene is set to enable the liquidation of Wool International and, in the meantime, to make interim cash payments to wool tax payers of Wool International equity.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The liquidation of Wool International will take place by removing reference to the privatisation of Wool International currently set out in section 3(3) and parts 10 to 12 of the act. Further, it is necessary to provide in the act for the final wind&amp;hyphen;up arrangements of Wool International. These include the provision for leftover funds, treatment of small holdings, the final annual report and ensure provision for the wind&amp;hyphen;up costs of Wool International. It will also provide for a scheme for the distribution of entitlements to the beneficiaries of deceased wool tax payers and insolvent businesses.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Interim and final payments to wool tax payers of equity in Wool International is another major aspect of these amendments. Wool tax payers will receive their interim payment as a cash entitlement. The payout to wool tax payers of funds held under section 51 will not delay the retirement of the debt associated with the stockpile.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The act will provide for wool tax payers to have the option to invest their initial payment, from the first Wool International payout, in a growers investment vehicle—which may subsequently invest in a wool logistics and merchanting venture, commonly referred to as `global wool'. But the act will not involve Wool International other than to facilitate investment in the proposed growers' trust by those growers who elect to do so.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The act will require Wool International to receive my approval to establish the growers' investment trust. Wool International will be
         <break page="4285" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          allowed to support preliminary steps in the establishment of the proposed trust, and will also be able to undertake, in a limited way, feasibility studies and related activities for possible investment targets for the trust, including the global wool joint venture proposal. As I have indicated previously, global wool will not proceed without clearance by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A final distribution will take place after the stockpile has been sold, and will signal the liquidation of Wool International. It is intended that the stockpile funds after sale and disposal of the stockpile will be the last of the Wool International assets available to wool tax payers.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These amendments clearly signal the government's withdrawal from the wool market. Wool International will also be required to reduce its activities to the core functions of disposing of the stockpile and retiring the associated debt. This will result in the phasing out of the subsidiary functions of Wool International and the corresponding reduction in the size of the board.

         The provision of services to the Australian wool industry, the development of a viable international wool futures market and the development of mechanisms for the sale of wool to allow more efficient management of risk, will be phased out as functions of Wool International.

         It is, however, necessary to provide for the winding up of several current Wool International functions not associated with selling the stockpile and retiring the associated debt. These are to ensure that Wool International can continue the education program on forward marketing and a market reporting service on a commercial basis.

          With the functions reduced to only core activities, it is appropriate for the board to be reduced in size. In keeping with the phasing out of subsidiary functions, this is to occur gradually, with the board being reduced from its present number of 11 to five by 1 January 1998 as the workload associated with liquidating the organisation declines. I would take this opportunity to thank the retiring board members for their valuable contributions during their service on the board. The composition of the new board will be announced in due course.

         As I stated at the outset, these amendments signal the beginning of the final stage of government's involvement in the wool industry. It will of course still collect wool tax on behalf of the industry, contribute to R&amp;D and continue negotiations with customers on trade access issues. From this point forward the industry will have a clear view of the future and can plan a new, prosperous and independent environment. I commend the bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum.

         This legislation is one of two bills arising from issues associated with the sale of DASfleet. The other companion bill is the Commonwealth Motor Vehicles (Liability) Amendment Bill. The government announced
         <break page="4286" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          in 1996 its intention to either sell its vehicle fleet business, DASfleet, or refinance the vehicles which DASfleet operates. The government decided to approach the market for bids based on both sale and refinancing to ensure the best possible outcome for the Commonwealth.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This government is committed to public sector reform and has sought to identify functions where direct Commonwealth involvement can no longer be justified. In the case of DASfleet and the other Department of Administrative Services business units currently being offered for sale, the government has identified areas which do, or could, compete directly with private sector suppliers. It has decided to divest itself of these functions, while at the same time ensuring a fair return to the taxpayer for these quality businesses.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The operation of the Commonwealth motor vehicle fleet has historically been undertaken internally and the origins of DASfleet can be traced to the Department of Defence in the early 1920s. At that time, the options available to the Commonwealth for the provision of motor vehicles were limited. Today, however, the provision of motor vehicles and fleet management services is undertaken by a dynamic and competitive industry and the case for maintaining a Commonwealth owned vehicle fleet is no longer compelling.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Commonwealth Vehicles (Registration and Exemption from Taxation) Bill and the Commonwealth Motor Vehicles (Liability) Amendment Bill have been prepared in the context of the government's decision to sell or refinance Dasfleet. The ongoing measures in these bills will, however, apply to vehicles leased to the Commonwealth by any company, not just the purchaser of Dasfleet. In addition, because Dasfleet currently provides only half of the vehicles in the Commonwealth's fleet, the ongoing provisions in the bills will extend to any future sale and lease&amp;hyphen;back of Commonwealth vehicles.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The two pieces of proposed legislation are intended to ensure that registration, taxation and third party insurance arrangements which currently apply to vehicles used by the Commonwealth can continue once those vehicles

         The Commonwealth Vehicles (Registration and Exemption from Taxation) Bill will establish a Commonwealth register of motor vehicles in which vehicles owned by or leased to the Commonwealth may be registered rather than being registered under state or territory law.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The use of Commonwealth number plates allows ease of recognition of Commonwealth government vehicles and has proven to be an effective mechanism for the regulation of their usage. This bill will allow for the continued use of Z and other Commonwealth number plates on vehicles once they are no longer owned by the Commonwealth but are leased for a period of at least three months to the Commonwealth for its use.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill also allows for the making of regulations which will provide for details of how the motor vehicle register will be kept and other matters such as how registration plates and labels should be displayed. Further, I intend that public trading enterprises will be exempt under regulations from the coverage of this bill and its companion bill. This will ensure that the proposed legislation does not impact on the competitive position of Commonwealth business enterprises which operate in the market place.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In addition to establishing the motor vehicle register, the bill contains measures to exempt the transfer of assets, as well as the ongoing provision of vehicles to the Commonwealth, from state and territory taxes.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Under the Commonwealth Vehicles (Registration and Exemption from Taxation) Bill, the transfer of Dasfleet assets, including the motor vehicle fleet, will be exempt from state and territory imposts. This will allow all Australians to benefit from the full proceeds of sale, rather than a proportion of those proceeds being distributed to those states and territories in which the transfer of assets happens to take place.

         The Commonwealth currently operates several thousand vehicles which it registers under state and territory law, most notably vehicles which are provided under the senior

          executive vehicle scheme. While the Commonwealth pays registration fees, by virtue of its constitutional exemption from state and territory taxes, it does not currently pay stamp duty on the registration of such vehicles. The Commonwealth Vehicles (Registration and Exemption from Taxation) Bill will maintain this position by extending the exemption to the private owner of vehicles where those vehicles are leased to the Commonwealth for at least three months.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In addition, where a vehicle is leased to the Commonwealth for a continuous period of three months, these leases will be exempt from state and territory taxes levied on leasing arrangements. The three&amp;hyphen;month period is intended to capture leases which could be considered to be long&amp;hyphen;term leases and exclude the short&amp;hyphen;term rental of vehicles for which the taxation exemption would be overly complex to administer.

         The measures in the bill now before the House are not intended to change the Commonwealth's position with respect to the states and territories. They are merely intended to ensure that the Commonwealth is in the same position with respect to state and territory law and third party liability coverage after the sale of its vehicle fleet as it was before the sale. This bill together with its companion bill will ensure a minimum of disruption to the supply of vehicles to the Commonwealth once these vehicles are privately owned.

          —When I was interrupted prior to question time, I was dealing with the $250 million that had been allocated to telecommunications support for regional Australia, and I had noted that this was very important to that particular area of Australia. As a member of the National Party, I believe that to be absolutely imperative if some of the decline we are seeing in regional and rural Australia is to be reversed.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We all know that, with the policies being adopted by the private and public sectors at the present time, there has been a decline in regional jobs, a decline in regional growth and that many pressures are being placed on small local communities. If they do have the ability to compete with cities with the fibre-

         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         `Decentralisation' is a word that has been bandied around by many governments for many years, and it is very difficult to achieve if you do not have a market or a raw material—a resource. We do have many resources in Australia. However, I believe that those particular areas in many instances are exploited. Also, we do get as much as possible the value adding that can be found in the natural resources of the country.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But in this particular instance where there is an argument being put forward that, in fact, services can be centralised with the technology we have today, I believe that it is a very sound argument that those services can be delivered from regional centres. In fact, with many of the information services, the 1800 lines and even computer services, if these telecommunications are available and can support such a system, then the regional centres, such as the great regional centres of Australia—and particularly that of my north coast area—can deliver such services. History has proven that the type of work force you can get in regional Australia is very dedicated and very loyal and, of course, there is a very good working environment. That all adds to the service that can be provided.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So I think the government is certainly moving in the right direction in this area, and obviously we should be taking advantage of it in regional and rural Australia to see that the pressure is put on government and also the private sector to move some of these services from Sydney and Melbourne. When we consider that half the population of Australia resides in Sydney and Melbourne, then there is plenty of opportunity to have some of those services decentralised and relocated to regional Australia.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Also within the budget I note that there is $48 million for regional forest agreements. This, of course, has been an ongoing process now for a number of years. But in New South Wales it has not yet been resolved, and I have great concern about some of the processes that are being put in place in that state. I come from an area that is, and has been for a number of years, very dependent upon the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          forest industries, and they have been very well managed in that area. But we do see a Labor state government, the Carr government, in New South Wales taking the opportunity with these regional assessments to put in place their agenda of more national parks, more wilderness areas, without any socioeconomic studies as to what effect that might have on small country centres.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Part of the national forest strategy, the national forest policy, when being implemented, was to look very closely at the socioeconomic effects. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has made it very clear that he is committed to that. With some of the proposals that are being put forward being the protection of 15 per cent of forest areas pre-1770, I believe that that type of area must be looked at very closely. There is an agenda in New South Wales being driven by that state's Minister for the Environment, Pam Allen, and it has no regard for those country areas and it has no regard for the effects some of these policies will have upon those rural communities. I think that has to be looked at very, very closely.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I also note that there is a continuation of the regional minerals program, which I happily say I was involved with when I was the minister for minerals in New South Wales. That program is looking very closely at areas like Broken Hill, which is one of the great mining centres of the world, let alone Australia. But the resource is declining in that area , and there is a grave concern for the city of Broken Hill as to whether it can be sustained into the future.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When you take into consideration that the lode at Broken Hill is no more than three kilometres long and about 230 to 240 metres wide at its widest, you can easily see that such a lode—given that it might be underground and not on the surface, such as the lode at Broken Hill—could be easily overlooked. The purpose of these aerial surveys is to locate areas where there might be more mineralisation, hopefully close to an area such as Broken Hill so that that city can be sustained into the future. I commend the continuation of that operation.

          It is impossible in the 20 minutes available to me to go through all of the issues in the budget. I note there has been an increase of $75 million for AQIS. In recent times we have seen the necessity for such a body to oversee and protect the industries that we have in Australia. With fire blight and the debates about the chicken meat industry, the pork industry and the salmon industry—especially under the World Trade Organisation and the agreement—we can see that an organisation such as AQIS has to be efficient and vigilant to ensure that our great industries are protected.

          Other speakers have talked about the work for the dole scheme. This scheme is important in my area, where we have 16 per cent unemployment and 30 per cent youth unemployment—an area that we have to address very clearly. Some $20 million is provided for depressed areas. As I have already said, this clearly outlines that my area is a very depressed one.

          —This is the second coalition government budget. It is structurally rather  different from the one they brought down last year. Last year's budget was characterised by some fairly draconian spending cuts in a variety of areas. The underlying rationale for those cuts was that the government allegedly faced some sort of fiscal crisis when it came to office, characterised by a large black hole in the budget.

          The reality is that, if you compare Australia to other developed countries, our stock of public debt as a proportion of GDP is very much at the low end of the range. Our deficit as a proportion of GDP is likewise very much at the low end of the range. We are in considerably better shape than most of the countries affected by the Maastricht Treaty in Europe. In general, the claim that there was some sort of crisis that required drastic measures to resolve was clearly untrue. A number of decisions taken in last year's budget have had very adverse effects on a great many people and significant adverse effects on Australia's long-term prospects—particularly such things as the cuts to education and training.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          If you aggregate the cuts to higher education, which, contrary to the claims of Senator Vanstone, were very much more than a nick, the cuts to vocational education, which, particularly when combined with decisions taken in this year's budget, exceed the extra money that the government provided for aspects of its new apprenticeship and traineeship scheme, the very substantial cuts to labour market programs which the government is seeking to replace with mickey mouse schemes like work for the dole and the green corps, then there are some major adverse impacts on this country, the effect of which will come to bear as the years go by.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I think many of those decisions will produce some tragic consequences and will severely undermine much of the good work that was achieved by the former government. The rationale for all this was the alleged need to engage in fiscal consolidation in order to increase national savings. The Labor Party have never disputed the need for a fiscal consolidation program. There was an argument about whether it needed to be proceeded with at the rate that the present government believes is appropriate. The long-term need to achieve a better balance between savings and investment in this country is not something that we disputed. Indeed, the former government put in place long-term structural measures designed to improve national savings. The most important of those was the succession of initiatives in the superannuation area.

         <break page="4292" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          <para first-indent="16">
           If you look at the various modelling exercises that were undertaken by the previous government, there is no doubt that over a period of decades those measures would have significantly increased national savings. The outcome of those modelling activities was very clear on that point. Contrary to what the present government claims, these were effective measures to raise national savings through the extension of superannuation.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           As part of an overall long-term strategy to ensure that future governments of this country are in a viable fiscal situation which will enable them to sustain an adequate social safety net and cover all the other various functions of government that governments ought to carry out, we put in place a good framework. For example, if you look at retirement incomes, in the year before last the World Bank brought out a major report on approaches for getting a retirement income structure in place that was capable of dealing with the phenomenon of ageing populations.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The kind of model that we had established was pretty close to what they regarded as the desirable model—that is, one that has the inherent flexibility and capacity to sustain decent retirement incomes over time. It was based on a combination of provisions through private savings and a targeted safety net pension arrangement, and was increasingly supplemented by contributory superannuation. That three&amp;hyphen;tiered retirement income provision was a pretty good way to go. We believe this approach was the right one to get Australia's fiscal circumstances into proper shape for the long term.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           This year's budget of course did not have anything like the same fiscal impact as last year's budget. When you take into account the major savings measure in the budget—that is, the removal of the superannuation co-contribution—and the fact that all that it did was increase the level of public saving at the cost of private dis&amp;hyphen;saving and you factor that into the way you look at the impact of the budget, then its effect on savings is not only negligible but actually adverse when you take into account the tax rebate that was brought in in conjunction with the abolition of the superannuation co-contribution.
          </para>
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           <para first-indent="16">
            I think it is important to stress that fiscal consolidation is not an end in itself. The aim of fiscal consolidation is to raise national savings, and any measure that simply substitutes extra public saving for an equivalent amount of private dis&amp;hyphen;saving really does not contribute to the goal of achieving a better savings investment balance for the country in the long term.
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            When we are talking about investment, of course it is important to bear in mind that investment is more than private business investment; it should include a whole raft of public activities, whether it be in education and training, environmental protection, physical infrastructure and so forth.
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            The budget does nothing to increase national savings. In fact, the tax savings rebate reduces national savings. It costs more than $2 billion in a full year and there is little reason to believe that much of this is going to be saved. If the average household savings rate at the moment of 4&amp;half; per cent continues to apply, less than $100 million of this will be saved, so that private saving will go up by less than $100 million but public saving will fall by over $2 billion, which is a net loss of national savings of $1.95 billion as a result of that.
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            The suggestion that the rebate will bring forth an increase in private savings exceeding this cost is absurd. The rebate is not targeted to people who are increasing savings. You can be running down your savings and still receive the rebate. There is no incentive for further savings by those already eligible for the maximum benefit of the rebate, and the rationale the government puts forward does not take account of the fact that there are a number of motives for savings.
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            In traditional Keynesian analysis, three motives are identified as to why people save. You have precautionary savings, savings for a rainy day. And you have people saving with some target in mind—for example, to buy a house. Likewise, the rebate makes no difference to that sort of motive. In fact, it could reduce private savings by helping people reach their target earlier but not much earlier.
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            For example, a young couple saving $5,000 a year for three years to achieve a $15,000
            <break page="4293" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
             house deposit would receive under this rebate $19 in the first year, $56 in the second year and $94 in the third year—a total of $169 in all. The rebate would help them achieve their savings target all of 12 days earlier. But there is no reason to suppose that this sort of measure will increase the saving being undertaken for that motive.
            </break>
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            It is only for people who engage in what is referred to in Keynesian terms as saving for speculative purposes that the rebate will be an incentive. Again, this is likely to be a relatively small proportion of total household savings. And it is not much of an incentive either—equivalent to 0.75 percentage points on a deposit paying five per cent interest. So if this was going to make much difference to savings behaviour, then presumably you would expect that we would have had very substantial increases in savings at times of high interest rates. Of course, we did not.
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            The rebate is even worse when you set it alongside Labor's superannuation contribution, which it in effect replaces. Every cent of co&amp;hyphen;contribution would have gone into savings and, by association with increased employee superannuation contributions, would have induced a further substantial increase in private savings. So the impact of Labor's measure was unambiguously beneficial for savings.

            In 1999&amp;hyphen;2000, for example, Labor would have spent $2.4 billion in a manner that induced an increase in national savings. The coalition, in contrast, will spend $1.4 billion and reduce national savings by nearly that amount.

            The net economic impact of the budget, once this anti-savings feature of the savings tax rebate is recognised, is a contractionary effect of $352 million in 1997&amp;hyphen;98 and $863 million in 1998&amp;hyphen;99 and an expansionary effect of $403 million in 1999&amp;hyphen;2000. These numbers are derived from the budget papers, pages 1 to 5, and from pages 11 and 162 of Budget Paper No. 2.

            The public debt interest effect of the $3 billion Telstra payment this financial year is another example. At current bond rates this represents a PDI saving of over $200 million a year, but savings by the public trading enterprise sector will be reduced by this amount or more through the increased interest bill on Telstra. The net effect on national savings will be at best zero, at worst negative. That is to say nothing of the reduction in private savings resulting from the transfer of some pharmaceutical expenditure from the Commonwealth to individuals, or of the anti&amp;hyphen;saving effect of some of the government's superannuation measures.

            The other problem with the rebate is its regressivity. The government has tried to argue that the measure is not regressive because it is capped and it is a rebate rather than a deduction. That is to say it could have been worse—it is not a progressive measure, it is just a regressive one that is not as regressive as it potentially could be.

            The other argument of the government is that low income earners, such as self&amp;hyphen;funded retirees, will benefit. That is, it is regressive in life cycle terms; only people who have had the capacity in the past to build up savings will benefit, and that is demonstrated by the fact that not one cent of the rebate will go to maximum rate pensioners.
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            Obviously, there is a correlation between the capacity to save and income, particularly over the course of an individual's life. Equally obviously, the rebate reinforces this distributive pattern; to suggest otherwise is disingenuous, and to defend it on the basis that it could have been worse is absurd.

             The final issue relates to the morality of applying a higher rate of tax to earned income than to unearned income. The opposition has indicated that it will seek to inject some equity back into the budget, particularly through income testing the savings tax rebate. This means that the opposition is prepared to do some of the work to increase national savings which the government has shirked in this budget.

             Firstly, the government claims that it has legislated and made provision in this budget to maintain pensions at 25 per cent of male average weekly earnings. The government says that it has met its pre&amp;hyphen;election commitment in this regard. This was announced last year, of course, and funding was included in the contingency reserve in last year's budget legislation, which was introduced on 19 March. The government is trying to pretend, in the context of this budget, that it has announced a new initiative, but in fact it is in effect the third reannouncement of the measure.
            </para>
            <para first-indent="16">
             What the government neglects to mention is that this adjustment is retrospective. That is, when pensions are adjusted each March and September, they will be aligned with 25 per cent of the latest available estimate of average weekly earnings. These estimates will be months old. With average earnings growing by 3&amp;half; per cent to four per cent a year, this means that at no time will the pension actually be at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. At each indexation point, the pension will be about 24.6 per cent of average weekly earnings, declining over the subsequent six months as average earnings rise.

              In contrast, Labor kept the pension above 25 per cent of average earnings at all times. It was at 25.3 per cent at the time that Labor left office. This is a significant difference. The government, in saying that it has adhered to its pre&amp;hyphen;election promise to maintain pensions at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, has adopted the most parsimonious interpretation possible of that commitment.
             </para>
             <para first-indent="16">
              When we were in government, we took the view that there were basically two ways you could interpret that commitment. One was that the pension would be above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings at all points in time over the course of the year. The other was that it could be interpreted as meaning that the pension would be above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings on average over the course of the year.
             </para>
             <para first-indent="16">
              The fact is that we, in practice, managed, from April 1990 onwards, to adhere to the more generous interpretation of that commitment. But the government is claiming to do no more than keep pensions at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings at two points in time during the course of each year—at the indexation points of March and September. And, for the reason that I have outlined, it does not even do that because the wage figures that are being used for calculating the benchmark are lagged.
             </para>
             <para first-indent="16">
              So what the government has got by way of adhering to this commitment to keep the pension at or above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings—the mechanism they have put in place—guarantees that the pension will never reach 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. Even at the most favourable points—the two indexation points—it will be below 25 per cent. In between the indexation points, the position will deteriorate further. I believe that this is a very clear breach of faith by this government with retired people and pensioners.

              The brief to the incoming government—which we received a copy of—when it came in in March last year provided costings to adhere to this commitment.

              The other thing I would like to mention is the so&amp;hyphen;called pension bonus plan which the government seeks to present as a win&amp;hyphen;win situation; something which benefits some pensioners on the one hand, but which, on the other hand, also produces budget savings estimated at $42 million a year when it comes fully into effect. The problem is that it takes no account of the longer term impact on the budget of this measure.

              When we were in government I, as minister, asked the department to prepare a brief on precisely this sort of proposition. If there was something that would produce budgetary savings and did not seem to hurt anybody—well, why wouldn't you take it? The reason we did not take it is that it built a significant structural hole into the social security budget in the long term. The reason for that is quite straightforward: once people start to become eligible for a lump sum, a proportion of the people who would benefit from that are people who would have remained in the work force beyond the pensionable age anyway, even without that sort of incentive. So there is a class of windfall gainers and these, by and large, will tend to be the better off amongst the pensioners. It is not a savings measure; it builds in a significant long&amp;hyphen;term structural hole.

They let Australia down budget after budget. I will put that into context. Let me take you back to Labor's first Keating budget in 1983. Paul Keating said in his budget speech:

It repays debt. It abandons the borrowing culture of Labor. It restores our economic integrity in the eyes of the financial world. It brings the budget to real surplus, not an artificial surplus brought about by the proceeds of asset sales used for current consumption. The budget entrenches a low interest culture underpinned by low inflation. I commend the budget to the House.

          The decision of government to place a premium on a science based university degree also sends the wrong signal, especially to the risk averse group of lower to middle income families who are considering future educational options for their kids. Unfortunately, education, particularly at the tertiary level, has taken a bit of a beating lately. The last two budgets have not been kind to many people, least of all the higher education sector. If you add together the cuts to operating grants of some $600 million and the abolition of discretionary funds, which is in excess of $200 million, you have upwards of $800 million cut from the higher education sector over the period of the forward estimates. This does not include the failure of the government to provide supplementation for academic salary increases, which will have a very significant effect on university operating budgets or the further one per cent efficiency dividend which was buried in last year's budget and which finally came to light during analysis of the current budget.

There is no doubt that California is the premier area for research and innovation in the United States.

As I said earlier, the sudden reduction in the value of this concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent may be expected to have a long&amp;hyphen;term negative effect on both actual levels of expenditure and on the board&amp;hyphen;room psychology of the culture of research and development, which is almost as important in the long run.

On budget night, the minister claimed that the government had increased direct Commonwealth spending for science and innovation by $43 million in 1997&amp;hyphen;98 to a total of some $3.55 billion. The minister also claimed that CSIRO would receive an extra five per cent in funding. Unfortunately, those claims simply do not stack up.

These show that, when you factor out the effect of inflation, there will actually be a cut to funding of about $38 million or 1.3 per cent. Those figures are contained in the government's own statement which, unfortunately, was not released on budget night, and I would challenge the minister in future budgets to release that statement on budget night so that everyone can have a real and ready reference from the government's own sources as to the reality of its budget rhetoric.

Additional money has been given in the budget to the Australian Tourist Commission and I believe that money will be used well. There is no doubt in my mind or in the minds of many of my constituents that the Sydney Olympics is not just about two weeks in the year 2000; it is about the years before and the years after. The whole of Australia will benefit from Sydney staging the 2000 Olympics.

          I should say that tourism continues to be a vital industry for Australia. It is responsible for more than $8 billion of what are effectively export earnings for this country, and that probably makes it Australia's major export earner. Therefore, I am pleased that in this budget the government has given tourism full export industry status by extending the export market development grants scheme to the tourism industry on the same grounds as it is available to other exporters. The previous government, for 13 years, failed to recognise the importance of the tourism industry in that situation. The member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) is frowning. He does not need to be reminded about that particular decision in respect of the export market development grants scheme, I am sure.

          The tourism industry continues to grow strongly despite the anti&amp;hyphen;Asian comments of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). It needs to be understood—and it needs to be said in my electorate, which is absolutely tourism based—that these comments are a serious threat to our tourism industry. Let the point be made clearly by me and, I hope, by others in this place that those sorts of anti&amp;hyphen;Asian sentiments are very much against Australia's interest as far as our tourism industry is concerned. I also believe they are representing a threat to the wider interests of Australia in our relationships with our Asian neighbours.

         The opposition believed that it was unfair to take away from those two groups the right of access to Australian Hearing Services. Our amendments were rejected in the House of Representatives. But we were very pleased that the government picked up one set of amendments that agreed to not proceed with the measure that would affect deaf children between the ages of 19 and 21. Also, there was a majority in the Senate, made up of the opposition together with the support of the Democrats and Senator Harradine—and I am not sure whether Senator Colston was helpful—ensuring our ability to amend the legislation in the Senate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The problem was—and this was our mistake—that, despite the collective wisdom of the opposition, the Democrats and Senator Harradine, we amended one part of the legislation: we deleted item 3 from schedule 1 of the legislation, which removed subsections (ac) and (ad) from section 5A(1) from the Hearing Services Act. What we failed to notice was that another part of the legislation, item 23 of schedule 1, deletes all of section 5 from the Hearing Services Act. In fact, it takes out of the Hearing Services Act 1991 the eligibility provisions and places them within the Hearing Services Administration Bill 1997.

         Mr Deputy Speaker, I know that you and every other member would have known that is as clear as mud and would have quite obviously realised that the opposition should have moved two amendments rather than one to try to protect seniors. That is the mistake that we have made.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What is the effect of this? The effect of it is that the opposition, the Democrats and Senator Harradine have protected the senior health care card holders and they will retain their eligibility until 1 July. After 1 July, the government's item 23 of schedule 1 bites, and those seniors lose their eligibility on 1 July.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The problem is that the group of people affected are, in many cases, farmers, self-funded retirees—people who are perhaps asset rich but income poor. The opposition believes that, having extended this concession to
         <break page="4308" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          seniors five years ago, it is quite penny pinching of the government to seek to take away from people such as farmers and those self-funded retirees the right to be looked after by Australian Hearing Services. What does it do? Australian Hearing Services ensures that, if those elderly Australians are assessed as needing a hearing-aid, a hearing&amp;hyphen;aid is fitted, provided and maintained. It is a service which is quite helpful to those many self-funded retirees around Australia.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Given that I understand the government intend to accept the opposition's first amendment, which extends the eligibility of the senior card holders till 1 July, if they are serious about making sure that these people are protected, they will allow the opposition to move this additional amendment which does seek to ensure that the eligibility is protected forever, not just until 1 July. With that, I will try to finish early to make sure that we move through this as quickly as possible. But the point we are trying to make is that this is the best way to make sure that those 33,000 seniors do continue to have access to Australian Hearing Services.

         This is not something I particularly enjoy doing, but we had to make a lot of tough decisions last year with the financial position we found ourselves in after the election. Our principal concern was to see that we could get the budget back into surplus over this term, health had to play a part, and this was a direct consequence of the deficit. So, as it has already been substantially debated, both here and in the other place, I do not see any need to further debate it. We do not agree to the suspension.

         In the past we were told that there was no saving as a result of this change. There was a discussion about that in the consideration in detail stage with the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan). All of the information which we have been provided with to date was that the savings were zero over the forward estimates. We do not think it will bankrupt the government to allow these 33,000 senior card holders the right to continue to have hearing aids assessed, fitted and maintained. For those reasons, the opposition is supporting this amendment.

I applaud the government's reduction of the taxation level on savings. I do so because it institutionalises it in the system and, hopefully, the scheme can be made more practical and less regressive in some future budget. I think this could be done by either reducing the amount of taxation involved or giving a complete exemption, thereby benefiting people on lower incomes.

You cannot talk about industry policy in isolation. You have to talk about education, training and immigration. You have to talk about a whole host of other costs to society. That is clearly something which the member for Melbourne is not prepared to do. In my view, his posturing on industry policy has a rather hollow ring. I think the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) has a much better idea about it. It remains to be seen whether the member for Perth will be able to influence the Labor Party in the future.

The army had worked with International for two years to develop the vehicle they wanted. We then let the army buy a foreign vehicle at a cost which was 50 per cent higher than that of the Australian vehicle. That was, I believe, the last nail in the coffin of International, which was surviving and profiting as a truck manufacturer in Australia, and could have continued to do so.

It is my view that the Mabo decision was a social engineering decision. It was not based in law. I think the reason for that was that when we had appeals to the Privy Council there was some intellectual rigour imposed on the High Court. In those days, we arguably had the best appellate court in the world. Those days have gone. There is a no rigour imposed on the High Court and it has sunk into social engineering. In the Mabo report you have Deane and Gaudron talking about `our unspeakable shame'. What sort of emotive language is that? What sort of legal terminology is that?

          —In a week notable for the fall of official interest rates by a further 0.5 per cent to 7.2 per cent, we should be cautious about any premature euphoria in housing purchases, for the brute facts, as revealed by the release of a report this week from the Real Estate Institute of Australia, show another picture. That report notes that historically the proportion of first home buyers in the housing market has been inversely proportional to mortgage interest rates. Rates come down and people make what is their major financial commitment for life to buy their homes. It has always been the Australian dream, and Paul Keating's attempts in the past to talk down the quarter acre block have not changed that.

Instead, as the REIA reports, first home ownership rates have declined. That is something which we must keep under scrutiny.

          The government of 1945 totally rejected the claim that occasional depressions are necessary to remove inefficient firms and to speed up the transfer of resources from declining to expanding industries, which it maintained `cannot any longer be supported in view of the miseries imposed on large sections of the community by those depressions'.

          Rereading the white paper of 1945, it becomes apparent how the perceived role of government in this country has changed. In 1945 it was possible to put in place import quotas when there was a severe and prolonged fall in export incomes. For less permanent declines in Australia's trading fortunes overseas, an alteration in the exchange rate was seen as the appropriate method of correction.

          Some commentators have dated the abandonment of the aspirations of the 1945 white paper to the Fraser government's election in 1975. Then the government chose to fight inflation first rather than deal with the high rates of unemployment as a priority. The emphasis was on keeping money supply steady. Policy makers from that era onwards returned to the classical view of unemployment as purely the result of excessive real wage levels, which had risen dramatically prior to 1975 under the Whitlam government.

          These policies largely excluded the possibility of active government intervention to achieve full employment. However, an adverse consequence of these decisions was to expose Australia to the ill winds that blow from offshore. Economic policy became a matter of anticipating the reactions of the markets. So the values of the foreign exchange market speculators came to dominate economic policy. As we saw in the 1980s, a wave of unproductive speculative activity was unleashed in this country.

          A worrying concern for many Australians is their perception that these trends of globalisation have removed full employment from the national agenda. The truism is that by being competitive in a survival of the fittest contest the most efficient companies will survive and it will not matter that the rest will not. The phoenix will rise again from the ashes in the form of new businesses and industries. Many Australian manufacturers find that to compete with the low levels of pay possible in industries in South&amp;hyphen;East Asia, for example, they have to increasingly `downsize'—that euphemism from the 1980s.

          The litmus test for the Australian economy is the development of high value added industries and exports, particularly in areas such as elaborately transformed manufactures, ETMs. In the late 1980s it seemed as if giant strides were being made in this country in ETMs. In 1985 ETMs and other manufactures accounted for 20 per cent of total commodity exports. By 1993 this position had improved to a point where ETMs and other manufactures accounted for almost 30 per cent of total commodity exports. Even the ratio of exports to imports slowly improved for ETMs and manufactures as a whole. In 1986 ETM exports were 15 per cent of total ETM trade while by 1993 exports had moved up to 35 per cent.

          The other half of the equation, however, was that imports so far exceeded exports that, according to Stephen Bell in an article in the

          Moreover, the trend towards a deteriorating trade balance in manufactures has been accompanied by a fall&amp;hyphen;off in investment in import competing industries. The problem is compounded because whenever the economy

          The manufacturing sector is thus peculiarly vulnerable to the imports assault. Bell points out that the import penetration of manufactures increased by almost 50 per cent between 1970 and 1989. This figure is even way above the OECD average—in fact, 24 per cent higher than the OECD average. Many imports no longer compete with any local products. Worse, the ETM trade deficit worsened from $20 billion in 1985 to almost $37 billion by 1994. Amongst the imports there is only little evidence of the capital goods component that is necessary to rebuild industry. The conclusion that Bell and other commentators have drawn is that Australia is actually becoming more, not less, dependent on non-manufactured, largely low value&amp;hyphen;added exports.

          Labor failed to develop an industry policy except on an ad hoc basis for the industrial basket cases. Yet I believe industry policy can be the means for reducing the extent to which adverse economic outcomes are determined by international market forces. Its value is in ensuring the development of a diversified national economy at least partially insulated from the fluctuations in price and demand in world markets. Despite its bleating in recent weeks, the previous government failed to develop an adequate industry policy. The ongoing problem for national economies is to wind up old industries and structurally realign others and to adopt new technologies and retrain the labour force.

          —I want to make three basic points about the budget. Firstly, it reveals the unambiguous failure of last year's budget to deliver on its economic forecasts. Secondly, it demonstrates, by breaching two key front&amp;hyphen;and&amp;hyphen;centre election promises, the utter deception of the Australian people by the coalition at the last election. Thirdly, it fails absolutely to deliver on the major claim that the government is making for this budget, which is that it increases savings.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Expanding on those points, let me say firstly that in last year's budget the government claimed that, despite the contractionary budgetary policies that it was pursuing, it would still achieve substantial economic growth and enough employment growth to reduce unemployment. We argued that, because of the contractionary impact of the budget, the economy would be slowed and unemployment would be likely to be increased. This budget confirms that we were right and the government was wrong. Economic growth and employment growth were both notably less than forecast and unemployment increased, not decreased—at least that is the expectation of the government as revealed in this year's budget for this current financial year.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let us look at the details. In last year's budget, they forecast that for 1996&amp;hyphen;97 we would have growth of real GDP of 3&amp;half; per cent. This budget says it will only be 3¼ per cent. They said we would have employment growth of 1&amp;half; per cent. This budget says it will be 1¼ per cent. They said we would have an unemployment rate in the June quarter of 8¼ per cent. This budget says it will be 8¾ per cent. Quite clearly, there has been a failure to deliver on the forecasts.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That failure is what we predicted but also, importantly, we should remember that these forecasts were indeed modest. They were less
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          than Labor had been achieving when it was in office. We had been achieving for the previous three years rates of growth of output of over four per cent a year. Employment had been increasing at an average of 2.8 per cent per annum over the previous three years. We had a forecast here for a lousy 1&amp;half; per cent, and they could not even achieve that.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Against these outcomes, the Howard government's economic growth and employment forecasts obviously have not been achieved. Even though they were very modest forecasts, it still failed to deliver on them, the result being that we have got an unemployment rate forecast for the end of this financial year—for the June quarter of 1997—which is higher than for the June quarter of 1996 and, indeed, higher than for the June quarter of 1995. There can be no doubt that this budget reveals that the government's key economic forecasts in last year's budget were not obtained, and that the opposition's contention—that the contractionary Costello budget would slow growth and increase unemployment—has been shown to be correct.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second major point I want to make is that this budget, by breaking two key front&amp;hyphen;and&amp;hyphen;centre election promises, reveals the coalition's deception of people at the last election. The first one was the promise to boost employment growth. The now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) promised in his policy launch statement on 18 February 1996 to boost job growth. There was no more central promise he made than that—to boost job growth. To this point in time, we have seen an abysmal failure by the government to deliver on that election promise, and this budget confirms that there is no possibility of this government anywhere near matching Labor's employment growth, let alone boosting growth higher than that level.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Compare the record of the two governments to this point in time. This government has been in office 14 months. In that first 14 months, it has achieved employment growth of 92,000—1.1 per cent. In Labor's last 14 months, employment grew by 263,000 compared with a lousy 92,000 under this government. Our growth: 3.3 per cent compared with their 1.1 per cent. In Labor's last 14 months,
         <break page="4319" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          we had growth in full&amp;hyphen;time employment of 192,000. This government has achieved just 4,000. In male full&amp;hyphen;time employment, we had growth of 114,000. This government has reduced male full&amp;hyphen;time employment by 16,000 in its first 14 months.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The number of unemployed in our last 14 months decreased by 26,000. Under this government, it has gone up by 35,000. The unemployment rate went down in our last 14 months by 0.6 per cent, from nine per cent to 8.4 per cent. Under this government, it has gone up to 8.7 per cent. The number of long&amp;hyphen;term unemployed went down by 56,000 in our last 14 months. In this government's first 14 months, it has gone up 14,000. The teenage unemployment rate went down by 0.7 per cent in our last 14 months. It went up by 1.5 per cent in this government's first 14 months.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What all these figures show is that, far from boosting employment as promised, this government has boosted unemployment. Furthermore, this budget demonstrates that there is no chance whatever that the government will be able to meet its election promise in this term of office. Labor, in its last term of office, increased employment by 733,000 or 9.65 per cent. That is what the Prime Minister promised to beat: he would boost employment growth. He would do better than Labor.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So far, in its first 14 months, this government has achieved only 92,000 additional jobs. So it has got 641,000 additional jobs to create in the next 22 months just to match Labor's additional jobs, and if it wants to match Labor's rate of employment growth—that is, the 9.65 per cent—it would need to create an additional 712,000 jobs in the next 22 months.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This budget demonstrates that the government has no hope whatever of matching Labor's employment growth, let alone surpassing it. Its employment forecasts are for 2¼ per cent employment growth in 1997&amp;hyphen;98 and again in 1998&amp;hyphen;99. Assuming that these forecast increases were actually achieved and assuming that the rate of growth would commence from now and not July, then in 22 months time—that is, in February 1999—they would have increased employment by a
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          further 351,000. With the 92,000 they have achieved so far, this would mean an increase in employment in this term of office for the Howard government of 443,000 or 5.3 per cent. That 443,000 is 290,000 fewer than Labor achieved in its last term of office. So this government is on track to achieve an employment outcome of 290,000 fewer jobs than were created in Labor's last term of office. Some terrific achievement that is going to be when you finally roll up to the election in February or March—whenever it is—of 1999 and say, `Look at our great achievement. We have increased employment by 443,000, just 290,000 fewer than Labor.' What a pathetic performance that will be! But that is what this government is on track to achieve.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Even if they did a little better than they have forecast, which is highly unlikely given their record, they would still be way behind Labor's achievement. And if they were to match our rate of growth—9.65 per cent—they would need 360,000 more jobs than they are on track to achieve.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This government is falling lamentably short of its promise to boost employment growth. It has, in a major way, decreased employment growth and shows no signs of turning that around. So it is now quite official: this government's most fundamental and central election promise—to boost jobs growth—has been abandoned after only 14 months in office. The budget in fact is a surrender document on employment. It is a total admission of failure to anywhere near matching Labor's employment growth, let alone surpassing it.

        <para first-indent="16">
         As realisation of the crushing failure to match Labor is hitting home, we are seeing the government turn to distractions and excuses. They are turning to things like work for the dole—a parody of their promise to create real jobs—and to excuses like the unfair dismissals legislation. If only we would agree to amend it one more time, that would enable them to create some jobs, ignoring the fact that in the year after the unfair dismissals legislation was introduced by the Labor government—in March of 1994—employment grew by 327,000! It did not stop us creating

         I will turn now to the second breach of election promise, and that is the coalition's promise at the last election to meet the then government's co&amp;hyphen;contribution commitment. That commitment was to match employees' contributions to superannuation dollar for dollar up to three per cent of average weekly earnings and, subject to an income test, that would phase the contribution out altogether at twice average weekly earnings.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The now government promised at the last election, unambiguously, to match that—to introduce the co-contribution—and it has clearly not done that as shown by what is in this budget. This was a $4 billion promise, but it was not some minor promise. This was a promise to pay $4 billion per annum when the thing was fully phased in to the working people of Australia—not just to the wage and salary earners but to the self&amp;hyphen;employed as well.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It was the largest promise that the coalition made and it was worth substantial money to working men and women. For instance, a worker on average weekly earnings would have been required to contribute three per cent of his pay to his superannuation fund and would have received from the government a matching $1,000 into his superannuation fund. So he put in $1,000 and he got a $1,000 matching payment from the government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In this budget the promise by the coalition to pay that money is abandoned. Instead, there is a different savings scheme, which costs only half as much as the co&amp;hyphen;contribution when fully introduced—that is, $2 billion compared with $4 billion—and which pays a 15 per cent rebate on superannuation contributions up to $3,000 per annum or savings investment income of up to that amount without any means test.

        <para first-indent="16">
         For ordinary workers, this is daylight robbery. The scheme robs them of $2 billion a year in overall funding of the scheme. Secondly, by paying only a 15 per cent rebate instead of dollar for dollar, it robs them of much more than half the original benefit. For instance, for that worker who put $1,000 into his superannuation, he now gets a 15 per cent
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          rebate, which pays him $150 compared with the $1,000 he was going to get under the co&amp;hyphen;contribution approach, which we promised to introduce and which the coalition promised to introduce as well. The coalition is now welshing on that promise and robbing this worker of $850 per annum. It is not some minor breach. This is probably the most outrageous breach of election promise that has ever been perpetrated in this country. I cannot remember a $2 billion breach of promise before. That is what this is. In fact, for the workers involved, it is much more than halving it; it is almost taking most of the benefit away.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         High income earners, who would have been means tested out of the co&amp;hyphen;contribution scheme, can now receive the maximum benefit under this new scheme of $450. An executive on three times the average weekly earnings would have got nothing from the co&amp;hyphen;contribution because of the means test, but now that there is no means test he picks up the full $450 while the worker gets screwed for $850. What is being perpetrated on the workers of this country is an outrage. The whole thing is being distorted in so far as it takes away from them anything that does exist and gives it to the higher income earners.

        <para first-indent="16">
         This is made more so by a wider range of investment income qualifying for the rebate. So it includes interest, dividends, rental income, trust income—you can split your income in lots of ways through various trusts; they all pick up the $450—partnership income other than wages and salaries, capital gains, et cetera. The recipients of this type of income will be very largely higher income people. Much of the benefit of the scheme that is now being introduced will go to people whose incomes are well above the cut-off point that would have applied in the co-contribution scheme. So it is biased heavily towards the wealthy.

         This budget fails absolutely to deliver on what it claims to be the central feature of this budget—a boost to savings. This failure to boost national savings stems from two factors. Firstly, the government's failure to cover its new expenditure with sufficient expenditure decreases or tax increases to provide a boost to national savings; instead, it reduces national savings. Secondly, the government's abandonment of the previous government's policy to boost private savings and replace it with a much less effective alternative.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let me go to the first of those two points. The government claims that its budget measures result in increased national savings but this is not so for the years beyond 1997-98. This is because the major expenditure reduction contained in the budget is the scrapping of the proposed co-contribution for employee superannuation contributions, which was to be phased in from 1998-99. But scrapping that co-contribution does not increase national saving.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To the extent that it is not spent on new measures, it increases public saving but it does not increase national saving because this payment was already going to be totally saved in private savings. Robbing private savings to increase public savings does not increase national savings. This is especially so when, as is the case in this budget, some of these purloined private savings are spent by the government when they are brought into the public sector.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Leaving aside the abandonment of the co-contribution payment, for the years 1998-99, 1999-2000 and 2000-01 the government's budget balance expansion measures—that is, new expenditure measures and revenue reduction measures—exceed the budget balance reduction measures, that is, the expenditure reduction and revenue increasing measures. It exceeds them by $197 million in 1998-99, by $1,755 million in 1999-2000 and by $2,887 million in 2000-01.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The second reason for reduced national savings is, as I said, the abandonment of the previous government's policy to boost private savings through superannuation and to replace it with a less effective alternative. Labor's scheme had award superannuation, the superannuation guarantee and then the compulsory employee contributions and the government co-contribution. According to the retirement income modelling task force, the effect of this scheme on national savings was to increase it by 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2001-02 and by 4.2 per cent of GDP by 2020.

          What this government has done is maintained the award superannuation guarantee reluctantly, scrapped the rest of it, brought in the rebate scheme and made some changes to superannuation arrangements. The combined effect of the government's new package, according to the budget statement

          </emphasis>
          , is said to be that national savings will be increased by 1.5 per cent of GDP by 2001-02. That is compared with Labor's 2.5 per cent—1.1 per cent of GDP less saving. By the year 2020 it will have a 3.6 per cent increase in saving compared to Labor's 4.2. This is a policy to reduce national savings over what they would have been if they had stuck with Labor's policy, as they promised to do.

          This is the most extraordinary situation. You have a government breaking an absolutely central major election promise and then saying, `Having broken that we are going to boost national savings.' But what they are doing is reducing savings and they are admitting it in the document

           We get no figure in there for what this rebate scheme is going to do because everyone knows this rebate scheme is a farce in terms of increasing savings. There is no estimate in there for that one alone. Treasury has said in reviewing the OECD report

         In my electorate of Murray I had decent young men wanting real work, wanting training to get that real work, put in the back of utes and trucks and driven out to forests under LEAP schemes—and God knows what else they were called at the time—supposedly to be trained as forestry type workers. In fact, they were to dig and install cattle grids, only one per day, and there were seven or eight people there to do it. They were not supervised. They did not get information or training on how to install cattle grids, not that that is a very long-term job prospect anyway. All they got was colds. They went back sick.

         I am sure that too many people remember what they did in the previous 13 years with our unemployed: they failed to give them genuine work opportunities. What happened is that the books were cooked. There was more frantic book cooking as the election approached in 1996. More of these mickey mouse schemes were brought on. More of the people from the jobless queues were siphoned off into numerous programs and then called trainees, so the statistics looked better. But the outcomes for those people were just the same. It was a cruel and callous thing to do.

         You were defeated at the last election because the country wants jobs for its people. We do not pretend for a moment that the work for the dole scheme is anything to do with creating work for young people that will be ongoing. What we talk about with work for the dole is giving young people in particular an experience of what it is like to contribute back to the communities that are, through their taxes, paying for their unemployment entitlements. We are giving young people a sense of what it is like to meet with others, to get back into the routine of work and to, perhaps, experience work for the first time. We are calling it work for the dole, and that is what the public wants to call it.

          —I rise tonight to condemn the actions of Telstra in seeking to ram through a proposal to deploy aerial broadband communications cable in Mornington and Mount Eliza, just weeks before the controls on cable deployment are substantially upgraded. Some of the 3,800 affected households in Mornington and Mount Eliza learnt just over a week ago that Telstra intended to commence the deployment of broadband cabling in the dying days of the revised telecommunications national code. Telstra plans to aerially deploy its cabling in 88 per cent of the Mount Eliza neighbourhoods and 75 per cent of the Mornington area covered by this ill&amp;hyphen;conceived proposal.

         With a mere few days notice, a public meeting was held on 21 May 1997 to inform residents from Mount Eliza and Mornington of Telstra's plans. An almost unanimous motion from the meeting called on Telstra to

          defer its activities until after June 30 to enable proper consultation to take place with the local community and the Mornington Peninsular Shire Council. At the information meeting, Telstra representatives were unable to provide costings on undergrounding alternatives, or to discuss cooperative proposals to reduce the impact of cabling on neighbourhood amenity as has been negotiated between the City of Booroondara and Optus. Not only is Telstra failing to comply with the provisions of the revised code, it is behaving as if `telco thuggery' is a way of enhancing consumer loyalty. Here is why.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Both Telstra and Optus advised me that they only had cabling plans for the Frankston city area and not into the Mornington Peninsular Shire area during round table discussions held on 24 and 30 September last year. Telstra spoke in terms of `keeping pace with its competitor' which involved expected work in the Frankston area this year. Optus has carried through this position. Telstra now claims that `competitive pressures' are behind its plans to go south of the Frankston city area.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I reject Telstra's argument of so-called competitive pressures as Optus is not in the area concerned, households already have telephony services, pay TV is available through other delivery systems, and current Telstra technology provides access to available on&amp;hyphen;line services. The Telstra representatives may have let out of the bag the real source of pressure to deploy the cable when advising the public meeting at Mornington that `Telstra has a business obligation to Foxtel to roll out'.

        <para first-indent="16">
         For Mornington residents, Telstra appears to want to impose on them metropolitan technology, deployed with inner city sensitivity, while denying Mornington people access to metropolitan prices because the area concerned is outside the Melbourne 039 call zone. A reasonable opportunity has not been provided for the community to work through Telstra's proposals and certainly not to engage in the sort of substantive dialogue provided for by the post&amp;hyphen;July 1 regulatory regime. No-one wants to deny the local community new technology. But there is no

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Telstra's activities are opportunistic. Telstra knows that the code it is trying to exploit would not still exist if the previous Labor government had not locked in the code until 30 June this year as part of the licence deal with Optus. Telstra is being heavy-handed in using this small window of opportunity to roll out aerial cable in Mornington and Mount Eliza.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I have been told by Telstra that `commercial concerns' mean that a delay is not on. Genuine consultation and dialogue with the local communities is being denied. A thoughtful and customer focused Telstra would provide a proper opportunity for the local community to work through its plans and to fully explore deployment alternatives in conjunction with the local council.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is no good reason why the people I represent in Mornington and Mount Eliza should be denied this opportunity. Working through Telstra's plans without the immunity carriers have from state and planning environment laws would ensure that the proper consultation and dialogue occurs between the Mornington Peninsula Shire Council, Telstra and its Mornington and Mount Eliza customers. I call on Telstra to be more reasonable in its behaviour towards Mornington and Mount Eliza residents in regard to its deployment of broadband cabling.

Young people are the subject of much debate in this House, as well they should be: they are our most precious, valuable resource as a nation.

          The forcible removal of Indigenous children from their families occurred during two periods in Tasmania. The first commenced with the European occupation of Van Dieman's Land (as Tasmania was called until 1856) in 1808 and lasted until the middle of the nineteenth century.

          —It is appropriate that we discuss this package of bills together. Essentially one matter is being dealt with and the proper parliamentary processes require it to be considered in a package of legislation. The opposition will be supporting the package of legislation and the government amendment, of which we have been advised and which will be formally considered in the consideration in detail stage.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This legislation concerns the NICNAS—the industrial chemicals notification and assessment scheme—that has been developed over the last decade. It is a worthwhile program for the improvement of the occupational health and safety of Australian men and women at work and as such it has had, and deserves, the bipartisan support of everybody in the parliament. We
         <break page="4332" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          are talking about setting up proper processes for ensuring that these chemicals, which are necessarily used in the proper process of important production, are safe and are used safely, and that proper arrangements are put in place for industrial access and their use.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is therefore appropriate that on this occasion we are in a position to respond positively to the government's initiative, which is really only in small part a variation from an initiative considered by the previous government, and which will implement a decision formulated by the previous government, concerning cost recovery in the industrial chemicals notification and assessment scheme.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Under this scheme, all new industrial chemicals are assessed before their importation or manufacture so that recommendations about appropriate safeguards can be made before their use. Chemicals already in use and causing concern can be selected for assessment as priority existing chemicals. In total, over 700 industrial chemicals have been assessed in the six years NICNAS has been in operation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The real purpose of this package is to replace the current cost recovery arrangements for funding the assessment of existing industrial chemicals with an industry based charge, which is another nice way of saying a tax. This government has a record for elegantly saying it is  going to impose a tax without using the word `tax'. In this instance it is not something we disagree with at all, but if there were a euphemism contest the government would definitely win.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think the move to full cost recovery is appropriate. I will say something briefly in a moment about a method but there is no question about the principle. It was decided in the context of the 1994&amp;hyphen;95 budget of the previous government to move to full cost recovery, so there is no argument of principle about it. Nor is there any concern regarding the consequential amendments which flow from the need to ensure the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission's  administration of the scheme and that the moneys are properly collected in accordance with the constitution and properly applied to the purposes of this scheme.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I indicated, it was decided in the context of the 1994&amp;hyphen;95 budget to move NICNAS to full cost recovery in the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 financial year, aligning it with the cost recovery arrangements applying to agricultural and veterinary chemicals. There were reports about both the implications of that move by the so&amp;hyphen;called Gwynne report and the mechanisms to achieve full cost recovery conducted by Access Economics. When you put all that material together, it certainly leads to the conclusion that the principle that this is a scheme that should operate on the basis of full cost recovery is appropriate, and the timing and the consequential amendments are quite adequate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         From the opposition's point of view we are relaxed about supporting these proposals. I just want to make two qualifications. They do not in any way constitute opposition; they constitute reservations to some extent caused by the lack of information. The government has been very cooperative in briefing us, but in opposition the access to information is more limited than in government. So I want to flag these two things while not in any way qualifying our support for the package and the amendment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am not convinced at this stage that, had we been implementing the decision of 1994&amp;hyphen;95 ourselves, we would have gone down this route of cost recovery. We would have pursued cost recovery; I am not sure that this mechanism—with registration and a sort of two&amp;hyphen;tier system—is the one we would have used. I have some qualification about that, but it is not an unfair or unreasonable proposal. The government has given it consideration. Its arguments for putting
         <break page="4333" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          it forward are reasonable, and I have no quibble at this point with its rights to proceed in the way that it wishes to pursue cost recovery. As long as it does not come into fundamental conflict of principle, then the mechanism it chooses is essentially an administrative matter for it.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I did have a discussion with the officers of the department about the other reservation I have. I understand their argument and I do not have an alternative to put forward. But this reservation, which is more substantive than that about funding, is about the way in which the bill deals with the so&amp;hyphen;called small quantities matter. I do not want to debate that in detail. People who are interested will know what I am referring to, and people who wish to research it will find it adequately covered in the explanatory memorandum. I simply want to say that that is the operative reservation I have.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The officers have put the explanation of why the government has proceeded in this way to me. I understand that point and I certainly do not intend at this stage to propose any amendment. It would take a lot more resources and independent research capacity to be able to develop an alternative, and this proposal may work very well. I would be delighted to find that my reservations are unfounded.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Overall, this is a package which we support. It implements a principle that the previous government had proposed. I notice, and I think this is appropriate, that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) said in his second reading speech that he has established what he called a non&amp;hyphen;statutory industry consultative committee. I do not know in full its composition and I hope it is representative. But the point I want to make is not about that—I think it is appropriate that the minister has a consultative committee. I hope that if, as is referred to in the second reading, it makes recommendations for improvements to the scheme then those recommendations will be public or at least available to the industry, to employees and their organisations, and to the parliament.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government has indicated to us that they intend to move, and they have distributed, a minor amendment. The opposition has no problem with that minor amendment; we understand its purpose and we support it. If the scheme is going to proceed, that amendment is necessary to make its operation proper and appropriate in accordance with the management of public moneys, so we have no problem with it. We will therefore be supporting this package of legislation and the government amendment through the Main Committee and when they return to the House.

         Obviously, in matters of any nature that come before the House, one would be foolish to say that there are not some reservations about measures that are introduced, particularly about a measure that is basically moving in a different direction from what has been in the past. Therefore, we have to tread somewhat warily at times, particularly in an area like this, to ensure that ultimately the best result will be achieved not only for the consumers and for the workers who have to work with the chemicals but also for the industry, the marketing industry, research and development and so forth.

          The purpose of the bill is basically to bring into line an overall government philosophy of user pays, which is one I thoroughly endorse. Using chemicals in modern society is, some would say, a necessary hazard. So, consistent with modern trends, schemes need to encourage less hazardous chemicals entering the market. This bill addresses the need to provide a more effective assessment of new and existing chemicals. Constant development of new chemicals requires more cost-effective measures for that assessment.

          The bill follows the recommendations of the Gwynne report involving the facilitating of movement to full cost recovery and improvement in the effectiveness of the national industrial chemicals notification and assessment scheme, known as NICNAS. The scheme encourages a user pays philosophy, which I have already referred to and which characterises the government's general philosophy across a wide number of areas. It is a responsible budgetary measure in that context. It brings the scheme into line with comparable regulatory authorities such as the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals.

          It should be noted in passing that in relation to constituent problems that I have encountered involving small businesses and the NRAAVC, it is important in an area which is aligned to  that sort of regulatory authority to ensure that the scheme will work effectively and will not be a vehicle to discourage small businesses in their trading activity. The national registration authority has, unfortunately, in the past not been all that helpful, particularly to small businesses. This is not the place to go into that, but I do have some reservations about the operation of the labelling scheme that was brought in by the previous Labor government.

          The charging mechanism for cost recovery for existing chemicals will bring program efficiencies and enable a variety of assessment approaches to be implemented, including the assessment of groups of chemicals and safer substitutes. The small businesses in my electorate are aware of the demanding needs of the public for safer chemicals and the overall strategy of the bill will assist these businesses to keep pace with a much more environmentally concerned consumer market.

          More specifically, for new chemicals in the Australian inventory of chemical substances, the director will be able to remove chemicals wrongly included and add details of trade name products, making the inventory more accurate for users. An amendment adds additional exemption for research and development chemicals introduced solely in the course of a program of research, development or analysis, provided certain safeguards are met.

         <para first-indent="16">
          An additional exemption eliminates the need for notification and assessment for new chemicals introduced in quantities of less than 10 kilograms per year where no risk to occupational health and safety is involved, or any environmental risks are involved. This will particularly assist the cosmetic industry in making it more competitive. That industry is a developing one in this country and needs to be encouraged.

          A further amendment permits the director to expedite new industrial chemicals within 28 days, pending completion of an assessment report, if the chemical is not hazardous or dangerous. Other amendments streamline assessment reports, remove the need for duplicate assessments, allow existing assessments to be extended to cover subsequent importers and for specific reports from an approved foreign scheme to be used. All of these will ultimately make for greater efficiency.

           In relation to existing chemicals, proposals from the 1994 evaluation report on the existing chemicals program are being implemented. Information about the use and introduction of chemicals will be more readily available and there will be some cross flow of information about chemicals prior to their declaration as priority existing chemicals—PECs.

           The further amendments in relation to the application for early introduction for non&amp;hyphen;hazardous chemicals will facilitate the entry into Australia of new industrial chemicals that are considered to be non&amp;hyphen;hazardous. In many cases, these new chemicals will replace older, hazardous chemicals. This is a very good system because it allows for faster replacement of hazardous chemicals and, as has been said by the minister, NICNAS has operated on partial cost recovery since its inception. This bill moves, of course, to full cost recovery. The current scheme for existing chemicals does not result in fair cost sharing in the industry and the 1995 review said it was an unworkable scheme.

           A company registration will replace the current fee collecting mechanism. A new register called the Register of Industrial Chemical Introducers will mean that all persons who introduce industrial chemicals with the total value of more than half a million dollars will be required to register and pay a charge assessed at $1,200 if the value is between the range of $0.5 million and $5 million. The scale of charges goes up depending on the value of introduced chemicals.

           In summary, as I have said before, this scheme will ensure that the industry is more cost efficient. It will encourage research and development. It will reduce the reliance on hazardous chemicals and ultimately will encourage, in my view, small businesses to provide products that the market—and particularly consumers—are seeking. The environment will be spared in the process from the extra dangers which an unbridled chemical industry would produce in a society increasingly concerned about chemical waste.

           Most of all, given that many workers in my electorate are working with chemicals in the course of their employment in engineering and other workshops where the use of chemicals is fairly widespread, it is important to ensure that workers and their families are protected from hazardous chemicals. I believe that this process will assist in eliminating older, hazardous chemicals and bring with it the more modern and environmentally friendly chemicals, thus protecting workers and their families from unnecessary hazards. Having regard to comments that I have made and those that relate to the overall philosophy and direction of the bill, I support this measure and commend it to the House.

         The national industrial chemicals notification and assessment scheme—NICNAS, as it is termed—was established in 1989 to assess the health and environment risks of all new industrial chemicals and selected existing chemicals. In total, over 700 industrial chemicals have been assessed in the six years that NICNAS has been in operation. NICNAS has operated on partial cost recovery since its inception, and this bill and its cognate bills will move NICNAS to full cost recovery, consistent with other Commonwealth chemical assessment schemes. Currently, costs are recovered by a system of application fees for the assessment carried out. This has worked well for new chemicals but not, however, for existing chemicals.

          The bill will implement a system of company registration to replace the current fee collection mechanism for existing chemicals. The bill also establishes a new register, the Register of Industrial Chemical Introducers. All persons who introduce industrial chemicals with an annual total value of more than $0.5 million will be required to register and pay a registration charge.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Company registration was first proposed by the previous government in 1995. Following extensive consultation with industry, we have refined the scheme to minimise its impact on business. A two&amp;hyphen;tier system of registration charges will apply, with a lower charge of $1,200 and a higher charge of $7,000 for large introducers. The $0.5 million initial registration threshold will ensure that small businesses will not be affected. Company registration will enhance the operation of NICNAS by overcoming problems in its current cost recovery mechanism for existing chemicals. Costs will be shared more widely with the industry, as a result of this bill.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The bill amends the process of assessing existing industrial chemicals to ensure a better targeting of risks and a more flexible approach to assessment. New chemical assessment procedures will also be streamlined by allowing the early introduction of non&amp;hyphen;hazardous chemicals, and additional exemptions for chemicals introduced in amounts of less than 10 kilograms per year. These amendments bring the Australian scheme into line with comparable schemes overseas and also enhance the efficiency of the scheme in moving to full cost recovery.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The bill also makes important changes to the Australian inventory of chemical substances. The inventory lists all chemicals imported or manufactured in Australia since 1977. The amendments will allow the continued listing of chemicals in the confidential section, subject to a review every five years. The test for inclusion in the confidential section has been strengthened. Currently, only the prejudice of the commercial interests of the person or company is considered. This will be changed to require the director to balance that prejudice against the public interests of disclosure.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The bill also makes minor amendments to improve the operation of the act, including by updating certain definitions. In summary, the bill and its cognate bills are aimed at further enhancing the operation of NICNAS while introducing full cost recovery and further streamlining assessment procedures. As a result of these reforms, assessments under NICNAS will be able to focus more on the chemicals posing the greatest risk to the Australian people and the environment.

          In conclusion, I thank the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) and the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) for their contribution to this bill. I listened to the opposition spokesman, the member for Canberra, who seemed to get a little lost in his speech. He was suggesting that he and the opposition would be supporting—as they are—the bill, but seemed to go onto a tack of getting lost on policy, once again. Whilst they support full cost recovery—which was an area in which we, in opposition, supported their thrusts—he seemed to be saying, `We're not quite sure about that now.'

         <para first-indent="16">
          The opposition ought to take a good, hard look at where they are going, because the shadow spokesman seemed to be getting lost. He also suggested that this levy was a tax. I would remind the opposition that under their bills, which we supported, it was indeed a levy. They are trying to target the government with introducing a tax and we reject that assertion. I would suggest to the opposition that the bed levy introduced by the Labor Premier of New South Wales in Sydney is, in fact, a bed tax and should be properly labelled a tax and not a levy.

          —The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) would know all about rabbits because there are plenty in the Wannon electorate. They were clubbed to death there in the postwar era. I am sure, as a child, the member participated in the mass slaughter of the rabbit population of his electorate, as I did in the electorate of Corangamite where my father's dairy farm was located. We are dealing today with ostriches and emus, and we will keep the rabbits off the plate.

         Dining out today, one is confronted with a range of exotic meats to test one's palate. The amount of meat consumed in Australia has not changed dramatically in recent years; however, the variety of meat that is being bought and consumed has. An important part of our more affluent lifestyle is that we eat out more often. That is accompanied by a desire to experiment with the specialty and exotic meats that are available in restaurants today. Once consumers enter the zone of trying exotic meats there is a natural tendency to try new cuts of meat.

         The honourable member for Wannon mentioned rabbits and our upbringing. While I was growing up on a farm in the Western District, our family's meat consumption was largely confined to lamb and beef. We had chicken once a year at Christmas time, and we ate rabbit stew and we hunted ducks. That supplemented the meat diet.

        <para first-indent="16">
         However, in the last 12 months, I have become a consumer of exotic meats. On the odd occasion that I go out to dinner—and it is not as frequently, of course, as the honourable member for Wannon, whom I hear has been seen around the shopping malls of Manuka on many occasions—my meat consumption includes kangaroo, emu and venison.

          —Yabbies do not really come under the ratite category, as the honourable member knows. As I was saying, my consumption of exotic meats has increased in the last 12 months as, as a consumer, I have experimented when I have gone out to dinner. I am part, as are we all, of the rising demand for these commodities in Australia. Often there is a consumer perception that these meats contain lower levels of fat and cholesterol, and so they are increasingly in demand from more sophisticated consumers.

         The emu industry began in Australia in the early 1970s. Since then, the industry has developed into one supplying meat products, skins and oils to a highly specialised niche market. Emu meat is low in fat and cholesterol and obviously appeals to health&amp;hyphen;conscious consumers, such as the member for Wannon, who are out there for a dining experience that features exotic meats.

          The skin and leather of the emu are also used in a variety of fashion clothes and in the manufacture of wallets, watchbands and other products. The oils are reputed to have healing powers for a range of skin disorders and muscular ailments. Being a keen Australian super rules player, I am certainly going to check out the emu oil and use it in that recovery period after each match that we play of a Sunday.

          As far as the Australian ostrich industry is concerned—and that is another bird in the ratite family that is the subject of this legislation—it is estimated that over 70,000 birds are farmed annually in Australia. A relatively lucrative market exists overseas for ostrich meats, leather and feathers. I am not suggesting that the honourable member for Wannon would know much about ostrich feathers, but he certainly knows a lot about rabbit fur, being an old boy from the Western District of Victoria where rabbits existed in plague proportions.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The ostrich industry has undergone a resurgence in recent years. It has developed a sound marketing program to guide its development beyond the year 2000. As I mentioned before, exotic consumer tastes are the order of the day for the modern Australian palate and ostrich meat is rapidly becoming a favourite among many Australians and the meat is being used to produce sausages, pates and hams.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The ostrich industry has also become a destination for investors seeking out new opportunities in agricultural industry in Australia today. That investment is now developing and expanding the production base because of the export potential for the meats and other products, especially in substantial markets such as China. Investors are committing funds to develop the national herd and to supply those lucrative domestic markets.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There has been a word of caution sounded from the ASC on the rather extravagant claims of many promoters of these investment schemes in the industry. Nonetheless, there are investment funds flowing into the industry on the back of identified export potential in markets in Japan and, of course, China.

          I attended the Alternative Farm Vision Expo that was held in Geelong recently. I congratulate the Herald and Weekly Times for their sponsorship of that particular event and the organisers who collected from all over Australia people who are currently involved in alternative farming. The industries that I mentioned, the ostrich and emu industries, were prominently featured at that Alternative Farm Vision Expo. Both of those industries are rapidly acquiring an important status in Australian agriculture as niche industries and highly specialised industries in the rural sector.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I think it is very important that we recognise the contribution of these industries to Australian agriculture and also that we encourage the diversity of agricultural production. If we go back 20, 30 or 40 years, Australian agriculture was pretty well confined. Now, in the 1990s, and as we go toward the year 2000, many farmers who have grown up in those traditional industries are seeking new opportunities in alternative forms of agriculture, which are typified by the industries that I have mentioned here today.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          They are important industries because they give an export focus to Australian agriculture. Often these industries, as they get into highly specialised and lucrative overseas markets, reinforce the image of Australia as an agricultural producer of diversity and enhance the reputation of Australian producers who are able to supply quality products to these particular markets.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Let me also add that the development of these industries is also very important to regional economies such as my own in the electorate of Corio and the economies further out in the

           Western District, typified by the presence of the honourable member for Wannon here today. They are very important activities; they are part of the patchwork, the quilt of agricultural production that really has sustained and diversified many rural communities that over the course of time have suffered some hardship in the more traditional industries in those areas.

The farm is also the genesis of an industry which is going to move Australia into the next century. It is significant in the case of John and Betty Schmidt that they and their father were dairy farming for many years and that they have now moved into this industry. It has not been easy to make that transition but they are innovative and entrepreneurial people. They are making a very solid go of it.

         It is interesting to see the way in which these developments are taking place and are progressing the primary industries of this country. Primary industry is, in many respects, the backbone of this country and it is good to see that it is moving with the times. I will mention here that the Cherbourg Aboriginal community, with which I have been significantly involved over the years, has an emu abattoir and farm—they have just over 300 birds. I was out there just last Thursday. That farm provides employment for Aboriginal people, particularly young Aboriginals, under the CDEP program. It also has become a significant tourist attraction in the area.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In my view, this process, particularly as I have related it to emus and the experience in my own electorate, and from my association with Cherbourg, will give confidence to the industry at a time when it needs confidence. It will progress the industry so that in time one may well expect that there will be a significant local domestic market in the consumption of these birds and in the use of by&amp;hyphen;products. There is the potential for an international market and that is already in progress. With this system of monitoring for chemical residues during the processing of these meats we can look forward to an export industry that will do Australia proud. I firmly support this measure.

When I became a member of parliament in 1980, there was only one emu farm in Australia, and that was at the Ngangganawili Aboriginal community of Wiluna. The Department of Aboriginal Affairs, as it was then, had taken the decision to close it down. I put my own money in to keep this project going and fought tenaciously to save that project from being closed down under both Liberal and Labor governments.

         The industry did start in Western Australia and it was a very difficult beginning. It was strenuously opposed by all sorts of people, particularly the conservation lobby. I remember one member of the Labor Party denouncing me and saying that it was outrageous that I should support the eating of half of Australia's coat of arms. I remember telling the man that he was a fool and that we had been eating the other half for a hundred years or more.

         When the industry started the rules were that all emus that were entered into commercialisation had to be sourced from the stock at Wiluna. This was, in my view, a very silly rule but it was one put in there at the insistence of CALM, Conservation and Land Management, in its endeavours to contain the industry and basically stop its growth, I guess. What it did, of course, was limit the stock and drive up the price of emu chicks. So instead of the industry doing as it should have done—getting out and seeking the sale of product—it developed in a very incestuous way by selling chicks to itself. The price of those chicks got out of control because of the limit on the origin of the stock.

           —That is true, I am used to that, though, comrade. The potential for the skins and the leather was clearly enormous. In seeking a market for this, I approached users in the United Kingdom who had had experience with what they called emu but it was in fact a rare bird from South America. That rare bird was captured in the wild and it was very hard to get any skins that were not badly damaged. The end product was only available for watch straps and belts. There simply was not enough unscarred material for anything else.

          When I convinced them that we would be providing them with a much bigger skin, a genuine emu skin, and that because the birds were in captivity the skins would generally be unblemished, the opening order was for a million skins. I suggested that three or four dozen would be more than we could handle at the time, but it was quite clear that we had to have volume. Manufacturers told me that nothing under 10,000 skins would be considered a worthwhile run, and unless we had volume, we were not going to be able to get the skins onto the market.

          The emu skin has enormous potential. It is undoubtedly the best bookbinding skin in the world. It is a very soft skin that drapes well and therefore is also suitable in the clothing industry. The other product of great interest is oil. A mature bird will produce something like  10 litres of oil. The oil is very penetrating and it is suggested that as a subcutaneous carrier it will get through the skin perhaps 1&amp;half; to two per cent of a treatment, and that is probably 100 per cent more than is available at the moment. So it has enormous potential as a subcutaneous carrier of other medications and this, too, I believe, was never fully explored for the reasons that the industry was just selling chicks to itself.

          Looking at this ratite levy, I think the Emu Farmers Federation of Australia is again making a very foolish mistake. The markets for emu are basically the United Kingdom, Europe and Japan, and I see no suggestion that either of those countries is likely to use non&amp;hyphen;tariff barrier mechanisms to stop the entry. So I do not really see a threat there and I think they are foolish to involve the government. I notice the levy is set at 75c with a maximum of $5 per head, and they are wrong if they think that that levy is not going to rise. It will rise and they will find in years to come that the cost of having the government involved is a cost they did not need.

          It is quite possible for the federation to do random checking itself with a voluntary levy and, in my view, it is all that is needed to get the necessary chemical analysis of the meat.

          This is indicative of many people. They go running to the government for help when, in fact, they would be much better off doing it themselves. And I cite the efforts of Don Wieringa, the pioneer of human consumption crocodile meat. Don Wieringa used his own

           money to pay for research to try and eliminate salmonella from crocodile meat. Because of the nature of the animals, salmonella was very hard to eradicate from crocodiles—certainly in the wild it is always there. Through his own research, he came up with a feeding management program which eliminated salmonella from crocodile meat and, immediately, he was confronted with overseas orders which he simply could not meet. Interestingly enough, some of the big orders came from British Airways and Japanese Airways that wanted to offer it as a first class fare on their aeroplanes but would not do so while it had the association with salmonella.

           —I recently had an enjoyable holiday on the border of Mozambique—a fascinating country. Returning to the legislation before the Committee, I am not opposing the bill—it is the will of the Emu Farmers Federation. I just want to put on the record that I think they are making a mistake. Self&amp;hyphen;management would have been a much better role for them.

          I also think that the government could have done much more in helping to develop the potential of the skin and the oil. Some government funded research on the use of the oil clearly would have been enormously beneficial to the whole country. The government has failed to do it—unfortunately it seems to be the nature of governments to miss these opportunities. The industry now is a much larger industry in the United States than it is here.

          The ostriches, I think, have been somewhat better managed. Australia, of course, has a longer history of commercialising the ostrich than it has of commercialising the emu. Ostrich feather farms were in existence in Australia before the turn of the century. Most of them disappeared when ostrich feathers went out of fashion in the fashion industry. When you visit the South African ostrich industry, a lot of those feathers now are for things other than the fashion industry.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I might digress—emu feather is substantially different from ostrich feather. If it is stripped off the main stem, the feather has a lot of the properties of down for which, of course, there is an enormous market. I believe ostrich feathers too could have been commercialised to a far greater extent than has been the case.

         <para first-indent="16">
          As I said, we were exporting ostriches for the fashion industry but that went out of fashion—I was involved in actually catching ostriches for export to the world. The reason was that South Africa put a ban on the export of their ostrich. The ostrich used in South Africa for feather production is not a native, it is a hybrid bird, and the South Africans very sensibly were trying to limit its export. Those birds were, however, already in Australia and we exported them, mainly from a place called Port Augusta in South Australia.

          An ostrich is a much bigger bird than the emu and much harder to handle. We found that the best way to handle them was to mark the nest, collect the eggs and incubate them just

           before hatching. The company I worked for had a very successful business in this line. It was put out of business in 1960 by a very foolish government action which banned the export of all Australian fauna and left the company only with canaries and ostriches. This was not big enough to support the company. We had a situation where it was quite permissible to kill Australian animals but illegal to export them. Of course, that is a nonsense. But it is interesting to note that in all these years—some 37 years—we have never been able to amend that bill to get any commonsense into the action.

          The emu and the ostrich industries both have potential. They certainly have my goodwill. I believe that ostriches and emus are both compatible running with other stock. Certainly that is so with ostriches, which are in some sense amenable to the same sort of husbandry as sheep. The difference between the birds is that the male emu looks after the eggs during the night and the female during the day, whereas the male ostrich sits and hatches the eggs entirely on its own. I noticed in South Africa that there are quite a lot of people running stock sheep with ostriches, and I am sure that will be the case in Australia. I think it does represent a useful adjunct to our industry.

          —I support the National Residue Survey (Ratite Slaughter) Bill 1997 before the Main Committee today. As the previous speaker has alluded to, the ostrich industry in Australia has grown dramatically over the years. I have learnt today that the earlier development of the industry was purely on the basis of providing ostrich feathers for fashion; but, certainly, the ostrich industry today is one that is developing at a very rapid rate.

         I understand some of the statistics are very interesting, in that there are 2,008 ostrich farmers nationally. In New South Wales alone, in my home state, there are 450; and in the region that I represent, the mid north coast of New South Wales, there are 237. A couple of the leading ostrich farmers in New South Wales are in my area, particularly around the Hastings area based on Port Macquarie and Wauchope—and I talk of Steve and Janelle Gerke, John Pitkin and Howard Kerr, Kevin Gleeson, Peter Aitken and Peter Baber. They have some substantial investments in the ostrich industry.

         I know that this bill has probably been put together at the instigation of the Federation of Emu Producers or the emu industry; but, because it has to refer to ratites generally, it includes ostriches as well. I probably agree to a certain extent with the sentiments of the previous speaker, that self&amp;hyphen;regulation would be better. It is interesting to note that the emu federation has come to the government and asked the government to organise the collection of this levy, because it has been self&amp;hyphen;regulation all the way as far as the ostrich industry is concerned, I understand. That has worked relatively well, particularly through the R&amp;D phase.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As the industry has developed, it has grown beyond that, particularly in recent months, to the size it is now. A number of test slaughters have been undertaken; the meat that is being produced from the ostriches is being well and truly accepted; and, certainly, the by&amp;hyphen;products of feather and leather are also very popular.

         At the moment there are throughout Australia nine plants that process ostriches, and they include four export accredited plants.

         The Ostrich Association expects that there will be 12,000 birds processed this year and 20,000 in 1998. That gives you an idea of the size that the industry has developed itself to. I highlight the point that it has done this in a self&amp;hyphen;regulatory manner as far as the development of the industry and the development of the export mechanisms go. I will come to the point about quarantine inspection within ports of developmental stock in a minute, and the role that AQIS has played in that.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I want to highlight a couple of other important elements of the industry. Australia leads the way in meat development through the Australian Ostrich Company, which is the commercial arm of the Ostrich Association, and has developed a meat description language that will become the basis of international meat language for ostrich meat. If that gets set in place and becomes universal—particularly if it becomes the single universal language across Australia—then they will be leading the beef industry, which at this stage still has not achieved the goal of setting a nationally accepted and universal grading system for the beef industry—a goal that this government is working towards.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The industry is also at the forefront of developing, through R&amp;D, opportunities for the leather that is processed from the industry. Recently, Australian Exotic Leathers and the AOC secured a contract for providing 1,000 Australian farmed and tanned hides per month to Japan.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So the industry is going extremely well. It has, as I said, put in the hard yards to date. It has been going through the developmental stages, and all under self&amp;hyphen;regulation as far as that is concerned.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The spirit of what this bill is trying to achieve is important—as you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, representing a rural electorate. There are more than just tariff type trade barriers around the world. Again, I accept the comments of the previous speaker, the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), that at this stage there are no indications that these are being applied in any of the countries that we export ostrich or ratite product to, but we need to be ahead of the game in that regard.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill allows the imposition of the levy on all ratites. At the moment, it is set at 75c per head, with the opportunity to increase it to $5 per head. Ultimately it would be in the interests of everybody if that became a self&amp;hyphen;regulatory process, and that will probably happen.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But, as previous speakers have indicated, the government has been asked to initiate this. A lot of the areas involving the development of industry and services in Australia require government initiation ultimately, with the responsibilities then being handed over to the industry. For instance, the government is in the process of doing that with the beef industry at the moment. So that in itself is important. If the ratite industry generally accepts the spirit of what is being done here and works with it in a professional manner, then we are going to see the development of a very important export industry.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I said earlier that I wanted to make some comments on the involvement AQIS has had in the development of this industry to date. The member for Kalgoorlie alluded to the fact that no birds were allowed to be exported out of South Africa. Most of the breeding stock in Australia, I understand, originally came from Canada, and we cannot import from the United States. All breeding stock are implanted with a microchip so they can  track where those birds have come from and what the history of those birds is.
        </para>
        <break page="4347" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          I have worked with one of my local breeders, Kevin Gleeson. In conjunction with other breeders, he has been a major importer of breeding stock and a major player in developing the ostrich industry in Australia. I think we should recognise that fact—bearing in mind the terms we have discussed, the size this industry is going to be and the export income it is going to develop for Australia.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I know that in recent years Kevin Gleeson had a great deal of trouble with a shipment of imported birds coming from Canada through the quarantine station on the Cocos Islands. I undertook to conduct a bit of research into why—and I do not think we ever got to the bottom of it—there was undue delay in the processing of the importation of that group of birds through the Cocos Islands.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The birds went through the normal process of quarantine for X number of weeks but were held up for weeks and weeks and weeks on end. My understanding was that there was a concern, without justification and without documentary evidence, about the origin of some of those birds. Kevin bought all of those birds in Canada and brought them through the Cocos Islands on their way into Australia. AQIS seemed to believe at the time that the origin of a couple of the birds was suspect—that is, that they had come from the United States. My understanding is that that could not be substantiated and ultimately was not, yet the entire shipment was held up on the Cocos Islands—and this was a 747 aeroplane load of birds—and the cost to the importer was just unbelievable. It was tens of thousands of dollars extra.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I just highlight that example. I know there has been a review of the activities of AQIS, I know the government has allocated resources in that area, and I know there is going to be a refocusing and restructuring in that area. But that was just one example of an impediment to a fledgling industry that required an enormous amount of capital by way of investment in breeding stock. I thought that particular importer was being unduly impeded, and without substantiation speed bumps were being put in the way of him developing what he was trying to do in Australia.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          At the time, we put up the proposition that, if there were a couple of birds that they were concerned about the origins of, they could have held those back and let the rest of the shipment go. However, there seemed to be all sorts of bureaucratic reasons as to why they could not. I wanted to make that comment because we are discussing the ratite industry, which includes ostriches and the ostrich industry in Australia.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In closing, I support this bill. On the sentiments expressed by members opposite with regard to self&amp;hyphen;regulation, I imagine that that certainly will come in time. I highlight that, as far as the development of the ostrich industry in Australia is concerned, that has been the case, particularly with their research and development. In the case of some operators, like Kevin Gleeson in my electorate, the industry has developed in some isolated cases despite government bureaucracy and the hurdles that have been put in their way.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We accept that, because we are a safe and secure continent as far as exotic diseases are concerned, we absolutely need the protection of the Quarantine Inspection Service. All I ask is that, from time to time, it exercise a bit more commonsense and undertake its task in that manner. As far as the protection of primary industries in Australia is concerned, AQIS does its job in a very professional way but, because of the sheer costs involved, some flexibility must be exercised with regard to the ways in which it undertakes its duties. That experience would have sent a lesser operator broke. It was fortunate that the people involved had the resources to withstand the costs that were imposed by the decision taken.

           In terms of trade, we need to be eternally vigilant about what is happening with regard to the non&amp;hyphen;trade barriers that are put in the way of exports, as we do with trade in this country. It is an argument that cuts both ways. Debates are raging at the moment about imported salmon and imported chicken meat. That is exactly what we are talking about. We want to protect our industries from diseases, not from competition.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           I understand that other countries are going to want to do the same. If we have self&amp;hyphen;imposed quality assurance within Australia so that, as the product leaves, we can guarantee that there are no problems, then we may not face the hurdles which these export industries develop. With those words, I support the bill.

          —I address the National Residue Survey (Ratite Slaughter) Levy Bill 1997. People are getting used to seeing a number of big birds as they drive around Tasmania. The development of these birds comes from farming—as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker—being more innovative and needing to raise income from things other than the traditional ways of farming because of the pressure of prices on some of the traditional incomes.

         Instead of just seeing sheep and cattle on the farms, some pretty strange beasts are appearing. In Tasmania, the deer farming industry is coming on. It has been around for some time and deer is a respected game food domestically. Many of us enjoy a roast of venison on Sunday in place of some of the more traditional meats. In my family, venison is now a traditional meal. And the likes of emus, ostriches, llamas and other such animals are now becoming familiar outside zoos.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In Tasmania we have a fledgling industry in ostriches and  emus. They have a very interesting future, if they can sort out some of the problems that they have. There is plenty  of scope to use the oil from these birds. It is very useful to find an oil that can be used for a number of purposes including cosmetics. So, as I understand it, there is potential there but there are still a lot of issues to be dealt with. I have read about the qualities of the oil but it is not yet at a total commercial situation. The leather of ostriches is very soft and we have heard others speak about this. It has a very good skin pattern and it can be used for fashion accessories such as handbags, belts and shoes. From what I have seen, it looks as though there are very good opportunities out there. I heard my colleagues speak about the quality that it gives to the binding of books.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The meat side of the industry is still in its infancy. There are markets but there are problems to solve first. This bill may start to help the industry gain access to these markets. The idea was put forward by the Emu Farmers Federation of Australia. The purpose of the bill is to enable a national residue survey levy to be introduced. This allows for a levy of 75c per bird, slaughtered, which will go to monitoring the products. This certainly will help in the development of quality assurance in the marketing of the meat.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          I am honoured to have a minister here listening to the rest of my speech. The main functions of the residue survey are to monitor and assess the levels of chemical residue in raw Australian plant and animal commodities, and to give domestic and international consumers confidence in the quality and safety of these products. Consumers worldwide expect a high standard of assurance on food safety and quality. Some markets require a residue monitoring program, managed by government, as a prerequisite for product access. Chemical residue issues can also be used as a form of non&amp;hyphen;tariff trade barrier.

          I believe that meat inspections in the future will certainly come down to a live inspection of residue within product. I believe the emu federation is getting in on the ground on this because there will certainly be a need in the future for those measurements. When we go into exporting to other countries, I believe that other countries will demand a certain level from us. This initiative by the emu industry has an important role in developing and maintaining market access for the emu farmers it represents.

Things are a bit hit&amp;hyphen;and&amp;hyphen;miss at the moment and the industry in my state is seeking some new directions. However, I can see some good marketing angles in a chicken drumstick being compared to an emu drumstick: `feed the whole family on one emu leg!'—eat your heart out, Colonel Sanders—or `one emu leg on a plate and you could feed the whole family; finger&amp;hyphen;licking good.' Just think of the marketing value in that!

          —who could run the pants off a kangaroo—because it may indicate that there might be a bit of toughness in the product. We would probably have to think of another angle for the marketing of that but I am sure that we will come up with something. However, it is a very Australian product. The emu, as is the kangaroo, is part of our coat of arms. But, by the same token, it is a very farmable animal and totally adaptable to the environment. The kangaroo, the emu, and some other species that breed quickly, and are plentiful, can be nicely adapted for farming. They have had plenty of time to become fully adapted to Australian conditions and would be immune to many of the diseases that affect introduced species.

         <para first-indent="16">
          There was a report in 1993 that pointed out the possibilities of farming our native animals, rather than treating them as farm pests. The funds raised by the levy will be directed back into  the industry for further development. Therefore it will be of direct benefit to the growers. This has happened for a lot of other primary producers and those people have gained advantages in exchanges of information between growers nationwide.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Something similar may be necessary in Tasmania to allow growers to develop their own abattoir so they can take control of their industry. In Tasmania we have had some difficulties in getting an established abattoir to process the birds that we have in the state. People need to come together so that they can get on top of that, either by forming a company or a cooperative of members so that they can benefit from all the effort that they have put in. I do not necessarily think they always need a third party to control the killing and the shipping. They could take some control of this themselves and they would be able to direct the industry's future themselves.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I am excited about the possibilities here and I know that, with a little more work, there could be links developed with other growers to pool their energies in marketing and also in export. Only last Saturday I was addressing the deer farmers in my electorate, talking about the potential opportunities we need in relation to transport, and looking at the needs they have that need to be developed and the links that need to be put in place for that.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I think this bill will achieve what it set out to do:  give opportunity for new industries which are emerging; give them protection in the export arena when they are dealing with other countries and access points; and give international consumers confidence in the quality and the safety of the product. I believe that, in the long term, this will be beneficial to the industry and to the growers that are in it. I wish them well in the long term.

         Concern about chemical residues in food is an increasingly important issue worldwide, as consumers expect a high standard of assurance about food safety and quality. Real or perceived public health issues, such as those involving residues in food, can rapidly alter product consumption patterns and disrupt domestic and international markets for primary products. By providing an independent and authoritative assessment of the residue status of Australian ratite products, the national residue survey puts residue issues in perspective and dispels or averts speculation about the safety of Australian food commodities.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Chemical residue issues also form the basis for non&amp;hyphen;trade barriers against our primary products. I notice there were some comments from the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell)  on that issue. Some markets require a residue monitoring program managed by the government as a prerequisite for product access. Other markets consider these issues as trade negotiations. The national residue survey, the NRS, thus has an important role in developing and maintaining market access for these important and developing industries.

         The ratite emu industry regards this mechanism as the best way to collect funds for its residue monitoring program and puts it on the most equitable basis. I commend the bill to the House.

           Amendments) Bill 1997, which are now proceeding through this House. The essential feature of the Wine Export Charge Bill 1997 is to introduce a charge on the export of Australian wines to support the export promotion activities of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. This is an industry driven proposal to support the promotion program of the corporation, as grant funding for the generic promotion of Australian wines overseas from state and federal sources is coming to an end.

         The compulsory export charge is expected to raise around $1 million per year, which will be used to fund part of the promotional program which will include the generic wine promotion, the wine labelling integrity program and wine export control measures. It is pleasing to note that widespread support for this proposal is coming from producers from within the industry itself. At the last meeting of the corporation, support for the proposal ran at some 96 per cent. That support was drawn from large producers, as well as the many small and medium producers who are very important to this particular industry. It is not always the case in rural industries that a proposal such as this can get widespread support within the industry itself.

        <para first-indent="16">
         This is an industry with a vision, and the key to that vision is the effective promotion of Australian wines in overseas markets. These activities are vital if Australian wines are to hold their own against strong competition, which is expected to come from producers in South Africa, the emerging producers in South America and producers in central Europe.

         If there is one exciting story in Australian agricultural exporting today it would have to be the Australian wine industry. If we were to go back only 30 years, Australian table wine consumption amounted to little more than two bottles per head. As I was raised in a low-income rural household, with my father being a teetotaller, the consumption of alcohol beverages was not a priority in our household. That was the time that we bottled our own ginger beer on the farm. My only taste of wines was of the fortified kind around Christmas  time when the sherries and brandies made their way to the table. As a youngster I used to scoot around after the adults had had their fill, making some very potent cocktails from which I suffered considerably later on. It was only in my teenage years that I became introduced to—well, I would not say an exotic alcoholic beverage in beer—

         The factors which have contributed to this growth have been the rising population and rising income levels of Australians. Wine is a particular product that is not so much price elastic in economic terms but income elastic. That is, as the income of the nation rises so does domestic consumption, and overseas consumption as well. Australia's long&amp;hyphen;term export performance in this particular industry is predicated on certain growth assumptions that we hope will be evident in overseas countries and major markets. That overseas export performance will be
         <break page="4352" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          determined by rising incomes in our major markets—the USA, Japan, the United Kingdom and Sweden.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another factor which has contributed to the growth in domestic wine consumption and production has been the postwar migration boom which has changed our diet and our patterns of wine consumption. Also, with rising disposable incomes, our entertainment and leisure patterns have changed considerably. Accompanying that change has been an increasing incidence of dining out and this has obviously stimulated the domestic consumption of wines.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are many other factors that have contributed to this burgeoning growth, among them being the fact that the Australian population is becoming increasingly health conscious and, of course, a good glass of wine a day puts a bit of the cream on the cake, if I can use that term, as far as one's health is concerned. The stimulus has also come from within the industry itself, which has been able to increase productivity enormously through the introduction of innovative processing technologies and with improved growing practices.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We are indeed a nation that is blessed with many natural advantages which have given us those competitive advantages which we now enjoy in certain international markets. Among those natural advantages have been the productivity of our land base and the availability of suitable land in Australia in regional areas of the nation for wine production. We have developed over time a very skilled human resource with a long tradition that goes back to the 1800s in wine production and processing. More recently, we have become world leaders in the production and distribution of innovative technologies involved in the processing of wines. We have established ourselves, not as a large player in the international export arena, but as an influential and significant player.

         The history of Australian winemaking goes back to the first European settlements in this nation. Wine production was introduced to Australia by Captain Arthur Phillip in 1788. The  gold rushes in the 1850s were accompanied by an influx of European immigrants. It was that influx which laid the foundation of the vines and the expertise on which Australia's wine industry is currently built. As I have mentioned, the wave of European immigrants after World War II laid a further foundation for the development of the industry which has taken place in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s in such a dramatic fashion.

         This industry is very important and critical to the development of many regional areas around Australia, including my own. It has been a significant stimulator of employment in those regions and a major source of investment back from the metropolitan areas into the regions of this nation. We are used to hearing a great deal about the drain of investment funds out of regional areas in the form of superannuation that is paid by the rural work force which eventually finds its way into the commercial construction industry in major metropolitan centres. It is very important for regional areas to have industries that attract significant investment out of metropolitan areas back into the regions. The dairy industry is one good example of that. In the debate on the Dairy Produce Levy Bill in this chamber in the budget session, many speakers alluded to the very important fact of that investment and the importance to regional areas for it to take place. The wine industry is another example of the importance of that flow of investment into regional areas. With the spectacular export growth that is predicted for this particular industry, we will see an ever increasing investment taking place in regional areas.

         The wine industry has contributed greatly to the growth of regional tourism and the job growth in related industries that service that particular growth. It is the linkage between the

          wine industry and tourism which offers great domestic potential. Apart from the consumption of wine itself in its various forms, it is the combination of these two particular industries that is going to deliver some very real benefits to regional areas.

         Let me put in a plug for the wine growing areas around Geelong because, historically, the Geelong region was an important wine growing area in the state of Victoria in the 1800s and 1900s. Disease, unfortunately, wiped out many of the older vineyards, but we have seen in the last 20 years a resurgence in wine producing activities in the region. I do not profess to be an expert in this industry, or in the production of wine, but I am told that the limestone soil formations in the Geelong region are ideal for wine production. Of course, with the general growth in domestic and export demand, along with the various techniques that have been developed in the industry to control pests and disease, this has stimulated the resurgence in the industry in the Geelong region.

         Many of the region's wineries are now household names among Australian wines, while others in the region are cutting the mustard very well in the export arena. I would like to mention a few of those wineries because I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, that as you go out to dine, not only in this fair city but in your own city and throughout the length and breadth of Australia, you might come across Idyll wines or wines that are produced at Scotchman's Hill, the Bannockburn wines and the Anakie wines.

         I am very impressed with the vision that the Australian wine industry has developed which is encapsulated in its strategy 2025 document. It also establishes a strategic framework for the  industry over the next five years, from 1997 to 2001. I would like to run through some of the objectives of this particular vision statement. It is very rare indeed within Australian agriculture today that you see an industry prepare such a detailed and comprehensive strategic plan that is going to guide its development, not only in the medium five-year term but right out to the year 2025.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The wine industry has identified a number of key objectives which it says will be important in the development of this industry. Those objectives are to enhance the image and reputation of Australian wines. I would say that that process is really under way, because internationally our wines are recognised as being very good wines in quality and very attractively priced.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am reminded of my first term in this parliament. A French delegation came to this parliament, we had dinner in Parliament House and served them some very good Australian wines. The comment that they made was not only on the excellent quality of the wines, but also the attractive price. Bottles of superb quality wine that you were able to pick up in Australia then for about $A15 to $A20 would cost you the equivalent of $40 to $50 to $60 in France itself. They really regarded Australia as one of the hidden treasures of the world as far as wine production was concerned. I think that was an extraordinary compliment coming from the French for the Australian wine growing industry.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another of the objectives that are listed in the vision statement is to entrench innovation as the growth driver of the industry's competitive advantage. I wish a lot of other agricultural industries would enshrine this particular objective in their practices. If there is one thing that is going to keep Australian agriculture ahead of the pack in the international marketplace it
         <break page="4354" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          is its capacity to innovate—not only to produce new products, but also to produce new ways of producing those particular products. We are a very innovative nation, and Australian agriculture is extremely innovative, but there are very few industries in the agricultural sector that have prepared a plan such as this and have enshrined that sort of objective in it.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another objective that has been mentioned in the 2025 vision statement is to enhance wine style in quality, purity, uniqueness and diversity. Another is to establish global leadership in specific branded market price segments. Interestingly, when you tie this objective to the plan this particular element does not come to fruition until some 25 to 30 years out. That is what I call real vision. Here is an industry that is prepared to look at its future 20 to 30 years out and set a strategic planning framework in which it will muster not only the human resources, but the productive and financial resources, to give effect to the dramatic growth which it expects over that particular period of time.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another objective listed is to capitalise on market growth opportunities by expanding industry capacity. What this statement touches on is the importance of enlarging that productive capacity as the first platform for really expanding the growth of exports and getting to that position where the industry is a global leader in branded market price segments.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another objective which has been listed is to extend the scope of industry participation in complementary business sectors. Here the wine industry is attempting to link itself to other industry sectors—that is, in the research and development areas, in manufacturing generally, in the construction of the innovative processing equipment it has being able to develop, and with the financial sector in providing the funds that are going to propel this development according to this plan, and with the tourism industry. Here is an industry that not only sees itself as an important player domestically in improving its production and, in an export sense,  in expanding its export opportunities, but also sees itself linking not only with other agricultural industries but with other industries throughout the Australian economy.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The vision statement sets out clear directions for the development of the industry. Over the next five years, there will be a period of rapid vineyard expansion. That will mean an expansion of the productive base, and that will set the scene for a growth in the value of production which is expected from the years 2002 to 2015. That will build on the brand strength of Australian wines and cultivate greater market share. The plan goes to the years from 2015 to 2025, when Australia will seek to establish brand leadership in certain market segments.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The eventual goal of this plan is to expand production to achieve some $4.5 billion worth of sales by the year 2025. That is an extremely ambitious program of expansion for any industry. But it is coming off the back of a vision; it is coming off the back of a collective will of the industry to achieve; and it is coming off the back of an industry that sees itself at the forefront of agricultural industry development in this country.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The wine industry will require some $5 billion to finance that expansion. Obviously, some of that will come from within the industry itself, but it will have to rely on investment from private investors and new entrants into the industry who are prepared to commit money for this expansion, and from financial institutions in this country which in the past have not been great supporters of new industries and those primary producers in industries that are not top of the shelf, as we say, in an agricultural sense and are not the big powerhouse industries like wheat, sheep and wool. Nevertheless, this industry is a significant one. In the past, it has not been adequately serviced by the financial sector. It is pleasing to see now that many of the
         <break page="4355" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          major banks are very keen to lend in regional areas because they understand that a lot of the innovation in Australian agriculture is being propelled out of the regions and a lot of the private investment is taking place there.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Many other rural industries could take a real leaf out of the wine industry book in its strategic planning. The growth of this industry is really reflected in the dramatic export performance which has been achieved in recent years. It has been quite staggering and it is projected to continue on its growth path. Australian wine exports are expected to double between 1996&amp;hyphen;97 and 2001&amp;hyphen;02. In 1996, exports were valued at around $471 million and they are expected to increase to around $896 million by 2001. That growth has been driven by rising incomes in domestic markets which have propelled demand and also rising incomes in overseas markets. It has been propelled by an expansion of Australia's wine production base and by the changing preferences in wines, moving from the fortified wines more into the table wines, in this country and overseas.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is a very interesting and innovative industry; one which is export orientated, one which has demonstrated capacity to innovate, one which sees itself linking with other areas of economic activity, and one which I wish other industries in this country would take heed of. This bill will seek to generate revenues to consolidate and expand the promotional efforts of this industry in overseas markets.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We are going to come under increasing threat from other excellent wine producing nations throughout the world—in South America, South Africa and Europe. The industry is going to need this generic promotion which is going to establish its leadership position over the life of this strategic plan in certain market segments. So it is a very important piece of legislation from that point and it has the support of growers from within the industry. I congratulate the industry for its vision, its export drive and performance. Let us hope that the great and ambitious targets that are set in its industry plan are achieved over the life of that plan.

It is a positive step forward because it is meant to take the wine industry forward. It is an industry that, as we heard the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) quite clearly say, is very competitive on the international marketplace, but is still one that Australia has positive direction for.

         The wine export charge is another piece fitted in the puzzle of the plan the Howard government has. To give due credit to the former government, they helped put in place this plan, particularly in relation to the wine industry and more importantly for Australian agriculture. The wine industry is dreaming big dreams at present and the plan portrayed under the wine industry's strategy 2025, where Australian wines will achieve some $4.5 billion in annual sales by being the world's most influential and profitable supplier of branded wines by the year 2025, is very visionary stuff.

         What makes this vision even bolder—and it will reap amazing spin&amp;hyphen;offs for the wine industry if it can pull it off—is that it will achieve it in a world marketplace where the total volume of world wine sales may actually drop, even though the world wine market will rise to around $69 billion in 2025 as consumers shift towards high quality premium wines. The shift will become not just a trickle or a trend, but a flood, and our aim is to push the Australian wine industry to be part of that.

         I want to come back to that vision because, with wine export figures exploding like champagne corks—export figures that would make any other industry sector weep, in particular, local agribusinesses—it is important that we have plans. It is important that we stick to those plans to obtain the best communal benefit. Figures like those for the 1996 wine grape harvest, which was the foundation for new records for the Australian wine industry, undoubtedly explain that enthusiasm, with record production levels and exports totalling a record 129.5 million litres in 1995&amp;hyphen;96, valued at some $470.7 million.

         That trend is complemented by the figures of the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which showed total domestic sales of Australian wine rising in the March 1997 quarter by 1.2 per cent, with exports over that period of 12.4 million litres, valued at $48 million. That is some 13.6 per cent more than the February quantity and an 8.7 per cent rise in export volumes from the previous year. In the calendar year 1996, exports totalled 148 million litres, valued at $551 million, with exports now accounting for over 28 per cent of the total Australian domestic wine production—a figure that the industry should be truly proud of.

But the key element of this bill is that the introduction of a wine export charge will ensure that generic wine export promotion stays.

          —I join with other members in supporting this legislation. As the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) explained in his second reading speech, the legislation is to involve the introduction of a charge on exports for Australian wine to assist in funding the wine export promotion infrastructure and program with the corporation currently funded by levies paid under the Wine Grapes Levy Act.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The introduction of a wine export charge will, in the Minister's words, ensure continued funding for generic wine export promotion. The charges are expected to raise about a million a year to fund the infrastructure and part of the promotion program for the Australian Wine Export Council.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Minister and other members speaking before me have indicated in this debate the very considerable success, particularly in recent times, of the Australian wine industry, and that is a success that all members of this parliament would want to continue to foster.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Perhaps, I could touch on a couple of very brief anecdotes and use them as lead&amp;hyphen;ins to a couple of points I want to make about wine exports at the present time. In conjunction with a number of senators and members of both sides of this parliament, I visited Taiwan in an unofficial capacity last month. One of the things that was very noticeable on that particular visit to an Asian country, as compared with a number of earlier visits I had made, was that at banquets and other occasions, wine, particularly red wine was very much present and very clearly being enjoyed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That was quite a stark contrast with previous occasions when it was always the pattern at a Chinese banquet of any sort that there would be fairly copious quantities of cognac or whisky—spirits—on the table. So, there has been, in my observation, anecdotally,—and I think it is probably supported by more systematic market research—a very significant shift in Asian tastes in terms of beverages.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other anecdote I have to tell is not quite as encouraging. Whilst in Taipei I visited several wine shops. In those wine shops I had to look very hard to see Australian wines. The wines that were being promoted at the front of the shops were French wines and some other European wines. Eventually, in a couple wine shops I visited, I found some Australian wine stuck down the back of the shop without any obvious promotion. I suppose that reinforces the need for some of the exercises that are proposed in this bill—although, there is a qualification on that that I want to make. I flew on Eva Air, a Taiwan owned airline, in and out of Australia. No Australian wines were being served, only excellent French and Californian wines. Certainly, anecdotally, there is a great way for us to go.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What troubles me about how that challenge in Asia is being addressed—the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) referred to it—is that Austrade and the Australian Wine Export Council currently conduct, according to their literature, generic promotional programs in the UK, Ireland, Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Scandinavia, USA and Canada. There are no Asian cities there. The literature also talks about distributors. The Australian Wine Export Council has offices in London, Frankfurt, New York and, under contractual arrangements with
         <break page="4360" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Austrade offices, in Vancouver, Toronto, Stockholm and Copenhagen. Unless my geography is a singular failure, there are no Asian countries there.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When one looks at the 1995&amp;hyphen;96 annual report of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation, and at the overseas visitors being sponsored to Australia, one can see that someone came in April 1996 from Thailand, some people came in June 1996 from Japan and a wine writer came from Singapore. But, overwhelmingly, the visitors that presumably were sponsored by the corporation to visit Australia, as part of the promotion of our wines, were not from Asia; they were from Europe or North America.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let us look at the overseas travel of staff from Australia of the corporation. In December 1995, the general manager travelled to the US and Europe. In January and February of 1996, he travelled to the UK and Europe. There were no visits to Asia. I do not know whether the corporation was represented in the last month or so at the Hofex exhibition in Hong Kong. I am told that that is the major food and drink expo in Asia so it would be very useful to know whether Australia was officially represented at that. If we were not, frankly, it is a disgrace.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The point I am trying to make is that not enough is being done in terms of the relative priorities in promoting Asia. The latest ABS figures I have show that Europe and North America are certainly more significant markets at the present time. On my reading of the figures, which I have done fairly quickly—I have not had any opportunity to do any detailed analysis—the rate of growth in both South&amp;hyphen;East Asia and north&amp;hyphen;east Asia is dramatically greater, admittedly off a somewhat lower base.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That would seem to me to add very considerable strength to the argument that in this new fund for generic promotion particular emphasis ought to be given to Asian markets, without neglecting other markets. If my anecdote is correct about the shift under way in Asian drinking patterns, the potential gains there are very substantial indeed. That is not to say that it will be easy. A number of speakers have referred to the very excellent 2025 strategy plan prepared by the industry. That strategy plan, amongst other things, makes the comment that industry and government must work closely to dismantle the prohibitive tariff and taxation regimes which prevail in a large number of Asian markets.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I have had a very brief look at some of those barriers. For example, on the information I have, Hong Kong imposes a 100 per cent duty on alcoholic beverages. Japan operates, and I guess this is common with a number of other countries, a preferential system of duty which very much benefits countries such as Chile, as a competitor. From this information, countries such as Chile are regarded as less developed countries and therefore have a reduced or non&amp;hyphen;applicable rate of duty applied by Japan. It seems to me that we ought to take up the particular observation in the strategy report about the need for aggressive action by both the industry and the government in Australia to ensure that prohibitive barriers or distortions of trade with Asian countries are addressed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         With respect to Japan, I think the benefits there are very substantial. I obtained from the library yesterday a press clipping from a Jiji Press service in Japan dated 28 November 1996 entitled `Wine imports growing at heady pace.' It said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">

         That reinforces the observations I made about Asian patterns. It goes on to say:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         France lead exporters with a 24.5 pct share of the local imported wine market. Next came Argentina with about 18.1 pct, Germany with 14.2 pct, Chile with 8.2 pct, Bulgaria with 7.4 pct and Italy with 7 pct, the authority said. Imports from South Africa and Chile have grown particularly fast, it said.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         Wouldn't you know it, there was not a single mention of Australia!

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another observation I wanted to make arising out of the strategy report that I referred to earlier was a comment about the competitive edge that the Australian wine industry has. Before politicians get too involved with self-congratulation, it makes this particularly important remark:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         State governments are seen as more supportive
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         In the context of the strategy plan it refers to a range of taxation and other measures that the industry wants government to address.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is a very salutary point to note in this particular debate because whilst all contributors to this debate want to see the industry flourish, we are being told pretty clearly by the industry that in its view, inadequate government support is a major threat to its competitiveness. That competitiveness, as other speakers have indicated, is absolutely crucial. We face competition from the traditional European wine nations, and there is a very substantial threat from South America, particularly from Chile, and from South African wines.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Whilst I endorse the remarks that have been made by other speakers in this debate, it seems to me that we ought to be ensuring that the appropriate bodies, the corporation and its offshoots, really put a little more attention on their marketing in Asia. We ought to be seeking more adequate explanations as to why Asia is not apparently receiving the attention that it would seem to deserve in that exercise. We ought to very much take to heart the comments of the industry in its strategy plan that government support is, in its view, still inadequate.

          —And no exports—I will gladly pick up the point of the member for Fowler (Mr Grace). It is a matter that I am more than happy to address, but he might care to bear in mind my statement that there was no tax on the wine industry in 1983&amp;hyphen;84, a position that had been proudly defended by my predecessor, the honourable Geoffrey O'Halloran Giles.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The industry had a vine pull scheme funded by the government. I freely concede that to the member for Fowler. But it also was followed in its recovery by a tax of 10 per cent, in spite of the assurances of the government of the day that that would not happen and, subsequently, another tax of 20 per cent.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am one representing an industry—the member for Fowler will be interested to note—who did not vote against that tax, because I thought it was impossible to continue to have an alcoholic beverage industry that did not carry some tax bill. I stand here and quite frankly say I did not oppose that measure. It is a bit rich for the member for Maribyrnong to come in here and accuse us of not doing enough when what the former government did was burden this industry with a greater tax load than it had ever known before.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The member for Fowler interjected, `And no exports', and he is quite right. The industry, facing a vine pull scheme and a government taxation measure, determined to do what it should have done decades ago: that is pull together and develop an export strategy. In many ways, no thanks to the former government and no thanks to this government at this point in time, the industry has put together an export package that, as previous speakers have indicated, is the envy of most other industries in Australia, particularly primary industries. That package has had a real export focus. That package has thrived because the industry pulled together. The success of that package had nothing to do with the former government and a great deal to do with industry determination.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is an irony that the member for Fowler has pointed out. The irony is that the tax went on and the industry thrived—not precisely what the government or the industry of the day predicted, but that was the end result. There is also an irony in the car industry, if I may digress, in that the government lowered the tariffs from 70 per cent to what is targeted to be
         <break page="4363" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          15 per cent, and the industry developed an export base that it previously had never imagined. But that is not the matter before the chair. The matter before the chamber right now is the question of what the wine industry does into the future, how it equips itself for the future, and what it sees as its likely export success into the future.

         Not surprisingly, every speaker has mentioned the strategy 2025, the wine industry's plan which is very much the result of their having looked at their targets, potential markets and production in Australia and said, `This is what we can do with the reputation we have developed over the last decade as an effective export industry in Australia.'

         The United States continues to provide a lucrative outlet for Australian wine with the average export price to the US of $5.21 per litre substantially higher than the $3.45 per litre achieved in the United Kingdom. Sales to the United Kingdom rose 32.5 per cent in volume to 74.8 million litres and 30 per cent in value to $258.2 million in the year to March 31.

         It is a quite unprecedented success story and the industry has wisely come to this government and said, `What can we do to in some way ensure that that success continues?' They have come to us seeking the opportunity to have a wine export charge levied against the industry and this government has agreed.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          It would be fair to say that the government's agreement did not come instantly. Not because we wished in any way to frustrate the wine industry but because of two concerns that the government had. One was that the export charge may not necessarily be supported by the entire industry and the other that the export charge could be construed as a tax being placed on the industry. But the industry has made it perfectly clear to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) and to the government that this is a charge that is supported by almost the entire industry and that they do not construe it as a tax. There is an opportunity for them to work together from one revenue base with an eye to expanding export markets.

         This year alone, the wine industry—a point I am sure the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) will want to make—will in fact generate something like $634 million in exports which is double that of two years ago and well on target to the $1 billion that they are hoping to reach by the year 2001.

         Much has been made in this debate by the member for Maribyrnong of what he saw as the failure of the wine industry in Australia to make any inroads into the Asian markets. He recognised the progress that had been made in the UK and more latterly in the USA but he was critical of what he saw as a lack of aggression on the part of the wine industry in getting into the Asian market.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What the member for Maribyrnong fails to recognise is that whether we are in fact dealing as he did, with Taiwan, or with Japan, much of the difficulty that Australian exporters—not just the wine industry, but Australian exporters generally—have with the Asian market is the whole question of market access. Market access is denied them because in fact the countries do not want additional competition in their wine industry. The reason that the parliament—and I emphasise `the parliament'—has stuck by the WTO arrangements, conveniently ignored I must add by the Australian Democrats and some of the independents, is so that the parliament will be able to offer to all export industries, including the wine industry, better market access. It is quite true to say that in the wine area, as in any other export area, we do not have a level playing field—everyone knows that. But in fact as a result of the negotiations over the last decade, the playing field is more level than it has been in the lifetime of the member for
         <break page="4364" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Fowler (Mr Grace) or myself. That is to the credit of the parliament. It is to the credit of the government that in opposition we did not criticise the then government and the steps they were taking to level out the playing field. I would be a little less acidic in my remarks if I did not have the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) now criticising us for doing the very things in world trade that we supported him in doing when he was in government.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The reality is that the playing field is not level and we do not have the market access we would like in Asia—the very point made by the member for Maribyrnong. But that market access will only be gained as we abide by the rules of the WTO and that is bound to mean that there are some countries with tariff rates higher than we have. We do not like that and we cannot negotiate our way out of it as the member for Maribyrnong called on us to do as the previous speaker in this debate. We cannot negotiate our way out of it because, even in the wine industry, we are barely two per cent of world trade. We need to bear that in mind. We are not the tail on the end of the dog. We are scarcely even the flea on the end of the tail. We have no leverage in world markets. The best we can do is negotiate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The WTO is part of that negotiating process. Much of the difficulty that the Australian industry has in getting a toehold in Asia is principally a result of the fact that we are not enjoying the market access there that we are in Europe and the USA. The risk we run when we want to modify the rules under the WTO that we have agreed to as a parliament is the risk of being denied the relatively free access that we have into the markets of the UK and the USA.

         The bill before the chamber is a bill that has been supported by the industry. That is significant because the big four in the industry—and we are not talking about banks now, but about Orlando&amp;hyphen;Wyndham, Southcorp, Mildara&amp;hyphen;Blass and BRL Hardy—occupy 80 per cent of the wine industry's production in Australia. There was a real concern that this bill might merely facilitate them and not the smaller winemakers. But the smaller winemakers have  indicated, by and large, their support for this bill as well, so the industry can be seen to offer an aggressive and cohesive approach to export market development.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The future of the Australian wine industry and, as a result, its capacity to generate export income for the Australian community depends entirely on the way the industry performs in the export markets. This bill is in place to facilitate that and I am pleased to support it.

I think that is a point that is indisputable. That activity not only takes place in the Lower Hunter region these days, but has also grown very quickly in the Upper Hunter, so the Hunter is increasingly becoming a major player in the winemaking industry.

         There is a very strong and undisputed link between the health of Australia's wine industry and the health of Australia's tourism industry. That is a link that is very important in my electorate. Towns like Cessnock, for example, which traditionally relied upon coalmining as its economic base, have increasingly come to rely on tourism for economic wealth and therefore for survival. So the very strong link between the health of the wine industry and the health of the tourism industry therefore means there is a very strong link between the health of the wine industry and the health of my local economy.

          our winemakers are exporting their heads off. Winemakers in my immediate area, like the Drayton family, the Tyrrells and of course the McGuigan company, have been very innovative and, indeed, very energetic in their approach to opening up new export markets for their family companies. Not only that, in the Upper Hunter we have Rosemount, which I think exports about 50 per cent of all wine it produces. So the Hunter is also becoming increasingly very prominent in the export industry.

         If the Australian industry penetration into international markets is to continue to grow, the industry will need assistance. This bill does provide that extra push. I am pleased with the bipartisanship being displayed on this issue—it is almost a little scary; you do not see it too often—although I note that the member for Wakefield and the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) have had a word or two to say to one another. I am sorry that I missed a large part of the member for Maribyrnong's speech. But there has been a healthy bipartisan approach and I am delighted to stand here and lend my support to this government bill.

          Strategy 2025

I recommend the document

         To move away from bipartisanship for just a moment, I could not understand why last year, in its first budget, the Howard government decided to simply chop the final payment due to winegrowers which was a compensation payment instituted by the former government to compensate for the changes in the tax regime as it applied to the wine industry. That saving to the government was only about $3.5 million, but to each of the individual winegrowers in my region, and in every other region around the country, it represented a loss of some $6,000—hardly the sort of incentive we are looking to give them at this particular time.

         However, I want to digress just a little and talk very briefly about one very innovative project in the pipeline in my electorate, and that is an attempt to run water through a pipeline from the Hunter River into the Pokolbin area. One of the greatest difficulties the Pokolbin winegrowers have is the lack of water which, of course, impacts upon their ability to increase their volume. The project is an exciting venture that is valued at about $8 million. Again, it is a scheme that does not rely on government assistance. It is proposed to be put in place through either a cooperative—comprising a number of winegrowers and, therefore, investors in the region—or the bankable option.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bankable option involves an outside investor. It is a more highly engineered scheme, and is a low risk but secure scheme. I recommend it to ministers of the government who, no doubt, will be asked to express an interest in it. I recommend that they give it their support in any way that they can. This is potentially a scheme that could have enjoyed assistance under
         <break page="4366" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          the infrastructure bonds scheme—the scheme that we have effectively just seen abolished and replaced by a scheme that relates only to land, transport and infrastructure projects. That is disappointing and I would have thought this was a very worthy scheme that could have fitted very nicely into that scheme that has just been abolished. However, I do ask ministers to look favourably on any request for assistance that might be sought from the government in relation to the project for the Pokolbin area.

         Once again, I am delighted that on this issue there has been a large degree of bipartisanship. This is a very important industry to Australia. It is a burgeoning export industry and a very important industry to my electorate. I am delighted that we see members on both sides of the House working closely together to ensure a healthy future for it.

          —The Wine Export Charge Bill 1997 is to introduce, at the request of the wine industry, a charge on exports to assist in funding the wine export promotion infrastructure and program of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. The corporation's statutory responsibilities include wine promotion, wine export control, the wine label integrity program, and determining Australia's geographical indications for use in describing and presenting wine. The Australian wine industry has asked that the bill be introduced because, as successful as the industry has been in exporting wine, there will be a continuing need for generic wine export promotion.

         As the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) said in his second reading speech, the Australian wine industry is currently enjoying unprecedented international recognition and is achieving rapid growth in exports. It needs repeating that, between 1985&amp;hyphen;86 and 1995&amp;hyphen;96, exports grew more than 10&amp;hyphen;fold in value from 11 million litres worth $21 million, to 130 million litres worth $471 million. While Australian wines may be found in many countries, Australia's major export markets are Europe, North America and New Zealand. An  indication of the rapid increase is that exports in 1996 totalling 148 million litres were valued at $551 million—an increase over the previous year of 28 per cent by volume and 36 per cent by value.

         The bill gives me the opportunity to speak about a wine producing area that has in the past obtained very little recognition. I am pleased to see, however, that over the past several years, this situation has started to change, mainly due to the quality of grapes produced and the quality of the special vintages of the area—quality that can no longer be denied. There are a number of well&amp;hyphen;known wineries within the Riverina, and the names may surprise some people: De Bortoli Wines, Casella Wines, Cranswick Estate Wines, Lillypilly Estate Wines, McWilliams Wines, Miranda Wines, Orlando Wines, Riverina Wines, Rossetto Wines, Southcorp Wines, Toorak Wines, West End Wines, Stanbridge Estate Wines and, of course, Charles Sturt University.

         I am pleased to report that the 1997 vintage in the MIA has ended on a high note, with the May rains starting noble rot running in late hanging semillon grapes. This noble rot will produce yet another line of sweet Riverina wine that has become internationally famous. While in the MIA a vintage of around 125,000 tonnes was hoped for, a lesser amount of 118,000 tonnes was achieved. This was still pleasing, given that it was a record vintage. According to the Wine Grapes Marketing Board chairman, Mr Gary Smellie, all the grapes were taken; most of the winemakers obtained the fruit they wanted; and growers obtained good prices for working hard to produce better quality grapes.

          In speaking of the New South Wales Grapes Marketing Board, I am pleased to see that its term has been extended for three years by the State Minister for Agriculture, Richard Amery. This extension has been welcomed by wine grape growers and it followed a review of the vesting powers of the board; but the government at the end of the day accepted that having a statutory authority in place did not disadvantage wine consumers.

          The Wine Grape Marketing Board has in recent years brought about harmony and stability in the wine industry during an unprecedented growth phase. Grape prices that peaked in the 1995&amp;hyphen;96 vintage—fuelled by international demand for Australian wine—were sustained and climbed to new heights during the 1997 vintage, due to winemaker competition for premium fruit. However, the 1997 national grape tonnage fell from an estimated 900,000 tonnes to only about 800,000 tonnes. This fall has created a scramble for grapes, especially premium whites and all reds, which were in very short supply. The problem for the Wine Grapes Marketing Board may come once more favourable seasonal conditions return across all grape producing regions, and there may be a surplus of unfashionable grapes.

I would particularly like to congratulate all involved in wine grape production, wine making and associated industries in the Riverina and throughout Australia, who add so much to the prosperity of our Riverina region and to the prosperity of Australia. I strongly support the bill.

        Consistent with Government policy, I look to the opportunity to use frequent flyer points to offset the cost of official travel wherever possible, and will continue to do so. The opportunity to redeem points, however, is restricted by the airlines' conditions e.g. not all flights have seats available for frequent flyer use, not all destinations can be reached using a specific carrier and their partner airlines, and there are `block out' periods by the airlines (peak times) when no seats are available.
