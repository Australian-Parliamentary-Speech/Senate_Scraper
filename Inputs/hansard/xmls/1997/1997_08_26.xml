Can the minister confirm that MBF have applied to increase premiums for more than one million Australians by up to $275 a year and also plan to introduce a $50 a night co&amp;hyphen;payment for private hospital treatment? Does the minister agree that if these are approved MBF customers face: two premium increases in eight months, costing families more than $275 a year; large excesses on most policies; a new $50 a night co&amp;hyphen;payment; and massive charges to cover medical gaps?

First, with relation to MBF, MBF's application is arrogant in the extreme, the method in which it was released to the public has been arrogant in the extreme, and it makes me very, very angry. This sort of arrogance can backfire. MBF should not assume that the government's approval is automatic, unlike the Labor Party, which rubber&amp;hyphen;stamped

         On the second issue of the private health incentive rebate scheme, you have never seen anyone happier than the member for Dobell, running around saying, `They have failed, they have failed.' How can they fail on figures that finish the day before they start? The figures that came out were for 30 June; the rebates were for 1 July. No&amp;hyphen;one will know whether they have worked or not until we have had two quarters to run it through.

         There are two real differences between the government and the opposition. First, the government is at least attempting to do something where you sat by for 13 years and let premiums go up 12 per cent a year on average. You sat on your hands and you let them go up. At least we are attempting to make a difference. Secondly, we are attempting to make a difference in the areas where you were incapable of doing so, such as in out&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;pocket expenses and informed financial consent—things that Labor health ministers wailed about but in the end were incapable of ever addressing. We have had the guts and we have had the intellect to try to find new ways of addressing these.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the end it will be some quarters before we know whether or not they have worked. The anecdotal evidence is quite good. The anecdotal evidence I have, which is commercial&amp;hyphen;in&amp;hyphen;confidence, is that it was the week beginning 27 June before new memberships started to come in. The figures that you are relying on are figures from 1 April to 30 June. So any effect that the government's incentives have had will come through in the next two quarters, particularly as the major effect will be on the drop&amp;hyphen;out rate, which is not something which happens overnight.

         You inherited a private health insurance system that had 61 per cent of Australians insured. When you left office that had fallen to 35 per cent. That was a direct consequence of your ideological objection to private health insurance.

          —I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question. Before the last election the coalition announced that upon election we would be introducing capital gains tax rollover for small business so that, when they rolled over a business or an asset in the business, they would not be liable for capital gains tax. It was one of those tax commitments which the government made before the election which it has delivered on time and in full.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have now gone further than that. In March of this year we announced a major extension to the rollover provision, to provide relief where the sale of a business is accomplished through shares, and another further extension, to extend rollover relief to the disposal of units in a unit trust.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Today I will be announcing the broad details of the way in which capital gains tax rollover relief will apply in relation to shares and units in a unit trust. It will apply to individual taxpayers not disposing of shares in the capacity of trustees. It will be limited to relatively simple structures: that is, multilayered structures will not be permitted. A capital gain on shares may be rolled over into shares in a company and a capital gain on an active asset may be rolled over in shares in a company.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It took a coalition government to introduce capital gains tax rollover relief for small business. It could have been done by Labor during its 13 years in office, but Labor chose not to. It took a coalition government to ease the burden of capital gains tax rollover, when we were elected in March 1996.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I regret to say that the Australian Labor Party has been trying to frustrate this improvement for small business in this country. The coalition government said that this rollover relief would be available for small business—up to $5 million of assets. It was the Australian Labor Party that in the last session tried to pare down the availability of this relief by including personal assets in that asset test.
        </para>
        <break page="6850" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          The Australian Labor Party is at it again. Another feature of capital gains tax rollover is to allow small business to roll over into superannuation upon retirement. That allows a small business person, who has saved in their own business, to roll over money into their retirement and get the opportunity of superannuation, which has been denied them. Again, I regret to say, the Australian Labor Party, in concert with the Democrats and the Greens, are trying to frustrate the implementation of this measure. They are trying again to penalise small business in this country.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Why are they trying to penalise small business? Mainly because small business people are not joining trade unions in great numbers these days. They are trying to do it again by the same technique of wearing down the assets test by including personal assets.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As far as this government is concerned, we have delivered our election commitment in full and on time—and gone further. We will not sit by and allow the Australian Labor Party its attempt to penalise small business in this respect. We will not accept those amendments. We intend to deliver that benefit, in full, to the small businesses of this country, which deserve it.

I would simply say to the honourable member that we are carrying out an orderly review of the tax system which is going to produce a new taxation system in Australia that will result in lower levels of personal income tax and will result in a business taxation system that will help take this country into the 21st century and to realise its potential during that century.

         The only people in Australia who are standing against even looking at reform of the tax system are the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party, instead of reforming Australia's taxation system, want to increase it. Instead of lifting the burden off the back of manufacturers, which is represented by the current system, they want to make it even worse. I invite the honourable gentleman to contemplate the contribution he could make to political debate in this country by persuading his leader to join the push for taxation reform.

         There are a number of studies that have been done since—interestingly, studies done by the former Labor government—that highlight the viability of this particular project and the economic merits that flow from it. One of those studies was undertaken in 1992 by the Australian National Railways Commission under the direction of the former Labor government. They had a study undertaken by Morrison and Knudsen, who concluded in their report made in 1993:

        <para first-indent="16">
         Let me explain to the House what has happened. Members will know that in March of this year the government announced that small business owners will be exempt from capital gains tax on the first half million dollars of proceeds from the sale of a small business if those proceeds are used to fund retirement—that is, provided net business assets do not exceed $5 million. That was the proposal.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Yesterday in the Senate the Labor Party, with the support of the minor parties, have made an amendment which will reduce the number of small businesses that can qualify for this exemption from CGT on retirement. We wanted the initiative to be based on net business assets. That is the approach that we used for the other capital gains tax measure, the rollover relief when you go from one business to another business. The one we are dealing with at the moment is when you go into retirement out of your small business.

         The first leg of this duo was passed by the parliament in June and came into operation on

          1 July. So we have the first part of this rollover relief in place under certain criteria. You have taken a benefit from something like a million small business people. Furthermore, because you have treated the second leg of this differently from the first leg, you have added for no good reason whatsoever a whole pile of complexity and red tape to what was a simple, sensible measure to the benefit of the small business community.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We have two measures which are now inconsistent. Even if some of you can see some rationale for what you have done, surely commonsense would say to you, given that the measure went through in June in a particular form, it is a nonsense to turn it around and double up the complexity by changing the second half of it. Then, when you look at the practical consequences of this, you see the inequity in it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Now we have personal assets included, and for most people that is their family home. If you have a business in Sydney and one in Geelong of exactly the same dimensions and exactly the same value but your  house which is the same in Sydney as it is in Geelong but is valued more, in one case you get the benefit and in the other you do not. There is no rhyme or reason that you should treat business people in Sydney differently than the people that you treat in small businesses elsewhere around the country.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Just for good measure, the Labor Party, which gave us a lot of complexity and red tape for small business when in government, even in opposition is piling on the red tape and complexity in the Senate while we are trying to get it off small business. If you are in small business and you retire and are looking for this exemption, you have to get a valuation on your home and a valuation on your car. You are in retirement, you are spending hours and hours on red tape for absolutely no reason whatever, except for the fact that the Labor Party in the Senate are basically trying to do all they can to prevent the government providing a benefit to the small business community.
        </para>

         That leads me to say one last thing. The only other possible rational reason that you would want people to value their assets,

          which has been rather starkly demonstrated by the Treasurer today, is that you have frontbenchers who are advocating death duties. How incredible!

          —The provisional tax uplift factor at the moment is set by a formula which takes into account growth in the economy and makes allowance for growth in income. I believe it is put in at the end of the December quarter. It is stipulated in the tax legislation. You just take the amount off growth in the past year and divide it by the quotient, and it produces that particular formula. For the current year it has produced the formula of six per cent.

You have to make allowance for both. By putting that formula in place, the formula always gives an outcome which is closest to the actual outcome growth in incomes overall—incomes in the corporate sector, incomes in the general sector, incomes through wages.

         The Public Service Bill is a fundamental reform that is part of the government's strategy in preparing Australia to meet the challenges of the 21st century. This bill already has been acknowledged as a great piece of legislation. I am very pleased to pay tribute to the honourable member for Flinders, the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small

         A central element of the government's reforms is the principle of merit. The principle is enshrined in the bill. It is now clear as a result of the draft directions, released this week, from the Public Service Commissioner that those directions will further support the government's commitment to ensuring that appointments in the Public Service are made on the basis of merit.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The directions of the Public Service Commissioner indicate that this will be done by opening the advertised positions within the Public Service to public competition and public application. Approximately 8,400 positions in the Public Service are advertised each year, and at present only about 2,400 of those positions are open to those outside the Australian Public Service.

         Therefore, under the reforms announced, an additional 6,000 job opportunities will be open to the general community. Under the commissioner's directions, advertised vacancies will be open to all Australians whether or not they are APS employees and, as a minimum, the opportunity must have been notified in the Commonwealth government

          —I thank the honourable member for his question. Consequent on the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996, the Commonwealth required medical graduates to undertake greater proficiency and training prior to getting automatic access to Medicare provider numbers. This legislation was subject to a great deal of misinformation and a great deal of anxiety on behalf of medical students and young doctors. In talks with young doctors and medical students, the greatest concern that I came across was access to further training. Because of this, the medical training review panel was set up last year. This morning I received the first report from that medical training review panel.

          There were three areas that I asked the panel to look at. The first was the number of training positions, the second was hospital training and the third was transparency of the selection processes into medical specialist colleges. On the first one—the number of training positions available—it actually turned out to be very difficult to find out how many training positions states and territories offered, but we do feel that we now have exact numbers. There are over 5,660 training positions of all years of training. They are made up of general practice, 28.3 per cent; psychiatry, 11.7 per cent; internal medicine, which includes paediatrics, 11 per cent; emergency medicine, 10.6 per cent; anaesthetics and intensive care, 9.4 per cent; surgery, 8.4 per cent; and obstetrics and  gynaecology, 6.2 per cent.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The trainees are well distributed around Australia with respect to states and territories. Looking at their population, 42 per cent of all advanced trainees in Australia are women. When you look to next year, 1998, 1,369 training places will be offered. Again, on a geographic distribution, New South Wales and Queensland are probably a little bit under and Victoria is a little bit over on a per capita basis. However, this is substantially larger than the 1,200 medical students who graduate and we estimate a little bit over the 1,000 Australian medical students who will actually be looking for advanced training. If you add to that all the overseas trained doctors coming through the Australian Medical Council exam, we expect that there will actually be about 150 training places unfilled next year. This is very different from the figure that was being bandied around of 400 to 600 doctors missing out on training places.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Looking at the hospital medical officers, HMO, working group, the medical training review panel has come up with very strong recommendations. It recommends that the first two years of training should produce well&amp;hyphen;rounded general training and that formal streaming should not occur until the third year of training. It also recommends that all postgraduate training should include at least one term of rural training and at least one term of community based training and that the first
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           two years should be adequately documented so that young doctors have greater mobility and greater portability of their training. We will now progress this with state and territories to see if we can take up all these recommendations.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The final thing the panel looked at was training selection into medical colleges. There is a great perception here that merit may not always be the only principle that is used in selection. A consultancy has been let to try to produce a series of model arrangements for selection and review of such decisions. We will use this when it arrives as a benchmark against which to judge Australian colleges.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          All in all, this whole process will result in more places being available for postgraduate training, new opportunities in rural areas, greater accountability in the selection process for medical colleges and a strengthening of family practice. I intend to table the report in both Houses next month. I thank John Loy and Bob Wells, who have chaired the committee.

          —I thank the member for McPherson for his question. Last year this parliament made a bipartisan commitment to firearms reforms, and that commitment was taken up by each state and territory. It was really a historic turning point for the country. The Australia&amp;hyphen;wide buyback campaign was introduced pursuant to that commitment and ceases on 30 September—in 35 days time. It is timely that we take this opportunity to thank all those Australians who have supported firearms reforms, particularly those firearms owners who have reacted responsibly and with commonsense and decency to the new laws.

         Detailed research into the campaign has been commissioned. I think all members will welcome the results. A national study, conducted by Newspoll in June and July this year, tracked the views and behaviour of 2,400 people aged 18 years and over. It was found that the level of awareness of gun laws remains extremely high. It was found also that
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          78 per cent of Australians are in favour of the new firearms laws with 56 per cent being strongly in favour.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The Newspoll research indicates that nine per cent of adult Australians, or approximately 1.2 million people, are currently gun owners. It indicates that Australians currently own 2.5 million firearms—that  is approximately 2.1 per gun owner. The fact that as of today more than 500,000 firearms have been handed in under the buyback means that the campaign has been extremely successful. In the course of that buyback, more than $260 million has been paid to firearms owners.

         Newspoll made an estimate that 12 months ago 45 per cent of gun owners—that is gun owners at that time—were in possession of what will at the end of next month be an illegal firearm. Of these, Newspoll estimated that approximately three-quarters have now handed in or disposed of their illegal firearms due to the amnesty and are no longer in possession of an illegal gun, though many of these remain owners of legal guns.

As far as my visit to Athens is concerned, what happened was that the European Union, in particular the European Commission, and also the Council of Ministers were holding a meeting in Luxembourg—I do not remember the exact date, but it was on a Thursday. I went to sign the historic joint declaration between Australia and the European Union. It is one of the achievements of this government that that joint declaration was signed.

The government has a deep concern about the possibility of war criminals being in Australia and is committed to the proper investigation of any allegations of war crimes. I am sure those views are shared by all members of this House. The allegations against Mr Kalejs are extremely serious.

         Upon obtaining and examining all the available material, the AFP will make an assessment in consultation with other law enforcement agencies as to whether there is enough evidence to support a charge under Australian legislation. If the matter is referred to the DPP, the DPP will then, in accordance with published prosecution policy of the Commonwealth, consider whether to proceed with a prosecution.

          It needs to be understood that the standard of proof in the Canadian deportation proceedings was considerably lower than that which would apply in a criminal trial in Australia. Accordingly, the fact that the Canadian authorities found that Mr Kalejs should be deported is not conclusive of anything of relevance to possible criminal charges in Australia under the War Crimes Act. As I said, the government is committed to examining any allegations. We will examine all possible avenues and ensure that the investigation proceeds in a proper and considered manner. I can assure the House that, if any action is able to be taken, the government will ensure that it is.

         The minister for health, Dr Wooldridge, in relation to this government's health insurance policy, said, `What we have here is an absolute winner.' According to this minister it is an absolute winner, when we have had more people leaving private health insurance in the last six months than in any other half year since 1991. According to this minister for health, he is on an absolute winner, when in the last quarter total health fund membership has fallen by 1,000 people a day. According to this minister, he is on to an absolute winner, when he and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) have approved increases by 30 health funds, increases which have already swallowed up most of the benefit of the tax rebate for ordinary families.

        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         Health insurance giant MBF yesterday undermined the Government's $600 million health fund incentive scheme by flagging fee rises of up to 15 per cent and a new $50 a night levy on private hospital stays.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         That is the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Daily Telegraph
         </emphasis>
         says, `$50 bed fee'—the introduction of the new compulsory fee for MBF members that dare to use private hospitals. What these proposals mean for the ordinary families and individuals that are members of MBF is that this fund is seeking to increase its premiums by $90 to $275 a year from 1 October. Remember that date, Mr Deputy Speaker; it will become very important to you later in this discussion. MBF intends to have these higher health fund premiums take effect on 1 October.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This latest increase, proposed from 1 October, which is now before the minister is in addition to MBF's increase last February, which was an increase of up to 15 per cent, an increase of $200 for a couple or a family. The increase in February and the proposed increase in October mean that, for couples and families who are members of MBF, they will be paying more than $300 extra if this minister approves the latest MBF application.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          So you can imagine, Mr Deputy Speaker, if you are a retired couple living at Coffs Harbour in your electorate or living in Box Hill in the minister's electorate, if they are members of MBF they are going to be more than $300 a year worse off; and they will only be receiving a maximum of $250 from the tax rebate. So those couples are already worse off because of the fact that this government has approved premium increases that have totally swallowed up the benefit that has flowed from the tax rebate.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I have to say we are getting some very strange signals from MBF—some very strange signals indeed. We had MBF's official spokesman saying just a few weeks ago that the government's policy had been such a success that MBF had been deluged by applications from new members. Let me quote from the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Sydney Morning Herald
          </emphasis>
          of 2 July:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          MBF's public affairs manager, Mr David Jones, said that the fund had received a deluge of almost 6,000 calls in the past seven working days, 70 per cent of whom had been high income earners wanting to avoid the one per cent surcharge.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">

         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          The nation's second biggest insurer, MBF, also had a record of people asking about private cover.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          The simple question we have for MBF is this: if they were deluged with so many applications from new members a few weeks ago, why have MBF now submitted an application to this minister for another dramatic increase in the premiums of that health fund? And why cannot the minister rule out today, at the dispatch box, any consideration of this increase if, as the minister claims and as MBF claim, they have had a dramatic increase in their number of members? The reason the minister will not rule it out today and the reason that MBF have submitted this application is that MBF act differently to what they say, especially around 1 July. While MBF say they have been deluged with applications for new memberships, they act as if things are getting worse.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We would like to know from the minister whether things are getting worse. Are people continuing to leave private health insurance at the rate of a thousand a day? The minister knows. The minister is getting the regular
          <break page="6867" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           updates. If he wanted to, he could pick up the phone this afternoon and ask MBF how many members they have today compared with 30 June, how many members they have today after they claimed that they had been deluged with applications from new members. It would be a very interesting test of this minister and that fund as to whether or not the claims they are making are true. Mr Jones said on 2 July that he had been deluged with applications from new members. He is quoted in today's
           <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
            Telegraph
           </emphasis>
           as saying this:

         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          Mr Jones said that rising health costs, ageing membership and the decision of young and healthy people to desert insurance were behind the premium rise.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          So a few weeks ago he was being deluged, and here we have a drought. What is actually happening? That is what we want to know from this Minister for Health and Family Services.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is not just the application for the increase in premiums that is causing concern. It is also the proposal, as outlined in today's
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Telegraph
          </emphasis>
          and the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Australian
          </emphasis>
          , for a $50 bed fee. So it is not just the premium hike; it is also this new proposed $50 levy for the first five days in a private hospital.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Let me tell the House that what is quite interesting about this new proposed bed tax—the John Howard proposed bed tax, if John Howard approves MBF's new bed levy—is that it is only going to apply to MBF's members in private hospitals. It will not apply to MBF's members who choose to be treated as private patients in public hospitals.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          While MBF will tell its members, `You will pay a $50 a day penalty if you are in a private hospital,' what MBF will not tell its members is that MBF will be significantly better off if its members use public hospitals rather than private hospitals. In fact, MBF pockets about $200 a day because of the subsidy that applies for private patients in public hospitals. John Howard's new $50 bed tax on MBF's members in private hospitals is all about making a mockery of this minister's health policy and making a mockery of this government's claims that their tax rebate was going to take the pressure off public hospitals. They claimed that the tax rebate would reduce
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           the cost of private health insurance, that that would increase the membership and that that would take the pressure off public hospitals. Yet MBF today are outlining a proposal that introduces a $50 penalty if its members use a private hospital rather than be treated as private patients in a public hospital.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Minister, you have got to try to explain to us why you will not veto this today, why you will not pick up the phone and ring MBF today to disallow this attempt to make a mockery of your claims that private health insurance is all about taking pressure off public hospitals.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          To add insult to injury, we get MBF threatening the government, saying that they would have to increase their premiums by up to twice the proposed levels if the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Family Services do not approve the $50 levy—the Prime Minister's $50 bed tax. So we will watch very carefully how the government seeks to deal with this issue, because it is quite clear that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Family Services are going to be held accountable for any further increases.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The reason we are going to hold them accountable is that the Prime Minister made an undertaking to the Australian people in Brisbane on 29 August last year. Let me quote from what the Prime Minister said in Brisbane last year:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          What I can tell you is absolutely likely and absolutely correct is that any increase from now on will have to be approved at a political level, and it will only be if we are completely satisfied that that increase is justified.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          That is what the Prime Minister was saying last August when he was giving us that commitment that there would be no further increases in health insurance premiums approved unless he was completely satisfied and they got the approval of the Prime Minister—all the way to the top.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In fact, what has happened is that today we asked the Prime Minister to tell us whether he stands by the promise of 29 August last year. It is a simple question: will the Prime Minister stay in the loop? Will the Prime Minister still have the power to veto proposed
          <break page="6868" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           increases in health fund premiums? What we got was a refusal to answer.

           —On this one, having given the unequivocal guarantee last August, he was unable to reaffirm it today. The reason he has been unable to reaffirm it today is that the man sitting at the table, the Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, has made it clear that his view is that the Prime Minister is wrong and should be rolled, and the Prime Minister and he should be taken out of the loop in approving private health insurance increases.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Why does the Minister for Health and Family Services want to get out of the loop? He knows that there is a further round of health fund premium increases coming. The reason there is another round of health fund premium increases coming is that this minister and his department have been writing to the health funds, lobbying them and making it clear that they should refrain from any further applications that take effect before 1 October—that crucial date I mentioned to you before, Mr Deputy Speaker. What is very clear is that in the months following 1 October there will be another tidal wave of increases in private health insurance premiums. That is why this minister has been desperate to extract himself from the approval process. This minister is desperate to try to ensure that he can absolve himself of any responsibility for future increases in private health insurance premiums.

          But the great tragedy of this is that this government has blown $1.7 billion on this failed health insurance initiative. That $1.7 billion could have been spent directly on patient care. It could have been used to keep 6,000 public hospital beds open for the next four years or to reduce hospital waiting lists and overcome the crisis in funding for our public hospitals. That $1.7 billion did not have to be money flushed down the drain, as

         <para first-indent="16">
          The second part of the tragedy of this failed policy is that, to raise the $1.7 billion to provide the tax break, the government had to slash federal funding for public hospitals by $800 million, it had to abolish the Commonwealth dental health program—costing $400 million—thus leaving pensioners and low income earners unable to get emergency dental care and it increased the costs of essential medicines for low income earners and ordinary families as a result of the changes it made to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. There you have it. The government, in wasting the $1.7 billion on this failed private health insurance incentive was forced to reduce federal funding for a whole series of public health measures, to try to allow this minister to escape from blame.
         </para>

          The minister's response to all these changes, when the PHIAC figures came out last week showing there had been a further massive reduction in the number of people with private health insurance, was to describe this result as being in line with expectations. There are 1,000 people a day leaving private health insurance, and this man says it is in line with expectations.

          —What an interesting little whinge from the opposition. I actually thought we might have some discussion on matters of policy, on matters of substance, but what we have had is a tirade of abuse against one health fund—MBF—and no offer whatsoever of any alternative nor the vaguest inkling of an idea as to what the Labor Party would do if they themselves had the capacity to be back in government.

         It is now fairly well known what the difficulties with private health insurance are. The first is that there has been a very dramatic shift over the last four years from people being treated as private patients in public hospitals to people being treated as private patients in private hospitals. That has increased costs to the funds. The second is there has been an adverse selection, in that the people staying in funds are getting older and sicker. The third is people are angered by out of pocket expenses and they are angered about not knowing them prior to going into operation. Fourthly, they get a large and unmanageable number of bills for hospital stays.

        <para first-indent="16">
         If you have a look at why we are in the position we are in, it all comes back to conscious decisions made over a decade. The shift from treatment of private patients in public hospitals to treatment of private patients in private hospitals was a deliberate decision made by the previous government in 1993 when they signed the last Medicare agreement. That is the biggest single factor driving health fund premiums today—a policy decision of the previous Labor government.

          going up 39 per cent more than they needed to  because of deliberate policy decisions of the previous government. If you have a free public provision of service and you expect a private provision of service to survive alongside that, the latter will need government assistance.

         Yet the previous government progressively abolished the federal contribution to the reinsurance scheme, cut the Medicare rebate for in&amp;hyphen;patient services from 85 per cent to 75 per cent and abolished the Commonwealth bed day subsidy. So not only were hospitals being treated less favourably but they were adversely affected, because people got a lower Medicare rebate and the hospital funds were expected to make that up. That increase, which led to a 40 per cent increase in premiums in just two years—between 1986 and 1988—pushed a lot of fit young people out of the system and left a much older, sicker population in it.

         The third thing is the large number of out&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;pocket expenses that people receive, or the so&amp;hyphen;called `gap'. This was commented on time and time again by previous Labor health ministers. Dr Lawrence, when she mooted legislation in 1994 and introduced it in 1995, talked about eliminating the gap. That was a complete failure.

         Although it was never said at the time, my department now tells me that in 1995 the estimates were that in two years time we would have 20 per cent of Australian doctors in contracts with hospitals. As of today, we have about 80—not 80 per cent; 80 doctors. About one&amp;hyphen;tenth of one per cent of doctors have been prepared to go along with Dr Lawrence's reforms, and the out&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;pocket expenses remain.

The fact is that we are attempting to turn them around, which is a lot more than any Labor health minister made any attempt to do over 13 years of office.

          The rebates are an important part of trying to stem the flow from private health funds. Whatever the shadow minister may say about them, there is one simple fact: for the majority of Australian families, premiums today are $450 cheaper than they would be if you were in government. The fact is that $450 is what your average family gets; that is how much cheaper premiums are today compared with what they would have been under Labor.

           against private health insurance.' You are going to have to say in this place what you are going to do with these rebates, because unless you are  prepared to say you will continue them, we will let every aged person know. We will let the 25 per cent of pensioners who have private health insurance know that, under you, premiums will go up $250 overnight; and then they will go up even more because they will go up $450 for families. More families will drop out and the spiral will continue.

          You quote figures on the last six months, but you conveniently forget to quote figures on the last year. In the previous six months, the drop&amp;hyphen;out rate was the lowest for seven years. If you look at the whole of the 15 months since we came into government, the drop&amp;hyphen;out rate from the private health sector has been 1.9 per cent.

Again, I admit that it is higher than I would like, but let me have a look at what happened in the 12 quarters under the previous government, starting from March 1993. How many quarters out of those 12 do you think we got a drop&amp;hyphen;out rate of 0.6 per cent or greater? In six out of 12 quarters the drop&amp;hyphen;out rate was the same or greater than what happened in the last quarter. In March 1993, the drop&amp;hyphen;out rate was 0.6 per cent; in September 1993, 0.6 per cent; in March 1994, 0.8 per cent; in September 1994, 0.6 per cent; in March 1995, 0.7 per cent; in June 1995, 0.7 per cent.

         The coalition spent 13 years on the opposition benches. They had 13 years to come up with a comprehensive strategy for health care, but they do not have one. The only strategy we have seen in the last 18 months has been totally ineffective. Basically the policy can be summed up as follows. Firstly, you take millions of dollars out of the public health budget. Secondly, you pour millions of dollars into a private health insurance incentive scheme. Thirdly, you watch and do nothing as these private health insurers continue to increase their premiums and effectively negate any benefit whatsoever from the tax rebate. This is hardly the sort of inspiring leadership which this country needs on the public health issue.

         In New South Wales alone, the Howard government has cut more than $134 million from health funding. On top of this is the $240 million cost burden borne by New South Wales public hospitals as a result of the fall in the number of people taking out private health insurance. The total cuts to New South Wales are $374 million. So if you want to know the difference in approach to health care between that of Labor and the conservatives, have a look at what the federal government has done with regard to public health funding in New South Wales and compare that with what New South Wales Labor in government has done through Bob Carr and Andrew Refshauge. In New South Wales, in spite of these cuts, the state government have increased funding for the public health system by $805 million over three years.

The fact of the matter is that this government has no commitment to the public health system in this country. We need to remember that, in 1982, two million Australians had no health cover at all. This was a result of this Prime Minister, when he was Treasurer in 1976, presiding over the abolition of Medibank and its provision of free health care for all Australians. In 1984 the same person, John Howard, voted against the introduction of Medicare, which restored health cover for all Australians. In 1987, Mr Howard said—

He advocated the abolition of Medibank. He hates Medicare and he said that he would dismantle it. Just as we are seeing his true colours there, we are seeing his true colours on the GST.

         There was a real increase in private health insurance premiums from 1990 to 1996. Who was in government at the time? No-one other than the member for Dobell and the previous Labor government.

In doing so, however, they have ignored the wishes and needs of their own traditional constituency: decent hardworking blue&amp;hyphen;collar men and women and their families who recognise that our health care system has evolved from egalitarian principles and a strong health insurance ethic.

         In recent years, against all that is sane, Australia and I personally have been told by a succession of Labor Party health representatives that access and equity would in some way be threatened by financial support given by the government to the private health insurance sector. For example, in April 1992 Brian Howe, then the health minister in the previous government, said that private health insurance made `an insignificant contribution to health financing', despite the fact that at the time it was raising $3 billion when the Medicare levy was raising only $2.5 billion.

Under Labor, annual premium increases averaged 12 per cent. In fact, in July 1993 the then Prices Surveillance Authority estimated that 26 per cent of the increase in the cost of private health insurance since 1987 was due directly to the policies of the then Labor government. In other words, it was Labor Party government policy to increase private health insurance premiums by withdrawing all financial and political support from it.

In fact, according to Access Economics, 39 per cent of today's private health insurance costs are due directly to the policies of the previous government.

We were told that it was outrageous that people with private health insurance were being treated in public hospitals.

           —by leave—It gives me great pleasure to table today the report by the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs on its inquiry into greater autonomy for Torres Strait Islanders. The inquiry was referred to the committee in August last year by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator John Herron.
          </para>
         </talk.start>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The minister asked the committee to examine whether the people of the Torres Strait would benefit from a greater degree of autonomy and, if so, what form that greater autonomy should take. The minister also asked the committee to examine the implications of granting a greater degree of autonomy to those Torres Strait Islanders living outside the Torres Strait region.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Torres Strait Islanders, the traditional inhabitants of the Torres Strait region, are a special and unique people. Their culture has developed from ancient traditions and beliefs based on their island culture and strong links with the ocean. Their traditional culture finds
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           modern expression in Ailan Kastom, which forms a common bond between Torres Strait Islanders living on the islands and on the mainland.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Torres Strait Islanders have a sense of unity and strongly identify as a separate and distinct indigenous group. Not surprisingly, this has led Torres Strait Islanders to call for their own voice in indigenous affairs and greater control over the events which affect their everyday life.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The committee believes that Torres Strait Islanders should be granted a greater degree of autonomy. By greater autonomy, the committee means a greater degree of self-government and greater influence and control over policy and programs developed by Commonwealth, state and local governments for the region. Greater autonomy also refers to recognising and preserving the separateness of Torres Strait Islanders as a distinct culture.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          However, giving Torres Strait Islanders a greater degree of autonomy would not just be a political or cultural nicety. There are practical reasons why the people of the region should be urgently given a greater say in the decisions that affect them. For example, the committee has been appalled at some of the health problems facing Torres Strait Islanders. The region also relies on public sector expenditure and watches as the profits of the region's major private sector enterprise—fishing—go out of the region.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The people of the region need to be given the opportunity and the means to improve their situation. They should be given the chance to determine the region's priorities and ensure that services are culturally appropriate, efficient and effective. This will be done far more efficiently by Torres Strait Islanders themselves than by external agencies in Canberra and Brisbane imposing external solutions. The committee is sure that, with greater control over their own destiny and the day-to-day decisions that affect their lives, the people of the region will be able to tackle issues such as their poor health status far more effectively.

           excessive layers of bureaucracy. Aside from services provided in the region by mainstream Commonwealth and Queensland government agencies, there are 17 island local government councils, the Torres Shire Council, a state based indigenous specific organisation, a Commonwealth indigenous specific organisation and the involvement of ATSIC. These are all providing services to just 8,600 people.

          Many of these agencies have overlapping membership and overlapping functions, and some cross&amp;hyphen;fund each other.

          In response to these issues, the committee proposes a structure of governance and administration to deliver greater political autonomy for all of the people of the Torres Strait. The basis of the committee's recommen dation is the establishment of a joint Commonwealth and Queensland body to represent, coordinate and administer programs to the region's residents. The report calls this body the Torres Strait Regional Assembly. The committee believes that the assembly should replace ATSIC, the Torres Strait Regional Authority, the Island Coordinating Council and the Torres Shire Council, and undertake at least their functions.

          While the committee believes that the regional assembly's form would need to be determined by the local people in consultation with the Queensland and Commonwealth governments, the committee has set out a recommendation for the representation of the new assembly. The committee proposes that the regional assembly consist of an elected representative from each island and a total of five representatives from the larger communities on Thursday, Prince of Wales and Horn islands. The regional assembly will represent Torres Strait Islanders, Aboriginals and also the 20 per cent of the region's residents who are non&amp;hyphen;indigenous.

          The success of the regional assembly would depend to some extent on the funds made available to it. Funding to support services in the region currently comes from the Commonwealth and Queensland governments. Such funding should continue to be provided. Eventually, however, the regional assembly should receive untied grants from the Commonwealth and Queensland. The assembly should then decide how the money will be spent, although indigenous&amp;hyphen;specific funds would continue to be reserved for Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal purposes.

          True autonomy will not be a reality until the people of the region have a greater say over the funding priorities in the region and how these programs are administered. However, such arrangements will have to be negotiated with the Commonwealth and Queensland governments.

          One of the proposed functions of the regional assembly is the protection and promotion of the unique Torres Strait culture: the body of traditions, beliefs, art and practices which is Ailan Kastom. The committee suggests that the regional assembly establish a forum of elders from both the region and the mainland to be responsible for this very important function. The forum would act as a cultural council and a bridge between the islands and the Torres Strait Islanders living on the mainland. It would be up to the regional assembly to determine the council's duties and how it would carry them out. Nevertheless, the committee has made a recommendation setting out a possible methodology.

          I want to emphasise that many of the structural changes proposed in order to provide greater autonomy for the residents of the Torres Strait region are outside the Commonwealth's jurisdiction.

           The committee heard calls for Torres Strait Islanders living on the mainland to be represented in the regional model I have just outlined. However, because the committee has proposed a political model for greater autonomy in the region, the options for including mainlanders in this regional government are necessarily limited. Nonetheless, the committee has done its best to propose solutions to give mainlander Torres Strait Islanders greater autonomy.

           The committee is not satisfied that the current ATSIC arrangements for representing the interests of mainland Torres Strait Islanders are the best option for protecting and promoting Torres Strait Islander culture. The Torres Strait Islander population on the mainland is widely dispersed, particularly outside Queensland. It is therefore difficult for Torres Strait Islanders to gain ATSIC funding for their own programs and have an effective input into ATSIC policies.

           The Torres Strait Islander Advisory Board, as it is presently constituted, does not seem to provide an effective voice for mainlanders, particularly as it is only advisory. Some mainlanders feel that they do not get a fair share of ATSIC program funds, but this criticism is difficult to substantiate because of the way funds are disbursed. The committee notes that ATSIC is attempting to deal with perceived problems and has commenced an evaluation of the level of access to ATSIC programs and services by Torres Strait Islanders living on the mainland.

           Despite difficulties with the current arrangements for Torres Strait Islanders living on the mainland, the committee does not favour a separate commission for mainlanders.

           While the report focuses on greater autonomy for Torres Strait Islanders and the structures for facilitating this, it must not be forgotten that community control will be enhanced by improving access to mainstream services.

We hope that our suggestions will encourage other indigenous communities on the mainland to also develop strategies to increase their own autonomy and self-reliance. The goal is to give people greater control over and responsibility for the events that affect them so that they can enrich their lives. That, we believe, is no bad thing for all Australians.

          There are some 8,570 people living in the Torres Strait region and there are also 23,000 Torres Strait Islanders living on the mainland. The thing that I want to stress at this stage is that it is not practical for Torres Strait Islanders living on the mainland to have a separate national organisation. It would duplicate ATSIC's structure and be administratively too expensive to run. ATSIC has also recognised the criticisms by Torres Strait Islanders and is reviewing the way in which it represents them.

          I think both sides of the House agree with the principle of greater autonomy for people in the Torres Strait region. It is a question of how it can be properly achieved. What worries me is that some people's expectations have been unnecessarily raised. They will be disappointed. That is why, from an opposition's point of view, I signal that this report does not bind the opposition in terms of its response when the government does bring down a response to this report.

           Certainly, I think there are many things here that can and will be picked up readily by the government, but I see this report as a framework. Those of us on the opposition who have participated—some of us have not been to all of the hearings or all of the deliberations—do want to cooperate in this matter to give autonomy. But what the opposition will not do—I can say that at this time—is allow this to be used as a stalking horse to undermine, dismantle or disaggregate ATSIC. There needs to be a recognition that the Torres Strait community is a unique community. I think that they have genuine aspirations and I believe that those aspirations can be met.

Apart from that, I commend the report as being an excellent framework for progressing greater autonomy for the region.

         That said, I do seek some assurances from the government in relation to one part of the bill before us—that is, the very substantial package of amendments which have just been circulated this afternoon, the purpose of which is to clean up the Commonwealth-state taxing system in the aftermath of the recent High Court decisions in the Ha and Lim and Walter Hammond cases.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The response to that decision, which signalled a death blow for state business franchise fees on alcohol, tobacco and certain petroleum products, was for the states and territories to request that the Commonwealth helps them

        <para first-indent="16">
         These requests were duly made and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) announced on 6 August increases in customs and excise duties on petroleum products of 8.1 cents per litre, increases in customs and excise duties on tobacco of $167 per kilogram and increases in wholesale sales tax on alcoholic beverages of 15 per cent. The Treasurer has also announced the intention to impose a windfall gains tax to protect against refund claims in relation to business franchise fees paid but now declared illegal as a result of the High Court decision.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The amendments we have before us represent only one small part of a very substantial package of amending legislation necessary to implement the rescue scheme. As well as collecting the revenue on behalf of the other governments to make up for the shortfall, the Commonwealth has to ensure that the disbursement of these funds is equitable so that consumers and governments do not lose out.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is the aspect of the matter that the opposition could not help but be critical of, as have many others in the community including the businesses most affected. What has happened is that, notwithstanding the imminence of the High Court decision, the known date of its being brought down and the likelihood of that finding actually being made—certainly the possibility of it being made must have been in the contemplation of all those concerned—there does not appear to have been proper planning for that contingency.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The shambles that we saw as people scrambled to try to sort out a transitional system to enable the distribution of Commonwealth revenue to proceed on a basis that would restore the state collection system to the status quo previously existing has been all too apparent. A similar state of affairs was anticipated by the Labor government back in 1993 when an earlier case was heard by the High Court and a fully thought through and agreed plan was, as I understand it, pretty well on the stocks at that stage. Building on that base, one might have expected a better job to have
         <break page="6883" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        <para first-indent="16">
         I think the Commonwealth Treasurer has to bear a large measure of the responsibility for not being prepared, effectively, in cooperation with his state colleagues, to put the matter to bed. He should not just announce the outline terms of the rescue operation involving Commonwealth legislation but also be in a position to announce the detailed transitional arrangements to ensure that equity and good sense prevail.

         Having said all that, the opposition, being as fiscally responsible as we are, have not sought to dwell on this issue nor to cause any parliamentary difficulties with the passage of this legislation. I indicate that our disposition is to support these amendments, which were circulated this afternoon, as well as the rest of the bill.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What I do, however, is seek an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) about a number of matters which we foreshadowed in my initial public statement on 5 August, the day of the High Court tax decision. I said then that the opposition wanted to make it clear in principle that we would facilitate the passage of any revenue package which satisfied four conditions: firstly, that it has the agreement of states and territories; secondly, that it fairly distributes the revenue to the states and territories; thirdly, that it does not involve extra taxes being imposed on Australians; and, fourthly, that it is equitable in its impact on the businesses immediately affected.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would welcome assurances from the minister or, failing that, as usual, his parliamentary secretary on these matters. It does appear that we have an outline anyway—with the agreement of the states and territories. Presumably, the distribution mechanism contained in these amendments also has the agreement of the states. For that reason, it can, at least prima facie, be assumed to be a reasonably fair distribution.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is, however, the case that the states can find themselves in difficulties on these matters—and I will come back to this issue in
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          another context later on. I would certainly appreciate an assurance that the various petroleum, tobacco and alcohol shares between the states, which are contained within the amendments now before us, have been agreed to by all the affected jurisdictions. I would also appreciate information as to whether it is proposed that the  revenue shares used in the calculation of the revenue replacement payments are to remain constant or whether the intention is that those shares will be altered. If so, what is the basis on which that will occur?
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other matter on which we particularly seek assurance—although I appreciate this is more a matter for internal distribution within the states rather than a matter of distribution of the proceeds of these increases going back to the states themselves—is the question about the equity of the impact of these provisions and planned processes on the businesses immediately affected.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There has certainly been an intense amount of anguish between the different tobacco producing countries over the way in which, rather arbitrarily, the new basis for calculation of the taxation impost will have a differential impact between the three major producers. This decision is not based on any consideration other than a purely fortuitous new application of the legislation to products that are different by reason of the amount of tobacco in them, and so on. Commercial decisions made in the past, on the face of it, ought not to bear fiscal consequences as a result of the new arrangements that are being put in place.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I do not stop now to go into any detail on that particular issue or controversy, but it would be helpful in determining the opposition's final response to this if the government were to tell us precisely what the state of play is on this particular business equity issue and indicate what, if anything, the Commonwealth proposes to do to ensure that in the internal state distribution of these revenues that principle of equity is maintained.

          at simultaneously, but I do want to take this opportunity to comment on two broader themes which are directly relevant to the bill. One is the really quite deceitful and disgraceful way that the Commonwealth has managed its relations with the states since this government came to office. Secondly, I want to say something about the whole issue of vertical fiscal imbalance and explore whether it is as big a problem for the country as is often alleged and to look at what can and should be done about it. The issue of vertical fiscal imbalance is squarely raised by this bill because the moneys appropriated in it do represent a very large proportion of the so-called vertical fiscal imbalance phenomenon.

         Beginning with this government's management of its relations with the states, the bill proposes to implement the general revenue assistance measures agreed to, to use the English language in a slightly extended way, at the 1997 Premiers Conference. General revenue grants are of course the untied funds provided by the Commonwealth for the general use of state and territory governments according to their own priorities. These untied funds are provided for two purposes: essentially, first, to compensate for what was a takeover by the Commonwealth of the income tax base during World War II and, secondly, to fulfil the horizontal fiscal equalisation obligations of the Commonwealth—that is to say, to grant particular states and territories the additional revenue they need to be able to provide an average level of services without resorting to an above average revenue effort.

         Honourable members would be I guess well aware that when push comes to shove it is the Commonwealth position which is invariably `agreed' to at premiers conferences. The 1997 Premiers Conference was certainly no exception in this respect. In fact, it was even a little more grotesque than the normal run of these premiers conferences. The agreement, so called, reached at the 1997 conference did involve a reaffirmation of the funding formula that had been introduced by Labor; namely, that of real per capita indexation of the financial assistance grants pool of previous years.

        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          But the sting in the tail for the states and the territories was that they agreed—that is, were forced—to make so-called `fiscal contributions' to the Commonwealth in 1997-98 of around $627 million, building on an estimated $609 million contributed the previous year, 1996-97—that is to say, they are to have their funding cut relative to the real per capita arrangement originally struck by Labor. In order to appease to some extent the states and the territories, the method of calculation of the fiscal contribution will not reduce the base by which future years grants are to be determined—only the allocation over the three years of the agreement.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Notwithstanding this `fiscal contribution' for 1997-98 and that proposed for the next year, 1998-99, the Commonwealth has gone on to purport to extend the real per capita funding guarantee until 1999-2000. But there is a sting in this tail too because, given the reneging by the Howard government on its pre-election commitment to not cut grants to the states, which commitment has been massively breached as I have already described, the states are understandably very nervous indeed about the likelihood of actually receiving the amounts which have now been set out in the forward estimates.

          The impact of the so-called fiscal contribution embodied within this bill has already been felt by people reliant on services provided by state and territory governments. New South Wales had to increase taxes last year to make up for the impacts of the cuts. The legislation that was passed by the New South Wales parliament to achieve that was appropriately entitled by the New South Wales parliament the HAC—Howard and Costello—tax amendment act. Victoria did not increase taxes, but it did have to defer tax cuts that had been widely expected, so Victorians are still paying the highest state taxes of all.

          This $1.5 billion worth of contributions has had already a real negative impact on Australian families through either increased taxes or reduced services, or both. It really was an example, as we have seen so often, of the Commonwealth forcing the states to do its dirty work. The premiers and the chief ministers, understandably enough, objected to

           being ambushed by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister at the 1996 Premiers Conference when their fiscal contribution was `agreed' to—in other words, with their arms rammed firmly up their backs.

          That led to the interesting situation where the essentially conservative premiers actually told the world at large, in words of often not much more than one syllable, what they thought of the Treasurer. I think what has become known as `dog day afternoon' will be remembered for a very long time as a result. No agreement, it will be recalled, was possible on the first day. There was a real prospect of the whole Premiers Conference having to be abandoned. The final meeting to resolve the impasse was in fact conducted without the Treasurer being present. The Prime Minister had to do it himself as the state and territory leaders made it clear they just could not work with the Treasurer personally. The amount of time devoted to the Premiers Conference meant that the subsequent COAG meeting was an absolute failure as well. Nothing of substance was resolved, and the Council of Australian Governments process has been in a state of leaderless drift ever since.

          The 1997 Premiers Conference involved slightly less open warfare than the one the previous year. However, there was still real contention over the size of still more cuts—cuts of some 1.3 per cent, amounting to around $139 million—imposed by the Commonwealth on the states, this time to specific purpose payments to be paid in 1997-98.

          We had the incredible situation where this time the Prime Minister and the Treasurer were again at odds by giving conflicting advice about the size of the aggregate cuts in specific purpose payments.

There was genuine anger from the premiers and chief ministers at this further show of bad faith.

Maybe indeed it has had something to do with the lack of coordination and the general mess that seems to have been involved in coping with the High Court's decision in the business franchise fee matter that we have already talked about. What has happened is that the Commonwealth-state non&amp;hyphen;financial agenda has basically ground to a halt. Remember the grand plans of the new government to fundamentally overhaul the delivery of housing services? Remember the statements and announcements about plans to overhaul health services and education services? The results in all these areas have just been nonexistent. COAG has not met since 14 June 1996. The next meeting is apparently scheduled for October this year, but we wait with bated breath to see whether anything of substance will come from it.

          For a government that purported to be far more sensitive to the position of the states and territories, for a government which claims to be part of an ideological tradition of much greater sympathy to federalism and states' rights than has been traditionally associated with the Labor Party, it really has been a pretty disgraceful performance. The state governments have made no secret of expressing their preference for dealing with this government's predecessor rather than their so-called ideological soul mate. Therein I think is a very important message for this particular government and a very important message for the community about the quality of this government.

          The other general theme about which I want to say something is the issue of vertical fiscal imbalance, which as I indicated earlier is squarely raised by this particular piece of legislation, as indeed many others. It is true that Australia has a relatively high degree of vertical fiscal imbalance compared with other federations in the sense that the states in our federal system do raise, themselves, a lesser percentage of what they spend than by and large is the case in other federations. There are essentially two reasons for this imbalance. One is constitutional. It is the case that the constitution reserves most taxing power—
          <break page="6886" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           nearly all of it, in fact—in relation to goods to the Commonwealth. So that power is not available to the states, and that of course was the matter that was confirmed very robustly by the High Court in the recent business franchise fees cases.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The constitution has also been significant in the past, with the defence power in wartime being the vehicle through which the Commonwealth in fact acquired the capacity to in effect exclusively exercise income taxing powers. That is no longer the constitutional case in a non&amp;hyphen;wartime situation; but nonetheless the states, for all their complaints, have not been quick to rush to embrace opportunities to impose income tax themselves.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There are no other constitutional limitations on the state revenue raising powers. So the second constraint that has in fact operated over the years has really been straightforwardly political. The states and territories have deliberately allowed a number of aspects of their tax bases to erode by not being willing to take the political flak and endure the community hostility from continuing particular forms of tax or adding certain new taxes. I cannot call in aid constitutional reasons for that. It really is a straightforward political judgment. It may well be a political judgment with which one can sympathise, but nonetheless it is a political rather than a technical problem.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Much of the present vertical fiscal imbalance which exists is a product not of any technical incapacity for the states to raise revenue through income taxes or payroll tax increases or through property and inheritance taxes or through services taxes but of an understandable political unwillingness to go down that particular path. It is a point I have been making all week. It has been much misrepresented by the government; but they know perfectly well what I have said, because it has been very clear on the record. It is not a matter of me making any pronouncements about what the states should do; I have simply been stating what they can do and explaining that the recent High Court case has not fundamentally changed that balance in any really significant way.

         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

           The question I want to address now is how bad a deal for the nation as a whole is this imbalance that has emerged and been so obviously consolidated over the years. To what extent is this imbalance necessarily a bad thing? I say at the outset that I and the Labor opposition have a genuinely open mind at this stage on the whole subject of Commonwealth-state financial relations. As I said on the
           <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
            Sunday
           </emphasis>
           program on the 17th of this month, we should have an open mind about looking at ways in which the revenue capacity of the states can be enhanced and the rational distribution of taxes can be perhaps better guaranteed to the states. We do have such an open mind and certainly in the whole unfolding tax debate we are very willing participants in any discussion about these particular issues.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           But, that said, there are some arguments that can and should be put in the balance which do run against some of the received popular wisdom on the vertical fiscal imbalance question. I will take the remaining few minutes to spell them out. In the first place, it should be remembered and accepted that some level of vertical fiscal imbalance is in fact necessary and desirable, and that relates back to the question of equalisation. The Commonwealth provides an equalisation component in financial assistance grants to the states and territories just as part of the normal functioning of government. Those equalisation grants, as I mentioned in passing a few minutes ago, do ensure that all state and territory governments have enough resources to provide a general level of services to their residents without having, in some cases, to impose quite disproportionate levels of taxation.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           If there was not such an equalisation component, grants would be distributed on a per capita basis and that would severely disadvantage the Northern Territory, South Australia and Tasmania and also detrimentally affect Queensland. The Parliamentary Library has estimated that around $2.6 billion is the rough figure for the equalisation component in the grants in the bills before us now for this 1997-98 financial year. Without that degree of starting imbalance, without that degree of
           <break page="6887" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            flexibility, some states in our federation would have a very rough time indeed.
           </break>
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The second point I would make is that it should not be assumed that less vertical fiscal imbalance would be more cost effective for the nation. The main argument for the removal of the present degree of vertical fiscal imbalance is a general contention that it is better for sovereign governments to raise their own revenue as this leads to greater accountability between each government and its electors. Most people would not even stop to dispute such a motherhood sounding statement, but the real issue that has to be addressed in this debate is what is the actual cost of a state or territory being significantly reliant on financing from the central government. When you think about it, it does become apparent that the actual cost is likely to be either negligible or possibly even negative.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Why do I say that? Assuming that the states would still have the same revenue needs, there are really only two options of raising the revenue that is currently collected by the Commonwealth: either using the same revenue base that the Commonwealth uses or using a different base. If we assume, first of all, very generously, that the Commonwealth simply forgoes part of its revenue base and that the states enter that same base, using the same one, it is unlikely that they will be able to match the efficiency of collection which a single entity, the Commonwealth, currently achieves. Certainly it would be no more efficiently collected by multiple state revenue agencies than by the single Commonwealth entity. It just beggars the imagination to believe that that could be the case.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Alternatively, if a new form of revenue is to be tapped by the states, the collection and compliance costs will almost certainly be higher than from the forgone Commonwealth revenue base. More importantly, the economic effects of the new state tax, because of their more limited choice of tax bases, it being open ended basically what the Commonwealth can do, will probably be much more adverse than the Commonwealth revenue source that it replaces.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           So I am simply making the point that, measured in terms of costs of collection, costs
           <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
            of compliance and the economic efficiency losses associated with some state tax bases, it may be that the vertical fiscal imbalance is actually in some respects beneficial to the nation—certainly not the huge bogy that the states and territories always want to make it. The recent assumption, which we talked about earlier, of the collection of state and territory franchise fees now effectively by the Commonwealth does provide an example of where there may actually be national collection efficiencies derived through the use of the Commonwealth as a central collection point, even though, as I have also pointed out, there are obvious complications involved now in the calculation of the division of moneys back to the states and territories, in particular the equity problem as between the businesses concerned. We may get some interesting data on all of this in the fullness of time when the permanent Commonwealth measures are operating. Certainly it will be interesting to compare the comparative costs involved.
           </break>
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The third and remaining point that I wanted to make is that under current arrangements the major fiscal risks are in fact borne by the Commonwealth. Commonwealth revenue is more cyclical than state revenue; it does wax and wane according to economic circumstances. In a major economic downturn, the result is that the states are far better off under the current arrangements than under any more explicit, or more genuine, if you like, revenue sharing arrangement. In effect, the Commonwealth acts as the underwriter for the states and the territories when the cycle turns downwards. One thing the states will need to contemplate long and hard is whether they want the Commonwealth to abandon that particular role and the states as a result to be much more exposed.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           I repeat that, as the Leader of the Opposition and I have stated on several occasions, we are perfectly happy to have all these issues considered and debated in the general context of tax reform. Ongoing tax reform is something that every government should engage in and every opposition should be prepared to debate, and that is true on both counts for us. But whatever else that debate should be about, there should not be any question of its
           <break page="6888" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            being an excuse for the introduction of a GST. The whole question of  Commonwealth&amp;hyphen;state relations and vertical imbalance between the Commonwealth and states in their revenue raising capacity has absolutely nothing to do with a GST. Any suggestion that recent events in the High Court and so on operate as some kind of rationale for the introduction of a GST is a total misrepresentation. Indeed, I think one can make the point, ironically, that if a GST were to be introduced as a replacement for some or all of the states' indirect tax bases, then by definition the level of vertical fiscal imbalance in Australia would massively increase.
           </break>
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Let me finally say this: the real issue for the states and territories has always been the future certainty of their revenue sources, not so much how the revenues are formally raised. That is why we in the Labor government entered into three&amp;hyphen;year financial assistance grants agreements with the states from the June 1990 Premiers Conference where the value of the financial assistance grants pool was maintained in real terms for the agreed three years. At the 1994 Premiers Conference we extended that promise, increasing the FAGs not only by inflation but also by the increase in population. It was made on a three&amp;hyphen;year rolling basis.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           We have honoured all the agreements we made at those earlier Premiers Conferences. This government pretended prior to the election that it would honour the existing Commonwealth commitments, but it has reneged on them in the way I have described. At least $1&amp;half; billion has been ripped off the states and territories, which means that those most dependent on state services have been hurt.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           I conclude by saying that, while Labor is constantly decried as being too centralist, we have actually delivered far more to the states than the supposedly more sensitive federalist governments. One of the many reasons that this government deserves condemnation, quite apart from its performance on the economy and jobs, is its performance in relation to the states.

         The strength of our great country is the federation of its states and the will of its people. However, the national interest on issues of importance should always override state interests. However, the fact that states rely on the Commonwealth government for their funds when they could take over control of raising revenue themselves seems to me to be quite restrictive. A less centralised approach to government spending could ensure that each state could foster a more efficient approach to funding their services and their infrastructure needs. If the states and territories were able to take responsibility for more of their income, they would not have to rely on the health of the national economy to determine how they would fare each time federal budget time rolled around.

         Western Australia feels it gives far more to the Commonwealth than it receives back. According to information provided to me by the Western Australian government, Western Australians provide around $1.5 billion more to the Commonwealth in taxes and other revenue than they receive in grants, services and other benefits. In 1987&amp;hyphen;88, the Commonwealth returned 26.2 per cent of its taxes as grants to the states. Labor drove that down over the next period. In 1997&amp;hyphen;98 this portion is expected to be only 20.8 per cent—and that figure is from before the recent High Court decision.

        <para first-indent="16">
         If the Commonwealth provided the same proportion of its revenue to the states as it did a decade ago, grants to the states would be around $7 billion higher. Western Australia's share of this would be around $700 million. That would be an awful lot of primary schools in Western Australia—and in my electorate. In real per capita terms, under the previous Labor government grants from the Commonwealth to the states decreased by eight per cent over the past decade. Western Australia's grants have fallen 20 per cent. The Commonwealth increased its own spending in that same period by 21 per cent.

         Another concern in Western Australia with regard to the current funding arrangement is the states' ability to provide a range of services. Western Australia is one of the luckier states in that it has experienced strong economic growth—economic growth helped and supported by the policies of the Howard government. However, its funding has been reduced over the last four years, with no consideration—the Western Australian government says—to the increasing infrastructure needs generated by this growth. Yet the Western Australian government recently agreed to the rules required under the funding policies.

How utterly disappointing it was to come back here yesterday after almost three months in my electorate. During those three months I have walked down main streets of country towns to see empty shops and even more empty shops in some of the smaller communities; three months in which small country papers have run story after story about the scourge of heroin addiction and about unemployed kids who feel they have no hope in the world and so are better off smacked off their faces on drugs. I have seen the Berlei bra factory close in Lithgow and throw 184 women out of work because the company cannot compete here. I watched the growing despair of farmers who realise they are in the middle of another drought and who, because they are paid so little for their produce, have no savings to back themselves up. They are at the mercy of the banks, which are still charging ridiculously  high interest rates on farm loans. This is all background to my comments on this particular bill.

But, of course, it was wishful thinking. Instead we came back here to question time yesterday to see that the government had dredged up an old document to show that Kim Beazley once supported a goods and services tax.

Most of the cash they hand over when filling the fuel tank goes to the federal government in excise.

          —I rise to join this urgent debate on the States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill before the House. If ever further evidence is needed that the Australian taxation system is in urgent need of reform, then this is another example. This amendment bill is needed to rectify another anomaly that typifies another one of the strands of potential disputation in

         In addressing this bill before the House and prior to coming to the major thrust of the bill, I digress somewhat by way of background. In so doing, I refer to the state Labor Premier of New South Wales, the Hon. Bob Carr, and the state Treasurer, the Hon. Michael Egan, both of whom attacked the decision of the High Court whilst at the same time feigning great astonishment and surprise.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         They hit the airwaves and the media professing that the state of New South Wales was going to face imminent financial catastrophe as they had no emergency plan in reserve to pay out the franchise fees whilst awaiting rescue by the Commonwealth. I well recall my time as parliamentary secretary to the then Premier of New South Wales, the Hon. Nick Greiner, who was also the state Treasurer, and my subsequent service as the Premier's Assistant Minister and Acting Assistant Treasurer some four to five years ago.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I well recall the constant reminders and warnings by the state Treasury officers that state business franchise fees were being legally challenged and their recommendation that the state were to make necessary and appropriate provisions in the event of such an eventuality. These warnings were heeded and the necessary and responsible precautions were taken by the New South Wales coalition government—but not so by Bob Carr and Michael Egan, who have once again demonstrated their shortcomings and inadequacies as financial managers of New South Wales.

         The intention of this bill is to provide a safety net to protect the revenues to the states and territories of annual revenues of some $5 billion following the High Court's decision of 5 August 1997, which calls into question the constitutional validity of state and territory franchise fees. This bill also serves to address the resultant problems caused by the High Court's decision, which calls into question the past business franchise fee payments to the states and territories amounting to many billions of dollars.

          The Commonwealth will now collect what was previously a state tax through the Commonwealth's taxing powers—that is, all business franchise fees on petroleum products, tobacco and alcoholic beverages. Through these amendments, the necessary authority will be provided to the Commonwealth to refund to the states and territories the revenue collected by way of revenue replacement payments in the sum of more than $5 billion in 1997-98, in addition to the Commonwealth's weekly payments of general revenue assistance.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Resulting from the fact that state and territory business franchise fees vary substantially in their rates and coverage, and because of the fact that the Australian Constitution stipulates that the Commonwealth applies taxes uniformly, it will become necessary to do some juggling to ensure that no state or territory is worse off as a result of the High Court's decision on 5 August 1997. Additionally, excess revenues will be refunded to manufacturers or wholesalers by the states and territories to obviate the need for price increases for manufacturers or wholesalers. I note that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will be monitoring any price increases of the relevant products.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Another important aspect of this bill to note is the fact that the safety net arrangements are temporary and are to be reconsidered within the next six months or so. It is also important to note that it will be revenue neutral for the Commonwealth. The urgency  for the swift passage of this bill through the House is of paramount importance to avoid any further disruption to the state and territory finances. I am pleased to support the bill.

         However, as we all know this agreement was not reached without substantial compromise by the states.

         The engineering of these fiscal contributions by the Treasurer has ensured that the past practice of leaning on the states to shore up federal government coffers remains alive and well in our federation. This bill will guarantee that the appalling fiscal imbalance between the Commonwealth and the states and the loss of efficiency and accountability that goes hand in hand with it are further entrenched.

         One of the strengths of a democracy, and a federal democracy in particular, is that governments can be made accountable to the community when there is a clear delineation of power and responsibility.

         It is alarming to note, then, the changes that have occurred in state funding by the Commonwealth over the past decade. In 1983-84, general purpose grants to the states and territories constituted 6.35 per cent of gross domestic product. Ten years on, in the year 1993-94, Commonwealth outlays in this area had dropped to only 3.58 per cent of GDP. At the same time, the proportion of specific purpose grants allocated to the states has continued to increase.

         There is no question that a degree of centralisation is necessary to facilitate responsible and efficient government by the Commonwealth. However, the federal executive government has become more and more prescriptive in its direction of funds, which activity impacts directly on the states' political autonomy. Of course, the recent High Court ruling on business franchise or tobacco fees has cleared the way for the Treasurer to impose his will even more comprehensively on the other levels of government, if he so chooses.

          Although this bill was in the pipeline long before the fated High Court decision to abolish state government licensing fees on tobacco, it cannot be debated without bearing that particular landmark ruling in mind. If the states were stuck with an extremely thin tax base before the High Court's decision, that base is now looking near anorexic. Never before have the Australian states and territories been left so financially bereft. Never before has there existed a potential for the Commonwealth to exert such a complete stranglehold over the states by the administration of grants.  `Supplicants', `vassals of the Commonwealth' and `crippled dinosaurs' are some examples of the terminology being thrown around to describe the position of the states and that position in which they now find themselves.

          While reminiscing about the Labor Party's backflip on tax reform, it is worthwhile reminding ourselves of their abysmal track record on Commonwealth&amp;hyphen;state financial relations. This review is highly relevant to this debate in light of the recent High Court decision. At the 1984 constitutional convention, a subcommittee was formed to evaluate the provisions of the constitution affecting the states' fiscal capacity. In particular, the subcommittee was to look at the impact of section 90 of the constitution, that dealing with excise. The subcommittee's report was unanimous in its call for a redistribution of taxation powers. It noted that, amongst other things:

          The crisis that now faces the states, arising from the High Court decision, could have been averted if the former Labor administration had had the gumption to act on the recommendation of the 1984 convention. As it was, and for all it achieved, that talkfest was nothing more than another exercise in group therapy on a grander scale than usual. All this is yet another example of the calculated manner in which the Labor Party constantly undermined the ability of the states to raise taxes and fund their own programs, at least in part.

           Another example might be found in Labor's decision in 1989 to repeal the Income Tax (Arrangements with the States) Act of 1978.

Its provisions—and I am quoting from his second reading speech—state in part:

           Independent analysts have argued that the High Court's decision to abolish state licensing fees on tobacco means that tax reform generally, and a reform of federal/state fiscal relations specifically, is now inevitable. They argue that it is no longer a question of if, but when. But this will be of little comfort to those Australians who have been pushing for the reform of our inefficient and fragmented tax system for more than a decade, and probably even longer. Bandaid measures will simply no longer wash. There is a growing consensus that the Australian economy cannot survive this Mexican stand-off much longer.

Yet here we have a Labor opposition who quite happily will talk about anything they can to try to create scare campaigns and to try to walk us away from legitimate taxation reform. Where are they as far as looking after average weekly wage earners are concerned? Obviously, there is a lot left wanting.

         The fact of the matter is that the states rely incredibly heavily on the Commonwealth. In fact, the bulk of their funds comes from Commonwealth sources.

There are three categories—the special assistance grants, the special revenue assistance and the national competition payments. I will not deal with each of those in any great detail, but I thought it was important to state that for the record.

         There is a total of $16.8 billion for 1997-98 involved in this bill. Financial assistance grants are the largest category of the general purpose grants and are distributed based on the recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission according to a formula which maintains the grants in a real per capita term, making adjustments for inflation and national population growth.

         In Queensland there is always a lag effect. It has been a traditional complaint from Queensland, but it is a justifiable one—that is, the growth in Queensland causes the need for planning and then constructing  proper infrastructure to accommodate the forecast population growth. Likewise, the argument is—and I think it is quite a sound one—that Queensland needs a premium on their per capita allocation. It is a matter that a lot of the Queensland members continue to pursue with this government, as was the case with previous governments.

The completion of the Gateway Arterial about half a dozen years ago gave a route to the port of Brisbane via Mount Gravatt&amp;hyphen;Capalaba Road.

          What really is quite relevant—and ties this back into the debate before us here—is that there is an alternate route that is now available which has been funded, in part, by the monies that we are talking about in this bill. The alternate route is the extension to the Gateway Arterial called the Southern Brisbane By-pass. It hooks onto the Logan Motorway. They are both toll roads. That link opened a few months ago. After this massive investment by the Queensland state government,
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           you would think transporters would be using the route. The Minister for Transport and Main Roads in Queensland, Vaughan Johnson, did a very good thing in lowering the toll along this new route.

          I have to say that I think part of that is because the state government's signage is directing traffic onto Kessels Road. There are signs on the Gateway Arterial and on the South East Freeway saying `Alternate (no toll) route to Ipswich this way'. So here we have federal funds going into a major infrastructure project, which is very important, yet we still have this dreadful lag effect of traffic delays, problems and congestion encouraged by a sign of all things. So I have written to Minister Johnson to encourage him to pull that sign down. I think it is very important that he does.

          Worse still, a lot of trucks are finding that the traffic on Kessels Road—this federally funded road— is so bad that they are using Padstow Road at Eight Mile Plains, McCullough Street at Sunnybank, Boundary Road at Coopers Plains, Compton Road at Kuraby, Runcorn and Sunnybank Hills to get around the traffic.

I find it astonishing that even the state government does not have enough faith to use the new federally funded road infrastructure—after all, the pool of funds goes to the Queensland government and they spend it from there. The state government is not even using their own new infrastructure for their own trucks.

They can participate in it if they come in with an open mind rather than a scare campaign agenda. After all, in 1985 the taxation reform preferred by senior members of the then government did not take place. We ended up with new and demanding taxes and a more complex tax act, which went from taking up a metre or so of bookshelf to taking up half a dozen metres on a bookshelf. Each and every year taxation accountants have to update their knowledge about this system.

         This is a crossroads debate in many ways because it is a debate about whether Australia is going to go down the centralist road or whether we are game enough to try to claw back a federal system which is embodied in our constitution. The truth is of course that the Labor Party is totally centralist in its operation but so too is the present government, and there is no greater centralist than John Howard, the Prime Minister. In my view this is a dangerous phenomenon.

This would require some guts and integrity in the states which I see no great evidence of. But it is important for Australia. If the states have much greater freedom of operation, there is no doubt that some states will get it wrong and some states will get it right. The states that get it wrong will be forced to follow the example of those who get it right. If the Commonwealth gets it wrong, it will be wrong for all time. One can only say with all honesty that, if decisions in this nation in the last few years—probably in the last 20 years—had been made by a process of two&amp;hyphen;up, we would have been better off because we would have got at least half of them right.

          It is quite clear that there has to be a mechanism for the states to be able to independently raise money. This of course requires the states to accept a far greater degree of responsibility. I think the states were very foolish not to take up the option of clawing back income tax. This debate cannot take place, as many speakers have said, without consideration of the tax laws in this country. This has been brought on very much by the High Court decision. The High Court these days seems to be a perverse animal. It seems to delight in bringing down decisions that throw everything into disarray. There are people who would argue that the High Court has taken a legal decision in this case, and the recently deceased Mr Barwick would probably have agreed. But I think that argument is almost optional—after all, we saw a High Court in the old days give control of the offshore sea area to the Commonwealth. It was quite clear that the Commonwealth did not have a clue how to manage or control it and had to make the states agents for its management.

That is a danger, particularly when the rest of the world is starting to realise the dangers of centralism and is starting to try to move a lot of decision making back into regions—Australia goes blundering down the road to more and more centralism.

          When we are looking at changes in tax law, we really ought to be guided by the words of ex-Senator Peter Walsh, a former Minister for Finance in the Labor government. He espoused what I call the Walsh dictum, and that was this: all governments will always spend all the money, and mostly they will waste it.  The GST will give to government the power to incrementally increase the amount of money it gets out of taxpayers. It is nonsense for the government to suggest that it will lead to a lower overall tax. Everywhere in the world where this tax has been introduced, it has led to an increase in the tax taken—a total increase. There is not one example that I can think of where the contrary is true. Because a GST enables governments to ratchet it up slowly—half a per cent at a time—eventually governments will garner more and more money and that money will be garnered without any real accountability.

I suspect that I have paid more tax than Swiss Aluminium have paid. Certainly I have paid more tax than McDonald's have paid. Unless that is addressed, there can be no genuine tax debate.

         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          the Barwick family very well. Our lives crossed in many ways, and I want to take this opportunity, in being associated with this motion, to record some of them.

         It is perhaps little known that my father in fact stood for endorsement for the Liberal Party in Parramatta in the early 1950s and was defeated by Sir Garfield, as I think it is recorded in Marr's book, by 28 votes to 22. I suspect my own opportunity to serve in this House was very much rooted in the events of that time. The great figures in the Liberal Party were working to secure Sir Garfield's nomination. My father had been tilling the soil locally for a period of time and, of course, when Sir John Carrick and I think Sir William Spooner decided to come up and talk to everybody on the preselection panel the road was much more difficult.

         When I stood for endorsement at a later point in time, I was the subject of a very close ballot; I think it was 25&amp;hyphen;24. There were people working against me—I do not want to speak ill of the dead, but I think it was Sir Robert Askin—in support of Sir Nick Shehadie, who was the candidate who was expected to do well in that particular ballot. I put together a coalition of votes, but amongst that coalition of votes were four people whom I am reasonably confident voted for me to make up for voting against my father some 25 years or so before.

         In the period that I was the member for Parramatta and later the member for Dundas I continued to come across Sir Garfield in many of the activities in which he was involved in the period after he retired as Chief Justice of Australia. He was the Chairman of

I can remember as he was going increasingly blind and he was still in the chair he would come to meetings and be able to give perfectly lucid speeches about all of the activities in which the institute had been involved, to speak about its accounts, and in considerable detail. It was the same way he used to come in here and swear in members of parliament.

My wife would come home and tell me how he used to take the mickey out of them when they would all find quotes from Barwick CJ that they wanted to read.

          I want to make this point about the GST. The GST has a very high cost of compliance. That cost does not fall on government; it falls disproportionately on small business. The GST, make no mistake about it, is a tax beloved of big business. No doubt that is why the Liberal Party is supporting it—and I have no doubt that, in time, the Labor Party will fall into line.

          Regarding the debit tax, it is claimed that if all bank withdrawals were levied at the rate of 0.35c in the dollar, it would raise enough money to entirely replace income tax—if that is what you want to do. I suspect this figure includes foreign exchange transactions, which would not be there if you were to tax them, even at that rate. They themselves would be no loss to Australia, but the tax base would not be there. However, as a nation we deserve more information on this option. It behoves the government to lay the cards on the table and tell us just what those pros and cons are.

          Broadening the tax base is important. Apart from getting the multinationals to pay tax—which would clearly broaden it—getting people back in employment would broaden it too. Over the last 20 years in this country governments have destroyed the tax base which was available to the nation from import duty. We have lost that and, in doing so, we have also lost a lot of employment. So we have lost the tax base there as well. Government action has given us a double whammy of contraction in that tax base.

A lot of hype was talked about this. Both parties take credit for growth in manufacturing industry. It was a proud boast of Keating to say, `We have had 10 per cent growth in manufacturing'—bear in mind that manufacturing includes such things as aluminium ingots. Leaving that aside, yes, we did get a 10 per cent growth in manufacturing industry over a long period, but it was off a very small base. What the politicians do not tell us but what they also know is this: imports in that same category have risen by

          We have just had the Mortimer report brought down, and the government is waxing eloquent about it. Unfortunately the Mortimer report is totally in conflict with the Hilmer report. The Hilmer report is a very flawed document. Remember that Hilmer was put in place by Keating. He was writing to a format. What Hilmer has given us is high school economics. It is a nonsense concept. The truth is this: government departments can give you any return on capital they want. All they need to do is raise the prices or reduce the services.

          Introducing competition is often very counterproductive, and I think it behoves Mr Hilmer and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to tell us how the nation has benefited from, for instance, duplicating a glass fibre line across the nation, when one of those lines was more than adequate to carry the communications needs of this country for a long time to come, bearing in mind we also had the backup of the existing microwave system there.

          I find this talk of competition by people who have never done a damn thing in their lives and never gone out and earned anything in their lives a little galling. It reminds me of the early days of my entry into this parliament when, in the interests of competition, we decided all main roads contracts would go out to tender. The result of this was that we put main roads departments across the nation out of business. In doing so, we cut away the jobs of a lot of Aboriginal people. I suspect in some of those states—northern and South Australia, Western Australia, western Queensland and western New South Wales—there were a significant number of Aboriginal people working in main roads whose jobs disappeared. No one factored in the social cost of that. Did we get cheaper roads? No, we did not. Did we get better roads? I would say definitely not.

          So much for the nonsense. In the Mortimer report, which I think is itself fairly flawed, they go to great pains to say that they are not going to pick winners, which is exactly what

           they are doing. But they cannot even get that right. They tell us the industries we must have in Australia are industries related to science and computers and tourism. Tourism—and this should be remembered—means low paid jobs, part&amp;hyphen;time jobs and jobs for women and kids. It does not mean jobs for blue&amp;hyphen;collar workers. So what government has done is to create a situation where across this nation we have got the blue&amp;hyphen;collar worker out of work and his wife working part&amp;hyphen;time. Then we wonder why the kids are out of control. Nobody factors this cost in—least of all the rational economist—but it is a real cost being borne by society.

          Picking winners is quite easy to do. You pick winners in areas where you have a natural advantage or a strategic need. Take citrus growing, for example. We grow citrus very well indeed.

There will be no control on prices.

          Governments are paralysed. They say we cannot do anything because of GATT. That, of course, is cowardly nonsense. Why can't we impose in this country exactly the same regime as the Americans impose on imported orange juice there? They impose a rate at something just above 8c a litre, and that means that when the price is low it is a significant factor; when the price is high, it does not matter very much. We, of course, with our ad valorem tax, give the greatest protection to the grower at the time when he least needs it. That is nonsense and governments could improve on that. All it needs is the necessary wit, will and wisdom—which is, in my view, lacking from both sides.

We have abundant natural resources off the North West Shelf of Australia; they are absolutely begging for a chemical industry there. But an international chemical industry is not going to start there unless it can get some sort of assistance from government, because governments throughout the world give that sort of assistance. It is my view that assistance to
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           industry should be given in the form of capital grants. It is the most honest, transparent way of giving industry an advantage. Government can say: `We will pay for this much' or `We will install this much.' That way, I think we could get the chemical industry based on natural gas here. Once established, that industry will be there through the life of that technology and hopefully beyond, because if we do it sensibly we can make this country an absolute centre for this sort of thing.

          We have had a look at the sorts of industries that we need in Australia; let us have a look at what has actually happened. Four years ago this month we closed down, in Sydney, the last factory capable of making truck wheels, where the bearings go into. There is no country in the world that runs on wheels the way Australia does. We are a nation absolutely committed to transport; we need it for our very survival. Why did that company fail? It failed because a 15 per cent tariff was not enough to protect it from Malaysian imports. It was during the Keating years—if 15 per cent did not protect you then you deserved to die; and die they did. What happened to the price of wheels? Once the competition had been removed, up went the price of imported wheels and there was no way of stopping it. The rise in the price of those wheels has been far higher than the cost of the protection that was afforded them. The same thing will happen with orange juice.

          I can tell this House now that if assistance is not given to the citrus industry and the citrus industry fails, imported juice will replace Australian juice, the price will go through the roof, and we will never be able to start that industry again because of the lead times required. It takes seven years to start to get a profit off a tree. Those things are so self&amp;hyphen;evident that you can wonder why government cannot see them. It is my contention that government does see them. People in government cannot be so blind and they cannot be so stupid.

Something will go wrong and if that anger gets off the rails, you will have revolution in this country, all right. It will be a nasty revolution and it will be directly attributable to the acts of government, and the opposition—because, remember, they were the government for many years. I can tell you now that drugs are not the problem in Australia; paedophilia is not the problem in Australia. The problem in Australia—the problem which is driving people to desperation—is the knowledge that the system is unjust. They see Australia, which they know in their hearts should be the wealthiest country in the world, being driven into the  ground by government action. That is what is driving this despair. People in the country, people throughout Australia, want honest government that is going to give them jobs for their future and give their kids a future. If this is not addressed by government, if we play around the edges and pretend that these other problems are the problem to give the appearance of doing something, there will be trouble in this fair land and the blame will rest entirely at the feet of this house of parliament.

           Sydney Morning Herald
          </emphasis>
          by Paul Cleary on 9 August talked about a study by Professor Francis Castles of the ANU and Kerry Barwise of Treasury which concluded that, when it comes to raising taxation revenues, Australia is the most centralised federation in the world. While in the United States Washington raises something like 50 per cent of total revenue and in Germany Berlin raises 30 per cent, in Australia Canberra raises 80 per cent of total national revenue.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Not only is Australia the most centralised federation in the world when it comes to raising tax but also it is actually more centralised than many centralised states, like France. In fact, Castles and Barwise found that Australia was third out of all OECD nations, beating several countries which do not even have states.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The article went on to say that while the Commonwealth of Australia is centralised on the revenue side it is highly decentralised on
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          the outlay side. Their conclusion was that decentralised systems spend less on services like health and education. They found it to be statistically significant that, based on outlays, decentralised systems actually end up spending less because the levels of bureaucracy actually provide a constraint to the money being spent.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The article serves to highlight the fact that as Australia approaches the 21st century our federation is, fiscally speaking, in poor shape. Prior to the High Court decision of 5 August, the states were raising only 55 per cent of the revenue that they spent; Canberra supplied the rest. Now that the states have lost the ability to levy franchise fees on alcohol, tobacco and petrol, the situation has got worse. It is clear that Commonwealth&amp;hyphen;state financial relations need some reform.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is not a new problem. The states have been reliant on the Commonwealth since Federation and more so since they gave up their income taxing power in 1942. Malcolm Fraser, in the 1970s, offered the states some responsibilities and also the power to raise income tax. That power was never taken up by any state. In the 1990s Bob Hawke went through a constitutional frenzy and launched his new federalism to even up the imbalance between the Commonwealth and the states, offering the states a guaranteed share of revenue. As anyone who observed the period or watched some of the series like
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        <para first-indent="16">
         The High Court's decision on 5 August has highlighted that the states are now more dependent on Canberra than ever. Labor's response to that has highlighted how empty their whole policy on taxation really is. Gareth Evans, speaking on the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Sunday
         </emphasis>
         program, said that Australians were not highly taxed and that the case for fundamental tax reform was yet to be made. That was after the High Court had wiped $5 billion off the revenue of the states, which amounted to something like 15 to 20 per cent of their revenue.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Again, speaking on the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Sunday
         </emphasis>
         program, Gareth Evans rejected the notion that there
         <break page="6911" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          was anything wrong with federal&amp;hyphen;state financial relations. He said:

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The States can redress that (im)balance in a number of ways, not only through service taxes but through the old chestnut of property or inheritance taxes, through additional surcharges of income tax and, of course, through payroll tax which they've got already.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         What he is saying is that, although there is this imbalance between the Commonwealth and the state in what they spend and what they raise, the solution is not for the Commonwealth to rejig the balance but for the states to raise more money and to put on things like death duties.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is quite clear that there are problems with Commonwealth&amp;hyphen;state relations. The coalition have already stated that it will review the whole tax system and that any changes to the tax system will have to meet such criteria as leading to improved investment in Australia, enhancing Australian exports and enhancing Australia's jobs. They will also have a look at the whole issue of Commonwealth&amp;hyphen;state financial relations and they will examine the issue of a broad based indirect tax. Labor has ruled that out categorically.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We do not really know where Labor stand. If you look at Labor's record on a consumption tax they already have form on it. When Paul Keating, in 1985, went to his tax summit with a consumption tax proposal—option C, the 12&amp;half; per cent consumption tax—the only people in cabinet who supported him then were Hawke, Beazley, Evans and Susan Ryan. They believed in a consumption tax back then but they apparently do not believe in it now, although Gareth has said some interesting things. They believe that all that is needed is for the states to put on extra taxes like death duties. The bed tax would be another example of where they would like to see more tax raised by the states rather than looking at the whole imbalance between the Commonwealth and the states.

Road programs are a prime example of this practice: often one will find that local government, local council, state government and federal government funds will all be combined in a particular project—and that is a good process. The allocation of federal grants between state and territory governments, and sometimes local

         There are two issues I would like raise in this wide ranging debate about federal&amp;hyphen;state financial relations. The first issue is that, during Labor's period in office, we worked very hard to convince the states that it was not in the interest of all Australians, or of any governments in Australia, to be using taxpayers' funds, whether sourced from federal or state sources, to buy differences, industries or firms, from one state to another. I refer particularly here to the transport field. There it was common practice that, if one wanted to tender for locomotives or rolling stock to a railway system in a particular state, any tender originating in that state was likely to have a 20 per cent preference; so a tenderer from within the home state for the contract
         <break page="6913" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          had a 20 per cent start on a tenderer out of state.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The reality is that this nation's market is so tiny in toto, in world terms, that we finish up with a series of mickey mouse manufacturers—manufacturers of that kind of heavy capital investment industry—around Australia. This did not just apply to rolling stock; a whole range of state controlled contracts and  tenders were involved. Bit by bit, Senator John Button, the minister for industry at that time, managed to persuade the states that Australia's industry would be better overall by doing away with that practice. At the end of the day, those differentials, that additional price that a particular state would pay, had to be borne by the taxpayer, be they state or federal or coming through general revenue grants from federal government. But, one way or another, the taxpayer paid. That practice has gradually crept back in. Again we now see practices coming in where states are offering starts or advantages to firms to tender for state government contracts or territory government contracts within their own boundaries.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second aspect—I know the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) is very much interested in this because he is a man who has a very strong federalist view about industry in this nation, and I commend him for it, and I mean that sincerely, because it is in Australia's interest as we are such a tiny market—is one about which we will hear much weeping at the fountain by the states, as they bemoan the inadequacy of the share of federal, non-repayable, no strings attached grants that they receive.

         As I said, Solomon is between the covers of this report from the Grants Commission. You need to be Solomon to be on the Grants Commission to try to work out what the genuine relativities are and what the genuine disabilities are, both in revenue gathering and service providing across state and territory governments. But there is a major problem when taxpayers' moneys—as I have said, from whatever source—are used by one state or territory government to buy a firm from another state into their state by the offer of substantial financial inducements. Those
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          inducements take the form of revenues forgone, holidays from state taxes, transfer payments—and, yes, I am looking at the Deputy Speaker. I am speaking as an Australian with a federal view across this nation.

         There is a cost being borne by taxpayers, state and federal, for those inducements, be they by actual cash payment or handout to a firm, or by revenue forgone by the states. So it is very difficult for the states to stand up straight backed and look us square in the eye at federal level. Who or what colour the government is does not matter. But what does matter is that they stand up straight and argue with a straight face that they are doing everything possible to collect on a fair basis their share of revenue from within their range of revenue capacity. That is a problem that is increasing, as some states have disabilities. Also, it is a problem that is not serving this country well from the national viewpoint.

         I want to talk a little about a subject that I am deeply concerned about. It is a major flow-on of these practices and a number of other practices between state governments and the federal government. It goes to the core of federal-state relationships. I find it utterly repugnant and obnoxious that the tax burden in this country is being steadily moved across to those people who cannot resist the temptation to bet or to gamble. Those are the people that are the most vulnerable. They are the people that are the most gullible. They are the people likely to be influenced by advertisements several times a day that I see at home on television and I hear on the radio: `Put a dollar in and get a million.' `A dollar to play and a million to take away.'

         We know that is nonsense, but a lot of battling, struggling Australians are gulled by that. When you look at the figures on the growth of gambling in this country, you need to turn to the other side of the coin to see the people who are suffering, the suicides, the family break-ups, the social distress. Social leaders across this nation are appearing on television appealing to us—it is really to each of us they are appealing—and to governments, both federal and state, to have regard to the damage that is being done to our social fabric.

We are now at the stage where gambling and the expansion of gambling facilities are seen as being the growth industry of the nation. Victoria prides itself on how fast it can part fools from their money. Anybody who goes into a gambling establishment in the belief that they can come out with more than they went in with has to be a fool, regardless of whether they have a lot of money or little money. When you add to that mix alcohol and automatic telling machines, they are an even greater fool.

The 1995-96 Australian gambling statistics of the Tasmanian Gaming Commission—which is the best source of data for comparisons that I have seen, although it is not the latest—show that Australians gambled $72,871 million. That is an increase of $11,605 million in the previous financial year. To use the parlance, you can bet your bottom dollar that in the year just concluded, 1996-97, it has risen by at least that amount again. That is because the effort to induce or convince people they should gamble is even greater still in the year just concluded than it was in the previous year.

As the seconds tick by on the time clock, so the dollars tick by for the families that are providing that money. Much of the growth is the result of heavy promotion of gambling by state government agencies. Those massive losses being incurred by Australians are losses being incurred by Australian families, by kids and by mothers. They are often linked with alcohol.

In regard to state fiscal contributions, I make the general comment that it was the states who agreed to make the fiscal contributions to the Commonwealth for three years to assist the national savings task. It was not something which was foisted on them. It was an agreement between the states and the Commonwealth to undertake this task for the purpose of national savings. The Commonwealth also agreed to maintain real per capita growth in financial assistance grants. I underline that because some speakers have indicated that that may not have been the case.

          The opposition spokesman, the Hon. Gareth Evans, asked for some assurances in regard to a number of matters, and I just want to address some of those in the debate in the House. First of all, in regard to distribution of revenues among the states, state shares of revenue to replace payments were agreed among the states and advised to the Commonwealth. They were a state decision. The shares are based on Commonwealth Grants Commission estimates for 1996&amp;hyphen;97 on a business franchise fee revenue basis. The distribution will result in some states receiving more revenue than they previously raised under their business franchise fees, due to the constitutional constraint requiring the Commonwealth to apply taxes uniformly across the states, and the wish that no state be worse off as a result of the High Court decision. However, excess revenues are to be refunded to manufacturers and wholesalers in order to avoid, as far as possible, price increases for consumers and petroleum users.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The second area which the honourable member referred to was in regard to no extra taxes. The states acknowledge that this will represent a state tax imposed and collected by the Commonwealth at the request of and on behalf of the states. All revenue collected by the Commonwealth under these arrangements will be returned to the states, after allowing for Commonwealth administrative costs. The Commonwealth is not increasing its revenue—and I want to stress that: there is no increase in revenue by the Commonwealth in this matter.

         As announced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on 6 August, the Commonwealth has agreed to introduce safety net measures to protect state and territory revenues, following the High Court decision of 5 August which cast serious doubt on the constitutional validity of state business franchise fees. The High Court decision affects annual state revenues of around $5 billion and leaves the states open to refund claims amounting to many billions of dollars in respect of past business franchise fee payments. The Commonwealth will use its tax powers to collect the revenues that the states and territories previously collected by way of business franchise fees on petroleum products, tobacco and alcoholic beverages.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The states and territories acknowledge that this will represent a state tax imposed and collected by the Commonwealth at their request and on their behalf. The safety net arrangements are intended to be temporary and will be reviewed within six months. The proposed amendments provide authority for the Commonwealth to pay the states and territories a revenue it collects under safety net arrangements. It is intended that revenue
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          replacement payments, expected to exceed $5 billion in 1997&amp;hyphen;98, be made together with the Commonwealth's weekly payments of general revenue assistance.

         Some states will receive more revenue than they previously raised under their business franchise fees. This is necessary if no state or territory is to be worse off as a result of the High Court decision, since the Australian constitution requires that the Commonwealth apply taxes uniformly across the states, whereas states' business franchise fees vary in their rates and coverage. However, the states and territories have indicated that these excess revenues will be refunded to manufacturers or wholesalers in order to avoid, as far as possible, price increases for consumers and petroleum users. To ensure the safety net arrangements operate as intended, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is monitoring price movements of affected products.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The amendments also include a provision which returns to the states any tax revenues the Commonwealth might receive under the franchise fees windfall tax collection arrangements of 1997. This will ensure that state finances are protected from claims for refunds on the grounds of constitutional invalidity of past payments of business franchise fees. The safety net arrangements are revenue neutral for the Commonwealth. The payments made under these amendments will simply return to the states amounts raised by the Commonwealth on their behalf, after allowing for Commonwealth administrative costs.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It is vital to the integrity of state and territory finances that legislation to give effect to the safety net arrangements be enacted without delay. Accordingly, the government will be giving this bill and the associated revenue bills the highest priority. I present the supplementary explanatory memorandum for the additional amendments to the bill and I commend the bill to the House.

         As has been indicated previously, this series of amendments is necessitated in the aftermath of the recent High Court decisions in the Ha and Lim and Walter Hammond cases. Part of the temporary response to those decisions was for the states and the territories to request that the Commonwealth increase their existing tax bases—both wholesale sales tax and excise—to replace the revenue which had been collected under the state and territory business franchise fees. Those requests were duly made and, as many will be aware, on 6 August the Treasurer (Mr Costello) announced increases in customs and excise duties on petroleum products of 8.1c per litre, customs and excise duties on tobacco of $167 per kilogram and increases in the wholesale sales tax on alcoholic beverages of 15 per cent. In addition, the intention to impose a windfall gains tax on refunds of business franchise fees arising because of the High Court decision was also announced.

        <para first-indent="16">
         As well as collecting the revenue on behalf of the other governments, the Commonwealth also has to ensure that the disbursement of these funds is equi table so that consumers and governments do not lose out. We all know that the government mucked up this issue. It had not properly planned for the contingency of the High Court decision, even though its potential impact was widely known. The issue did not even come out of the blue. Indeed, the issue had been looked at by the former government back in 1993, which demonstrates that a fully thought through and agreed plan should have been developed prior to the High Court decision being handed down.

         The shadow Treasurer, in his contribution on the second reading debate, sought assurances from the Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) that four conditions—which we regard as essential in supporting this package and the relating revenue package—have been met. In his summing up on the second reading debate, the parliamentary secretary did respond to that request for assurances. I want to reiterate from the opposition's point of view the importance that the revenue and grants packages have the support and agreement of the states and territories, that revenue is fairly distributed to the states and territories, that extra taxes not be imposed on Australians and that they are equitable in their impact on the businesses which are immediately affected.

          —In speaking on behalf of the opposition on the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997, I want to begin by making our unequivocal opposition to the proposals contained within this bill very clear. This bill will take away rights from Australians. It will take them away selectively and, in so doing, it will expose Australian workers to harsh, unfair and unreasonable dismissal without a right of appeal, which in itself is not only on its face evidently unfair but it is also a blatant breach of an election promise.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In commencing discussion on this bill, I would like to first note the fact that anybody who has been involved in public life in Australia must know that there has been a considerable degree of misinformation and myth-making around the issue of unfair dismissal laws. Nobody could deny that there was substantial concern expressed by the business community about unfair dismissal laws during 1995.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think history will suggest that much of the hysteria surrounding the unfair dismissal laws was the product of a political scare campaign run by the coalition in opposition. What we have here today is an attempt to recreate what
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          was considered to be a successful political strategy in 1995. It is a habit of not only people in politics but people in all walks of life to seek to recreate their past successes. This was a stunt that worked in 1995—the coalition said, `Things are not going too well, let's try it again.' But let us, on this occasion, try to put some perspective, maybe even some facts, into the debate.

          —It would be in this debate. Nobody has tried it on your side, I have to say. The starting point is to understand and appreciate the nature of the protection unfair dismissal laws provide and the importance of that protection. Let me make it very clear that this is the core of this matter that is before us this evening. The unfair dismissal laws, as they presently stand—and this is this government's legislation, the legislation they drafted—provide that employees cannot be terminated in circumstances that are harsh, unjust or unreasonable. These are clear, unambiguous words that have an accepted meaning within the community and that the community can readily identify with.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What we have in this legislation we are debating tonight is a conscious decision by the government to remove this protection from a very large subgroup of Australian workers—that is, all those people who are employees of companies with 15 or fewer employees who commence work after the passage of this legislation. That means those people—and that will be a growing number of people—who are employees and whose dismissal is demonstrably harsh, unjust or unreasonable will have no remedy, no right of appeal. Today if that happens to you, you have a right of appeal. If this bill passes that right will be taken away—you will not be protected against a harsh dismissal, you will not be protected against an unjust dismissal and you will not be protected against an unreasonable decision.

        <para first-indent="16">
         What an achievement by the government! What they will have achieved is to take away the rights from what will become hundreds of thousands of Australians who will lose their rights under this legislation, and for nothing. The government admitted that this was the

         Answer, `Yes.' This fundamental removal of the right of appeal, which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the now Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) promised would be provided at the election campaign, is fundamentally important for two reasons I want to make  tonight and, if I have time, I will demonstrate how it goes to some very profound social consequences to which I wish to refer.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The first of these reasons to which I wish to refer, because it is often fudged, is that no other law protects employees from being dismissed in circumstances that are harsh, unjust or unreasonable. The minister, when questioned, always says, `But they have the protection of the anti-discrimination provisions.' That is true, that is welcomed, but it is not enough. If this legislation passes, the affected employees will have no other protection against harsh, unjust or unreasonable dismissal.

         That would be important in any circumstances, but it is fundamentally important in Australia in 1997 when the prevailing issue in Australian workplaces is job security. If you go to Australian workplaces—and you do not go there to just talk to the management, walk around, wave and leave; you actually sit down and listen to the workers in those workplaces and give them a chance to overcome their surprise that someone is listening to them instead of talking at them—very soon the issue of job security comes to the fore.

But let us say first of all that what will not help job security is legislation which says that it is now easier to sack you than it was and that you have no redress if it happens. No Australian can be more secure in their employment as a consequence of that; all they can be is more insecure. It is another one of those circumstances that recurs in every piece of industrial relations legislation we get from this government: some people lose their rights, nobody gains.

         We do have attempts to explain that other laws might provide protection against dismissal.

Employees can be dismissed for the worst of reasons, for the most harsh and unreasonable of reasons, but if they are given four weeks notice that is okay. There is, I suppose, ultimately the protection of the common law of contract but if we thought that was a fair and reasonable position we would not have unfair dismissal laws in the first place. To require employees to use the common law

Those matters are important but they interest only a small range of people with a specialist interest. Here we have something that goes to the very core of the lives of thousands of Australians and the households that depend on them: the nature of the security that people have at their work, their capacity to have, retain, enjoy and participate in their job in fair and reasonable circumstances, which not only affects their situation at work but affects their situation at home and in every other element of their participation in our society.

         That I think is the most fundamental argument against this proposed exemption. But let us think about the circumstances and broaden the basis of this concern. The government has trumpeted politically that the unfair dismissal provisions—what they call Laurie Brereton's laws—discouraged employers from employing people. I want to come to some evidence, if I have time, to challenge that, or certainly the extent of it. But, even if it were true, let us face the fact: those laws do not exist any more. The government has already changed those laws. The Prime Minister said they had wiped them away, they had created a simpler, more balanced system that provides a fair deal all round.

It has nothing to do with replacing Labor's unfair dismissal laws. That has already been done.

This emerged in the government's response to the Bell report, which did not recommend an exemption for small business from the unfair dismissal law. It proposed a review of the laws after 12 months.

         The exemption is also fundamentally discriminatory. It is unfair to employees and to decent employers. It discriminates between employees of small business and employees of big business. It creates two classes of employees in Australia. It discriminates between apprentices and other new entrants to the work force, including trainees. I welcome the fact that the proposal does not preclude apprentices from the unfair dismissal laws. Apprentices who work for small businesses will not be exempt. Why? I am pleased about it because I do not think anybody should be exempt. But, if this is a reasonable proposition, why shouldn't it apply to everybody?

It discriminates between workers who continue a job after a law commences and those who start a new job—two workers stand next to each other, do the same thing, get dismissed for the same reason and one has a right of appeal and one does not. It does not discriminate between cases on the basis of their merit but on the basis of the coincidence of the workers' employment contracts.

In February, March and April of 1997, as this act started to take effect, the number of jobs was falling; yet in October, November and December, under the old laws, the number was increasing. I do not pretend it is cause and effect, but let us get rid of the rubbish that there was a suppressed enthusiasm to employ that only needed the unfair dismissal laws to be swept away.

Recruitment Solutions said that 90 per cent of employers were not affected in their employment decisions by the existence of unfair dismissal laws, and Morgan and Banks said that at least 80 per cent of small businesses did not believe the existence of the unfair dismissal law adversely affected their decisions to employ new staff. Those figures are very high—80 per cent, 90 per cent—but they are under the previous government's laws. Those were surveys conducted during 1996, so surely it must be better now. This government swept those laws away. It has got to be more than 80 per cent, it has got to be more than 90 per cent of small businesses which are not affected. It must be nearly 100. Perhaps, the Yellow Pages suggests, it might be 97.

The states' unfair dismissal laws that they had in place worked very well in making sure that employees who had a right to protest about an unfair dismissal action were able to take that protest forward and have it heard in a calm, generally non&amp;hyphen;charged atmosphere with very little expense and without creating a culture where everyone who was dismissed thought they were unfairly dismissed.

         What Laurie Brereton's legislation did was to ensconce in federal legislation this nonsense that if you were dismissed it was bound to be because it was unfair and that no&amp;hyphen;one was ever fairly dismissed. The cases of just about everyone who was dismissed for any reason whatsoever—because they were incompetent, because they did not come to work, because they were off constantly, because the work they did was of poor quality, because it was unacceptable, because they stole from the till, because they hit another employee, because they sexually harassed another employee or because they verbally abused another employee with racial intent—went not to some minor jurisdiction where those cases could be heard and arbitrated or conciliated but to the industrial relations court, a new court that Laurie Brereton set up because he decided we needed a new court too.

         I remember a brilliant case in my electorate. There was a medium sized employer who decided to add to the management staff. They hired a young lady out of university and they put her on the staff and they were going to train her towards a management position. It turned out that she was not very good. When she was on the switchboard taking telephone

So you would go to ring the client back, and it was a wrong number, and the person on the other end of the line did not know why you had rung them. If she took down an order, instead of 25 pot plants, she would write down 250, and the client would send back 225. If she sent out an invoice for $50, it wound up being $500 or $5,000 or $5. She was constantly making mistakes.

         Every time, the boss would go and talk to her and try to counsel her and say, `Please, you have got to try to be a bit more attentive to the job and be a bit more accurate.' I have to say that I understand that her father was a union official with Telecom. Her response to her employer was, `Sack me. Go on. Sack me.' That was all she was waiting for: to get the sack, so that she could get her bundle of money and run. She did not want the job. All she wanted was to get the sack.

I can tell the member for Canberra, who has gone, that I have talked to small business after small business in my electorate of La Trobe—maybe as many as 50 or 60 of them.

It is the agony of dealing with solicitors and barristers, of going up in front of a judicial system in order to prove a case, of the hours of research and work at night to try to prove the case and justify it. We all know that some of the cases are absolutely ridiculous—cases where employees have had their fingers in the till and have done absolutely the wrong thing but where a minor point of procedure has been wrong.

That has been fairly consistent now since about April of this year. They are down about 24 per cent, and those have calmed down a lot.

          On 18 June 1997 a small business coalition, which represents a lot of small businesses, met in Canberra. There were 40 representatives of organisations with small business members. They put out a press release on 19 June. Amongst other things, they said that, on the issue of negative perceptions surrounding unfair dismissals, the small business coalition resolved to urge the opposition and the Democrats to support the action proposed by the government on unfair dismissals as it relates to small business, as a symbol to jump&amp;hyphen;start employment. They further asked the opposition and the Democrats to review their position on the matter.

It is not easy out there, whether you are in manufacturing, retailing or the service industry—it does not matter. They all have to fight hard for every dollar and every bit of expansion.

          —It is a pleasure to speak in the debate on the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill tonight. In my role as the shadow minister for small business, I have to say to my good friend and colleague, the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), that I, like he, have been doing a lot of travelling around—not only in my electorate but around Australia—talking to small businesses, and I have been trying to get a handle on the sorts of issues which are of concern to them. As part of that, I have been trying to make an assessment of where the unfair dismissal issue fits in their perceptions, as distinct from the realities of the circumstances facing small business.

If we are talking about micro&amp;hyphen;businesses in Australia, we are talking about businesses with one or two people—often family members.

What the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) says in the media or in this place, making reference to Laurie Brereton's unfair dismissal laws or the Keating government's unfair dismissal laws or industrial relations laws, is garbage. They are gone. They were swept away last year, and my friend the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott), who is at the table, knows that that is the case. He knows that last year his government, with the support of the Democrats in the other place, got rid of the Keating laws in respect of industrial relations and unfair dismissal. They got rid of the industrial relations laws, which they still talk about as being Laurie Brereton's laws.

But in one of those, recommendation No. 13, under chapter 4 on helping small business employers, Mr Bell recommended to his Prime Minister that the revised arrangements for unfair dismissal be reviewed after 12 months of operation `to ensure that it is delivering a more balanced and flexible approach for small business'.

As my friend and colleague the shadow minister for industrial relations and member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) said, Peter Reith and John Howard—the minister and the Prime Minister—said after they had changed their own industrial relations laws, `We have swept away Labor's unfair dismissal laws.' Peter Reith said, `We have delivered a workable system for dealing with unfair dismissal on the basis of a fair go all round and, in doing so, we have expressed an overwhelming community consensus that the previous

This is what this government said: that they were eliminating the laws that were in place and that everything was rosy. Yet within a few short months they were coming forward and saying that changes had to be put in place.

What they have said to me is that they want to eliminate unconscionable conduct, they want support for franchisees and they want, in retail tenancy situations, a decent and workable retail tenancy agreement.

          If you go and ask these people, `What are the issues facing you?' they will tell you that these are the issues. Unfair dismissal does not rate as an important issue with them. On the other hand, if you go and say to them, `Would you like to see unfair dismissal laws changed in this country?' they will say, `Yes, of course we would.' Then if you say to them, `Well, do you realise that the industrial relations laws on unfair dismissal in Australia at the moment are the Howard&amp;hyphen;Reith laws?' they say, `Oh no, we thought they were Keating's and Brereton's.' You then say, `No, no, they were changed last year.' If you then follow that up by asking, `Do you understand that, if you let someone go within the first three months of your employing them, you are not subjected to unfair dismissal claims?' they say, `Well, no, Peter Reith, the minister for workplace relations, has not told us that; the minister for workplace relations hasn't

Seventy&amp;hyphen;five per cent of small businesses said that the unfair dismissal laws had absolutely no effect on them. So there you go—75 per cent.

         In 1987 I, along with my business partner, decided that we would establish a medical deputising service. In fact, we established two. I set about to get some bank finance. I had to get a second mortgage on my house. I had to work hard to try to get the place which we rented established. We had to significantly go into debt to get the business up and running. We ran the great risk for someone just starting off in new business of employing staff. Employing medical people was not so much a problem because that was the nature of my experience, but employing clerical and administrative staff was fraught with great risk.

          There is another point that needs to be made in relation to small businesses and what they want.

Supporting the views that the ALP currently does may mean that there are fewer people surviving in small business and, importantly, that there are fewer people in small business who are prepared to give someone else the opportunity to have a job, which unfortunately a lot of other Australians take for granted.

          I also found in my dealings with the ACTU, when I was President of the AMA and trying to get the ACTU interested in the human and health effects of unemployment, that it seemed entirely preoccupied with only those people who had a job. It appeared not to be at all concerned—other than in a very broad sense—for those who did not have a job. I can only surmise that that is because those who are unemployed are not paying union dues. If I were to give gratuitous advice to the ACTU—which I will give anyway—it is that it ought to start to show a little more concern for some of the social problems this country faces and a little less for purely ideologically driven industrial concerns for its members. If it really is concerned for those who do not have a job, it ought to ask itself what it can do to get the government and the unions off the back of small business and give them the opportunity to create jobs for other people.

          —It is just over one year since the Howard government in its first budget tore the heart out of funding for community controlled Aboriginal organisations across the country. In one fell swoop they ripped one-third of available funding away from ATSIC programs aimed at encouraging indigenous Australians to take charge of their own destiny. They say they quarantined a large part of ATSIC's budget, but the truth is that those budget cuts have devastated the provision of basic services and facilities at the community level.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Where there were community controlled organisations providing a wide range of services in a culturally appropriate and, therefore, more efficient way, many of these organisations have now been forced to close. In central Australia alone I am advised that 11 women's resource centres have folded as a direct result of the government's budgetary cuts. Those organisations provided essential health services, life skills training and material support to women and mothers bringing up the next generation of young indigenous Australians. Now those mothers either have to go without or travel long distances—cap in hand—to hospitals where often nobody knows their customs or speaks their language. It is a story that repeats itself all over Australia every day—indigenous Australians forced to come to the government, cap in hand, for handouts. Before the budget cuts, they would have relied on their own people learning skills and doing it for themselves.

          McEwen electorate—namely, the wine industry. The importance of this industry can be shown in many ways. Firstly, the growth in the industry itself in Victoria has seen it advance in prestige to rival many famous Australian interstate and, indeed, overseas wineries. I am privileged to be the member representing an area which can boast such wine growing regions—Mr Speaker, I know that you would be aware of these regions—as Mansfield, with the Delatite Winery; Nagambie, with Chateau Tabilk, Plunkett's and Mitchelton wineries; and the Yarra Valley, synonymous for names such as Tarrawarra, Yarra Ridge, Fergussons, De Bortoli and Long Gully, to name but a few.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I must add that it is not simply a record for wine production that makes these wineries such a welcome addition to the McEwen electorate. With the first production of vines in the Yarra Valley being recorded in the 1840s, Victoria now produces its fair share of a national wine export market worth around $500 million. The growth in the wine industry in smaller towns such as St Andrews, Northwood, Avenel and Dixons Creek have supported growth not only in the national economy but also in the local districts through associated industries such as travel, tourism and hospitality.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Secondly, the quality of wines has seen them being rewarded recognition not only here in Australia but overseas as well. Once&amp;hyphen;small wineries have made a name for themselves in the industry and are attracting attention from larger corporations. Modest wineries have now grown into medium sized companies, with further expansion in the industry promising further growth.

         The value of the wine industry in Victoria should not be underestimated. With growth in the next 12 years, Victoria aims to secure
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          approximately 30 per cent of the national export market. In this goal, the Victorian Wine Industry Association estimates that production across the state should expand by up to 700 hectares of planting each year for the next 10 years. Growth such as this is essential in bringing jobs back to the rural communities, many of which suffered so badly under the previous 13 years of Labor government. This government, the Howard government, is working very hard to secure our rural and regional communities, and we encourage small business and industry to take advantage of all that is offered.

         The growth in the wine industry in Australia has specifically opened up new opportunities to jobseekers from a wide range of fields. From seasonal employment around the time of harvest to positions for experts in the fields of viticulture and winemaking, the increase in the number of vines being planted, tourism and marketing initiatives and value adding processes in the wineries have enabled the industries to employ many additional employees.

         In a report from the Wineries Tourism Council it was stated that wineries are a major drawcard for visitors to regional Victoria. Their research showed that more than 53 per cent of people visiting wineries indicated that their visit to that particular region was prompted by a trip to a winery. This kind of tourism entices visitors to stay not just a few hours but a number of days. For example, one of the places they love to visit is the De Bortoli winery and restaurant, which recently won the prestigious Jimmy Watson trophy. Their late picked wine, bearing the simple label of `Noble One' has won international awards beating comparable French wines hands down.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In addition to the benefits to the wineries of having an increase in cellar door visits and sales, tourists are keen to stay for a few nights to provide an additional boost to the local economy. The Wineries Tourism Council has estimated this increase will continue.

          —I rise tonight to raise a matter of serious concern that affects the substantial number of high&amp;hyphen;rise public housing estates in my electorate—a decision by the Kennett government to defund tenants councils or tenants associations that were first established in the estates by the former Cain government. This really relates to only a fairly small amount of money, and, in fact, may not save any significant amount of money at all. But it will have a devastating impact on the sense of community of the estates on the degree to which the various groups of people in these estates are able to relate to each other, work together, tackle the various problems that they face collectively and advocate on behalf of themselves as a group with respect to public housing issues.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What these tenants councils currently do is employ usually one, two or three people, one or two tenant workers and administrative staff in a location on the particular estate. They advocate for individual tenants who have problems—for example, they may take them to the residential tenancy tribunal—and deal with issues of maintenance, trying to ensure that the ministry actually looks after maintenance problems.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         They organise many collective community activities. In some estates they are involved, for example, in assisting with community gardens, vegetable gardens and the like. They are a forum where the various ethnic groups on the estates can come together, with the aid of interpreters, and express common concerns. Issues such as security problems, drugs and various other problems on some of the estates can be dealt with. What actually emerges from these tenants councils is a sense of community, a sense of participation and a sense of belonging.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What is actually happening is of considerable importance because these high-rise estates are like medium&amp;hyphen;sized country towns. The estate at Richmond has roughly a quarter of the population of Richmond in that one high-rise estate in a fairly small area—it has almost 7,000 people. There are other estates in my electorate that have 4,000 or 5,000 people on them. The only collective structure
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          they have, the only means for integrating the community on those estates, is those tenants associations. The Kennett government is defunding them and is going to replace the process with tendered out, contracted out operations that will only provide the narrow services of individual representation to the tenants.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Critically, there will be no sense of accountability between the tenants and the service providers. Hopefully, what we will have is a legitimate organisation like the Salvation Army or the Brotherhood of St Laurence getting these tenders. They at least will do their best to perform these services. But they cannot hope to be genuinely representative of the tenants. They will not be accountable to the tenants as the current tenants councils and tenant workers are through the structures that exist. They will also be organised in ridiculous regions. For example, the region in which the estate in Flemington in my electorate is situated will extend as far out as Melton but will not include areas such as Carlton, which are only 5&amp;hyphen; to 10&amp;hyphen;minutes drive away, and very similar.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So we will have a situation where a particular service provider is going to be looking after a very diverse range of different sorts of public housing and there will be no sense of collectivity. There is no guarantee that you will have on a particular estate, even a large estate with 4,000 or 5,000 or more tenants, a presence. At the moment, what we have is, usually on a ground floor location in one of the blocks, an office of the tenants council that is staffed with some basic resources there where tenants and particular groups of tenants can come and actually deal with their problems, get assistance, get some sort of sense of community and interaction with others on the estate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the things that worries me is that it is conceivable that we will end up with `Dodgy Bros Tenancy Services Pty Ltd' actually providing these services, that the Kennett government will take the same approach that it has taken on the question of cleaning. When that was contracted out, we ended up with people who had had no previous experience involved in providing cleaning
         <break page="6942" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          services getting contracts simply because they put in the cheapest bid. We could end up with some real shysters, who have no real concern for the interests of tenants, actually winning these bids—maybe not this time, but perhaps down the track.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The former minister, Mr Knowles, at least understood the importance of these tenants associations. They are a critical factor in ensuring that these estates are basically livable, reasonable places for public tenants. He understood that if you took these away you would actually end up potentially with the sorts of problems that you have in public high-rise estates in places like Britain and the United States. The current minister, Ann Henderson, apparently does not understand that.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am seriously concerned that the degree of the quality of life on the estates will deteriorate significantly, that there will be no accountability between tenants and those providing the services, that the range of things that will be provided—the degree of social intermediation and interaction between the different groups of people on the estates—will diminish and that we will have a substantial reduction in the overall quality of services.

         Clearly, out of respect for the democratic process, Australia must work with the Cambodian government in an attempt to foster and nurture its infant democracy. In advancing this objective, the following measures should be adopted. Firstly, in a demonstration of respect for democracy, all members of the former Cambodian parliament, including Prince Ranariddh, Sam Rainsy and other liberal Buddhists who are at present living in political exile, should be permitted to return and be encouraged to remain in their country with the protection and sanction of the Cambodian government. This is not merely a gesture of goodwill to Hun Sen's political opponents; it is a basic human right and a display of good faith to international observers and sceptics.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Secondly, the Australian government should maintain its insistence that the Cambodian government strictly observes fundamental human rights and the rule of law for all its citizens. Thirdly, the Australian government should increase its fiscal commitment and

          technical support to the Cambodian government for the proposed May 1998 elections to a level of assistance commensurate with the task at hand.

          —I would like to take the opportunity tonight to draw the attention of the House to some recent developments in the organisation of disability services. They have received scant attention either in the House or more broadly in the community but of course have a very significant impact upon people with disabilities, their families and carers and the services on which they rely.

          In particular, I want to talk about the renegotiation of the Commonwealth-state disability agreement. This agreement governs the funding and organisation of disability services throughout the country. It expired on 30 June this year after five years of operation and after an independent evaluation that had been in fact completed a year before. The evaluation had taken place a year before, so the Commonwealth and the states had had a year to reach agreement on the terms and conditions of the new agreement. They have failed to do so—a story that is becoming too common with this government.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This failure must in large part be attributed to the Commonwealth. Not only has it been unwilling to reassure state governments that existing funding levels will be maintained in a new agreement; it has attempted to reduce funding—and this despite the findings of the evaluation that in all service types funded under the agreement demand for services exceeds supply. It found that 13,500 people with severe and profound handicaps were in critical need of accommodation; 7,700 people with severe and profound handicaps had a carer over the age of 70; 7,000 carers of people with severe and profound handicaps did not have access to respite care; and up to 70,000 people with severe and profound handicaps might need access to day or recreation activities.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I am seeing the impact of the decisions to reduce funding in my own electorate, where, for example, Commonwealth funding cuts to a group called SPEECH, the Society to Promote Essential Education for Children, threatened the viability of services at Eltham, West Preston and Broadmeadows. If these services are curtailed, the children who now attend classes at these centres to assist them in overcoming severe speech and communication impairments will be severely disadvantaged. Without early intervention such as that provided through SPEECH, their future education and employment will be severely disadvantaged, as will their ability to interact socially.

Instead of shouting in this debate, she should take up the matter with the responsible minister, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), who has seen severe cuts take place and has not been prepared to take this agreement to the states. The minister might listen. The member for McEwen obviously is not interested, and I will be very happy to let her electors in Eltham know what is going to happen as a result of this minister's incompetence.

          The minister has said to all the states and territories, `We're not going to have a new Commonwealth-state disability agreement. We're just going to extend it by a month at a time.' If the member for McEwen thinks that that will help the people in her electorate or my electorate who need access to services, such as children who cannot hear properly and parents who have severely disabled children, she has no idea about the needs of those children or their parents. That shows just how out of touch this government is.

While some were talking doom and gloom after the closure of the meat abattoirs which left 600 of their townsfolk unemployed and a fire which burnt down a number of retail businesses, causing further unemployment, this small group were planning a comeback. The rural community I am talking about is Beaudesert and the event which has placed this town back on the map is the country and horse festival.

         I am invited to many community events and organisations and I have seen some outstanding displays of talent and teamwork, but none has left me feeling the way I did after this fantastic week of festivities. I was feeling nothing but pure pride for this town. The teamwork and community spirit displayed was exceptional. To see the townspeople get solidly behind the festival and really put on a great show for many visitors to our area is a great testament to the fighting spirit of this small, close&amp;hyphen;knit community.

         The people of the Beaudesert shire gathered together to support and contribute to a festival which celebrated the rural lifestyles and scenic beauty of the Beaudesert region in particular.

Nindooinbah opened its doors to the quilters and embroiderers competition, which attracted over 400 displays from across Australia. I want to congratulate Margaret Hockey on her hospitality, as so many people came to view this exhibition in such exquisite surroundings, and in doing so raised much needed funds for Catholic Care and Concern.

         The festival also catered for those who were not so competitive with food and wine tasting, day and night rodeos, bush poetry, sheepdog trials and a host of activities to keep everybody busy and entertained. The four-wheel drive tours of the shire was a great way for visitors to see the area, which is often overlooked by the public. It took in the local Palmaday and Belcam studs to show a display of race horses and their facilities. The tour also gave visitors the opportunity to take in the sights of the beautiful Mount Tamborine.

         To top off the superb week-long program, the weekend brought the celebrations to a high with a spectacular street parade which attracted over 5,000 people to the streets of Beaudesert. The `parade of a thousand hooves' consisted of the most amazing floats, bands, entertainments and horses of all breeds. The parade was followed by a country music concert put on by the very talented Ray, Tania and Lee Kernaghan.

        CASA acts on reports of information related to SUPs. CASA believes that one of the most effective methods of preventing the use of unapproved parts is through an extensive industry education and awareness program. In this regard, it has established a telephone "hot line" (1&amp;hyphen;800 245 011). This is for reporting any suspected unapproved aircraft parts.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        To further assist the industry, CASA has established a home page on the Internet which includes notifications of unapproved parts from the US Federal Aviation Administration and details of

        (2) &amp; (3) When intelligence is received about possible use of &amp; unapproved parts, the relevant CASA District Office investigates the claims.

        To date, CASA's investigation have not revealed evidence to support a brief being referred to the DPP. In one case, evidence has been provided to the Australian Federal Police, which was considered insufficient by the AFP to mount a prosecution.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        In May 1996, a special audit of a helicopter maintenance organisation was undertaken by CASA. No evidence was found to support allegations that unapproved parts were being used.

However, there will be exemptions from this requirement for young people who are sick or homeless, or experiencing temporary family trauma.

        (1) I am aware of these claims. The claims are based primarily on Queensland Government laboratory analyses of sediment samples from affected waterways which initially indicated the presence of Bifenthrin. However, a close check of these analyses showed that the presence of Bifenthrin could not be confirmed. Subsequent analyses of samples from fourteen other waterways of concern failed to detect Bifenthrin in all but two of the samples, in which trace amounts of Bifenthrin were reported. The problem is still being investigated by the Queensland Department of the Environment, and the most recent advice is that they have yet to identify the cause (which may or may not be related to chemicals).

The first State/Territory in which this product was approved was NSW on 3 December 1993.

         The honourable member is asked to note that the information contained in the following answer was obtained from two sources and, therefore, varies in presentation. The Appoint database was one of these sources. Appoint is an automated database used by Commonwealth departments to record appointment information for the purpose of measuring progress in appointing people to Commonwealth boards who come from the EEO target groups. The information is collected from appointees. Specific criteria applies for recording bodies on the Appoint database and so not all statutory and non statutory bodies within the primary industries and energy portfolio are recorded. Information collected for inclusion in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy Annual Report 1996-97 was used as a second source along with the Appoint data. The information included in this response is information readily available to the Department using these two sources.
