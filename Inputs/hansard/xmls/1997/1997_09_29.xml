           —The committee took this opportunity to review the National Audit Office report on Commonwealth guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort following concerns expressed about the findings of the report. These contingent liabilities have an implicit cost to taxpayers, because there is always a risk that a guarantee or an indemnity will require payments to be made. In most cases, of course, this risk is low.
          </para>
         </talk.start>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort can also result in legal action. If protracted, this can hinder the actions of the government. For example, legal action over guarantees associated with the sale of the Moomba to Sydney gas pipeline resulted in the Commonwealth cancelling the first sale attempt.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The audit report identified at least $222 billion in value of guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort. Significantly, this figure does not include a large number of indemnities which have no specified financial limit. Furthermore, the audit office does not consider that it has identified all of these instruments, due to poor record keeping by government departments.
          <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
           Having said that, I point out that the largest exposures appear to be well managed. For example, the guarantee
           <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
            related to the Commonwealth Bank, the obligations carried by this guarantee, are subject to prudential supervision by the Reserve Bank.

          Audit report No. 6 of 1996&amp;hyphen;97 identified some serious shortcomings in the management and accountability arrangements for Commonwealth guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort. As a result, the audit office made several recommendations. The committee strongly endorses those recommendations. The audit report reveals that the Commonwealth is neither informed nor aware of the potential losses that might arise.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Guarantees and indemnities are rarely recorded and often not managed at all. Even though there are guidelines on recording guarantees and indemnities, departments have failed to keep appropriate records. For example, the committee found the Department of Defence had an indemnity covering the construction of the Collins class submarine. It was not reported to the audit office and Defence's central financial area was not aware of the indemnity. Potentially, this is a very significant liability if anything untoward should occur.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The committee is very surprised that Defence did not have such an obvious and large indemnity on its central records. The committee believes that Defence's contract management would benefit from a review by the audit office. The committee was also very surprised to hear that a former department had managed to lose some $300 million of promissory notes from Optus. It was obliged to issue an indemnity covering the possibility that the notes might be presented for payment by some other party.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          These are just two examples of the poor standards of management of contingent liabilities in public sector agencies. The committee believes they are indicative of a more widespread problem. If these instruments continue to be so poorly used and managed, the Commonwealth could be exposed to unacceptable risks. The Commonwealth cannot allow mismanagement to become systemic.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In its report the committee deals with a wide range of issues relating to the use of
          <break page="8610" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort. These include the power of agencies to issue these instruments, and the management and monitoring of these instruments.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The committee was concerned at the apparent ease with which departmental officers can issue indemnities. The audit office noted that Commonwealth officers have the ability to commit the Commonwealth to large indemnities without the permission or knowledge of the minister or of the parliament. Such a system could compromise the budgetary process.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The committee recommended that agencies be required to follow the audit office and Department of Finance recommendations for officers to be properly authorised to issue indemnities on behalf of a minister. The committee has also recommended that departments review the powers of statutory authorities to accept contingent liabilities.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The committee expects to see some significant improvements to the management and monitoring of the Commonwealth's contingent liabilities in future. In part, this is because of new guidelines on issuing guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The Department of Finance, in conjunction with the audit office and the Attorney-General's Department, has issued the new guidelines. The guidelines incorporate many of the audit office recommendations and should assist agencies to improve the management of these instruments.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The committee congratulates the Department of Finance, the audit office and the Attorney-General's Department on the new guidelines. New financial statement guidelines for departments and statutory authorities also give greater prominence to the reporting of contingent liabilities, including guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort. The committee strongly supports this change.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is important that agency heads take all necessary steps to ensure that their agencies manage contingent liabilities well and follow the guidelines. While ultimate responsibility lies with the ministers, agency heads are relied upon to follow good financial management practices. The committee recommended
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           that agency heads be required to take account of this responsibility.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I would also like to briefly touch upon the need for risk management planning in the public sector. There is no formal requirement for agencies to have corporate risk strategies. The current approach is haphazard, and it is important that agencies cooperate with the Australian National Audit Office and Finance in developing risk management plans. In this regard, it will be important to also focus on the need to develop the appropriate expertise in the public sector to assess and measure risk or, alternatively, to ensure that such advice and expertise is available to agencies from external sources.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There are many other specific issues on which the committee has made recommendations or comments. The committee's report addresses the need for good reporting and recording of contingent liabilities, including derivatives. The committee also examined the use of indemnities in contracts and the use of financial and time limits in indemnities. In addition, the committee looked briefly at the arrangements for the supervision of government business enterprises. It appears that agencies are beginning to take appropriate action to address the deficiencies identified by the audit office. Nevertheless, there remains much for agencies to address.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The committee also considers that there is a need for ongoing oversight of the management of the Commonwealth's contingent liabilities. To this end, the committee recommends that the audit office review the management of the Commonwealth's contingent liabilities again in two years time.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Finally, I would like to thank the members of the committee for their very active participation in the conduct of the review and for the preparation of this report. I would also like to thank the committee secretariat, particularly Sarah Davis and Chris Paterson, for their part in this review. On behalf of the committee, I also extend our appreciation to the audit office and other agencies which contributed to the review. I commend the report to the House.

           . I fully endorse the submission made a moment ago by the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration, the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker). I will be far more brief in my submission than the committee chairman was in his.

          The aforementioned instruments—guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort—are instruments which facilitate promises involving one party being responsible for the potential debt, risk of loss or damage suffered by a second party. They are generally used by Commonwealth agencies to assist governments with the general management and day&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;day running of the government's operations.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The intent of this inquiry, as put by the chairman, was primarily to focus the minds of various departments and agencies on improving the administration and the management of the exposures associated with these instruments. It was revealed that there are in fact flaws in the administration and accountability arrangements for each of these three instruments. These, as I say, were revealed in the performance audit.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Surprisingly, the Commonwealth can perhaps best be described as being in general somewhat unaware of the potential losses which might arise due to the mismanagement of the administration of such instruments. Indeed, many agencies of the Commonwealth do not understand how to manage risk, and are somewhat oblivious to the serious potential for major losses. Too frequently, the risk attached to these instruments is, indeed, not managed at all.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In its audit, the ANAO sought to determine the extent of risk management that departments did apply to guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort. The committee formed the view that risk management was a very important aspect of overall public sector management. Some aspects of effective risk management include preparation of instruments, reporting procedures, records management and review and evaluation processes.
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           There is no formal requirement for overseers to have corporate risk strategies. The report canvassed at some length the need for broad risk management arrangements. Indeed, the report stated at paragraph 3.77:

          The Committee recommends that departments develop risk management plans appropriate for their circumstances. At present, there appears to be a haphazard approach to risk management by some agencies. The Committee expects that agencies will cooperate with the ANAO, Finance and other relevant agencies in developing risk management plans, and responding appropriately to the ANAO recommendations.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          The committee conducted a thorough assessment of several other aspects of Commonwealth exposure, including the supervision of GBEs and statutory authorities. It also examined the way in which non&amp;hyphen;complying agencies which do not adhere to Department of Finance guidelines ought best be dealt with.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          While the ANAO audit has proved to be a worthwhile exercise in managing the aforementioned three instruments, much needs to be done in general by Commonwealth agencies. The chairman has detailed at some length what ought to happen in those particular areas.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In its concluding paragraph, the report states that the committee expects that agencies will follow the recommendations of the ANAO as is appropriate, with the aim of lifting the standard of management of the Commonwealth risk. The committee supports the revised guidelines on issuing Commonwealth indemnities and the risk management guidelines of the Management Advisory Board. The committee commends these sources of advice to agencies. The committee also considers there is a need for ongoing oversight of agency risk management by the ANAO. That encapsulates where the committee sees this issue ought best head now.

          In commending the report to the House, I similarly wish to thank both Sarah Davis and Chris Paterson, in that order, for their fine efforts in preparing this document. It is certainly a good read, and one that I commend to all members.

          In the past, the committee has identified the growth in financial conglomerates as requiring a new approach to regulation.

          It is also an excellent example of the role parliament can play through its committee system to assist in raising public awareness of this important aspect of economic management and to ensure that issues of public concern are given appropriate attention by the bank. I will now make some comments on the issues canvassed in the report.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There were two hearings with the Reserve Bank. The first was with the former governor, Mr Bernie Fraser, and the second was with the new governor, Mr Ian Macfarlane. Much of the examination at both hearings focused on monetary policy. The discussion of monetary policy was of vital interest to the markets and the community at the time of the hearings. The report is largely a record of the matters canvassed at the hearings. However, a number of significant matters were discussed which continue to be relevant.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          One issue canvassed was the relationship between reducing the budget deficit and monetary policy. The Reserve Bank strongly endorsed moving the budget into surplus as an effective way of raising national savings. The bank also advised that the fiscal position influences long&amp;hyphen;term interest rates.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The relationship between fiscal and monetary policy is complex and the bank's view was that the fiscal position should be viewed over the long term—that is, it does not have to be in surplus each year—the main role for fiscal policy being to ensure sound finances, thus encouraging confidence in economic policy and contributing to national savings.

          The issue of unemployment was also discussed. The bank identified reasonable  pros

Growth prospects for employment will be a major topic for discussion at our next meeting in November. Inflation and growth were also discussed extensively, with the bank noting that the outlook for inflation is that it will remain low, although the governor continues to express concern over the potential for excessive wages growth to fuel inflation, which could put the current low interest rate environment at risk.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          One area of concern to the committee was the role that the strength of the dollar was having on containing inflation. The committee was concerned that a strengthening yen could have a significant impact on inflation in Australia. The governor was satisfied that some reduction in the value of the dollar—as has since occurred—would not be of great concern.

          The committee also took up the issue of the difficulties small business was having in accessing finance and the cost of that finance. The Reserve Bank continues to stress its view that margins applicable to small business reflect risk, although the governor was of the view that competition was now entering a phase where the needs of small business will be addressed.

          The governor suggested that the reason for this having taken so long is simply that small business lending is the most difficult form of lending. Lending to small business will be pursued in greater detail at the next round of hearings with the Reserve Bank. The committee has already sought and received information on margins for small business loans and a number of other lending products.

          The committee is concerned that small and medium sized businesses find it difficult to access equity capital due to the prohibitive costs associated with preparing a prospectus. The committee believes that this is detrimental to small business and restricts them to bank finance. The committee has recommended that the Treasurer review the rules associated with prospectus requirements with a view to reducing the cost and complexity of preparing a prospectus for small and medium sized companies. The committee also canvassed an issue which plagues small business: that of individuals continuing to trade while insolvent, and the related issue of phoenix companies.

          The committee accepts that many small businesses will fail, but that is not something that should be considered as meaning that they cannot have another go. Small business people are very determined to take risks, and we believe that should be encouraged. It is those operators who regularly go broke, leave behind debts and then pop up again—those who do this in a calculated manner—who are damaging other honest small business people in the process. This is an issue that we believe needs to be given more priority by the ASC.

          In the time remaining, I would like to cover a couple of matters related to the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. The committee canvassed the introduction of risk management guidelines for the use of derivatives in the superannuation and insurance industries. While the implementation of an appropriate regulatory regime has been slow, progress is being made. The increasing attraction of derivatives is a cause for concern with regard to small funds in particular. The emphasis put on the role of trustees is something that may have to be considered in the future, and it is something that the committee will keep under review.

          From the committee's perspective, it intends to continue to develop its role of oversighting the new regulators in order to play its part to ensure that there is continued and improved accountability to the parliament and the community. Consequently, the committee has recommended that the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority be required to appear before this committee each year to report on the prudential supervision of the financial services industry. This will complement the Reserve Bank's appearances and will assist in ensuring that the cooperation, which is vital to the success of new arrangements, is effective and workable.

          I will restrict some of my comments to the RBA, given that time is limited, and I will defer my thoughts on the ASC and the ISC for another day. It was, as the chairman has put, a significant opportunity for the RBA to make its views on the conduct of monetary policy known, not only to the financial services industry but also to the broader Australian community. In a sense, it was the latter category who were interested in this report—if for no reason other than they have a particular interest in matters that relate to cheque clearing. There was no doubt that the committee approves of arrangements whereby the governor appears twice annually before the committee to report on the conduct of monetary policy.

          <break page="8615" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           most often—is not derivatives nor commercial operations, for example, of the RBA. Rather, they are interested in the issue that is closest to their hearts: cheque clearing and the time taken to clear a cheque. In general, the Australian electorate considers that the time taken to clear a cheque is too long. Whilst writing cheques continues to be a popular pastime, primarily because of its flexibility, people are aware that the time taken is too long.

          Notwithstanding that, there are still many cheques signed and cleared in Australia each day. In fact, during 1995, as the RBA put to the committee, some four billion cheques were processed each day with a total value of some $25 billion. The RBA does, of course, support the view that banks should take advantage of the benefits of new technology with respect to cheque processing. Of course, the Australian Payments Clearing Association is currently developing a set of industry wide standards around which the electronic presentation and dishonouring of cheques may be dealt with—albeit somewhat slowly in the eyes of the committee and somewhat slowly in the eyes of the bank itself.

          There are, however, some positive signs, one being that the RBA has suggested that the proposed arrangements should allow a reduction of at least two days in the period before depositors can access funds. Of equal interest to cheque account holders is the matter detailed at paragraph 2.69 of the report, which states:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          . . . by holding onto customer's funds longer than is necessary, the banks are able to take advantage of the difference in the interest available on the short term money market and that which they are obliged to pay on customers accounts. The RBA advised that the time taken to clear cheques gives rise to a pool of funds which banks can invest, generally on the short term money market at a rate of interest in excess of that paid to customers. This proposition is not accepted by the banks, some of which maintain that there is no float.

          This is an interesting point, given the emphasis now placed on banks recovering costs. The committee will be exploring that at a later date. I certainly encourage the committee to do that given the widespread interest across the Australian community in this issue.

          After speaking to hundreds of young people, I am in absolutely no doubt that the overwhelming majority want to work. Also the committee heard over and over again that, above all else, employers seek employees who have the right attitude to work and a desire to learn, who are punctual and honest and who have appropriate personal behaviour and presentation. Most young people know this, but it is clear that the expectations of young people and employers do not always coincide.

          Family background is an important influence on a young person's employment prospects. A disadvantaged background can condition young people for a life of unemployment. The committee believes that a greater emphasis on literacy and numeracy in primary school, better careers education and wider availability of workplace education programs would assist more young people, particularly disadvantaged young people, to get their first jobs.

         <para first-indent="16">
          In recognition of the importance of early literacy and numeracy education, the committee has recommended that the minister ensure that there is comprehensive teaching of literacy and numeracy, that the standard is regularly tested and that students who need it get special attention to improve their skills. It has also recommended a national youth guarantee which would entitle every Australian under 21 years of age who has not attained year 12 at high school to a funded place at a high school, a TAFE or a recognised training provider to complete a year 12 education.

          There have been dramatic shifts in young people's participation in employment and education.

          The committee is emphatic that the parlous state of careers guidance and education in our schools must be corrected. It is recommended that comprehensive careers guidance be established as an entitlement for all secondary students and that their careers guidance teachers have better access to national and regional labour market data. Unbelievably, most careers guidance teachers do not have easy access to this information.

          Back in 1989, this committee recommended that the states should facilitate the development of integrated school to industry links programs.

We must do much better.

          Workplace education leads to employment for a significant number of participating young people.

Programs for students in years 9 and 10 like the one at Berwick Secondary College in outer Melbourne achieve better outcomes for students who are otherwise at risk of leaving school early with poor job prospects. The committee's recommendations would make workplace education more widely available and improve its framework for employers.

          Apprenticeship commencements in Australia are well below the optimal level. There are several reasons why this is so. Outsourcing causes fewer firms to train and retain their own tradespeople. Subcontractors are loath to employ an apprentice or trainee when the cost has to be factored into every quote. The firms that train young people are at a competitive disadvantage. This aspect of business culture is not in the national interest and is not in the long-term interest of business itself. It must change.

          A striking anomaly the committee encountered everywhere was young people's ignorance of the wide range of opportunities offered by apprenticeships and traineeships.

          I believe that the government's new apprenticeship initiative is a sound approach to improving apprenticeship and traineeship commencements.

          I am very concerned that employers of young people have to keep justifying the retention of age based wages. So far it has not been possible to develop a competency based alternative to junior wages which is practical and economical to administer. Junior wages are not discriminatory. They recognise that most young people do not bring the same mix of maturity, skill and experience to the workplace as older workers. The demise of junior wages risks the jobs of thousands of young Australians, and I believe that those who argue in favour of abolishing junior wages do young people a grave disservice.

          The coalition members on the committee have recommended the establishment of a national youth wage, but it is not our intention to set a rate which would be inconsistent with Australian community standards.

          I will point to a few wage anomalies to indicate why a national youth wage is justified. The award rate for a first&amp;hyphen;year apprentice chef is $186 a week. A supermarket trainee on the national training wage, who is not learning a trade, is paid about $1 more per hour in productive work than the apprentice is paid. A trainee at a skill level approaching that of trades is paid about $1.23 more per hour in productive work than the young person learning a trade, while an 18&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old in a non&amp;hyphen;training retail job is paid about $1.30 more per hour than the apprenticeship chef. The wage signals facing young people entering the labour market are upside down. The financial incentives should not induce them to choose lower skilled jobs without training.

          Generally speaking, the committee reached agreement in a bipartisan way in the report's first four chapters, but that was simply not possible in chapter 5 on youth wages, where opposition members could not agree in any way with the recommendations made by government members. One member of the committee, the member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel), wrote a minority report. This is because, in essence, the government members—whether they realise it or not—recommend Australia go down the income equality direction so prevalent in the United States.

          In recent weeks, Channel 9 and News Limited promoted a commendable Jobs for Australia campaign, securing promises from employers for 20,000 jobs. However, the stark reality is that these 20,000 jobs, if they eventuate, would do nothing of a fundamental nature to change the chronic and endemic unemployment that stagnates in the economies of Australia and the developed world. For me that campaign reinforced the fact that jobs are simply not there for younger and, indeed, older workers.

          This inquiry focused on young people aged from 15 to 24 years. In the few minutes I have, I wish to address three points which for me are the substance of the report. The first refers to the age group five to 15. This is the age where children gain literacy, numeracy, social and technological skills. Although there are privileged and vested interests in the education sector denying that there is a crisis in our primary and junior secondary schools, there is no escaping the fact that when Australia is compared with other OECD countries we are nearly at the bottom when it comes to expenditure on all resources in the five&amp;hyphen; to 15&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old age group.

         When you consider our unique range of fauna in Australia, especially amongst our marsupials, it is long overdue that we recognise the special place these animals have in our country, the damage that has been done to them over the last 200 years, the need to identify and document the species affected and to set out to do something about it by recognising the problem, identifying what has to be done and putting the whole issue on a proper scientific footing, as indicated in the wording of the motion, so that we can begin to rectify, where possible, the neglect and mistakes of the past. In short, this means commitment, caring and a proper level of funding to attack the problem.

          with the ability to make great advances in this shamefully neglected area within months, let alone what could be achieved within years. To mention some, Dr Jack Giles, the Director of Scientific Policy and Research at Taronga Zoo and the chair of the Biological Diversity Advisory Committee of New South Wales, is behind this, as is Dr John Kelly, the Director and Chief Executive of Taronga and Western Plains zoos. The South Australian Zoological Society backs it, as does the Division of Wildlife and Ecology within the CSIRO.

         It is a project the public would enthusiastically embrace. There is no opposition to it that I know of anywhere. Indeed, it borders on criminal neglect of our heritage if we do not begin to act now. I acknowledge that this motion could apply to biodiversity generally in this country as only 10 per cent of our species have been properly described. However, to start the ball rolling with something we can all identify with, I have concentrated on our marsupials that have been lost in the wild.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Simply put, we have lost nearly all of our marsupials in the wild who lie in the critical weight range of 35 grams to 5,500 grams and who have inhabited the drier areas of our continent. Above 5&amp;half; kilograms, such as the larger wallabies and kangaroos, these animals have often thrived since white settlement because they have the size to handle the introduced predators and they have extra man&amp;hyphen;made watering points around the country, which gives them a wider and more secure grazing range. However, below that size, the introduced predators, especially the fox, which really started to spread about the 1870s, but also the feral cat, have proved devastating.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Add to this the increased grazing pressure from rabbits, sheep and goats, habitat destruction from clearing, the introduction of domestic dogs and even the introduction of the exotic granivore, the house mouse, and you have a result of the loss of so many species in the wild. By contrast, in tropical and rainforest areas where cover, for example, has been preserved, the loss is often very slight. Tasmania is okay too, although the thylacine, the Tasmanian tiger, is a notable exception.

        <break page="8620" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          But in our temperate and especially dry to arid areas the destruction of lower weight range native marsupial wildlife is all but complete. My own electorate of Parkes, which encompasses almost 40 per cent of the land area of New South Wales, including much of the western arid areas, is a classic case in point. Mammals that once roamed free are now never seen because they are extinct in the wild: 27 mammal species have become extinct in New South Wales since 1788 and tragically the loss of mammal diversity on the mainland of Australia, south of the Tropic of Capricorn, is the highest of any continent in the world.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The good news is that we can do something about this. Quite a number of these animals still exist in captivity, although they are in colonies of very small numbers and sometimes only one or two colonies. They sometimes exist only in unnatural caged conditions within zoos. So we have a very low genetic biodiversity pool base to work on. The number of these animals is sometimes below critical mass numbers and they are highly vulnerable to disease outbreaks or other disasters such as a predator attack, which means we must create, as a matter of urgency, more colonies of these animals and breed them up as fast as we can. They have been doing some excellent work at Taronga Zoo in Sydney, for example, and more so in recent years at Western Plains Zoo in Dubbo. There are also some other centres around Australia, such as that at Alice Springs and a centre being set up at Roxby Downs in South Australia with a lot of private money; and there are also other projects, such as the Wamsley Wildlife Park in South Australia.

          But the need is great to set up another endangered species area in an arid area where most of these animals lived. In particular, Broken Hill would be an ideal place for that. There is strong community and council support for this, and I pay particular tribute to Councillor John Simons, who has done a tremendous amount of work in this area. At Broken Hill they already have a 2,400 hectare reserve—that is nearly 6,000 acres—on the northern outskirts of the town. They plan to fence off 180 hectares to make it predator

          They have plans there for an excellent interpretive centre or visitors' centre which can be used for education for school children, students and adults. Tourism would thrive there too. Dr Jack Giles, whom I mentioned earlier, said:

          The proposed Broken Hill Living Desert Sanctuary fits squarely into a considered and well developed program aimed at increasing our capacity to preserve and amplify threatened species and populations, utilising the interest, resources and good will of the private sector and local communities. It has the potential, if it wins adequate resources for capital development, to be strongly supported by an informed and motivated local community, to the long-term benefit of the species involved and to be self-supporting in terms of operational costs. On our current projections, the sanctuary will break even in operation costs at about 40,000 visitors per year. The Living Desert currently receives about 18,000 visitors annually.

          One of the animals they have been thinking of breeding there is the yellow&amp;hyphen;footed rock wallaby. There are only about 100 left in the wild in Australia near Broken Hill because of good fox control suppression measures they have there. The population of those wallabies are genetically distinct to the small colonies in South Australia and Queensland. But all the other animals they are thinking of breeding are extinct in the Broken Hill area; namely, the greater bilby, which is extinct in the wild in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia; the mala or rufous hare wallaby, which exists only in the Northern Territory and more recently at Western Plains Zoo, Dubbo; the chudditch or western quoll, which is extinct on the mainland except in Western Australia; the greater stick&amp;hyphen;nest rat, which is extinct in over 90 per cent of its original range; the bridled nailtail wallaby, which once

          The whole project would cost only $1.9 million to set up. The fence, which is critical to getting it started, would cost about $300,000 to make it predator proof. But the 180 hectares there would allow a very cost-effective operation to maintain large numbers of these animals relative to keeping them in cages. The visitors' centre would cost probably $800,000 fitted out. Then you would need funds for water, power, roads, a large aviary, veterinary rooms, et cetera. It would cost less than $&amp;half; million a year to run and, as I say, the tourism alone would more than pay for that.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The ultimate aim is to release these bred animals back into the wild once we could control the predators such as foxes through immunocontraception programs, et cetera. We have had 19 releases of these sorts of animals into the wild in the past. They all failed because they have been cleaned up by foxes. One classic case was when 50 parma wallabies were released into the wild and all were killed within two months.

          —Like other members, I appreciate the concern of the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) for endangered species and welcome the motion that he has put before the House. It is an issue about which we should all be well informed and indeed alarmed. It is particularly important that we recognise and remedy the threats to habitats and ecosystems that are critical to the survival of existing species. We need to act to preserve our biodiversity, or at least what is left of it. It is not enough to act

         Let us look briefly at the state of play in Australia. We are one of the most biologically diverse areas of the world. In fact, we have had mega&amp;hyphen;diverse status conferred upon us. It is estimated that we have 10 per cent of the world's biodiversity. Indeed, many species are unique to Australia: 85 per cent of flowering plants, 84 per cent of mammals, 45 per cent of birds, 89 per cent of reptiles, 93 per cent of frogs and 85 per cent of temperate zone fish are endemic to Australia; in other words, they are found nowhere else.

In particular, little is known of the vast world of invertebrates and micro-organisms. I think it is important to emphasise that we depend on biodiversity for our survival and the quality of our lives. Again to quote the

         I think it is important that we recognise that all ecosystems in Australia have been modified in some way by human settlement—by us. Given the information available, the trends
         <break page="8622" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          are very disturbing. Five per cent of higher plants, 23 per cent of mammals, nine per cent of birds, seven per cent of reptiles, 16 per cent of amphibians and nine per cent of fresh water fish are extinct, endangered or highly vulnerable. Australia has the very unfortunate distinction of having the worst record of mammal extinctions in the world. Over the last 200 years of settlement we have lost 10 of 144 species of marsupials and eight of 53 species of native rodents.

         The greatest pressures on biodiversity come from the demands on natural resources made by increasing numbers of human beings, their growing affluence and changes in technology. Most important of all is habitat modification, especially the removal of native vegetation for agriculture, urban development and forestry. This has been and remains the most significant cause of loss of biodiversity.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have to look to our own patterns of settlement and our own demands on the environment. Of Australia's 80 terrestrial biogeographic regions, only five are considered to be largely natural. All the rest have been modified extensively. I think it is worth noting that nearly 70 per cent of all native vegetation has been removed or significantly modified. Of the nine per cent of pre-1788 Australia covered with forest, we have already lost 40 per cent through clearing. Seventy&amp;hyphen;five per cent of our rainforests have already been removed. Sixty per cent of coastal wetlands have gone, 90 per cent of temperate woodlands and mallee and also 99 per cent of temperate lowland grasslands in the south-east. Even the conservative WA government in its submission to the Industry Commission investigation on sustainable land management indicated:

Other pressures include the harvesting of native species and pollution of industry and urban areas from fertilisers and other chemicals used in agriculture and forestry.

         What of Australians' attitudes and how good are our policies? Australians generally clearly understand the importance of biodiversity as indicated by the fact that, when asked, they now rate destruction of habitat and ecosystems, the extinction of species and the degradation of land and water as among their major environmental concerns. The recent Industry Commission report indicates that:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . community demands for conservation of biodiversity . . . are not reflected in decisions about resource use.

         The Industry Commission report further argues that biodiversity and environmental amenity have characteristics which mean that society's values are not reflected in the market system and hence are not adequately incorporated in land management decisions. I love this quote, and I will use it many times in the future, especially since it comes from the Industry Commission, the driest of dry bodies. They say:

         Hear, hear! Even those programs that have been undertaken have not succeeded as well as we would have liked. Since 1989, programs such as Corridors of Green and One Billion Trees have resulted in the establishment and protection of 680,000 hectares in Australia, but over the first four years of that same period two million hectares were cleared for agricultural purposes. So we are still going backwards.

         The Industry Commission concluded in their report that the incorporation of the principles of ecologically sustainable development into state, local and federal government policies had been `ad hoc, incomplete and

          tentative'. This problem continues with the establishment of the Natural Heritage Trust. It is still ad hoc, incomplete and tentative.

We have seen no changes to the Natural Heritage Trust which would prevent those same criticisms.

         What is the present government doing? I am concerned that it is not attacking the question of biodiversity as directly as I and, I am sure, many members would like. There have been significant cuts to environmental funding over the first two years of the budget. Even with the sale of Telstra, there will be only marginal increases of funding for the environment. As yet, we have seen no clearly enunciated policy objectives. We are going to see a proliferation of ad hoc and small scale programs and a repeat of the problems of lack of coordination and clear outcomes and accountability identified by the Australian National Audit Office when reviewing landcare programs. We should learn from our past mistakes and shortcomings.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am also concerned that changes to pastoral leases under legislation before the House on native title will exacerbate overuse and degradation problems already identified in the pastoral industry. I have been disappointed that, when the opportunity has arisen, the government has so far failed to protect endangered species such as the dugong in the Hinchinbrook Channel.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Unfortunately, we have seen an acceleration of the rate of exploitation of native forests and a failure to protect significant forest habitats in some of the recently agreed forest plans, especially in East Gippsland. I am concerned that all governments, including the present one, have failed to act to curtail the clearing of native vegetation, especially in Queensland where there has been a recent and rapid increase in clearing for agricultural purposes. The data indicates that over 308,000 hectares of vegetation are being cleared every year in Queensland alone. I think it is important that we tie any future Commonwealth funding to the requirement to institute clearing controls.

          Unfortunately too, there has been a reduction in funding for the reclamation of the habitat of the mahogany sugar glider and for the repurchase of properties in the wet tropics world heritage area. In my own state there seems to be a tendency to allow for the possibility of oil and gas exploration and hence subsequent exploitation and danger to the Shark Bay world heritage area, a very mega&amp;hyphen;diverse area.

         <para first-indent="16">
          There have been significant cuts too, including a cut of 17 per cent in the first budget to the Australian Nature Conservation Authority, which is responsible for the endangered species program. Last of all, I urge the government not to flirt with the idea of agreeing to the damming of the Fitzroy River which would be a massive destruction of a unique ecosystem in Australia.

         Upon landfall, James Cook and naturalist Joseph Banks discovered a high diversity of unique animals and plant life totally alien to anything they had ever seen before. Occurring in a wide variety of habitats throughout our great south land of the new world, these unique animals captured the imagination and fascination of the old world of Europe. These animals included mammals, marsupials and monotremes amongst an animal world of great diversity, but 200 years of European occupation and activity have taken their toll on our precious and rare species.

         on 16 August this year on the threat to the wildlife in Sydney and its environs and that our failure to protect our wildlife heritage will also have a social, economic and environmental cost to us all. Dr Flannery states that 10,000 small things could be done to restore wildlife to Sydney. The city is fortunate in having substantial national parks near its centre and ringing its periphery, which would, once again, shelter and feed a diversity of marsupials. Control of foxes and cats, along with judicious reintroductions of native species, could see this become a reality. With appropriate management, many species could even be returned to the city's smaller reserves.

         Mr Deputy Speaker, you may be aware that in my electorate of Hughes there are two national parks in close proximity: the Royal and the Heathcote national parks. Contiguous to the Heathcote National Park are 20,000 hectares of natural bushland, which comprises the Holsworthy defence area. The combination of these vast tracks of natural environment continues to provide habitat to native fauna. However, the threat from foxes and

         Following on from the concerns expressed by Dr Flannery, I have had discussions with representatives from ANSTO located at Lucas Heights in my electorate. This organisation has a 1.6&amp;hyphen;metre buffer zone of well&amp;hyphen;fenced natural bushland which surrounds the facility and in which the grey swamp wallaby thrives in significant numbers. A program exists where excessive numbers from the wallaby mob are returned to the national parks on a regular basis. However, these wallabies, when fully grown, are sufficiently large enough to have protection from foxes and cats.

If the feasibility study is successful, ANSTO will welcome selected species of our precious little marsupials into the protected bushland environment of their buffer zone. This will also provide a valuable resource from which other colonies may be reintroduced into their areas of native environment when programs for the eradication of feral predators are shown to be successful.

         By breaking an 11&amp;hyphen;game hoodoo against Manly in their 22-16 victory, the Knights may have defied the tipsters but certainly not the avid faith and support of the whole Hunter community who were right behind them every step of the way. The guts, the determination, the skills and the never&amp;hyphen;say&amp;hyphen;die attitude of the Knights shone out on the field like a beacon—from man of the match, Robbie O'Davis, through to half, Andrew Johns, and the entire forward pack.

          —The Howard government's controversial changes to aged care start this Wednesday. They will have a particularly harsh effect on Australia's non-English speaking communities, because more than 15 per cent of the people in those communities are over 70 years of age.

         Australia has about 150 nursing homes and hostels, providing nearly 6,000 beds for elderly people from culturally diverse communities. In Melbourne and Sydney, the operators of the Jewish community homes for the aged have figured out that some residents may be asked to pay as much as $63.50 per day for their accommodation from 1 November. In addition, incoming residents will be required to put up an accommodation bond to contribute to the cost of their care. The Chairman of the Council on Jewish Aged Care—the well respected Professor Sol Encel—has condemned the government's changes for their negative impact on residential care facilities. The interplay between high levels of unemployment and a cultural commitment to take care of elderly parents is undermining confidence in Australia, undermining a sense of security.

         The aged care changes will be a huge financial burden on migrant communities. Migrants are attracted to Australia because they want to take care of their parents in a vibrant, free society which will help them build a better future for their families. Almost everything the Howard government has done since its term of office began has undermined their hopes that Australia in the 1990s will deliver to them what it delivered to previous waves of migrants from the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. They are the issues of the day, the very issues the government does not want to talk about—the attack on ordinary people.

         While government cannot ever take full responsibility—and nor should it—for parenting and responsibility in this regard, there is a place in Australia for governments to encourage cinema owners to see that parents are fully responsible when they choose to take children into these kinds of films. You can understand a child at the age of 11 or 12 being accompanied by a parent to such a film, but to take a child of four, five, six or seven years of age is an act of gross irresponsibility. I encourage cinema owners and responsible members of the public to see that this does not continue.

          —I thank the honourable member for his question. I inform the House that this morning I participated in the largest public share offer in Australia's history. The public offer document was launched in respect of the sale of one&amp;hyphen;third of Telstra, and the document is now available for consideration by all Australians.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would like to inform the House of some of the details contained in that offer document. The indicative price range is $2.80 to $3.30, and a price cap of $3.30 has been placed for the Australian retail investors who hold instalment receipts for 12 months.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          The sale will be by instalments. The first instalment will be at $1.95 for Australians and $2.00 for institutions. That instalment will be paid at the time that an investor applies for shares. The second instalment will occur on 17 November 1998.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The government has also decided that Australian investors will be guaranteed at least 70 per cent of the offer. I am sure all honourable members will recall that in the legislation up to 35 per cent is available for international investors. The considerable demand is reflected in the fact that over 2.3 million Australians registered or reserved the offer document over the past several weeks.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The first instalment price, as I have indicated, is $1.95 per share for Australian retail investors. The Australian retail discount on that first instalment will be 5c per share. There will be a further loyalty discount for Australian retail investors of 5c on the second payment.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The minimum allocation, again in line with the commitment the government made prior to the election, will be 400 shares. Those who reserved the offer document, when invited to do so prior to 12 September, will be guaranteed an entitlement 50 per cent above the minimum allocation. They will be guaranteed 600 shares.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In addition to that, there is an employee entitlement that again goes along with the commitment which the government made prior to the election. Employees of Telstra will be guaranteed up to 2,000 shares if they choose to invest. They will receive one extra share free for every four shares purchased, up to a maximum of 500 free shares. Telstra has also offered each eligible employee an interest free loan to help them buy up to 2,000 shares and to take advantage of the 500 extra shares.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As I have indicated, the offer document is available for consideration by all Australians as from today, and I will be circulating a copy of that document to all honourable members during the course of today. That public offer will open on 15 October and close three weeks later on 3 November. The employee offer and the broker firm offer will open on 15 October and close on 31 October.
          <break page="8631" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           The institutional offer will open on 27 October and close on 14 November.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The final price—which will, of course, be calculated through the institutional book build—will be announced by 16 November. Conditional trading of the instalment receipts is expected to commence on the Australian Stock Exchange on 17 November. When Telstra lists on the Australian Stock Exchange in mid&amp;hyphen;November, it is expected to rank in market capitalisation alongside Australia's largest company. Of course, as I have said already, it gives Australians an opportunity to participate in the telecommunications industry. This is the people's privatisation.

         <para first-indent="16">
          From the proceeds of this sale—I am sure honourable members would want me to remind them again—there will be $1.1 billion allocated to the Natural Heritage Fund; the biggest environmental clean&amp;hyphen;up in the nation's history. There will be a considerable repayment—depending, of course, upon what the proceeds are—of the national debt. We know what a problem that was. We know that, in the five years leading up to the election, the Labor government increased general government debt from $16 billion to $93 billion. This government has set about not just reducing the deficit but also clearing the national debt. The proceeds from the sale of Telstra will make a significant contribution to clearing up Labor's debt—the debt that they incurred in those five years prior to the change of government.

I have raised questions with the commission as to whether it should be making submissions to inquiries and committees on subjects on which it has no terms of reference given by the government. Under the act that governs the commission, it can only acquire references from the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General and it can only perform functions in relation to those references.

         The ALRC has done some valuable work in the past, but it does not have unlimited resources. Those resources ought to be devoted to the functions conferred on it by statute.

The committee recommended that the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General continue to have sole power to make references to the Law Reform Commission, and that the commission should be limited to making suggestions.

         As I informed the House last week, one of the major obstacles to learning to read and write for many young Australians is the lack of time in the school curriculum. The primary curriculum has become grossly overcrowded and there is a need for responsible school

         The House would be aware that the Commonwealth government has taken a strong stand on this issue to ensure that all young Australians will be able to read and write at a satisfactory level by the end of year 3. I am pleased to inform the House that one state government has now clearly taken up the challenge to address this vital task.

         Last week, the Olsen government in South Australia announced that every child in the first three years of schooling will spend between 70 and 90 minutes per day learning to read and write. The South Australian government has become the first state or territory government to mandate a specific time for literacy in the primary curriculum in the first three years of schooling.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It has also announced that the overcrowded curriculum will be reviewed to make time for more literacy learning, and that parents in South Australia will be able to compare results at similar schools across the state. I congratulate the South Australian Minister of Education, Rob Lucas, on this important and far&amp;hyphen;sighted policy. South Australia is now taking crucial steps to expand reporting to parents and to expand opportunities for young people in that state to gain the basic literacy skills. This is good news for all South Australians.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Also good news is the decision of the Commonwealth government to supplement recurrent funding to schools in the states and territories by 7.4 per cent for 1997—a real increase of 3.2 per cent over the CPI for the relevant period. With the Olsen government now on the front foot on literacy and with the Adelaide Crows triumphant, things are looking up in South Australia.

         As the host country, Australia was able to provide a technical briefing for one of the afternoons, and here we showed off our expertise in telemedicine. Australia is as advanced or more advanced than any country in the world in telemedicine. Today, if a person has a road accident in Alice Springs, the neurosurgeon can look at the CT scans and decide whether or not the person should be evacuated prior to that evacuation taking place. As every evacuation costs $25,000, it is incredibly cost effective as well as providing emergency care in a way that could not have been dreamed of a number of years ago. Most countries in the region, because of either their physical isolation or their size, were particularly interested in our expertise in telemedicine. I hope it provides very substantial commercial opportunities for Australia in the future.

         As a result, the customers that are borrowing from banks on the standard mortgage of Australia are paying nearly $317 less in interest than they were under the Labor Party; that is, $317 less in interest, which goes in their pockets. This has also had an effect in relation to home affordability, which is now at the best peak that it has been for some time. The Citibank REIA index shows that it increased by 1.7 per cent in the June quarter and it is the highest since 1994. The Commonwealth Bank HIA index shows the same.

         Here you have the Labor Party which raised to an art form this kind of material. Here you have the Leader of the Opposition unable to do anything to the shadow finance minister, who is sitting back there. There is one person who cannot show any leadership in this parliament and he sits opposite. He masquerades as a temporary Leader of the Opposition.

It has been up to this government to insist that taxpayers' money be properly spent and spent efficiently. That is in sharp contrast to the policies which led to the massive budget deficit that this government was landed with when it came into office.

It is one thing to have a law passed in the parliament; it is another thing to have effective means to assist small business to ensure that law protects them. For example, we will be immediately appointing two small business commissioners to the ACCC. We will also appoint a full&amp;hyphen;time small business commissioner to the ACCC at the next vacancy, and we will also be amending the Trade Practices Act to require any government in the future to appoint to the ACCC persons with experience in small business matters.

         This is perhaps a longer answer than the Leader of the House should give, but let me conclude by saying that when I got the small business job, when the Prime Minister rang and asked me to take it, I said I would look forward to doing so. I want to say to the members of the committee that when I first read that report—it was a few days after I had accepted the job—I said to myself, `Gee, I think the government has raised expectations pretty high here and we have bitten off perhaps a bit more than we can chew.' I want to say that at the end of the process, after all the tremendous consultations we, as a group, have had together with the small business community, we raised expectations and tomorrow we are going to fulfil them.

          —Mr Speaker, I have already canvassed these matters at some length both here and elsewhere, but can I take the opportunity that the Leader of the Opposition's question affords me to table a few documents. I table, first of all, a statement by Mr John Sutherland, dated 25 September 1997; a letter dated 26 September 1997 addressed to me by my former chief of staff, Grahame Morris; two documents, both dated 25 September, from Miss Fiona McKenna; two letters of termination, one to Mr Morris and one to Miss McKenna, from myself, dated 26 September; a minute of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet dated 26 September, signed by Miss Philomena Bisshop, and also another minute signed by her. The first minute is addressed to Mr Blick, the deputy secretary to the department; the other is addressed to the secretary to the department. Those two minutes bear upon the matter that I referred to at the beginning of my press conference on Friday.

         Can I simply add that, as recounted to the House last week, the first general reference to this matter I received from Mr Morris was in circumstances which both he and I have confirmed. I had a subsequent discussion with Mr Sharp on Monday. As a result of that, I requested certain information. When that information was received, because of its deficiencies I requested further information, and that ran into the discussions I then had with Mr Sharp and Mr Jull and also the secretary and, I think, one other senior officer of the department.

You can plead that that was 13 years ago. If this had come out 13 years ago, we would have been saved many of the difficulties in relation to travel matters. You know that and you made that mistake.

The second thing that comes out very clearly from last week is that I knew nothing of the matters relating to Mr Sharp or Mr Jull until a little over a week ago in the circumstances that have been described by both Mr Morris and myself.

The member for Cowper should also tell the veterans in his electorate, as should all members of this House, that those who have taken out an additional loan at the rate of 10 percentage points will have that additional loan rolled into this new loan.

I found that we had built surface ships which cannot defend themselves, and so we are faced with the task of fixing that up.

I also think that the remarks he had to make both at the presentation ceremony and also when he returned to Newcastle was a reminder of the enormous psychological boost of this particular victory on the Hunter Valley. I am sure that, right across the political divide in this parliament, there is great delight at the impact psychologically of that victory. There is also a reminder that, despite the difficulties through which Newcastle and the Hunter Valley have passed in recent months—and they are undoubted—there are many things on the bright side that one can look at.

         For example, a decision was taken by my government only a few weeks ago to commit some $15 million out of the special infrastructure grants program to assist in the construction of the Redbank power station. That particular project will not only be of great importance to industry in the Hunter Valley but also be of considerable psychological value and considerable employment value. There was the decision which I announced when I visited the north of England in June this year regarding the construction of the Hawk lead&amp;hyphen;in fighter at the Williamtown base. There are other projects that are getting towards the stage of favourable consideration. I want to say on this side of the House that the efforts of the member for Paterson, who asked me this question, have been absolutely prodigious.

         Can I finally say that we have a Leader of the Opposition and a principal spokesman on this matter neither of whom believe that I was informed of these matters before I have repeatedly stated to the parliament that I was. In those circumstances—particularly because it is coming from people who engaged in a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, and coming from people who conspired to ignore the advice of the Crown Solicitor and the head of the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's Department—when it comes to calling for judicial inquiries, neither of those gentlemen has any credibility at all.

         The government is closely monitoring the situation in Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia and has issued travel advices alerting Australians to the detrimental effects to health which may be caused by the severe smog in the region. Australians considering travelling to the worst affected region, Sarawak, have been advised to defer non-essential travel until air quality improves. I emphasise that that is official travel advising from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. We are closely monitoring the situation of those Australians already in Sarawak but have been advised that the airport in Kuching has re&amp;hyphen;opened and that seats are available on flights out of the area.

It is true that for many years the adjournment debate was not broadcast, but this was changed in 1994 and since then the adjournment debate has been included in the broadcast. The application of privilege in respect of the broadcast of the adjournment debate is now the same as for other proceedings.

          today reports that 140 members of parliament were sent `please explain' notes about their travelling allowance records by accountancy company KPMG after an audit of travelling allowance claims. In May this year, the Department of the House of Representatives commissioned its internal auditor, KPMG, to undertake an audit of members' travelling allowance payments made in 1995&amp;hyphen;96 and 1996&amp;hyphen;97. A similar audit is being undertaken in relation to senators. The timing of the audit means that it extends to members of this parliament and to former members of the 37th Parliament.

         —I claim to have been misrepresented by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and other ministers on a number of occasions, including in question time today, in relation to their suggestion that I was involved with the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in a police conspiracy or `police cover&amp;hyphen;up conspiracy' as it was described.

        I will very briefly retail the facts of this matter for the record once again. First, the police themselves did not at any stage seek to investigate that matter. What did happen was that the two senior members of my department, the departmental head, Mr Brazil and the Acting Crown Solicitor, Mr Sherman, in discussion with the senior officers of the Department of the Special Minister of State, did suggest that a reference to the police might be an appropriate course to follow. When that view was retailed to me and the matter was brought to my attention by Minister Beazley, as he then was, my reaction was that a police investigation at that stage would be premature—and I used the expression `at this stage'—given that there had not been a full departmental investigation.

        When the results of that investigation came to hand and it became a matter then of deciding, in the light of that investigation and the conclusion of the matter by the senator in question repaying the amount, I took the view—and I make no apology for it in the circumstances of the time—that, for a variety of reasons, including the past practice of the Fraser&amp;hyphen;Howard government in similar matters and the fact that the public purse had not been prejudiced in this matter and the fact that there had been vigorous denial and the fact that there had been a whack over the wrists of the man in question—

        Navy: Service Recognition

        To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament:
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        This petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are still the only Australians, sent overseas on active service, whose service has not been recognised in three important areas:
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        1. R.A.N. casualties are not yet included on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial alongside Army and R.A.A.F. casualties;
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        2. R.A.N. service has not yet been recognised with the visible signs of service to Australia; the Returned from Active Service Badge and the Naval campaign medal;
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        3. R.A.N. service is still not acknowledged as eligible service for the Australian Service Pension, while service by Commonwealth and allied veterans from 55 other countries is.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Members of the Army and R.A.A.F. who served during the same period in Malaya had their service fully recognised 24 hours after arriving in Malaya.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        In the 1997 Budget the Government partly recognised that R.A.N. service was `operational' and accepted responsibility for disabilities resulting from that service. Those affected appreciate the belated, partial recognition. However, government departments are still resorting to old, and inventing new excuses, to deny the above 3 points.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Your petitioners therefore request that the House acts to help remove the injustice of 40 years and fully recognise R.A.N. service by providing the same recognition and benefits for that service. The cost will be minuscule, being mainly a transfer of pensions from `age' as paid by the Department of Social Security, to `service' pensions, paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs.

I want to congratulate members of the opposition for the overwhelming support that I have received from them in relation to this motion.

He and I joined those striking miners, the men at the picket line, to indicate our support to them. We joined their spouses and their kids, who went up there as well to show their support for what their husbands and their fathers were trying to do.

          Let me deal with some of the issues in turn—first of all, the port of Cairns. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business and Leader of the House (Mr Reith) and this government thought that they would have an easy win at the port of Cairns. They thought the handful of union members would be easy to pick off. They did not move into Sydney and they did not move into Mel

           bourne; they moved into the port of Cairns where seven union stevedores were working on the wharves. They thought they were easy pickings. They thought, `Seven of them. We'll pick them off one after the other. We'll pick the weak spot.'

          What they failed to understand was that there is not just a national trade union movement; there is an international trade union movement. For that reason, I have taken the opportunity in this motion to congratulate the transport workers federation of the world, which came to the defence of those seven union stevedores. They said to the international stevedore company Freeport, in effect, `You can be used as cannon fodder by the Australian government, but you operate around the world and it may be dangerous for you to do that.'
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I understand that, apart from indicating their concern to Freeport, there were no threats or intimidation. But Freeport very sensibly withdrew the demand that the ships up there be loaded and unloaded by non&amp;hyphen;union labour. They are now being loaded and unloaded by union labour. What a magnificent result. Seven union stevedores were picked off by the national government in Australia, but found support in the unity of workers around the world. The International Transport Federation said, `We'll stand with you,' and they won.

They know struggle and they have been strengthened by it. Stop trying to humble and humiliate them. Treat them with the dignity and the respect which all Australians are entitled to receive. Accept that production is a social process in which all participants—including those who supply capital, those who supply management and those who supply labour—are entitled to be included and entitled to be considered.

          There has not even been unanimity in relation to the implications of the government's Workplace Relations Act, and the philosophy that lies behind it, for the industry itself. Richard Hein, the Managing Director of
          <break page="8656" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           P&amp;O, one of the major stevedore companies in Australia, said that this government `had no proper understanding of the complexity of the whole subject'. Chris Corrigan, the Chairman of Patricks, another major stevedoring company, said:

           The other thing that Richard Hein said was that he had told the Howard government to `put up or shut up' on waterfront reform. He described the recent rhetoric of this government as `unhelpful and becoming boring'. Both Mr Corrigan and Mr Hein rejected government claims that the only way to increase productivity was to take on the unions. That is what they were told. They were told, particularly by the former Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr Sharp, to take on the unions. Mr Sharp said:

          This government was hoping that it would be able to use the sensible, balanced management of corporations which were prepared to negotiate, prepared to sit down with unions and prepared to come to sensible, balanced, civilised arrangements. They thought that they could put legislation in place and then say to corporations in Australia, `We've given you the legislation, now go for their throats.' These corporations are not so stupid. Does anyone think that they are going to throw away their future, their competence and their performing capacity just to play this government's dirty, grubby, stinking little games by attacking the union movement and the unionists? The people who are involved in industry have got much more sense.

          —That was a bit of a giggle, wasn't it? Back to the future with the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown)—let's go back and re&amp;hyphen;regulate the labour market in Australia; let's try to force the people somehow to make unions relevant in 1997 and perhaps the year 2000. The honourable member for Charlton knows as well as anyone that union membership in Australia has fallen over the last 10 years by about 10 per cent—that is, about one per cent a year. It is now down to below 25 per cent of the private sector employment market. That means that three&amp;hyphen;quarters of Australians that work in the private sector do not want to have anything to do with unions. They make a voluntary choice.

         However, if you work in the coalmining industry or on the wharves you do not have a choice. This government has brought in legislation on this—the Workplace Relations Act, which came into force on 31 December 1996. Amongst a lot of other things, it says that for the first time Australians have the right of association—freedom of association. It sounds like a simple concept. It sounds like something that might be in the constitution, but it is not. Everybody believes in freedom of association. You can associate with whom
         <break page="8657" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         What that means in the context of the Workplace Relations Act is that you can be a member of a union if you like, but you do not have to. Tell that to the members of the CFMEU. They do not believe in that. Why? Because the CFMEU controls employment in the coalmines in the Hunter Valley. Because it controls it, it can guarantee a closed shop.

         At the coalmine we are talking about income levels of coalminers are very high. The lowest paid worker in the Hunter earns about $55,000 per year. Industrial action in the coal industry is 45 times the national average. Why? Because they have a monopoly on the supply of labour. That means that your son or daughter cannot get a job in the coalmines in the Hunter unless they join the ALP and then join the CFMEU.

It does not do to do a full day's work for a full day's pay. No, we need the CFMEU and the MUA to make sure that our jobs and all our lurks and perks are absolutely protected.

         I think the conflict between the CFMEU and Rio Tinto really stemmed from the company's successful move to Allstaff in its operations outside the coalmining industry. The CFMEU and one of their officials admitted under cross-examination in the AIRC recently that the objective of the union in the disputes at Rio Tinto is to force Rio Tinto out of the coal industry. The union will make sure that the owners of the mine cannot survive. That is really brilliant stuff for Australia, isn't it? That helps our productivity. It helps our standard of living. It makes all of us really feel better.

          This motion by the member for Charlton is an absolute nonsense. I think it is really enough to make you sick. He wants to go back 30, 40 or 50 years, when we know that the only way for Australia is to move forward. He supports not the workers of Australia but those highly protected dinosaurs on the waterfront and in the coalmines—the ones that have the protection of the big union. And he talks about the powerful company. In these two sections of the labour market, the power resides not with the company or the government but with the unions.

If they are so sure that they are in the right on this issue, why don't they support arbitration? If seniority is such an important issue to the member for La Trobe and others, why don't they simply bring in the independent arbiter? What is their concern?

         Mr Deputy Speaker, what you must understand is that Rio Tinto has been running a very nasty public relations exercise with respect to this dispute, which is now more than four months old. It has been running petty stories like the one about how tradesmen at the Hunter Valley No. 1 mine are only allowed to change a light globe, implying that it is a matter of pulling a stool out, standing up on it and twisting a globe. How ridiculous! What a misrepresentation of the facts.

         The simple fact of the matter is that changing a globe requires tools. Who is provided with tools? Tradespersons only. Who makes that decision? Management makes that decision, of course, and probably for very good reasons. Involved here, no doubt, are occupational health and safety issues. This has been the approach. The approach has been to undermine community support for those workers at the Hunter Valley No. 1 mine and their families. I am pleased to be able to report to the House that this sort of rubbish has been unsuccessful, even though their tactics in this matter know no bounds.

          —This motion put forward by the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) with all this nice sounding, flowery language about worker solidarity and `united we stand' is about one thing and one thing only: the union movement trying to justify its monopoly position over labour in key sectors like the coal industry and the waterfront in Australia in 1997. It is that monopoly position that has been used to extort high wages, questionable working conditions and unproductive work practices in both of those industries.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We know the workers on the waterfront and in the coal industry, which the member for Charlton defends, earn up to $80,000 a year for 35&amp;hyphen;hour weeks and for questionable work practices, and they get a whole lot of perks along the line. Yet the member for Charlton is saying that they are not well paid. Any average battler out there would fully understand that $80,000 to $100,000 a year is a well&amp;hyphen;paid position.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The position of those workers in the coal industry and on the waterfront can be maintained only by their monopoly power. They have the monopoly because there are few workers on the waterfront and because of the coal industry's long tradition. I predict that those monopoly powers will not last indefinitely. That has been proved by the operation of the reserve price in the wool industry, that
         <break page="8660" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          this House put into position. Inevitably that fell over. Inevitably the oil industry with the OPEC nations fell over when a cartel was put into position. In relation to Bunker Hunt, who tried to corner the silver market, that monopoly or cartel position fell over.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So attempts by the member for Charlton in this motion to maintain this monopoly position is doomed to failure in the longer term. That was the situation in the UK under the Thatcher government when the waterside workers tried to maintain a similar monopoly position. They did not want to listen to governments of both colours, Labour and Conservative. Inevitably the change in the law ensured that the monopoly of the waterfront workers in that country was no longer maintained. Likewise in New Zealand, while it took some time, the monopoly position has no longer been maintained.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We saw the case in Cairns where seven workers wanted to maintain the monopoly position in that smaller port, as the member for Charlton was explaining. They were in such great trouble that they had to pull in the International Transport Workers Federation to exert again monopoly pressure on the employers of the stevedores in that port. So that dispute was about the right of that company to opt for in-house stevedoring services, but it was coerced by the MUA with the assistance of the international organisation.

         In no other commercial context would an extortion of this nature be acceptable. It would be punished by law. Imagine if an insurance company threatened to burn a customer's house down unless the owner bought insurance from that company. We would be quite rightly horrified. That is the comparison we can draw. If the boycotts, bans, verbal abuse or threats of violence were all used by a supermarket chain to prevent customers from using an alternative grocery store, they would stand condemned. How do members opposite defend that?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Why should the MUA use strikes, picket lines, verbal abuse of other workers and their families, and international pressure to force a company to use a contractor which the MUA prefers? How do members opposite defend that position? Is the member for Charlton's

          idea of Australia's traditional and civilised approach to negotiation part of this particular background? Why should the unions be permitted to act in ways which we will not tolerate in any other commercial context?

         This government has responded to these positions by introducing section 127 in the Workplace Relations Act, which enables companies to seek a court order to require a return to work so the companies can ask the workers to go back to work rather than being in this monopoly position. This government has also responded by revising the secondary boycott measures at sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. This government has put in common law positions to ensure that the monopolistic intimidating unions are not able to bring about the chaos they have done historically.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Ultimately, as the member opposite would know, the only way to ensure job security in any enterprise is to ensure that it becomes as competitive as possible. Jobs are kept if the industry is profitable. In the case of the waterfront, you can no longer make it a monopoly position where the union movement and the stevedores are in bed together to ensure that the farmers, the exporters and the importers pay exorbitantly high rates.

          During this generation, there has been an accelerating trend towards concentration of economic power in fewer and fewer persons. . . . The power of the greatest corporations transcends that of most governments. A reaction to the submergence of the individual worker is the demand by organised workers for some share in deciding what work is to be done, by whom and when, where, and how it is to be done. The thrust of the demand is not merely the improvement in existing pay and conditions. It extends to the protection of jobs, for themselves and other workers, but it is more than that; it is a demand to be treated as more than wage&amp;hyphen;hands—to be treated as men and women who should be informed about decisions which might materially affect their future, and to be consulted on them.

This government is not about that; this government is about crushing workers and about destroying their working conditions.

The sum of $100 million plus is circulated throughout the Cairns region through International Purveyors. There is a risk that we could lose that business in Cairns.

         If you want to talk about agreements, I would suggest you have a talk to some of the workers in Comalco up in Weipa. They were prepared to stand up and talk to the companies. When you talk to the workers who brokered the deals, they tell you that they are getting a far better deal now than they ever got from the unions. They were forced to accept the lowest common denominator that was imposed on them by the unions. They have come out with far better prospects and, of course, far better conditions and rates of pay. They were able to do it because they were confident of their own ability. They knew they could do the job. They did not hide behind the union. They were able to get up there and broker a deal. At the end of the day, they benefited, their families benefited, and the community benefited. It is something that could happen across the whole spectrum.

Ever since the Howard government was elected to office in March 1996 various ministers have been threatening industrial confrontation in order to smash the two most significant trade union organisations in Australia, the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union and, of course, the Maritime Union of Australia. The labour movement, political and industrial, will unswervingly back these two unions against the union smashing agenda of this government—not `if', `but' or `maybe'.

Taxpayers' money is being used to fund a war chest against that trade union movement.

         A fortnight ago we saw the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) involve himself so intimately in the industrial dispute on the Cairns waterfront. He came into the House and was boastful about all the telephone calls he made late at night to the owners of International Purveyors. But the minister, obviously, was not too aware that his provocative calls would fall on deaf ears and that the years of association and support that the MUA has provided to the ITF, in the campaign to clean up the ships of shame, would have paid dividends.

         The minister also admitted to briefing Rio Tinto management on the government's submission to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission as to whether the AIRC should arbitrate this damaging dispute. It is no surprise that the submission was against arbitration; a submission which argued against the national interest of settling disputes. It is clear that the government has the unions in its sights and it needs the employers on the waterfront and in the coalmines to actually do the battle. The problem for the government is that it, as yet, has been unable to identify one employer on the waterfront to be the dummy for its battle. It has one employer, Rio Tinto, in the Hunter Valley.

I sometimes wonder if any on the other side have ever been down a coalmine or ever been near a coalmine. Have they ever looked at the record of safety in a coalmine? Would they go down a coalmine?

Then we can have a real, decent debate on it and you will be shown that your figures are wrong. They are figments of the imagination which you constantly trot out.

         There is no doubt in mind, and it is the reason that I have joined this debate, that there is an increasing need every day for reform of the waterfront. At stake are the jobs of many thousands of Australians in small businesses. Certainly, in my electorate there are people who are struggling to meet the costs of export and import which are imposed by so many of the rorts on the waterfront. This nation is held captive by the Maritime Union of Australia. They run the ACTU and, of course, the ACTU runs the Australian Labor Party. It provides funds for elections and, of course, pre&amp;hyphen;selections. Pre&amp;hyphen;selections are probably at the top of the minds of the honourable members opposite contributing today.

         They are certainly not showing themselves to be strong advocates for workers, unlike people on this side who are standing very strongly for freedom of association. We do not see any need for compulsion. We are standing up for ordinary workers, unlike those opposite who are standing up for the $80,000 to $90,000 a year club—the earning elite—who are the Maritime Union of Australia members. Ordinary workers have my support, but I am not convinced those opposite are offering support to ordinary workers in Australia. They are, instead, protesting the innocence of the real featherbedders—the people who are living off the hard work of their own grandfathers and fathers in a job that was essentially handed down to them.

         I have to tell you there are workers in my electorate who are absolutely furious day in and day out with the wharfies of this country. They see an unreasonable level of extortion oriented wages paid to a bunch of people who barely work each week. Conditions and structures that are in place in jobs in my electorate are nowhere near as good as what is happening on the waterfront all because these guys have traditionally held Australians and Australian workers to ransom.

          If the same conditions existed in small businesses in my electorate there would be no businesses left standing. Every one of them would have to shut tomorrow. At the same time I have a growing band of small businesses in my electorate, exporters, who want to try to send things offshore but can never be 100 per cent sure that their business plans are not going to be jeopardised by unions like the MUA.

          Let us look at the benefits. The honourable member for Throsby wanted us to talk about some facts. Here are the facts. We are talking about people who are working a 35&amp;hyphen;hour week. When you subtract things like tea breaks and crib time involved in getting to and from those breaks—they shuffle to and from these breaks and that crib time is worth about seven minutes each way, that is, 28 minutes a shift—then the amount drops to 28.9 hours a week. Unlike all other workers in Australia, the wharfies are paid for tea breaks—they are probably going to get a sugar allowance next—and for the crib time as well.

          Then there is the infamous nick—when people clock on and their working mates, the ones who stay, cover for them while these blokes nick off and still get paid. If you consider there are 52 weeks a year, wharfies do not get four weeks off. All up they total about 17 weeks off a year. There is a total of 261 workings days in a year. Five weeks annual leave, 10 days sick leave, four days long service leave and eleven public holidays come off that.

         At this point in our history we should reflect on the fact that this Prime Minister (Mr Howard) cut his political teeth in a Fraser government which had an appalling industrial relations record. The Prime Minister appears to have learnt nothing from that dismal experience. He was part of a tory government that presided over an industrial relations system that was riddled with conflict, an industrial culture corrupted on all sides of the industrial fence. It was up to the Hawke and Keating governments to sort out the dreadful

The reforms that Labor in government instituted introduced industrial flexibility and changed the industrial climate to a cooperative and rational one while at all times being sensitive to maintaining the award wages and the conditions of workers. The direct result of those policies was a massive reduction in industrial disputation and the creation of a civilised culture of negotiation, conciliation and arbitration in industrial relations.

          —I am amazed but not surprised that the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) calls on the House to applaud the actions of the waterside and maritime unions which blackmailed this nation. As recently as 1994, the Labor members of this House, despite being voted into their positions by the people, were reminded that they are required to be a member of a union. What we are seeing today is the member for Charlton dancing to the tune of his union puppet masters. For decades the waterside and maritime unions have held this country to ransom. Their tactics are simple: blackmail, bullying, threats and intimidation; and, if all that fails, lies and then the Labor Party.

         We have just seen the ACTU secretary, Bill Kelty, threaten the nation with union instigated war.

This is the same Bill Kelty who applauded Bob Hawke's use of troops in the form of the Royal Australian Air Force to break up the national pilots strike in 1989—a matter raised by my friend the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch). The pilots union was not a member of Labor's ACTU. Those workers were not to be protected; they were to be destroyed.

          —I rise today in this grievance debate to raise two issues about two very different parts of the world, yet two places that are in very close proximity to each other and in which Australia played, and is continuing to play, a key role in ensuring that there is peace and stability in this pivotal part of the world: the Middle East.

         Firstly, I wish to highlight the tremendous role Australia's peacekeeping forces are playing, scattered as they are, in so many places throughout the world. These members of our armed forces are working as key members of both the United Nations forces and other multinational forces. This afternoon in the grievance debate I wish to highlight a very special and somewhat unique force: a one-off group situated far from home, a group
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          of 26 Australians consisting of 25 men and one woman. These Australian soldiers are doing Australia proud.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I must admit that, like so many others in this place, I had only a rough idea that Australia contributes to several peacekeeping operations somewhere in the world. Apart from being aware of our commitment at times of international crises when it is featured on the television, I, like most of us in this House, would be blissfully unaware of the tremendous job our armed forces who serve in both UN and other multinational forces are doing. Unless we as politicians manage to visit countries where Australians are operating as both UN troops or multinational troops, we will continue to be ignorant of their effectiveness. Perhaps there might be a job here for someone in the public relations sector of the Department of Defence.

         I and five other members of federal parliament had the privilege whilst in Egypt just over a week ago to travel to the Sinai and to meet one such group of Australian soldiers: members of the MFO. What does MFO stand for? MFO stands for Multinational Force and Observers. It is a rather unique collection of armed forces from many nationalities: United States, Colombia, Fiji, Bangladesh, France, Canada, New Zealand, Norway, Hungary and, last but not least, Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Following the cessation of hostilities between the Arab states and Israel flowing from the Yom Kippur war of the early 1970s and in the peace discussions that followed, the MFO was set up as one of the key instruments that came out of the Camp David accord brokered by President Carter with President Sadat of Egypt and Prime Minister Begin of Israel. The MFO's role is to monitor the troop deployments of both Egypt and Israel in the Sinai and to ensure that each country is complying with the stated agreements signed at Camp David.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Unlike the UN peacekeeping forces currently in Bosnia, as one example, the MFO is not responsible and accountable to the United Nations. Rather, it is responsible to and headed up by a secretariat based in Rome and answerable to the three countries which pay for its continued existence—the United States,
         <break page="8668" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Egypt and Israel. I might add that these three countries contribute $15 million a year to this MFO force.

        <para first-indent="16">
         During this grievance debate, I would like to place on the record not only my but the rest of the delegation's congratulations to Colonel Nick Slingsby and the Aussie task force for the magnificent role they are playing in the various key positions they hold in the MFO and the Sinai. I would also like to express our delegation's appreciation for the wonderful hospitality shown to us on the night of 18 September at North Camp outside El Arish. The Annzac Cove—and it is not A&amp;hyphen;n&amp;hyphen;z&amp;hyphen;a&amp;hyphen;c; it is A&amp;hyphen;n&amp;hyphen;n&amp;hyphen;z&amp;hyphen;a&amp;hyphen;c, the Australia, Norway and New Zealand Army Corp—really hummed along and we who were there will never forget that marvellous night when we Aussies, so far away from home, showed just how important this place we call Australia is to all of us.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Australian service personnel of the MFO had two gripes—firstly, and understandably, the lack of Australian beer in the desert and, secondly, which I think is the most important, the fact that the Defence department only allows them to have six free minutes a month to speak with their loved ones back home. We found this absolutely ridiculous—six minutes a month, and most of them have young families. It is marvellous when the American forces have arranged with their telecommunications carrier to have real discounted phone calls back home. One wonders what Telecom, Optus and the Defence department might consider doing to help these guys and the young lady thousands and thousands of miles away from home to rectify this rather ridiculous situation.

         The second issue I wish to raise in this grievance debate is that of the 604 missing and unaccounted for Kuwaitis resulting from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in the early 1990s. As well as visiting Egypt, our delegation also visited Kuwait. I was proud to be part of the six&amp;hyphen;person Australian parliamentary delegation—the first by an Australian parliament—to visit that wonderful country. Kuwait, as everyone knows, was the scene for the Gulf War in the early 1990s. Once again, Australian service personnel served superbly

          and proudly in this theatre of war to ensure that Kuwait was finally liberated.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Our party travelled throughout Kuwait being shown many of the battle sites and the devastation wrought on this country by the Iraqis on their invasion of, their occupation of and their subsequent withdrawal from this rather small nation state. I was also proud to be part of the delegation's visit to a rather sensitive part of that world—the demilitarised zone on the Kuwait&amp;hyphen;Iraq border—and, once again, to see this time the UN multinational force operating to ensure that there is some peace and stability in this rather sensitive part of the world. Even though Australian service personnel were not on service at the Kuwait&amp;hyphen;Iraq border area, they had been there previously. It was interesting to note the high recommendations by those who had served with them.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I said, this area of concern for the 604 Kuwaitis is one of the principal areas of concern for everyone who lives in Kuwait. The 604 Kuwaitis include many women and children who were taken by the Iraqis during the occupation of Kuwait and the subsequent time when they were fleeing the advancing liberating forces. Despite a very prolonged and constant international pressure not only by Kuwait but also by those who served in the Gulf War area to liberate Kuwait, Iraq has continued to fail to respond to requests over the past five years just to simply resolve the concerns of Kuwaiti families to learn of the fate of these 604 people.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As we met the Amir, the Prime Minister and various cabinet ministers, time and time again it was conveyed to us that not knowing the fate of 604 compatriots is probably the most pivotal concern that these people have. To us, 604 does not mean much but, when there are such few Kuwaitis—600,000&amp;hyphen;odd of them—this is a considerable number of their population.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I said to the people that when we came back to Australia we would once again highlight the need for international pressure to be put on Iraq to at least let the Kuwaitis know the fate of those persons—whether they are still alive, whether they are still incarcerated, whether they have been put to death. Not
         <break page="8669" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          knowing five years after these people have been taken is inconceivable to me and to all members of the delegation. It is inconceivable that this should still be taking place.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Visiting those two sensitive areas and seeing the pivotal role of Australian peacekeepers, I would like to compliment them all and tell them that we have not forgotten them. We do appreciate the wonderful work that they do. If there is anything we can do, even something as simple as getting them cheap phone calls and some Australian beer, we will not forget them and we will work to ensure that their concerns and their grievances are noted.

          —I want to grieve today about unemployment and, in doing so, I want to focus on one of the ways we may reduce it. As members of this House would be aware, unemployment has been stuck at about 8.7 per cent for 15 months. Despite the government having achieved persistent low inflation, an anticipated budget surplus, good growth, low interest rates and a more competitive dollar, jobs are not picking up.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the 1950s and 1960s, Australia had an unemployment rate of under one per cent. During the 1970s, it rose to almost seven per cent. Although it returned to under six per cent in the 1980s, by 1992, in response to Keating's recession, it jumped to over 11 per cent.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The severity of the 1992 recession, with the high interest rates that closed so many small businesses, has left a legacy in the form of the long-term unemployed, who make up almost a third of those who are currently unemployed. Recessions have always left behind this type of legacy and, in this regard, the deliberately engineered recession of 1992 was worse than most.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The long-term unemployed and those entering the work force not only have to contend with the aftermath of Labor's disastrous recession; they also have to face changes in the nature of the world's economies. Globalisation has reduced the demand for low skill jobs, many of which have moved off
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          shore to developing countries. At the same time, the technological revolution has seen a shift in emphasis from low skilled to higher skilled labour. As we move into the next century, the demand for high skilled workers will increase. At the same time, proportionately, the demand for low skilled workers in traditional areas will decrease.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Training will be important to get people into higher skilled jobs, but we must accept that there is a certain proportion of the population who, for a whole variety of reasons, be it talent or circumstances, will not be able to access these jobs. These people now make up a significant proportion of the long-term unemployed and will form an increasingly significant part of the new unemployed as opportunities for the low skilled continue to decrease.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Multiplying our industries is obviously one way of providing jobs for the low skilled, but as computers have replaced manual labour in so many areas, industry is not the great employer it once was. As more high skilled jobs become available in emerging industries—in particular, in information technology—those with higher skills potential will be able to move out of the low skilled jobs which they presently occupy into high skilled work, leaving more positions available for the low skilled.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As the reality of low inflation, low interest rates, sustainable high growth, the low dollar and the budget surplus increase business confidence and activity, the overall job market will grow. But at the end of the day, globalisation and technological change will leave a significant proportion of people with low skills without jobs. As it is essential that these people not be excluded from the workplace, strategies have to be found to increase their participation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One such strategy is allowing wages for the unskilled to decrease sufficiently so as to make them attractive to potential employers who cannot afford to employ them at current rates. Such a solution is known in Europe as the Anglo&amp;hyphen;Saxon solution. Indeed, in the UK and the USA, lower wages have brought about fuller employment. The cost has been
         <break page="8670" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          high, with an emerging class of working poor in both countries.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A solution that establishes a class of working poor is not acceptable in Australia and is contrary to Liberal philosophy, which has as its core the belief that people who work should obtain sufficient income for a reasonable standard of living. John Stuart Mill called it `the amount of income needful for life, health and immunity from bodily pain'. On the one hand then, we have the alternative of no work and welfare dependency; on the other hand, work with inadequate wages—both of which are antipathetic to Liberal philosophy.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The solution is in the tax system. If the only way to increase low skilled employment is to let wages drop, the government will have to compensate the low skilled and the most appropriate way is through the taxation system. There are a number of ways of compensating the low skilled by using the tax system. Professor Peter Dawkins of Melbourne University advocates negative taxation, whereby low income earners have their income supplemented by the government through so-called tax credits. So as not to discourage full-time work, the credits have to be proportional to the amount of work undertaken during specific periods.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Dawkins's general approach is one that all Liberals would applaud, in that it seeks to ensure an adequate and equitable income for people in low paying jobs. Unfortunately, making a full-time worker reliant on government supplements can take away the pride people take in their self&amp;hyphen;sufficiency and independence. There is also the danger of entrenching a culture of government dependency and encouraging businesses to rely on government for wage top&amp;hyphen;ups for their employees.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         While the detailed works of the last century's Liberal economic philosophers cannot be an appropriate blueprint for a 21st century tax system, the Liberal philosophers knew what they were about when they set out the general principles of taxation. Again, Mill argued that taxation should not commence until after a certain level of income, sufficient to support an individual or a family adequate
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          ly, was reached. This is the philosophy behind the tax-free threshold.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When the tax-free threshold was first introduced in Australia, it was much closer to average yearly earnings than it is now. Inflation has seen the difference between the two increase. Even in the last 10 years, the tax-free threshold has moved from almost a quarter of average yearly earnings to less than 15 per cent. Currently, the threshold—at $5,700—is nowhere near adequate to support an individual, let alone a family. Because the threshold has been left so low for so long, the cost of raising it now for all taxpayers, regardless of income, is prohibitive—approximately $1 billion for every thousand dollar increase in the threshold.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A more acceptable alternative is to raise the tax-free threshold for only those on low incomes. Financially, this is more achievable. The cost of raising the threshold to $10,000 for those with incomes of $10,000 or less would be under $300 million per annum. To raise it to $15,000 for those with incomes of $15,000 or less would be approximately $1.5 billion. Graduated thresholds above a new tax&amp;hyphen;free threshold for low income earners are necessary to ensure that those who earn more maintain an overall higher income and do not get caught by high effective marginal tax rates.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As real wages fall and low skilled workers become less expensive, more of the unemployed will get jobs and the bill for unemployment benefits will drop. But, in the short term at least, the reduced social security bill will not be sufficient to offset the loss in taxation from raising the tax&amp;hyphen;free threshold for low income earners. Consequently, to support a significantly higher tax&amp;hyphen;free threshold for those on lower incomes, the government would have to make up a certain proportion of lost taxation revenue.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The GST is not the answer to this problem. Although the GST has huge benefits, it is not a magic pudding and cannot provide revenue to compensate the Commonwealth for loss of tax from low income earners as well as replacing wholesale sales tax and payroll tax. With corporate tax rates dropping all over the world in an effort to lure industries on shore,
         <break page="8671" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          raising the corporate tax rate is not sensible, although it would bring plaudits from those on PAYE incomes. While raising the marginal tax rate for the better off is not a popular option—and one that has been discounted by this government—it is an option we have to look at.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There were winners and losers out of globalisation and the technological revolution. It is only reasonable to expect that the winners should compensate the losers. Only in this way can we move into the next century with a society that can expect high employment and economic justice. High unemployment puts pressure on welfare systems and increases taxation. It has a high social cost which affects unemployed and employed alike. It breaks down social cohesion and increases crime and civil disobedience. It extracts huge personal cost and wastes lives. What we must not do is put an added burden on the victims of change by creating a class of working poor. If we follow the British and the Americans in freeing up wages for the low&amp;hyphen;skilled, we have to compensate those accepting low wages. Raising the tax&amp;hyphen;free threshold for low income earners is one such method.

          —I would like to bring up today what became clearly apparent in this parliament last week—that the Howard government is unfit to govern. We have seen the demise of three ministers, but, more importantly, we have also seen talk over the weekend about why certain reshuffles should take place. I would like to say to the Howard government that, if they are talking about reshuffling or dismissing ministers, I would like to add another two to their list.

         The two I am talking about are the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) and the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp). I do so in this grievance debate today because both Senator Vanstone and the member for Goldstein, through their public statements and their actions in the last few months, have proven themselves unfit to hold

         They have betrayed the principles of public education for which they purport to stand. They have denigrated the efforts of thousands of educators and teachers across this country of ours and they have actively undermined the nation's public education system, robbing it of the confidence of parents and employers across Australia. They have attacked a system which, thanks to savage budget cuts and this government's unwise and inappropriate program of public education changes, is already demoralised and in disrepair.

         In her first 18 months of office as Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone has made something of a name for herself as a minister who can do no right. She has become a symbol for all that is wrong with the Howard government—unfocused, mistake&amp;hyphen;prone and ineffective. She has, equally, become a figure of resentment and bitterness for many hundreds of thousands of Australians affected by the mismanagement of her portfolio.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         All Senator Vanstone's failings and slip&amp;hyphen;ups faded into insignificance on 8 August, however, thanks to several off&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;cuff comments made by her in a speech to the American&amp;hyphen;Australian Chamber of Commerce in Adelaide. Senator Vanstone, the minister responsible for defending public education in this country, said that students from private schools were 10 times more likely to get jobs than those from government schools and that private schools, unlike their public counterparts, had `beaten unemployment'. It was Senator Vanstone's assertion that, if public schools could only lift their game and try to be more like private schools, the country's unemployment problem—particularly the youth unemployment crisis—would be solved.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The minister also yearned for the good old days of technical schools—clearing houses for apprentices where boys were encouraged to do metalwork and girls to do home economics. That, I might add, was a system Australia rejected in favour of comprehensive education in the 1960s, a vital move in the democratisation of our Australian public system.

          These comments, even based on Senator Vanstone's track record, were breathtaking in their arrogance, contempt and stupidity. They show a minister completely without a grasp of her portfolio and with scant knowledge of the differences between public and private education in this country. The Australian public have a right, at the very least, to expect a working knowledge of these issues from their federal minister for education.

          Condemnation of Senator Vanstone's comments soon followed—not just from the public education sector. The Chair of the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia, Mrs Judith Hancock, said the senator's comments were `unfortunate' and `poorly advised'. She said:

          Mr Warren Johnson, the Executive Officer of the New South Wales Federation of Parents and Citizens Associations said Senator Vanstone's comments were `facile'. In a letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) he said:

          Even Senator Vanstone's party colleagues joined in the condemnation. One comment which caught my eye particularly came from the ACT Liberal MLA, Louise Littlewood who said she found the senator's views `not only offensive but extremely shallow'.

           The paper's editorial said that Senator Vanstone offered no suggestion as to how the age&amp;hyphen;old problem of social inequity between private and public education should be addressed. It said she also `ignored the fact that there were plenty of excellent public schools successfully preparing students for the direct transition from school to work or for going on to university'.

           State schools have been savaged in this country by the last two Howard federal government budgets. Over four years, $270 million has been cut from government schools and directed towards private schools through the enrolment benchmark adjustment.

          <para first-indent="16">
           Cutting of untied grants to states will reduce funds made available to public schools by $400 million. A sum of $45 million has been cut out of teacher development programs, including some which focused on literacy. Public schools are doing their best with the resources available.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           What the minister fails to understand is that state schools, unlike private schools, reflect the social make&amp;hyphen;up of the communities in which they are located. Society's problems, such as unemployment and poverty, therefore infiltrate these schools to a much greater degree than private establishments, making the job of teaching so much harder for teachers.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           What Senator Vanstone also fails to appreciate—and this is perhaps the most disturbing thing—is that students, whether they come from a private or a public school background, will remain unemployed as long as the jobs are not there. If every kid in Australia went to a private school, would that mean the unemployment rate would immediately drop? Of course, it would not. To suggest so is ridiculous in the extreme.

           The conduct of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), I might add, has been no better than that of his senior minister. Over the last few weeks, Dr Kemp has raised quite serious concerns regarding the state of literacy in Australia. As minister for schools, Dr Kemp is quite entitled to do so. What he is not entitled to do, however, is to raise spurious allegations about the standard of education and literacy taught in our schools, aggressively impugn our teachers across the country and, like Senator Vanstone, create a climate of concern about our education system as a whole.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           On an issue which should be above party politics, above media grandstanding, above attacks on state governments, above scapegoating, in his remarks over literacy the minister for schools has quite plainly done all of the above. He has done so to the detriment of our children's interests and of achieving a cooperative national approach to improving literacy in our schools.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           To then turn around, as the minister has done, and say that if schools didn't improve literacy standards their funding would be withdrawn as a performance based penalty is as illogical as it is outrageous. Quite rightly, as with his colleague Senator Vanstone, the minister for schools has been condemned throughout Australia. The Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, said of Dr Kemp and his highly inflammatory comments, that it was:
          </para>
          <para font-size="-=2">
           The greatest attack on, not only children, but those who teach our children, in very many years.

          <para style="Para">
           Mr Kennett's Minister for Education, Mr Phil Gude, went further. He said Dr Kemp's statements were `like being stabbed in the back by a best mate'. He also said:

           Dr Kemp and Senator Vanstone have shown themselves to be incapable of doing their jobs at even a satisfactory level. Their comments have sought to bring down our public education system rather than build it up, as is their duty. Kids in state schools and their hardworking teachers deserve ministers who are supportive of their efforts, not contemptuous and dismissive.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           I personally believe that both of these ministers should be stood down by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). As long as they remain, the Australian people will quite rightly continue to question the commitment of this government to public education. And while we have such outrageous comments being touted around this country by both of these ministers the respect which all of us should have for our public education will be diminished.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           I will further add that both of them not only need to be condemned by their own Prime Minister but should be, as I said, if not demoted, reshuffled out of the portfolio of responsibility that is the training and the education of the young people of this country who eventually will be the future leaders. These ministers need to stand up and take their medicine. These ministers need to be condemned.

Some of the most significant improvements involve simple changes at a local level, from recycling used products to cutting down on energy use. Airconditioners, for example, are a significant and real source of pollutants. Whether in our businesses, our homes or our cars, airconditioners traditionally relied on CFCs and now use HFCs or hydrochlorofluorocarbons. The battle against CFCs has been won, but the battle against HFCs is still to be won. Esanty plays a very significant part in winning that battle.

During the past two years, the Motor Vehicle Repair Industry Council of New South Wales, the Association of Fluorocarbon Consumers and Manufacturers and the Vehicle Air Conditioning Specialists of Australia—all of whom, understandably, are out to protect the interests of traditional manufacturers—have led an unprecedented fear campaign.

          —Last week I spoke in the grievance debate on the effects of the attitude of the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams) towards the National Crime Authority and the residue of the cowboy culture of the 1980s—Bond, Quinn, Skase and Elliott. In that debate I said that some went to gaol and some got lucky.

         Just how lucky John Elliott is was revealed in the decision of the Supreme Court of Victoria's Court of Appeal case, Director of Public Prosecutions reference No. 2, the decision of which was handed down on 26 September—just three days ago. The judgment was a unanimous one. The judge who wrote the key judgment was Mr Justice Brooking. He ruled in favour of the National Crime Authority on every appeal point.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I will go quickly through the facts. The prosecution case against the defendants—including Elliott—was that in January and September of 1988 Elders IXL, controlled by John Elliott, paid a total of approximately $66 million to the Bank of New Zealand in purported settlement of foreign exchange hedging transactions supposedly entered into between Elders and the Bank of New Zealand. At or about the same time, the Bank of New Zealand paid most of this money to companies associated with alleged co&amp;hyphen;conspirator Alan Hawkins in purported settlement of foreign exchange hedging transactions supposedly entered into between companies associated with him and the bank.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The prosecution alleged that there were no genuine foreign exchange transactions and that the money paid by Elders under this guise were payments to Hawkins of a fee for
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          his assistance in May 1986 when a company associated with Hawkins—namely, Beid Pty Ltd—purchased about 4&amp;half; per cent of the share capital of Broken Hill Pty Ltd during the currency of a partial takeover offer for BHP by Bell Resources Ltd, a company associated with Robert Holmes&amp;hyphen;a&amp;hyphen;Court. The prosecution intended to say that this assistance prevented BRL from obtaining effective control of BHP and, ultimately, Elders.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the course of preparing, it was expected that Kenneth Charles Jarrett, a former director of Elders, would say that he had lied on oath at a hearing of the National Crime Authority on 19 December 1990 in stating that the foreign exchange transactions had been genuine. Jarrett was expected by the prosecution to swear that he had discussed in detail with the Elliott co&amp;hyphen;accused what he proposed to say at the hearing and that he had devised and formulated the false explanation that was to be given to the National Crime Authority in relation to these foreign exchange transactions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Jarrett was expected to say that he had discussed the false explanation of each of the Elders co&amp;hyphen;accused and, to a lesser extent, another of the accused. The evidence he was expected to give would, the prosecution was intending to say, show that all four of those persons were aware that the explanation was false.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The problem the prosecution found was that there was argument from the outset about the admissibility of a number of discussions which had taken place with the National Crime Authority, and the judge ultimately accepted the defence's contention that the statements made by the accused were non-admissible.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The argument was conducted on the basis that there was a prior set of dealings before the notice under section 25 of the National Crime Authority Act was issued which coloured that notice and affected its interpretation. No jury was ever empanelled. The judges hearing this appeal said that basically this showed that justice in Victoria was out of control. Mr Justice Brooking said that it reinforced his view that criminal proceedings
         <break page="8677" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          in Victoria are in some respects out of control.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let us look at how much so. The proceedings started in September 1993 in the full Federal Court, where Mr Elliott and his co&amp;hyphen;accused sought to prevent the laying of charges. Then there was a High Court application for special leave. There were 56 sitting days of committal hearings, where ultimately Mr Elliott and others were committed for trial on the basis that there was a prima facie case established; then eight mention hearings in the Supreme Court before trial; and then, as Mr Justice Brooking notes, from 29 January to 22 August 1996, the trial. He notes in brackets:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         not of course in the sense of trial by jury—that foundation of the system has never been anywhere to be seen.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         Then there were the ultimate proceedings that I have mentioned today where the Court of Appeal threw out Mr Elliott's legal case that he had asserted at the trial.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This means that Mr Elliott has succeeded in getting a directed acquittal from a judge without ever going before a jury. We know that he gave evidence which was entirely inconsistent with his innocence when he was going before the National Crime Authority, and evidence that certainly was inconsistent with that which he asserted later when he had his `affronted injured innocence', claiming that he was the victim of some conspiracy by the National Crime Authority. We know that his previous business associate Mr Jarrett went to gaol after pleading guilty to these matters. We know that plainly Mr Elliott is prepared to lie. He either lied to the National Crime Authority or lied subsequently. We know that we have witnessed one of the greatest corporate frauds in Australia's history, coupled with dishonesty and a contamination of the justice system which the Victorian Court of Appeal has rightly recognised, bought by the millions of dollars that John Elliott was able to pay—unlike ordinary defendants—to bring the system to its knees.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Why are we not seeing a reopening of the investigation by the ASC in these circumstances? Why is it that those concerned with the administration of justice are not querying that a person cannot be subjected to trial after
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          an acquittal in such circumstances? It was an acquittal which was only obtained by direction and without the jury being empanelled, where the full court of the Supreme Court of Victoria basically says the trial judge got it entirely wrong.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         How offensive is it that we saw Mr John Elliott strut around before the parliament's committee, attacking Senator Conroy—who put on the record some of the assertions which are inconsistent with the present account of the truth that Mr Elliott was giving—seeking to say that Senator Conroy was acting improperly? How offensive is it to find that Liberal senators were complicit in seeking to sweep information under the carpet to cover up for this man who, in those circumstances, has so acted?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is plain that Mr Elliott still is a man of immense influence in the Australian Liberal Party. He is a person who is still bringing his malign influence to bear with the Attorney-General, who has still not appointed a third member of the National Crime Authority over which the axe still stands. That is an appointment which has been vacant since the Attorney-General took office over 18 months ago.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have a situation where Mr Elliott's attacks on the National Crime Authority have been supported by Premier Kennett in Victoria, notwithstanding the fact that it was the Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions, under his state's administration, who proceeded with the charges against Mr Elliott and then maintained this appeal in the Supreme Court, which ultimately succeeded in absolutely shredding any possible defence that Mr Elliott might have contended that went to justify his argument that he was the victim of a conspiracy. He is victim of no conspiracy. He is the beneficiary of the most technical of acquittals that is possibly imaginable—an acquittal that does shame to the justice system and does shame to those who would come before this place or anywhere else and seek to defend him.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The argument that the acquittal in some sense speaks for his innocence is about as plausible as the argument that the Spanish court's judgment in relation to Skase is an
         <break page="8678" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          accurate diagnosis of his state of health. The Australian public sees right through this. They see, as the Australian Institute of Criminology says, that white&amp;hyphen;collar crime costs this community hundreds of millions of dollars every year.

         We need to find more effective ways of dealing with it. We do not need people who are the luckiest people on the globe walking around this place saying that they were the victims of conspiracy. I think the Australian public would join with Joh Bjelke-Petersen who, when he was speaking of crows and socialists, said, `If they fly like a crow, squark like a crow and look like a crow, they probably are a crow.' If you use the word `crook' in the case of John Elliott, most of the Australian public would probably agree and think you are absolutely right.

          —I rise tonight to speak about a section of road in my electorate of Longman: Deception Bay Road on the Bruce Highway through to the Caboolture-Bribie Island exit. It is a piece of road which is seeing enormous growth in its traffic flow due to the incredibly high growth within the communities of Narangba, Burpengary, Morayfield, Caboolture and Bribie Island.

         The reason I wish to bring this to the House's attention is simply that two state governments, both of different political persuasions, have sought to build a service centre—a service centre capable of handling motor transport such as cars, B&amp;hyphen;doubles, perhaps even B&amp;hyphen;triples, and coach traffic—on this section of the highway to obviously provide fuel and the like.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The problem is that I think this particular section of road was very poorly thought out by both the previous Labor government and this National&amp;hyphen;Liberal Party state government. A horrendous number of accidents have occurred on that road. This section of road has no particular part in which it can meet either the national standards or the lower standards set by the state government.

         In the short time available, I wish to go back through some of the records and just
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          show for the record how this piece of road should never have been determined to seek the needs of a service centre. First, back in 1995 the Queensland government, through the Queensland Department of Transport, wrote to one of the proprietors of a current service station on that road informing him that the road was so busy it was going to have to upgrade it to six lanes. I have no argument with that. This government has had the foresight to put $5 million into the acquisition of land and planning of that project. However, it said to him that safety and traffic flow were key considerations in this upgrading and, as part of that, it was going to have to deny him access to the highway for his service station. Obviously this has a dramatic impact upon a number of service stations on this part of the road.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Being a reasonable man, he accepted that because he believes, like I believe, that safety is of the utmost importance and realised that his service station would cease to exist from about the year 2000. The letter also mentioned that it would have to look at unsafe road intersections, delays to through traffic, excessive noise to neighbouring properties, environmental downgrading of the area and conditions contrary to government policy. All of these things seemed to be reasonable at the time.

         The same gentleman was written to again in response to his letter. Once again I would like to quote, this time from that piece of correspondence. In a letter dated 10 July 1995,  the department states:

         There always is a balance that needs to be made between designing a road for local access and through-traffic carrying functions.

Current policy is that the National Highway be constructed to an access-limited motorway standard.

         The problem is that this piece of road between the Deception Bay exit and the Caboolture-Bribie Island exit, because of the number of overpasses, has no clear piece of roadway which actually meets these criteria. You need a minimum space of 4.5 kilometres between overpasses to allow such a development to go ahead. There is no section of that road which has a space of 4.5 kilometres. So it begs the question why they are so keen on having it there.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If we go a little bit further, they start to change the tune and say, `We don't have to meet the national highway standards, we can reduce it to 1.5 kilometres,' which obviously reduces the 4.5 kilometre requirement between overpasses. It still does not meet these requirements. So we do not meet the national standards. We do not meet the standards the state government has set forth as being safe. They then put forward a document which says, `If you don't meet the national standards and if you don't meet the state standards, then we will look at other proposals that will then meet our standards if you have a development which is of a high enough standard.'

         If you are going to have a development which is of a high class—one which is going to have a McDonald's, a Hungry Jacks or whatever else and is going to provide parking and all those other wonderful facilities—isn't that jolly, but at the end of the day, if it is going to create havoc in people's lives and deaths on the roads, are we making a horrible mistake here? I put it to the House that we are or, at least, that the state governments,

         In the past ten years there have been sixty&amp;hyphen;eight recorded accidents involving southbound vehicles.

While not all are related to the ramps, it is clear that they contribute to an unsafe and undesirable situation.

        <para style="Para">
         The point I would like to make to the House and would hope that the state government would take up is that there are some places which simply are not suitable for a service centre. This is a project that will take up several football fields. It will allow double and treble carrying prime movers to come within some 20 to 30 kilometres of the city. It is an area where there are no alternatives, according to the state government departments, for arterials roads to be built to take the short&amp;hyphen;haul traffic off the roads.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So here we have a national highway system which is designed to carry long-haul traffic. We are forced, due to the growing population, to have short-haul traffic of immense proportions—and it is growing so quickly—forced to use this same piece of road. We already have a horrible situation where accidents and deaths have occurred on this stretch of road, yet we insist that we have to build a service centre to cater for trucks and buses.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I put it to the state government that they would be best served and they would serve the needs of the population there and the motoring traffic if they elected to have this service centre placed north of the Caboolture-Bribie Island exit. In doing so they will get rid of that short-haul traffic, the density of the traffic on that section of the road would be halved and it would then cope with the custom it was designed for.

         Mr Guina, who is a developer, has already purchased land in this area to build such a centre. His development—and he has numerous of them around Australia—is of a high quality.

         It is my belief that due process has not been followed here and that the state government has looked inappropriately at measures to build such centres. The residents that I represent are more than concerned about this. Mr Steve Barber has worked for several months trying to get both the state minister and the various development organisations to come to the party and to listen to their concerns.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The state government has stated in all of its planning requirements that it will deal with the people, that it will listen to their concerns and have consultation, yet earlier this month it called for expressions of interest to build a service centre.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I ask that the state government reconsider. If it needs a service station in this vicinity, by all means there may be the means in which to build it, but let us not bring the B-doubles and B-triples into an area which carries short-haul residential traffic in large quantities—people coming to and from work—on what will be a six-lane highway in an area that does not currently meet national standards and does not even meet the standards set by the state government.

        <para first-indent="16">
         There must be a better way. I implore the state government to research, to go back to the drawing board, not to accept these expressions of interest and to look further afield to put such a service centre.

          The government has made some progress in reducing the burden on small business by the partial exemption from unfair dismissal laws of small businesses with 15 or fewer staff and by way of the minor reduction in the provisional tax uplift factor. The decision to extend capital gains tax rollover relief on the sale of a small business if the proceeds are used for a retirement income or if another like business is purchased is also very worthy of mention. However, these lesser conditions should not be allowed to camouflage the failure of the government to implement the more significant measures that were recommended to it by its own deregulation task force in its report of November 1996.

In other words, it was the reduction in the aggregate compliance burden that was to be the measure of the government's success. Well, the coalition has a long way to go to meet its own benchmark.

          The chamber went on to observe that the most important task force recommendations, those that would have seen a substantial reduction in the burden of compliance, were those relating to tax compliance.

         <para first-indent="16">
          If the coalition had been serious about a 50 per cent reduction in the compliance burden, it would have embraced the recommendations of the Bell committee on fringe benefits tax, sales tax and capital gains tax. Instead, the government's insistence that the recommendations be revenue neutral meant that even the `full implementation of the 62 recommendations . . . would not have seen this'—that is, 50 per cent—`target reached', according to the CCIWA. The same opinion was expressed in an editorial in the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Business Review Weekly
          </emphasis>
          in February last. The editorial read in part:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          The unanimous view is that a 50 per cent reduction can be achieved only if the legislation that caused the paperwork—primarily tax legislation—is overhauled. Tinkering at the edges . . . will not even come close to achieving the coalition's promised revenue neutral 50 per cent reduction.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          Even the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, in its report into the tax law improvement project in March 1997, indicated that the cost of compliance for business would not be reduced until all governments committed themselves to a comprehensive review of tax policy.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The CCIWA report noted that the coalition deserved criticism for promoting a task force that comprehensively identified the major regulatory burdens faced by the small business sector. What is the value in sponsoring such an expansive report if the critical reform proposals are put in the too hard basket? It was poor judgment on the part of the government to tout a 50 per cent reduction in the compliance burden during the election campaign when its revenue neutral caveat was always part of the plan. The two are mutually exclusive. The reality is that the government would most likely have struggled to meet all the expectations of the small business community anyway.

           that have been consistently reflected in small business surveys since the election of the coalition. It is unacceptable that the government continues to assert that it has honoured its commitment to small business when clearly that is not the case.

          The government regularly cites two issues as being the most significant to the small business sector. It lists the previous Labor government's unfair dismissal laws as its primary concern and the burden of red tape as its secondary concern. For a government that lobbied small business relentlessly during the last election campaign, its record on both counts leaves much to be desired.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The decision to partly exempt small businesses from the unfair dismissal laws is an important one, but if this move is to produce the sorts of lasting productivity gains that the coalition claims one has to wonder why it has not been extended across the whole business sector. Further, unless the federal legislation precludes the states from filling the gap its amendments have created, the changes to unfair dismissal will be of little or no consequence to many small businesses.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In March this year the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants released a report that demonstrated that 80 per cent of all small businesses surveyed cited tax reform as what they most wanted to allow them to profit, grow and employ. Yet, of all the deregulation task force recommendations on tax reform, the government has chosen to act on only a few.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The CCIWA observes that `whilst each is welcome to some degree, they do not individually or as a group, represent significant reform'. The changes to fringe benefits tax, including a record&amp;hyphen;keeping exemption for employers who submit an FBT return in a base year of $5,000 or less will have a `very limited practical application', according to the CCIWA. The chamber notes that one of the major shortcomings in the government's response to the Bell report is its failure to `tackle the very considerable compliance problems associated with FBT on meals and car usage, and its refusal to review Australia's unwieldy sales tax system'.
         </para>
         <break page="8682" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          <para first-indent="16">
           The impact of FBT on small business is well known by the coalition and all honourable members. In May 1996 the Institute of Chartered Accountants released a report that listed FBT as the No. 1 federal government regulation that had an adverse impact on small business. In the words of the CCIWA, which represents 5,000 small businesses in Western Australia:

In addition to its criticisms of the government's small business policies, the CCIWA has been consistent in outlining alternative and, it asserts, more effective approaches to ensure that changes in regulation bring about a substantial net benefit to small businesses. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) would be well advised to take on board some of these criticisms and recommendations.

          —I do not always feel happy about speaking in the grievance debate because I come to the point where you really are grieving about something that is of importance to a lot of your constituents. The first thing I would like to raise is the question of television reception. Those of us who live in cities or centres where there is perfect television reception do not realise what a problem it can be in many isolated areas of this country. For my electorate of Cowper, I would like to make a plea to the National Transmission Agency through the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) to consider the possibility of installing a translator on Mount Yarrahappini. There are transmissions coming from Mount Moombil, but there are many valleys going into the
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           Great Dividing Range—wonderful places to live, but the topography means they get virtually no television reception whatsoever.
          </break>
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Mount Yarrahappini is certainly used to transmit radio and I believe it could be a strong possibility for a TV translator. I have it on very good authority from a constituent of mine, Phillip Lane, who installs antennas all over that area, that places like Taylors Arm and Burrapine, Thumb Creek, Talarm, North Arm, South Arm, out to Bowraville, Missabotti, Stuarts Point, some of the Macleay Valley and some of Nambucca Heads cannot get satisfactory TV reception. I would just like to make the plea that the NTA and the minister might consider some form of investigation into whether we can get transmission there.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second thing I would like to raise concerns something I spoke about five years ago, on 10 September 1992. At that time I spoke about a very brave young man who was 19 then, Tony Leggett, from South West Rocks. He was a student at ANU. He dived into the pool in Canberra and happened to break his neck. He is a quadriplegic. He is a bright young man. As I said five years ago, he has got an indomitable spirit and he will survive—so much so that even though he is still a quadriplegic he has moved to Sydney and is doing a psychology degree, which I think is fantastic.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The point I would like to make is that when I spoke five years ago I had been into the Canberra pool and at the shallow end there was no sign saying it was shallow. At many pools it is quite obvious which is the shallow end, but there are some around this country, and Canberra is one of them, where you cannot tell the depth, which is why he broke his neck. In a recent letter to me he makes the point:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         While it is most likely that ninety&amp;hyphen;nine percent of the time it is quite obvious which end is the shallow I would like to see that one in a hundred chance [of disaster] eliminated.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         Like Tony, I certainly agree with that. I was at the pool today and there is still no sign saying, `This is the shallow end.' There were signs saying, `Slow lane', `Fast lane'. If they can put a sign up to say the speed of swim
         <break page="8683" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
          mers in each lane, surely there can be a clear indication that one end is the shallow end. This should happen not only at the Canberra pool—I am not just picking on them, for this is where Tony broke his neck—but right around Australia. At pools where it is not immediately clear from the visual appearance which is the shallow end, there must be a sign. I say to all governments of Australia that we should do something about signposting swimming pools at the shallow end. Even one young life blighted into paraplegia or quadriplegia is too high a price to pay compared with the cost of a few signs.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The third point I wanted to raise concerns the services of doctors in part of my electorate in the Macleay Valley, which is an incredibly beautiful valley. The local government headquarters is in Kempsey on the Macleay river itself. In the area are lovely places like South West Rocks, Hat Head, Crescent Head and a rainforest hinterland. It really is beautiful. But we have a situation of approaching crisis in the supply of GPs and specialists. I quote from a recent article in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Macleay Argus
         </emphasis>
         headed `Kempsey to lose four GPS':

        <para font-size="-=2">

        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         But where are the replacement doctors to come from? I know full well that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) is really concerned about this and I know that the government is taking whatever action it can. But I need to take this opportunity to highlight to the parliament that we are not talking about outback Australia. This is on the mid&amp;hyphen;north coast of New South Wales, one of the fastest growing areas of Australia and one of the most closely settled, and we have this virtual crisis. As Mid&amp;hyphen;North Coast Area Health Services director of operations, Jeff Pattinson said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         We are in the process of trying to recruit doctors . . . we've been advertising for quite a while.
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         </break>
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         But there has been nothing in the way of responses. They are:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . trying to find two consultant obstetricians and a specialist anaesthetist to replace specialists who have left the hospital in the last two years.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         You go down the river to beautiful South West Rocks and we have a situation there where one of the local doctors is planning to close his practice if he cannot replace somebody who is leaving him shortly. He is working virtually seven days a week. He is on call every second night. He starts early in the morning and he finishes late at night. He has already said that he cannot take any new patients. He is concerned with the holiday season coming on that he will not be able to service holidaymakers who need medical treatment. This is in a beautiful place, South West Rocks.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The citizens of that area are just as concerned as I am. We have a very high retired population and those people are naturally very concerned that their medical service should continue. So I would just like to assure the parliament I will be doing everything I can, as I know the Minister for Health will be doing, to help solve that problem.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The last point I want to raise concerns the Child Support Act. I have a close relationship with an organisation called DADs, which is Dads Against Discrimination. They have written to me saying that the fundamental flaw in the act as it currently stands is that it offers no incentive for a payer to work harder when most, if not all, the extra income goes in tax and maintenance. It also encourages payers on marginal incomes to become unemployed. Every member of this place knows that that is a true statement. We all know of people who have left their employment because the child support payment was so great it was not worth their while to stay in work.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the things they say is that they believe we should allow payers to claim children from their second families as dependents for Child Support Agency purposes on the same criteria as they can be claimed for social security purposes. I think that is a very sensible and reasonable suggestion. Again, they say the philosophy of the legislation
         <break page="8684" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          appears to be that the payer will pay no matter what. Unfortunately, the `what' includes the right to properly feed and clothe themselves and their children on contact visits, to provide suitable accommodation and quality of life for the children when they are with them, the ability to rebuild their own lives and so on.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other point they make is that although it is called DADs it is important to remember that this is not a gender issue. This is not about men against women. There are 44,528 women across Australia who are actually paying child support maintenance. I would like to read part of a letter I have received from one of my constituents, which states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I firmly believe in paying child support to assist our children. It is a basic responsibility as a parent, but why can't the CSA formula be more fair and equitable and why doesn't the CSA listen to both parents. The paying parent is paying the money but has no rights.
        </para>
        <para justification="CENTERJUST">
         . . .              . . .             . . .
        </para>
        <para>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Like many non-custodial parents I am unable to make a new life for myself. I just can't afford it. I am financially unable to become involved in a relationship with anyone as I can't afford the expense of "going out".
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         This constituent writing in this way is a woman. She is one of those 44,000&amp;hyphen;odd women who are actually paying child maintenance. She asks three very important questions: why is the CSA formula based on gross wages? Why doesn't the formula take into account both parents' true and proven living expenses? Why can't child support be means tested once the custodial parent remarries or lives de facto?

On each occasion the committee has been frustrated by the lack of time in which to carry out this task.

          The Public Service Bill is a very significant piece of legislation because it introduces new public service legislation after 75 years. It redefines the nature of the Public Service legislation and it embodies a new conceptual framework for public sector management. Notwithstanding the significance of the bill, I am allocated only five minutes to speak on the findings and conclusions of this important review. All other members who wish to speak have only 10 minutes between them to do so. This does not reflect well on the proper use of this chamber.

           While the JCPA supports the need for the 1922 act to be replaced and favours simplification, modernisation and the more accessible format of the bill, the review has identified a number of areas where improvements can be made.

           Firstly, let me say that the committee strongly agrees with the commitment given by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) in his second reading speech that merit will remain a cornerstone of Public Service employment. In support of this, the committee believes that the definition of `merit' should not be relegated to subordinate legislation as it is proposed but should be enshrined in the bill itself.

           The committee is pleased to say that the APS values have been spelt out in the bill. In some cases, however, the values do not go far enough. For example, values require that advice given by APS employees will be timely. The committee believes that advice needs to be more than timely.

           On the issue of protection for whistleblowers, the committee believes that there are considerable limitations to any whistleblower protection scheme being based within the Public Service Bill. No-one could argue that a public servant who discovered a fraud and exposed it was doing other than his or her duty. As things stand now, a departmental officer who exposes a fraud may be in contravention of the Crimes Act. If there were a proper procedure for a public servant who found fraud to report it through properly authorised channels and with appropriate protection, there would be less reason for a

           The committee has recommended that the government should consider introducing whistleblower protection along similar lines to that which already exists for the public sector in other Australian jurisdictions.

           Perhaps the most contentious clause in the bill was clause 33 which entitles an APS employee to a review of any APS action which relates to his or her employment. The committee found a high level of dissatisfaction with the proposed regulations as set out in the draft subordinate legislation. This dissatisfaction stems partly from the very detailed nature of the draft regulations which were considered by many witnesses to be confusing and partly from the role given to the Public Service Commissioner. There is a perception that the commissioner lacks independence in reviewing APS employment decisions.

           A review mechanism which builds on the current model of a separate statutory officer within the structure of the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission may offer a more independent review process than is proposed. In the JCPA's view, such a separation seems a sensible solution to a very complex issue. I should mention that the review revealed a number of issues on which JCPA members could not agree. These differences of opinion, which were the result, fundamentally, of divergent policy approaches, are highlighted in the report for the information of members and senators.

           —by leave—I rise to add my remarks to the report of the inquiry of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts into the Public Service Bill 1997. It is intended that the provision of the bill will enable the public sector to be placed on a similar footing to the private sector. The key component of this is the increase in power to the secretaries of departments and agency heads to have employment power in their own right. Essentially, we will see a radical change in the Australian Public Service. The bill aims to simplify the 1922 act and incorporates into the public sector the government's controversial industrial relations changes.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The opposition acknowledges that it made significant changes to the Public Service when in government, but these changes go far beyond anything we had envisaged at that time. The overall effect will be to create a Public Service which is more easily influenced by the government of the day and less willing to offer critical advice. As has been mentioned, the Prime Minister and ministers will be able to negotiate salary and conditions for agency heads which will not be subject to public scrutiny.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In turn, agency heads will have the power to hire and fire and determine salary conditions for agency employees. The committee accepted that placing necessary employment powers with agency heads is consistent with the government's broader policy on workplace relations. The APS will become less of a career service and the culture of the service will be radically different. The Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act is being repealed and with it all the current mechanisms for review of employment decisions affecting APS employees. The proced

          I would like to make some remarks regarding whistleblowers. A number of serious weaknesses have been identified in the schemes established by clause 16 of the bill. Although the committee felt that it was limited in the sorts of recommendations that it could make, I support the remarks that it would be preferable for the government to introduce whistleblower legislation along similar lines to that in other Australian jurisdictions. This is clearly an area which demands due attention and where protection ought to be strengthened.

          With all these changes, committee members differed in their view on how radical a change the bill represents. With many of these changes, we will see severe repercussions for the Public Service. Many of these changes will constitute significant departures from current practice. There has been a lot of concern expressed that the changes could lead to the Public Service being less prepared to give full and frank advice to ministers and agency heads. These concerns expressed by a number of witnesses need to be taken seriously. If a trend arises, then the government will need to revisit the issue. No doubt there will continue to be much debate over the future of the Australian Public Service as a result of this bill. I also put on record my appreciation of the secretariat's support.

           —by leave—The Public Service Bill is a piece of legislation which is of fundamental importance to the government of Australia and its administration. It is designed to supplant the Public Service Act 1922 which, for much of its existence, has served Australia well and provided us with a Public Service of high quality and commitment. However, there is a universal consensus that the 1922 act is not adequate for the demands of taking us into the 21st century. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts does support the need for the 1922 act to be replaced and it favours the simplification, modernisation and more acces

          In the very limited time available to me, I would like to focus on one particular improvement responding to a particular concern about the bill—namely, its impact on the provision of strong and effective advice by secretaries who, when I was younger, used to be called permanent heads and who in the future will be called agency heads. I do not believe that the significance of permanent heads, secretaries or agency heads can be overestimated. The contribution they make in terms of advice to ministers, the running of the departments and the delivery of public policies and programs is vital. Given this, I did look very seriously at the concern about secretaries' tenure impacting on their advice.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This concern was most dramatically put by Sir Lennox Hewitt, who sees the provisions as destroying `frank, fearless and honest advice'. I believe that this is excessive, but I also believe that there are some problems in the Public Service Commissioner's statement that advice is not a matter of tenure but of character. Character may not in a sense be paramount, but it is rather easier to give vent to one's character when one's professional survival is not at stake. But the fact is—although one would not have recollected it from hearing the previous speaker, the honourable member for Rankin (Mr Beddall)—that the current system of contract employment for secretaries is not something that this bill will introduce. It was instituted by Labor in 1993.

          There is a change in the formalities of appointing and terminating agency heads, and the committee did accept that the `approach proposed by the bill reflects the reality that such matters rest with the Prime Minister of the day and, therefore, supports the proposed changes'. Nonetheless, strong and effective advice is of paramount importance and the committee has recommended that the Public Service values should embody a provision highlighting the commitment owed by the Public Service to frank, honest, comprehensive, accurate and timely advice. I believe that this is important not only for the agency

I do commend the report to the House.

          Firstly, while applauding the inclusion in the legislation of the APS values, the committee believes that some of the values need to be strengthened. Others have already noted the committee's concern that advice given by APS employees needs to be more than timely and our recommendation that the words `frank, honest, comprehensive and accurate' be added in this value.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Another of the values refers to accountability but does not say whom the APS is accountable to.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The member for Fairfax has already referred to the committee's recommendations in relation to merit and workplace diversity programs. In relation to merit, the committee believes that the inclusion of a clear and unambiguous definition of merit in the bill itself rather than in subordinate legislation will enhance community understanding of the importance of the merit principle in APS employment decisions. The committee has suggested a definition for inclusion in the bill which is based on the commonly accepted CCH

           In relation to workplace diversity, the bill places the onus squarely on agency heads to develop workplace diversity programs. The committee's recommendations address the issue of the proper evaluation of these programs by agencies to ensure a focus on outcomes and on enhancing the role of the Public Service Commissioner in monitoring agency programs.

          <para first-indent="16">
           On the issue of the parliamentary departments, the committee has supported the creation of a separate parliamentary service established under its own legislation. However, the committee also believes it is essential that reciprocal mobility arrangements be introduced which will allow for movement on merit between the APS and the parliamentary service and for portability of relevant entitlements. The committee has also made recommendations in relation to the situation of APS employees who wish to take up employment on the staff of members of parliament and other statutory appointments.

           I would like to mention briefly the question of subordinate legislation and the various regulations around the question of the operation of this bill.

           Finally, I would also like to echo the concerns expressed by the member for Fairfax and others about the inadequate amount of time that the committee was given to undertake this review and the limited amount of time that has been allocated to speak about the committee's report. The fact is this is not the first bill in this parliament where this committee has been given a very short period of time to consider major legislation. That, in itself, is a problem that I think the government needs to think about because it is impacting on the capacity of the committee properly to consider issues in the fullness of time.

I referred to the two categories of operational service and qualifying service and I explained that `operational service' refers to service overseas in a clearly defined area during a war or similar operation. Under this category, personnel are eligible for a disability pension for injuries, disease or death where it can be attributed to that service.

         North-east Thailand, including Ubon, is one that I had a fairly recent representation on. Mr Lyle Barker, of Narooma in my electorate, came to see me about the possible recognition of Ubon. He was a member of 79 Squadron stationed there and he related to me how, from 1965 through to 1968, Ubon air base was used by the US as a base from which to operate bombing runs into Vietnam. Planes from the US were coming and going at all hours of the day, and Mr Barker recalls very vividly all that went with such wartime operations, as our troops were living on the base.

         I do not recall him telling me that the base was ever attacked during that time, but clearly this would be known by others. However, I assume it was not, as this bill includes this area as operational service not qualifying service. The clear distinction for all areas already included is that, for qualifying service, the personnel would have had to have incurred danger from hostile forces. That not being the case, operational service is the correct category. Similar supporting stories can apply to the other five categories that are being included, and I congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) for their inclusion.

I am sure a number of the matters he raised will be checked and responded to by the minister before this bill is approved. But the good work in his contribution was unfortunately eliminated by his totally out of order attack in the words he used in what can only be called his so-called amendment.

I know the Labor Party was probably going to get around to that in their 14th year in government, but that is still no excuse. Rather than condemning this government for this excellent bill, they should be applauding our action and apologising for the fact that they were too slack to get around to it.

I certainly support this bill right across the board and I reject the ungracious amendment that the member for Reid has moved. I look forward to some of the further comments that might be made in relation to his comments.

He gave parliament a nice bit of history in saying that the Reserve was established to defend Malaya, Singapore and their surrounding waters from external communist aggression and that its secondary role was to assist in suppressing communist insurgency within Malaya, which also implied hazardous conditions. I am sure the member for Riverina would gain some Tuck-budt brownie points for pointing this out. I am sure there is a lot of merit in his speech, as you would be well aware, Madam Deputy Speaker.

          This emergency that took place in Malaysia was one of those wars that you have when you are not having a war. So they called it an emergency and said, `This isn't a war.' I have read descriptions of why that was so. I think Churchill was still around in England in those days and did not want to have to pay compensation to tin mines and other things. Calling it an emergency prevents the veterans of that campaign from gaining recognition of service at the time. The navy personnel are the ones that missed out—and they have missed out all together right through.

          The personnel were subjected to similar dangers to all other Australians serving overseas on active service.

This will no doubt address the problems of further anomalies arising.

         The need for these changes is obvious. Like many of the acts this government is attempting to amend, this is an unwieldy piece of legislation that is confusing for all but those few experts who make it their life's work to write official documents in such a way that common folk cannot understand them. This specific subsection consists of 17 paragraphs  which seem to follow no set path. Many are

         A further benefit of this bill is that it will allow all disability pensioners, war widow and war widower pensioners access to a lump sum advance of their pension up to a maximum of $500 a year. In the past, this advance has been made available to only those on income support pensions. The amendments moved by the minister in relation to this bill will have an effect not only on the Veterans' Entitlements Act but also on the Social Security Act. They will provide a better link between services currently provided under these acts.

         One such change will link a veteran's eligibility for treatment at the department's expense to the pension calculation process. Presently this is done through separate income and assets tests. This will avoid the situation where a person may lose their entitlement to treatment at departmental expense should they have a small increase in their pension.

         Another change with regard to the DSS will be the transfer of carer service pensioners and carer income support supplement recipients from Veterans' Affairs to Social Security. When this change was first mooted, the Department of Veterans' Affairs paid carer pensions to only 100 people, while DSS paid more than 24,000 carers. Since first announcing this change, approximately half of the 100 carers with Veterans' Affairs have pre-empted the government's actions and transferred to DSS. It is important to stress that those transferring to DSS will not be financially disadvantaged.

         The department has advised that there is a small number of Veterans' Affairs pensioners who could be adversely affected by the transfer, and they will remain with Veterans' Affairs. I am sure those on the opposition benches will object to this aspect, but that is nothing new. By transferring the payments, all the government is proposing is that one department, instead of two, handles carer payments. It just means one less department

         The final aspect of this bill on which I will comment is the changes to the repatriation system with regard to the use of tobacco. The government has, in the past, accepted considerable responsibility for illness arising from the use by veterans of tobacco products. There was a time when members of the defence forces were encouraged to use tobacco products. In times of conflict, tobacco products were used to keep soldiers calm in the face of overwhelming odds. It was also a time when the dangers of such use were not widely known or accepted.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is certainly no longer the case. Today, tobacco companies are being forced to explain in some detail the inherent dangers of using their products. The general public is well aware of the dangers of smoking and can no longer claim ignorance of the facts. It is therefore quite reasonable for the Commonwealth to relinquish its responsibility for compensation for the future health problems of members of the defence forces who take up smoking after 31 December of this year.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Members of the defence forces go through exhaustive training and are taught how to take care of themselves and their health. They must possess better than average intelligence to get through their training and would, therefore, be well aware of the dangers of tobacco products. With this in mind, the Commonwealth cannot remain liable for the health of those taking up the habit in the future. This is not to say that those veterans already suffering will be shunned. The Commonwealth will continue to assist those whose habit was formed prior to December of this year.

          before the House tonight seeks to amend the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to extend eligibility for certain benefits, including defence service home loans, to armed forces personnel who served in some overseas deployments, to allow all disability pensioners and war widowers to take as an advanced lump sum a payment of up to $500, and to limit the Commonwealth's liability for injury or death to service personnel due solely to tobacco use either begun or increased after 31 December 1997.

         Our shadow minister, the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson), has indicated that the opposition is happy to support the extension of eligibility for those payments and is happy to accept the restriction of the Commonwealth's liability with respect to smoking.

         In addressing the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Compensation Measures) Bill, I am reminded of the great debt we owe to the service men and women in our community. While the amendments in this bill continue to ensure that our veterans are commemorated and cared for, there is one aspect of major significance; that is, the matter of nicotine addiction.

         I think that reformed smokers are often the ones who can speak most freely on this subject. As a reformed smoker, I know that nicotine is a deadly addiction and one that even the most determined find extremely hard to break. Generations of people have been encouraged by advertising to smoke, and that did not start just recently. In years gone by the armed forces did not discourage its members from smoking. In fact, tobacco in its various forms was flown and shipped into the war zones along with the bully beef. This was during the days when we did not realise the extent of the damage caused by smoking. We certainly had not assessed its cost to the community.

         It is pointless allowing all disability pensioners, war widows and war widower pensioners access to a lump sum advance of their pension, as seen in this bill, if they are ill and infirm due to smoking related diseases. We must continue to discourage smoking. And that is what we are doing in this bill. This government has determined that the Commonwealth will no longer be liable for compensation for ill health due to smoking. Obviously this cannot apply to the many thousands of men and women who unknowingly adopted a life-threatening and lifetime addiction.

He walks around the house with tubes up his nose which are connected to his oxygen machine. He gave up his habit of 60 cigarettes a day only when he had trouble breathing. This is an example of the incredibly addictive power of nicotine. It is almost so strong that people find it easier to face ill-health and possibly death rather than give up tobacco.

          This amending bill makes it clear that any person in the services who takes up smoking at the end of this year does so without government support. This measure will not affect veterans who acquired a service related smoking habit before 1 January 1998. It must be pointed out that, if smoking is only one of the causes of ill health of a veteran, that person will still be eligible for compensation. This is a tough call, but one that had to happen. The cost in dollar terms to the nation due to the consumption of tobacco is $12.7 billion—billions, not mere millions. The cost to the veterans' budget is a massive $80 million a year.

Also, those veterans who served in north-east Thailand between 1962 and 1968 benefit, along with the members of the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces between 1949 and 1951.

          —As has been outlined during the debate, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Compensation Measures) Bill extends operational service benefits to 11 groups of veterans, which means that they will have access to compensation in the form of disability pensions, treatment for diseases and injuries relating to service, and defence service home loans. Many of these veterans have campaigned for years to have access to these benefits. Access comes following a review conducted jointly by the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Defence. Unfortunately—it is to be much regretted—the government has not released the report that resulted from this review.

         One group of veterans who will benefit to some extent from this legislation consists of those who served with the Royal Australian Navy in the Far East Strategic Reserve between 1955 and 1960 in Malaya. The veterans from this group in my electorate, who I have had dealings with, have said that, whilst they are happy with the decision to extend the disability pension to them, they regard the government's decision as only half a victory.

          first, they were never allotted for duty; second, they were not subject to military law; and, thirdly, they did not incur operational risk. This legislation means that the government have effectively given up on continuing to claim that they were not allotted for duty, although, as has been noted by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) as shadow minister, this piece of legislation introduces new terminology `assigned for duty' which is of unclear definition. The legislation also perhaps dents the argument that this group of veterans was not subject to military law.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, the claim that these veterans did not incur additional operational risk still remains. When the actual conditions that the Far East Strategic Reserve were required to operate under and the demands made of them are examined, it is quite clear that the risk was implicit. The primary role of the reserve was to secure and defend the sea lanes and the coastline of Malaya. In addition, they were required to be part of operations against insurgent forces.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Amongst the types of operations were escorting land troops through the harbour, enforcing a blockade of enemy positions, tracking the enemy and bombarding the communist positions as outlined in the previous CIDDRA report. They were also required to undertake support functions for other Australian and Commonwealth personnel land and air forces, protecting merchant shipping, and be prepared at a level at least sufficient to undertake warlike operations at short notice.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are reports of Royal Australian Navy ships being fired on while undertaking troop movements and RAN personnel being caught up in a riot in 1957. The argument that the Royal Australian Navy personnel were not incurring any operational risk is undermined even further by the granting of full benefits to RAAF and army personnel involved in the same theatre. Both army and RAAF personnel were eligible for qualifying service benefits after 24 hours service in the operational area.

         In August I wrote to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) putting to him some of the questions that veterans had
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          put to me about his decision to deny them the service pension. These questions included what surface&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;air capability the enemy had against the aeroplanes of the RAAF, given the fact that the lack of surface&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;sea missiles is used as a reason to suggest the naval personnel faced no operational risk. To date I have not received a reply from the minister.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In asking these questions, the Royal Australian Navy veterans do not seek to denigrate the efforts of the army or the RAAF personnel or to remove benefits from them to which they are entitled. They seek only to point out the anomalies involved in denying benefits to one branch of the services that are available to others. This is a question of equity and justice for the veterans.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Another issue of great concern for some veterans and one that has been completely mishandled by the government is that of medals. Yet again, it highlights the gross incompetence of the government when put to task about such matters. Veterans from the Korean War, the Malaysian emergency, the Indonesian confrontation and some from the Vietnam war were not eligible to receive the Australian Service Medal 1945&amp;hyphen;75. The coalition's position on this was clear cut before the election.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In their policy document `Lest We Forget' before the election they stated that the veterans, except those who had already received the Australian Vietnam Service Medal, would be eligible for the Australian Service Medal 1945&amp;hyphen;75 with the appropriate clasp. In September last year the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) announced that the government's strategy was largely in place. Then in May this year the minister claimed that it had been discovered all of a sudden that to grant the Korean veterans their medals would be double medalling. As such she was going to break the coalition's commitment to veterans given to them by the then shadow minister, the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) before the election.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are two very disturbing aspects to the minister's May announcement not to grant the medal. Firstly, this government does not obviously consider veterans worthy enough of
         <break page="8701" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          core promises. So they get the ordinary old promises which the government has shown no shame in breaking on a whole range of issues. Secondly, the minister claimed that she had suddenly discovered this double medalling issue—double dipping on awarding medals. For many years this was the reason that the department and the governments of the day had used to deny veterans the Australian Service Medal. It was clear cut. This was one of the prime reasons that these veterans had been denied an Australian award.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It was nothing new but the minister attempted to portray it as such to get herself and the government out of its commitment to veterans. Fortunately for these veterans, the minister has since performed a backflip on the medals issue. Last week she announced that Korean veterans, Malayan emergency veterans, Indonesian confrontation veterans and eligible Vietnam veterans would be eligible for the new Australian Active Service Medal 1945&amp;hyphen;75.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I stress that this is a new award. This issue has been solved by the creation of a new award. In some cases that sort of ingenuity in getting around a problem could be applauded, but it simply appears to be a device that, in this case, has managed to get around the intransigence, especially of some within the defence forces, of those who actively campaigned against the award to these people.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         While the representatives of Korean veterans' groups that I have dealt with have welcomed the announcement of last week, it still represents a significant difference to the position that the coalition outlined before the election. The whole sorry mess on the medals issue has shown the incompetence that this government demonstrates constantly. Whether it be changing Australia's system of nursing home care or the awarding of a medal that was promised before the election, the government cannot do anything without backflip, chaos, division and uncertainty.

Perhaps that is an unintended consequence of changes to the legislation that were made previously. I hope that the minister is able to take those matters on board.

          I finally mention one group of veterans that will have benefits extended to them by this legislation. I refer to the veterans that served in the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces in Japan between January 1949 and June 1951. Like other members, I have had a lot to do with veterans who served with that group from my local constituency. During the year of Australia Remembers, I was pleased that the local committee in Scullin was able to assist the Victorian group of the BCOF in installing an appropriate plaque in the gardens around the Shrine in Melbourne which commemorated those efforts. I was very pleased to be invited to a simple ceremony which commemorated that occasion and which meant a lot to those veterans that returned.

          People do not realise that, to a certain extent, in the postwar period there were conditions that prevailed in Japan that were unsettling to those people who served there. Yet again, there was this ambivalence based on whose control the Australian forces in that group were under which led to their not getting proper recognition for certain repatriation benefits and recognition for service medals. That situation is to be regretted.

I am grateful that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) is in the chamber tonight for the debate. I would like to briefly raise two particular cases of constituents that he and I have been corresponding on for a little while. I appreciate that, with the minister being in the chamber, it is an excellent opportunity for me to raise in the House and bring directly to his attention these two particular cases. I can say from the start that, naturally, I do not expect the minister to be able to respond in detail to these cases in his reply. If he would be willing to give me a written
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           reply at some future occasion, I would be very grateful. But if he is willing to give me an immediate response tonight, I would be more than grateful.

         First of all, the first case involves a constituent of mine, Mr Norman Cotton. Mr Cotton is seeking a particular medal in part because it will give him access to a service pension. The brochure which is put out by Veterans' Affairs on service pensions makes the following statement about eligibility for service pensions:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Service pension is an income support payment, similar to the age pension paid by the Department of Social Security. It may be paid to Australian veterans who have qualifying service, which is generally service during which a veteran incurred danger from hostile forces of the enemy.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Commonwealth and Allied veterans and mariners who served in conflicts in which Australian forces were involved and who have qualifying service may also be entitled to the service pension.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         The details of Mr Norman Cotton, a constituent of mine from Bateau Bay, are that he served with a group of British servicemen who defused unexploded bombs in the United Kingdom. He was involved in this work for a considerable period of time—I understand it was in the period from 1945 to 1949. While his work did not involve his carrying out that work outside the United Kingdom, he placed his life at risk on many occasions. Not only Mr Cotton was at risk, but all of the other people who carried out the work in seeking to defuse and, on some occasions, explode some of the unexploded ordnance that littered the British landscape, in particular some of the British cities.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         While Mr Cotton did not serve overseas, he certainly placed his life at risk on many occasions. In many ways, I think the allied servicemen who worked on unexploded ordnance probably required more courage and bravery than that of many people who have received service pensions for serving overseas. I know that rules have to be set and sometimes people can inadvertently be ineligible for entitlements, but this is an issue that I have written to the minister about on several occasions. In fact, on 21 August, I received the most recent reply from Stephen Edwards,
         <break page="8703" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          the acting senior adviser to the minister. He said, and I quote from the letter:
         </break>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Minister has arranged to look into your request that the General Service Medal (Bomb and Mine Clearance 1945&amp;hyphen;49) Clasp be included as a campaign medal under the VEA. A full response will be forwarded to you as soon as practicable.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         The most recent correspondence says the minister has agreed to look at this particular request. The reason why I am raising it tonight is to add my personal support, once again, to Mr Cotton's request that the government look at adding this particular clasp to the list of medals that entitles people to a service pension.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If at the end of the day we say that Australians who are entitled to service pensions are those who were in the Australian forces and served overseas in a hostile theatre of war, that is fair enough. We say that if Australians served on Australian soil or in Australian waters and their lives were at risk because of hostile enemy action, that is fair enough. We say that if Commonwealth or allied veterans served outside their country of citizenship, their country of birth, and had their lives placed at risk, they should be entitled to a service pension.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So surely an allied veteran who placed his life at risk on many occasions blowing up unexploded bombs or defusing bombs that were placing not only his life but the lives of all the others in his teams at risk should be entitled to consideration for a service pension. So that is the case. I would be very grateful if the minister, having already agreed to look at the matter, could give it his personal attention. Not only I but Mr Norman Cotton will be grateful for any sympathetic consideration which is forthcoming.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second case which I would like to raise involves a second constituent of mine also from Bateau Bay. There are a lot of good veterans living in beautiful Bateau Bay these days. This particular constituent of mine, Mr M.E. Flaxman, has written to me having served in Darwin. He served in Darwin for less than six months and, under the current rules, he is not entitled to receive the 1939 to 1945 star. As a result of that, Mr Flaxman has been quite disappointed.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          During the time he was serving in Darwin, the hostilities might have lasted for less than six months but he advises me that there were about 25 air raids. I think that someone who was serving in Darwin during a time when 25 air raids took place is probably entitled to some consideration for receiving that particular service medal, that particular recognition of placing his life at risk in a theatre of war when many other Australians were counting on people such as Mr Flaxman to do their duty.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As I said before, I do not expect the minister to immediately respond to these particular cases. But, if he is willing to give an assurance to my two constituents that they will receive his personal attention, I would be very grateful. With those words, I will not hold the House up any longer.

         I must take issue with some of the members on the other side of the House and some of the points raised by the shadow minister, the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson), and repeated by other members on that side of the House. It really is quite rich for the opposition to now claim that the Royal Australian Navy personnel who served in the Far East
         <break page="8704" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Strategic Reserve during the Malayan Emergency should be granted qualifying service and receive a service pension. The Far East Strategic Reserve Act 1956 was repealed by the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986. If Labor had wanted to fix the anomaly that they have spoken about during the debate on this bill, they could have fixed it then.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         They could have also fixed it subsequent to the Veterans' Entitlement Act being introduced in 1986, because they had the opportunity when they amended the act in 1991, 1992, 1993 and 1995, all of which amendments continued the exclusion of qualifying service for members of the Far East Strategic Reserve. There were four opportunities after 1986 when they amended the act for them to have done something about it. So for them to come into this House saying that we should have done something about it, when they had 13 years to do something about it, is really quite rich.

         You can contrast the action—not the words, but the action—of those on the other side of the House with what this government has done.

          I thank the opposition for their leave and consideration of the amendments that have been circulated. I present the supplementary explanatory memorandum. Before I explain these amendments I would like to put the record straight on a number of issues that were raised by members on the other side of the House. The opposition really has quite a nerve claiming that the government cost veterans dearly because of the time delay in passing this legislation. In fact, it has been the opposition that had an unholy alliance with the Democrats in the upper house which has inconvenienced the veterans of this nation. This

          should have passed the House before we rose in the winter. But it was Labor who resorted to join with the Democrats in their cosy little coalition in the upper house in an attempt to open up debate on social security legislation that had already been passed in the Senate. Quite clearly, the Labor Party really must have been asleep when that social security legislation passed through the Senate. Otherwise, why did they attempt the tactics that they did in seeking to amend the bill?
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is also particularly offensive to choose a veterans bill. I also note their lack of consideration of the fact that the Veterans' Entitlements Act and issues relating to the veterans has nearly always had bipartisan support in the past. It was indeed a very tacky measure of the Labor Party to seek to amend the Veterans' Entitlements Act by talking up issues relating to social security on a bill that had already passed the House. I urge the shadow minister to look at the issue of veterans quite separately from those other issues in future because, by not winning that debate, he did not do his party any good with those who perhaps might have been trying to seek to gain political points on a veterans issue in the upper house.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I now turn to one of the main thrusts of the amendments. This is the rationalisation of payments between the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Social Security. This reflects the government's commitment to administrative reform and to streamlining the delivery of government services.

         <para first-indent="16">
          One of the amendments will allow age pensioners who also receive a disability pension to choose to be paid both pensions by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. For the veterans and their eligible partners it will mean that they will need to deal with only one department.

           Yet another amendment provides for the establishment of the vocational rehabilitation scheme for veterans. That is indeed a very good measure. In fact, it is one that the opposition sought to bring in whilst they were in government. It is one that particularly the younger veterans of our country have sought for many years to have implemented. It is an important measure. It is one that has bipartisan support, one that will bring immense benefits to the veterans, particularly the younger veterans.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The scheme will provide for early intervention for younger veterans leaving the forces and support for the Vietnam veterans. It will assist veterans to find employment and to continue in employment. The development of the legislation for the scheme, and of the scheme itself, has been the subject of extensive consultation with the ex&amp;hyphen;service community. Once again, I want to thank the veteran community for their assistance in developing this scheme, because it would not be possible to introduce this measure without the cooperation of the veterans themselves. I do thank them very sincerely for their cooperation as this scheme has been developed.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The scheme will be available to all eligible veterans, but special provision has been made for those veterans who are receiving a disability pension or a service pension on the grounds that they are prevented by their incapacity from working full time. The legislation presents guarantees that those veterans who volunteer to take part in a rehabilitation program under the scheme will not have their pension reduced while participating in that program.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The legislation also ensures that veterans will receive at least the same income from earnings and disability pension combined as he or she would have received as a disability pensioner and the veteran had not participated in the rehabilitation program and entered employment. If at any time the veteran ceases employment, he or she will revert to the rate of disability pension payable when the rehabilitation program was initially undertaken. These safeguards and guarantees remove disincentives for veterans to volunteer for rehabilitation back into the work force.

            The benefits veterans may obtain from participating in a rehabilitation program go well beyond financial advantages. These programs increase a person's self&amp;hyphen;reliance and their ability to cope with life's tasks. They provide opportunities for socialisation and can help markedly, in many instances, in improving the quality of the participant's life.
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            Included with the other amendments moved in relation to this bill is the 1997&amp;hyphen;1998 budget initiative to streamline the determination of a service pensioner's eligibility for medical treatment at the expense of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. As a result of this simplification and the associated removal of the anomalies, about 100 veterans will gain access to treatment benefits.
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            This bill demonstrates this government's commitment to expanding and improving benefits to the veteran community. These measures are not a reward for those who served this country in war; they are benefits for veterans who have earned them by their sacrifices. I urge all members of this House to acknowledge the beneficial nature of this bill. I particularly urge the opposition to quit grandstanding when this bill gets to the Senate.
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            The government remains absolutely committed to maintaining existing veterans' entitlements. As the bill demonstrates, benefits and services will continue to be reviewed to maintain their quality, their fairness and their appropriateness. Also, the government is committed to improving efficiency in the delivery of these benefits and services. The outcome will be a system that is responsive to the changing needs of the veterans and their families and one that directs resources to the greatest needs. I commend amendments Nos 1 to 17 to the House. I thank honourable members for their participation.

         The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) talks about the opposition having the effrontery to move a number of amendments in regard to this legislation. If anyone around here has a hide, it is the minister sitting opposite. He has been preoccupied in recent months with the question of travel allowance, to the point where there was the rather amazing situation of him issuing information on the travel arrangements of a Dr Killer. He then had to issue a press release apologising for the public disclosure of this man's travel arrangements. It certainly does show a preoccupation with the travel allowance issue. What has happened, unfortunately, is that because of this preoccupation with other matters he is taking his eye off the ball.

         The vocational rehabilitation scheme is, as the minister correctly noted, a concept of the previous government and is endorsed thoroughly by it. It includes measures that we all in this House agree with. The fact of life is that this week we have seen him finally come around, months later, to what the opposition advocated from the beginning. We indicated back in June that this matter should be released, should be separated, should be divided, from the more controversial measures relating to superannuation rollover and the attempt by the government to force people over 55 years of age to use their superannuation money before they get unemployment benefits.

Whether it is the Public Service, whether it is lack of support for industry policy or whether it is cutbacks in research and development, in all areas more and more Australians over 55 years of age will face this quandary. The opposition indicated quite correctly right from the beginning that we were not going to be intimidated, that we were not going to be pushed into endorsing those kinds of measures just to put this vocational rehabilitation legislation through the House.

         We well know that with this bill we are talking about incompetence, negligence and a lack of clout by the  government. This bill has been around the House for three months, but the minister came in here tonight and said that the opposition should somehow have solved his problems. This minister has had this bill lying around this House for three months. Talk about who is responsible around here! One would have thought that, if it was so important that he went out there and issued press releases attacking the opposition for obstruction and blockage, he might have persuaded the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) to give him a bit more priority.

         I turn to another aspect of this legislation. Some people will be deprived of some time in backdating of their benefits through the other part of the bill simply because he did not get in early enough. They can only go back three months at maximum. Basically, he has been indulging himself in personal preoccupations over the last few months—worrying about what might be the headline in the paper on travel or whether he is going to be asked questions—when he should have been in there pushing and struggling with the Leader of the House to make sure that this bill got to the House.

          It was also interesting to hear the other major announcement which the minister made this evening. He announced that he has had a talk with the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel on the question of the Vietnam Logistical Support Group and their rights.

          Once again this is an attempt to put it over the electorate, to put it over those veterans who are concerned with these matters in regard to responsibility on another aspect of this broad policy area. As the minister says in his press releases, supposedly the previous government, in the 1995 legislation, was responsible for reversing the 1993 Hawkins decision on the coverage of naval personnel from port to port. Isn't it interesting that they have actually waited for a full 18 months to put an instruction—or whatever they call it technically—to say that back in 1995 this legislation altered the meaning of those people who were deemed allotted and that they were deprived of that service?
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Once again it points to a lack of interest in the portfolio. The minister has allowed people in the department to say, `This is what we have tried to accomplish for quite a while. We wish to reverse Hawkins and you are going to be the bunny who is going to essentially approve this.' His later attempt to defend it was by trying to say that an interpretation that he had allowed, that he facilitated, that he operated, was somehow the responsibility of legislation back in 1995. That was despite the fact that Con Sciacca and a number of other ministers made very public statements in this House and elsewhere that there was no attempt to reverse Hawkins. It is pretty rich for him to be manipulated by bureaucrats within the department in 1997 and to say that back in 1995, when it was not even mentioned in the bill, when there was no coverage of this aspect whatsoever, the intention was reversed.

          The other thing that has basically been a total shemozzle is the question of the medals—again because he has not been interested or concerned enough. He says it was not a secret report. It might not have been secret in the full sense, but it certainly had no public input, it did not allow representatives of the general public with a service background to have some input, it was not put out in the public domain for comment and it was not put out there for other people to have a look at and comment upon.

          Apparently I was sent a copy—which as far as I am concerned never arrived—but we had to write to the minister concerned to get a copy. Once again this area has been a total shemozzle because the minister has been too preoccupied with other areas. As part of the resolution that we considered earlier this evening, the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel is making a fourth attempt to solve this medals problem. She had to create a new medal last week. After deciding a few months ago that there was some new capital offence in this country called `double&amp;hyphen;medalling', she has actually had to create a new one to try to rectify the matter. The minister is going to be facing an avalanche of people who have been left out again.

          On the broad expanse of these amendments, they are not something that we oppose. Essentially, the amendments dropped on us in the last few days are going in the right direction.

We hope they accomplish the aim of getting Vietnam veterans back in the labour market.

          as they affect veterans of the Malayan conflict in which Australia took part in the mid to late 1950s. The extension of the service pension to those veterans who served this country in various theatres of war across the globe must be recognised by this House.

        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I wish to draw the House's attention to the case of our Royal Australian Navy veterans who served in the Malayan conflict between 1955 and 1960. Australia had 15 ships involved in 35 deployments in this theatre of operation. The men who served us in the RAN during this conflict are still not eligible for the full service pension.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The basis on which they are being deprived of the service pension is that they did not incur what is known as `operational risk' and therefore do not gain the necessary qualifying status for the service pension. I have benefited from the service pension in a roundabout way because of my father's service in World War II, for which he received the pension. As such, I feel strongly about the right of all our veterans to gain the implicit recognition for their deeds and bravery that comes with the awarding of a full service pension as well as some degree of financial assistance and compensation which they deserve.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The debate which surrounds this bill seems to be bogged down in pedantic detail over the terminology which is used to define levels of service and danger. A cursory reflection on the role of the Royal Australian Navy during the Malayan conflict makes it quite clear that their actions qualify for the appropriate reward.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Actual operations of the Royal Australian Navy over the five years of the Malayan conflict included: escorting land troops through the harbour, which was believed at the time to be mined; enforcing an effective blockade and defending the harbour; preventing infiltration of the enemy through enforcing an embargo and isolating supplies; intercepting enemy signals and tracking the enemy; bombarding communist positions; running training exercises; performing general

        <para first-indent="16">
         In terms of the actual dangers that RAN personnel encountered, we had RAN personnel from several ships caught in a race riot in 1957 in which shots were fired, two RAN servicemen killed during service in Malaya, and RAN ships fired upon by the enemy whilst conducting troop movement and protection in the harbour. Surely this is ample evidence that RAN personnel serving in Malaya faced danger from hostile forces of the enemy and qualify, on this ground, for access to the service pension.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In the 1997 budget, the government partly recognised the Royal Australian Navy service as operational and accepted responsibility for disabilities resulting from that service. Those affected appreciate the belated, partial recognition. However, navy veterans are still fighting to achieve the same benefits as other veterans. The costs of allowing those in the navy in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 their full entitlements will be minuscule, being mainly a transfer of pensions from age pensions, as paid by the Department of Social Security, to service pensions, as paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs.

         As I alluded to earlier, there are documented cases of RAN casualties while in service. The RAN was `allotted' for operational service from 1 July 1955. This is documented in navy office minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The Royal Australian Navy was then apparently

         I would like to mention two glaring double standards that show up the unfairness of the situation that these sailors currently face. The first double standard is that allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for service pensions under the act. Service by five countries in Vietnam was recognised after the Royal Australian Navy service in Malaya was excluded.
        </para>

         The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex-members of the South&amp;hyphen;Vietnamese armed forces are in receipt of Australian service pensions—571 on the married rate and 115 on the single rate. In effect, 1,257 service pensions are being paid to people for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam. While I do not begrudge any of those ex-soldiers the benefits that they are now receiving, I do believe the same generosity should be extended to our own Malayan veterans in the navy.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other glaring double standard I wish to highlight is that members of both the army and the Royal Australian Air Force who served during the same period in Malaya had their service fully recognised after spending just 24 hours in Malaya. Again, I do not begrudge any of these veterans what is rightfully theirs. All I call for is that those in the navy also gain access to their service pension. Perhaps the most pernicious aspect of this whole episode is the motivation for depriving the navy veterans of the special pension. The thing that makes me so angry about this whole episode is that for well over 30 years veterans have been short&amp;hyphen;changed because the Menzies government wanted to save some money during a particularly tight budget squeeze.

Within my electorate I have circulated a number of petitions on this issue that will be tabled in the House. Amongst others, I have received representations from Tom Pendleton, Ron Martin, Walter McGoldrick, Frank Busswell and Eric Grant on this issue.

         There is no greater sacrifice people can make than to serve their country in the theatre of war. For those who have undergone such an experience, it must be insulting in the extreme to be told that they did not really partake in a conflict, that they did not really risk their lives; they were just support crew with no real involvement in the fighting and defending their country's interests. Such views are both hurtful and wrong, and it is incumbent upon the government to change the law so that these offensive propositions can be laid to rest once and for all.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The rebate is to be paid through the new Commonwealth services delivery agency—Centrelink. Currently, child-care assistance is a grant to services that is paid monthly in advance. Under the arrangements to which this bill gives effect, child-care assistance will be paid fortnightly in advance to services based on the individual family's entitlement. But services will not any longer calculate individual family's child-care assistance, acquit child-care assistance or adjust entitlement where care changes.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         At present the rebate is paid in cash, by cheque or by direct credit after the care has been used and paid for—so much so that families can now claim the rebate for care used up to two years ago, which reminds me of some of the things we have seen recently in the House. Through the agency, the rebate will be paid fortnightly to families' bank accounts with a maximum backdating period of 13 weeks. Cash payment is not an option.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Under the new arrangements, a family's entitlements will be based on their projected or expected use of care. From 1 January 1999 we will move to child-care payments stored

          electronically in a consumer-held card. There will be special arrangements for families whose use of care varies and where it may be difficult to predict such care. Families will with the agency, Centrelink, agree on what is the best estimate of care over a fixed period and as such child-care assistance will be paid on that basis. Families can also be paid in arrears on the basis of receipts if care is unpredictable.

         Hardship child-care assistance will be available for those families who are experiencing short-term difficulty in paying their fees. To qualify, a family must satisfy an available funds test which is formula based. Available funds will cover readily accessible moneys, for example cash or income from wages, moneys that might be due from a previous employer, bank accounts and payments from the Department of Social Security. For a couple with two children who are in care, for example, 50 hours a week, the limit will be $2,360. Having passed this test, the hardship payment will cover 100 per cent of the fee and be available for up to 13 weeks with extensions approved by the minister's delegate.

         Children at risk of abuse or neglect—which, unfortunately, are an increasing proportion of those in need of child care—who need immediate admission to child care will be covered by emergency child-care assistance. To be eligible, services apply to the agency and approval is automatic for payment to cover 100 per cent of the fee up to four weeks once a year. If ongoing payment is needed, families apply for the hardship payment during that particular four-week period.

         One critically important aspect of this bill is the linking of child-care assistance and the rebate to the immunisation of children under the age of seven. Now claims to Centrelink for child-care assistance must be accompanied by evidence of immunisation or exemption on the grounds of a medical contraindication or conscientious objection. If a child is behind on their immunisation schedule, the family has 28 days to obtain the next vaccination or lose their entitlement. Then at the next annual child-care assistance review, the child that is not immunised will lose his or her entitlement
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          to child-care assistance. Those for whom a medical contraindication exists may backdate a claim for 13 weeks.

         This measure in particular is something for which the government makes no apology. I understand it is also something that is supported in principle by the opposition. In recent years and in my previous life as the President of the Australian Medical Association campaigning for these sorts of measures I could never understand why the same parents who would be so concerned to restrain their children in cars, to see that they wore seat belts, to worry that they might be exposed to environmental tobacco smoke and all sorts of other things would fail to have their children vaccinated against preventable diseases from which children can and do die.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It also struck me that I could not get my dog into a boarding kennel without having it vaccinated, but I could send my child along to child care and expose him or her to potentially serious diseases because others in such facilities had not been vaccinated. One of the problems that has developed in Australia over the last two decades is that many parents have become preoccupied with their rights and are far less concerned about their responsibilities. Parental neglect can take all forms. One of them is simply not having children vaccinated or immunised.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Linking child&amp;hyphen;care payments, which are a responsibility of government, is a two-way street. We are linking immunisation or a requirement for parents to fulfil their obligations to their children to the payments for child-care assistance. This is something that is long overdue. If a number of Australian parents have their children immunised as a result of this measure alone, then I think we will have done a great deal to protect our children.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the context of discussing this bill, I think it is important also to correct some of the nonsense that has been spread around in the community recently. One of the measures that was undertaken by the government was to withdraw subsidies to community based long day care centres. I think it is worth reminding the House, the electorate and those hardworking men and women of Australia who
         <break page="8728" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          pay the taxes that support these things that taxpayers were subsidising child care to the tune of about $20 per child per week in the community based sector, which provides less than one-third of child care nationally. But average weekly fees were only $4 less than in private centres, which provide 70 per cent of the care. Private operators never received an operational subsidy.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Additionally, in the 12 months to July 1997, before the removal of the operational subsidies, 21 community based long day care centres had closed. The majority closed because of declining utilisation and subsequent financial problems that these centres have had. As difficult as it may be, a part of what the government is doing is trying to rationalise a significant sector of the human services economy which has been growing at a disproportionate rate in some parts of Australia. The assistance given to one part of the industry, if that is what it might be called, has been unreasonable in the context of what has not been provided to other parts of it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The legacy of the unplanned, unchecked and clearly unsustainable child-care policies of the previous government is that we now, in a cruel sense, have an oversupply of centres in areas where there is not particularly strong demand and an undersupply in areas that are literally crying out for places. What we have done as a government is introduce a national planning framework which includes a cap on growth, continued accreditation and quality standards, and a redirection of child-care assistance to those families most in need—that is, low and middle income earners.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Importantly, from 1 January 1999, we will move to the electronic card which families—I do not like to call them clients—will hold and which will store the money that will be used to purchase child-care services. Although it is another term I do not particularly like to use, I think the Labor people know what I am talking about when I say that it empowers parents; it puts more power into their hands so that they are much more able to make decisions about the kinds of child-care services they want to consume for their children, instead of simply providing all of the subsidy to the providers.

        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          A final point I would like to make is that the government has been accused of not doing the right thing in relation to child care, and nothing could be further from the truth. It is worth reminding the House that 83,000 additional child-care places are planned to be established in this country over the next four years, along with 44,000 new private centre places and 39,000 new community based places, which will be a mix of long day care centres, family day care and outside school hours care. That means that an extra 140,000 additional children will have access to quality child care, taking the total number in formal care to almost 750,000. In one sense, that is something we celebrate—delivering more effective child-care policies to Australian parents—but in another sense it is with some sadness that one cites that sort of figure because it means that these are children who, for various reasons, need to spend time in the care of people other than their parents. But such is the nature of modern life.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The other important initiative is a new national planning system that will be underpinned by the planning advisory committees that will include representatives from the Commonwealth, state and local governments, industry, consumers and small business. The committees are being established in each state and territory to identify areas of high demand for child care. The new system will provide parents with up-to-date, relevant information in relation to child-care places in their local area, fees and eligibility for government assistance. It will also improve the collection of information on where child-care places are needed and distribute information to child-care operators.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          One of the important initiatives is to make sure that those people who are planning to go into this industry, into this area of behaviour, have a real understanding of what the demand for these appropriate services are and that the services that grow up respond to a reasonable and consistent demand in the community. One of the problems as we go through this area of readjustment is that in parts of south-east Queensland, where we have seen quite a significant growth in the child-care sector, people who are effectively trying to run a
          <break page="8729" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           small business have established a service where there is inadequate demand, and the policies of the previous government allowed that to happen. In one sense it is cruel. It is cruel for those people in other parts of Australia who have a demand for child-care places yet cannot find any. It is particularly cruel for those people who established a business, who did so by taking a risk and borrowing money and all the other things they had to do, then found that, unfortunately, the demand was not there.

         This amendment summarises the disaster that this government has created in the area of child care. One thing that is clear to this community is that Labor has had, and still has, a very great commitment to and a great understanding of the importance to Australian

Initially it was introduced to support the entry of women into the work force, but child care now is recognised as being equally important in providing education and early childhood development.

         In Labor's period in office—1983 to 1996—there was a 500 per cent increase in Commonwealth funded child-care places. Labor's policies were about addressing needs, not about making budget cuts, which has been the hallmark of this government. In contrast, the Howard government has slashed more than $820 million from child care in its first two budgets. The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) and the members of this government regularly like to use the words `quality, affordable and accessible' in the same sentence with `child care,' but it is the case that their constant repetition devalues these words, because you cannot slash more than $820 million from anything, let alone child care, and claim that you are making it better. The government has attempted to disguise the scale of its attack on child care by spreading the areas and the implementation of the cuts. Look at where and when these cuts have fallen.

         In the August 1996 budget the coalition announced: the abolition of additional income allowed for additional dependent children when assessing eligibility for child-care assistance, which was implemented from 1 April this year; the reduction of child-care assistance cut&amp;hyphen;offs for second and subsequent children, which was again implemented from 1 April this year; an extension in the range of fringe benefits for child-care assistance income testing, to be implemented from 1 January 1998; the capping of access to child-care assistance at 50 hours a week, which was implemented from 1 April this year; the freezing of child-care assistance and child-care cash rebate fee ceilings for two years, and that means no indexation on 1 April this year or 1 April next year; a reduction in the child&amp;hyphen;care cash rebate benefit to 20 per cent for families above the family tax initiative ceiling, which was implemented from 1 April

         Nine months later, in the May 1997 budget, we had another round of cuts which cut the supply of new child&amp;hyphen;care places to just 7,000 a year in 1998 and 1999, a saving of $207 million; it is always taken as a saving. It limited child&amp;hyphen;care assistance for non&amp;hyphen;work related care to 20 hours a week from 1 January 1998, a saving of $81 million. Payment of child&amp;hyphen;care assistance will be changed from fortnightly in advance to fortnightly in arrears from 1 January 1999, saving $32 million. This word `savings' means savings to the government but costs to parents.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The sum of these cuts means that the government has taken more than $820 million from child care—$820 million that otherwise has to come out of parent's pockets. It is the case that Labor does support a planning system for new child&amp;hyphen;care places. The private centres have been the strongest advocates for such planning controls. Labor also supports the reduction in child&amp;hyphen;care assistance for non&amp;hyphen;work related child care to 20 hours a week.

         However, these two measures, while important in themselves, amount to tinkering at the edges when we consider the grave impact of the various cuts and slices to child care that we have seen in the short life of this government. These have all had the effect of making child care less affordable. For example, at a meeting in Melbourne of 40 private child-care providers, three weeks after the introduction of the 50&amp;hyphen;hour cap last April, almost all reported a reduction in usage with those in lower income areas reporting a drop of up to 25 per cent in full&amp;hyphen;time places. Usage dropped more in lower income areas because the cuts impacted most severely on low income families. That is why we are opposing and continuing to oppose the capping of assistance at 50 hours and why we are calling on the government, in this amendment, to reverse this unfair decision.

          These various cuts in child&amp;hyphen;care assistance have been exacerbated by the ending of operational subsidies to community based centres. In many centres the increase in costs is now reported to be $18 a week, confirmed in many newspapers last week with the release of survey material from the National Association of Community Based Child Care Centres. The survey revealed that more than 4,000 families have reduced the amount of child care they use or that they have withdrawn their children from child care altogether. Other important points made by the survey were that in four states the weekly fee for one child in full&amp;hyphen;time care is $170 a week, more than four families in each centre surveyed have reduced hours or have left the centre, more than 25 per cent of centres have reduced staff, 74 per cent of parents using existing care cited increased fees as the reason for leaving, 67 per cent of families leaving centres are using informal care, and 76 per cent of parents reported their fees were due to increase again before the end of the year—a very sorry state of affairs.

          I will give one example of the real result that this is having on families. I was out in Blacktown in western Sydney recently and met with a group of child&amp;hyphen;care workers. I was told of a family in that area which could no longer face the fee increases, the result of the two budgets from this Howard government. They had withdrawn their children from care and hired a teenager at $80 a week to mind the children at home. We have backyard care back in Australia. What an appalling indictment of this government!

          The minister must not sit on her hands and watch our child&amp;hyphen;care system become out of the reach of parents. In recent newspaper reports she has tried to blame the child&amp;hyphen;care centres for the fee rises. From our point of view she needs look no further than her budget cuts. It is thanks to the budget cuts of this government that many centres are facing such deterioration in their affordability. In private centres many staff have already been laid off and proprietors and their families are battling to keep things going. I want to read from the letters a couple of private centres

          We can't plan for the future with confidence. The changes and cuts to the industry here have pushed up costs in ways that have seriously threatened affordability. With all the restrictions and cut backs, this has had major effects on our business—e.g. non&amp;hyphen;indexation of hourly rate, 50% cut in child care assistance for holidays, rebate changes, 50 hour limit etc. A lot of centres have felt unable to increase further fees on families and have therefore absorbed these extra costs—because we are frightened to lose any more business. I do not think we can absorb any further cuts without severely damaging our businesses.

          If the loss of operational subsidy was bad for community based long day care, it is going to be calamitous for out of school hours care.

         <para font-size="-=2">
          The previous low income limits for Child Care Assistance in Out of School Hours Services resulted in few families receiving this form of assistance and so Out of School Hours Services have little knowledge of a system they are expected to administer from 1 January 1998. Holding fees and allowable absences for instance are new notions for many Out of School Hours Services. The tight timelines and the magnitude of the changes proposed will make it difficult for service management, or their sponsoring bodies, to absorb information and put into place appropriate management structures.

         <para font-size="-=2">
          The standard of premises from which Out of School Hours Services operate varies greatly.

Computerised records are virtually non&amp;hyphen;existent in Out of School Hours Services, indications are that the only alternative will be a large increase in administration time.

          There has been no recognition from the department that any additional administration time will be required. The stand taken by the department has been that parents will now have to take responsibility for their child care. They will be responsible for recording absences for sick leave, annual leave and RDOs, while services will be required to keep records that will verify such absences. However the reality is that parents will look to services for clarification and advice.

          Not a vote of support. The increase in child care assistance for parents using these services in no way compensates to the services for the loss of the stabilising backup that operational subsidy provided. Even more ominous is the fact that some state governments are reportedly reassessing their contribution and commitment to these out of school hours services in light of the cuts.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Some of the out of school hours services are very concerned that they may have to close. So not only will we see young children in backyard care—a very serious turning back of the clock—but we will have school age children back on latchkeys. The National Out of School Hours Services Association goes on to ask me to try to have the implementation of the new policy delayed for six months so that they can at least have some time to cope with the changes.

          One specific example of the likely impact on an out of school hours service comes from a primary school in South Australia. This centre provides an essential service in an area where many families do not have the support of extended families nearby. Next year the centre will lose around $13,000 in operational subsidy and this loss will mean that to maintain viability fee increases of around $40 a week for a two&amp;hyphen;child family and $50 a week extra for vacation care are inevitable. These are the figures they have sent to me. These increases will be virtually impossible for many families to carry—a difficulty compounded by the closure of the local Medicare office making it more difficult in the short term for families to access the child&amp;hyphen;care cash rebate.

          This is a view held by many of the most powerful in this government. I am sure it is not the case that the minister thinks that a woman's place is in the home. It is the case that for most women it is not a choice to go out to work; it is something that their families need to keep their budgets together. For other women it is a choice that they want to have. But you have to look at the nature of this government's policies because they make it clear that overall this government wants to see women out of the work force by whatever means, by increasing the price of child care to families to make it more and more difficult for those families to manage to keep both parents in the work force.

         After yesterday and in the weeks ahead, people in Newcastle will come to understand that eventually we need ourselves more than anybody else. Last night's coming together was an expression of that. We have to grapple with the future by ourselves because the government has made it clear that the future of steel is in BHP's hands, not theirs. The government has made it clear that 400 jobs can go in the Public Service in Newcastle and that does not matter to the government. The government has made it clear that it will make the strikes worse rather than better. It is not interested in getting solutions but in having arguments, whether it be on the wharves, whether it be in sea transport or whether it be in the mines or the pits. What is happening right now in Newcastle is a microcosm of Australia. I think the answer we are finding will be relevant to the nation.

          —I rise to pay tribute to the phenomenon sweeping South Australia caused by the Adelaide Crows' history&amp;hyphen;making win on Saturday in the AFL grand final. In my lifetime I have rarely experienced anything like the public excitement surrounding the event. As a child I remember standing at the end of my street with thousands of other South Australians when the Beatles drove past. I remember the crowds when members of the Royal Family visited Adelaide at the height of their popularity.

         On Saturday night in South Australia, excitement hit a comparable level on the Richter scale. As I drove home after watching the match with friends, there were literally hundreds of young people on the streets waving balloons and scarves and singing and waving at passing traffic. Many Adelaide
         <break page="8734" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          homes had red, yellow and blue balloons tied to their letterboxes and fences. My neighbours around the corner now have three totem poles in their front yard painted in the famous colours.

         We owe the Crows a considerable debt in our state. To Malcolm Blight, Mark Bickley, the great Shaun Rehn, Norm Smith medallist Andrew McLeod and their team, all South Australians say a heartfelt thankyou. On behalf of my husband and his old mate John Voyzey, I pay tribute to the Glenelg Football Club for producing such fine footballers as Rod Jamieson, Kane Johnson, Matthew Liptak and Mark Visca as their contribution to the Crows' talented personnel.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Right from the start there were great expectations, to say the least, placed on the Crows' performance once they entered the AFL. Now, some six years later, together with the prior success of the West Coast Eagles, we truly have a national competition. If it were not for the fact that I want the Crows to take the cup home every year, I would wish the Swans and the Lions good luck in order to indelibly enshrine the concept of a national league in the nation's psyche.

         South Australians do not like to be compared unfavourably with the other states. We do not like it when we are referred to as the rust bucket state. We do not like being ignored. We know we deserve our fair share and we know that we can mix it with the best of them, and sometimes we get a bit put out when this is not recognised. At times we do have a self-esteem problem and at times over the past six years we have taken some of our resentment out on the Crows when they have not met our expectations.

         Saturday's victory met every expectation. We knew they could do it and they provided a major boost to our state's self&amp;hyphen;esteem. Such confidence is something that governments find difficult to foster. Confidence comes from feeling good about yourself and your place in the world. Today, South Australians feel very good about themselves and their place in the world. We know we can cut it on the big stage and we did just that on Saturday. The symbolism of this victory should not be lost on South Australians. Our football

         South Australians are not lacking in a generosity of spirit. I believe that I can speak on behalf of all of us in expressing our sincere admiration of Nicky Winmar. His outstanding effort the day after the death of his father in fronting up for the match and playing a fair game was not rewarded in the way he would have wished for his father. For that, he has our deepest sympathy.

         South Australians and Victorians have a lot in common. We both rely heavily on our manufacturing sectors for our daily bread. Our joint cooperation in lobbying the federal government for an outcome from the Productivity Commission's inquiry into the automotive industry that would ensure the future of the industry in Australia, so vital to both our states, was most constructive and effective.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the spirit of that cooperation, I feel it would be most appropriate for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), to publicly thank South Australia's Crows supporters for their outstanding contribution to the Ballarat economy over the past few weeks. We accepted your offer of hospitality and we paid you lots of money.

         In closing, I feel it is incumbent on me to mention the joy experienced by all South Australians due to the pain that a certain football commentator would have been feeling on Saturday night and will hopefully go on experiencing for some time. A plea to all Victorians: in the name of further cooperation between our great states, send Sam Newman to be your Agent General on the Island of Dr Moreau.

          —I rise tonight to bring to the public notice my concern about the integrity of some members of the Court government in Western Australia. One of my constituents, Mr Alan Ingham, has been representing a consortium of Western Australians who wanted to develop a resort on the North West Cape near the Ningaloo Reef. Originally, this resort development, known as
          <break page="8735" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           Ningaloo Seastar Resort, had the support of state tourism minister, Norman Moore.
          </break>
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let me emphasise that Mr Ingham's consortium, Trade Centre Pty Ltd, was exclusively financed from within Western Australia and, as such, would have provided employment, tax revenue and redistribution of profits within Australia. Trade Centre also sought to undertake an environmental impact study to ensure that any development in the area had no negative effect on the Ningaloo Reef or any flora or fauna in the vicinity.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Their concept was to develop an ecotourism resort that would allow Australians and foreign visitors to enjoy the pristine environment on the western side of North West Cape. I for one support their motives, as giving people controlled access to national parks and world heritage areas is now well accepted as the best method of guaranteeing their protection. For Ningaloo, I think this would have been even more important in the context of the state having now approved oil exploration in the immediate vicinity of the reef.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Court government, however, has decided to develop a marina on the mud flats of the east coast of the cape. The government's resort will be marketed by its own Landcorp in partnership with a foreign consortium, which I understand is wholly foreign owned and financed, although one of its directors is Mr Ken Court, the brother of the Premier of Western Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Ken Court is also the failed Liberal candidate for the federal seat of Curtin, which, I am glad to say, is still held by my good friend Mr Allan Rocher. Mr Ken Court has shown some amazing business acumen since his brother became Premier and successfully represented various consortia for government tenders. Ken Court's luck has not escaped the cynicism of the Western Australian public. They are sensitive to such matters, having been educated in political favouritism by the years of Labor's WA Inc. They showed their disgust through the ballot box and I believe that the Court government should keep this in mind.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One small but typical example of public cynicism was shown in a call received by Dr Gallop, the state Labor leader in Western
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          Australia, on a recent talkback radio program. A caller summed up the last decade and a half of government in WA by saying: `You lot,' meaning Labor, `gave all the money to your mates. This lot,' meaning the Court government, `is giving it all to their relatives.'
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The people of Western Australia were almost universally dismayed at the levels of corruption that were uncovered by investigations into WA Inc. and the smaller but equally insidious Wanneroo Inc. scandals. The only real measures to prevent recurrence of this type of behaviour were the recommendations made by the WA Commission on Government. Unfortunately, by the time the commission's report was presented, the Court government had formed the view that the types of protection needed to prevent corrupt activity by government were in fact a barrier to the style of government it proposed to follow. As a result, almost every single recommendation has been ignored.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In WA, the public have only taken one term of the Court government to learn that corruption is not necessarily limited to any particular party, despite claims by the Premier that his government does not have to take any special precautions to avoid the dangers of WA Inc. My main concern, however, is the lack of transparency in the process for choosing the successful project.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think that these circumstances are not far different from previous Labor cabinet decisions to bail out the Rothwells bank or to enter into a secret deal to circumvent the casino licensing tender process for the Burswood casino. Further, I believe that the state government has acted deceptively by making Landcorp a player in the project. This is little more than a protective and anti&amp;hyphen;competitive guarantee for the consortium.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Supposedly to protect Landcorp, the state has granted these foreign investors exclusive rights to develop on the cape. If we have Australian investors seeking to develop a resort without putting state taxpayers' money at risk, why then secretly opt for foreign money propped up by the state and then guarantee they will not have to face any competition whatsoever?
        </para>
        <break page="8736" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          Foreign investment scrutiny is limited to the state government, which I believe has already shown itself to have an unacceptable interest both by the family relationship of Ken Court to Richard Court and by the involvement of public money through Landcorp. The other problem is that, who knows, in the future when the exclusive licence guaranteed to the Burswood casino expires this particular resort consortium may well end up having a casino licence also.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I call on the state parliament in Western Australia to undertake a parliamentary inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the granting of the project on North West Cape to the successful consortium. I believe that the decision to ignore the proposal by Trade Centre in favour of a foreign consortium desperately needs to be investigated.

         My first contacts with John came through regional tourism. The concept of regional tourism was new and was experiencing a traumatic birth.

John soon was appointed manager of what went on to become the Fraser Coast South Burnett Regional Tourism Board.

          John strongly believed in the tourism potential of the Fraser Coast and was instrumental in convincing the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation and the local community that tourism could be a major industry in the area. He also knew that, while each individual centre possessed notable tourist attractions, the area could not become a major tourist destination unless everyone worked together to promote the region.

          I had the privilege of working as chairman of the board with John for four years, during which time he was primarily instrumental in establishing the regional tourism board as a reliable, innovative and hardworking organisation deserving community support.

          John Craig&amp;hyphen;Gardiner had a dynamic enthusiasm for promoting his region and was able to convey his personal excitement to others.

As his classmate Dr Ian Truscott said in the eulogy:

          John has been largely responsible for restoring a tarnished pride in our city. Perhaps that is why Maryborough loved him. He made us feel good about ourselves too, and now when we say "I am from Maryborough", it is with pride.

          After John decided it was time to leave the tourism board, he devoted his energies and organisational skills to a new project. This is Maryborough's sesquicentennial year and it was largely John's idea that the year should be celebrated with pride and style. The city council appointed him to coordinate the celebrations and, with his usual dedicated enthusiasm and meticulous attention to detail, he put together a program involving hundreds of events spreading through the whole of this year—street parties, a visit by tall ships, freedom of the city, parades, reunions, memorabilia, visits by dignitaries, including a visit last week by the Governor-General, and everything that would make this an extraordinarily memorable year.

          —In several previous speeches to this House, I have outlined the potential to the Geelong region and the nation of developing Avalon airport in my electorate as an airfreight hub for the export of perishable food products to Asia and elsewhere in the world. The proposal first surfaced in a report that was undertaken in 1994 and funded by the previous Labor government's Office of Labour Market Adjustment when the airport was still under Commonwealth control. It gained widespread support within the Geelong community from people anxious to diversify the city's economic base and to reduce the city's reliance on traditional manufacturing industries, such as
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           textile, clothing and footwear and automotive manufacturing. The proposal has been enthusiastically taken up by the Habitat Trust—in particular, the trust's executive officer, Ross Mellor OBE, who more than anyone else has worked to develop the concept in a most practical way and to convince decision makers in state and federal governments of the national economic significance of this exciting proposal.

         The Avalon project, in a nutshell, is an ambitious project to establish a dedicated airfreight hub specialising in the export of perishable horticulture, floriculture and aquaculture products to Asia and beyond, drawing that produce from a four&amp;hyphen;state hinterland of Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Riverina in New South Wales. The project seeks to utilise the region's quality transport assets—the Port of Geelong, the Princes Highway, the national standard gauge rail and Avalon airport itself—to propel a state-of-the-art development which has the potential to generate thousands of jobs in the region. Utilising the Geelong region's highly skilled work force, its quality teaching and training institutions—such as Deakin University and the Gordon TAFE—and its productive rural hinterland, Avalon is uniquely positioned to generate a level of regional economic activity not seen in the region for decades.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Now that the Victorian Premier has abandoned his obsessive and stupid idea to locate the Coode Island chemicals complex at Point Lillias—which lies at the end of Avalon's runway—the way is open to establish a unique production zone and associated processing facility at Avalon and Geelong and market the output as clean and green, Avalon fresh produce to receptive and burgeoning markets in Asia and beyond.

         The concept I have outlined has been embraced by trucking magnate Lindsay Fox who, in a joint venture with Serco Limited, won the lease of the airport from the current Commonwealth government. That company, Foxerco, now carries the onerous responsibility of developing the facility to the region's benefit and that of the nation.

Tonight I invite the honourable member to join me in developing this proposal and promoting it for the Geelong region. It is an exciting proposal and one of national significance.

          —I rise tonight to bring to the attention of the House the plight of a constituent of mine, Mr
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           Lee Davis—a plight shared by a small group of constituents in similar circumstances.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Lee suffers from multiple sclerosis. Before being forced to give up due to ill health, he was the proprietor of a small business which employed between two and six people at any one time. He is one of a number of people in my electorate who suffer from a disability and who have taken out private health insurance and an income protection policy while still in business and able&amp;hyphen;bodied. He never expected that one day this would become his only source of income.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Unfortunately for those like Lee who have taken up the responsibility to ensure that provisions are made for themselves and their families in the future, there appears to be little assistance forthcoming from governments to give them a helping hand in their time of greatest need. Ironically, had Lee not taken the responsibility to insure himself, he would easily have been eligible for a number of generous benefits. Few would disagree that Lee's initiative in providing for himself and his family has saved the government enormous cost in various benefits. Had he been disabled and not in receipt of an income from his income protection policy there would have been little doubt that he would have been easily eligible for the disability support pension, rent assistance, a health card and a pensioner's concession card—to mention a few—as well as benefits for his wife and children.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For those who suffer a chronic disability, the costs of insuring that their everyday needs are adequately met can be shockingly expensive. The provision of appropriate equipment which helps to make their living a little more comfortable and meaningful plays a vital part in meeting those needs. The limited income received from the protection policy is certainly nowhere near enough to ensure that one family is well&amp;hyphen;catered for let alone to cover the costs of ongoing needs. The following list of costs will give an indication of the approximate costs Lee incurred when his MS deteriorated further and he became wheelchair&amp;hyphen;bound. These costs do not include the numerous other incidentals which he incurs on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.
        </para>
        <break page="8739" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          His shower chair cost $1,200, his toilet chair cost $150. His incontinence aids create unlimited and ongoing costs. His manual wheelchair cost $1,200 and his electric wheelchair cost $7,000. Repairs and maintenance to his electric wheelchair cost $600 per annum. Batteries for his electric wheelchair cost $300 per annum. Pressure relieving cushions cost $650 and pharmaceutical costs amount to $50 or more per month. There are a lot of taxi fares to be paid at well over $10 per trip. Lee has to make trips frequently to doctors and other health professionals as well as to various meetings.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In addition, building adjustments had to be made to Lee's home, to accommodate his wheelchair when his body was no longer able to carry him. All doors had to be changed and ramps had to be added. Major adjustments had to be made to the bedroom and bathroom to ensure that Lee was able to get in and out without too much drama. As you may be aware, the necessary building adjustments I have mentioned were very expensive. They cost in excess of $50,000.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Another point which is not usually raised and one which I believe is very important is that for those like Lee the numerous and constant repair and maintenance jobs to the family home, which are easily done when they are well, are now done at a high cost through hired labour.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The plight of those with a chronic disability is certainly a long and difficult one. They frequently struggle with the acceptance of their illness, the loss of their jobs, the loss of stable and secure income and the fact that they are no longer in a position to adequately provide for their loved ones. To also contend with the constant problem of acute shortage of funds and resources complicates their lives and the lives of their spouses and children. That is a huge burden that they could certainly do without.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Most people with chronic disabilities are quite fortunate as the government provides them with assistance. Few would disagree that it is a government's responsibility to ensure that people with disabilities are taken care of and well&amp;hyphen;provided for. However, it is also the responsibility of government that those people
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           with disabilities who have made provisions for themselves should not be ignored and neglected. On the contrary, they should be encouraged, understood and commended for being responsible enough to make such provisions. As Lee Davis's example illustrates, despite making provisions for themselves, many people with chronic disabilities experience enormous financial difficulties.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I strongly believe that current government policy should be reviewed where disability services and social security benefits are concerned, with the view of more appropriately accommodating the needs of this community, particularly those who have made provisions for themselves and, as a consequence, saved the government enormous expense. Financial assistance should be made available to this very small and neglected group, to help them with the purchase of their equipment and the cost of their medication and to help ease their burdens at times when they are desperately short of funds. Governments should look into doing whatever is necessary to ensure that the serious concerns of Lee Davis and others like him are properly addressed in the near future.
