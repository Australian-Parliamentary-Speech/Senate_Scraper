It is a program which provides the opportunity for young Australians to assist the environment and to develop accredited training opportunities since the scheme began. By June 1999, the Green Corps will have undertaken some 350 priority programs for the development of heritage conservation projects in conjunction with conservation organisations and community groups right around Australia. It is being managed on behalf of the Australian government by the Trust for Conservation Volunteers. We hope that there will be some 3,500 young Australians who will have had the opportunity to have worked and benefited from these projects by the year 1999.

         The trainees work in teams of 10 and go into the different communities to assist these programs. They are aged between 17 and 20 and have to make a commitment to the environment for a period of at least six months. It is interesting and will probably not come as a surprise to honourable members to note that finding people with a commitment to the environment is not difficult. A survey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that as recently as April 1996 it found that an astonishing 72.2 per cent of people aged between the ages of 18 and 24 are concerned about the environment. The Green Corps provides an opportunity for those people to be involved.

For the first time in a decade, on budget night the finance minister was not required to stand up in this House and introduce a loans bill. In fact, we will be repaying some $5 billion of Labor debt during this current year.

         They also might want to know that this committee, in anything it does, will look at what it has done since the change of government in March of last year. What we have seen through the budget process time and time again is the Labor Party, the opposition, seeking to interfere with the fiscal consolidation of this government. Only last night we saw them trying to stop legislation for Australian National—after they presided over Australian National to the tune of a $1 billion debt and after they had presided over 7,000 job losses in recent years. That is what the young people of Kingston and elsewhere would want to see being examined in this waste watch committee.

         The young people of Kingston can see, more than anything else, fiscal consolidation. As to the policies of this government, they can see home interest rates that have gone down. Young people and young couples in Australia know that, if they want to borrow the average mortgage today, they will pay $292 less per month than would have been the case while Labor was in power. More than anything else, the young people of Kingston and elsewhere know that, through responsible fiscal and economic management under the Howard-Fischer government, their future is very bright; their future is guaranteed.

           —Mr Speaker, the question did also specifically seek from me a response to the comments of the Leader of the Opposition that the bill would be rejected lock, stock and barrel. The fact is that the Labor Party is in a shambles. This weak Leader of the Opposition is unable to state a view on behalf of the Labor Party, and the view we hear one day is not the view we hear the next. It is time the Labor Party woke up to the fact that young people and communities around Australia are welcoming the youth allowance, as they welcomed work for the dole. It has very strong support because they believe it gives the right message to young people. Unlike the Labor Party, they do not want young people to be encouraged to—or have an incentive to—live a life on the dole. They want them to go and build something for the future through education and training. We will see whether you can stick to your position on this any more than you stuck to your position on work for the dole.

         The member has asked specifically about employees of ADI. I can indicate that, in all asset sales, the government takes into account and puts to the forefront of its consideration the impact that any particular sale might have on the employees. All that has occurred to date has ensured that any entitlements and benefits that any employees have are preserved. It is very early days. What might or might not occur in respect of any particular operation of ADI has not, at this point in time, been determined. But the government is having a look at it and getting some expert advice in terms of how we might proceed in respect of that sale. That will unfold over the next month or two.

         In the 13&amp;hyphen;year period from 1983 to 1996, the yield on Australian 10&amp;hyphen;year bonds—bear in mind it was 7.03 per cent at noon today—averaged 11.63 per cent. In the USA over the same period the average was 8.45 per cent—a margin of 3.18 per cent on the Australian bond over the US bond. Since March of 1996 the yield in Australia has been 8.01 compared to 6.6 in the USA—a difference of 1.4. So throughout the period of the 1980s and 1990s we were running a 3 per cent interest differential on 10&amp;hyphen;year bonds as against the US.

         The 10&amp;hyphen;year bond is a measure of inflationary expectations and confidence in the economic future.

It was the new arrangements that the government put in place, with an agreement between the government and the Reserve Bank—the first time ever in Australia—with an inflation target, with the ability of the Reserve to transparently make its decisions known, that gave us that kind of credibility.

During the course of this morning I asked the ambassador of the People's Republic of China to meet with me. During a discussion about the James Peng case, the Chinese ambassador told me that Mr Peng had been moved from Dongguan prison, which is about 150 kilometres from Guangzhou, to Quingpu prison in Shanghai. Consular access will be provided for the Australian Consulate&amp;hyphen;General in Shanghai, and we expect a consular visit will take place very soon. The ambassador has assured me that access will also be provided to Mr Peng's family.

          Peng's interests for me to do so. In our missions in China, we remain in very close contact with the Chinese authorities on this case.

         The government has been assiduous in its efforts on Mr Peng's behalf. We have endeavoured to lend all possible consular support to Mr Peng, including monthly visits by consular officials, and we have raised this case repeatedly with Chinese leaders and officials. As the House would know, the Prime Minister raised it with Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng at the beginning of April, I raised it with the visiting Chinese justice minister, and both the Prime Minister and I discussed the Peng case with Vice&amp;hyphen;Premier Zhu Rongji on 27 May during his visit here.

         The government will be continuing to press the Chinese government for Mr Peng's immediate release and deportation from China. I think the news we have heard today about Mr Peng's whereabouts and the consular access that will be made available to Mr Peng is indeed encouraging.

         Professor Stocker raises some very interesting points in his report, some of which are not new to any government. He also presents a number of challenges. He sets out a blueprint for reform of science and technology arrangements. As a key starting point to identifying priorities, Professor Stocker recommends a shake&amp;hyphen;up of the role of the government's chief advisory bodies—the Prime Minister's Science and Engineering Council, the Australian Science, Technology and Engineering Council, the Coordination Committee on Science and Technology and the Office of the Chief Scientist.

         The report also covers research activities undertaken by the three major science and research agencies—CSIRO, ANSTO and AIMS—and calls for a single strategic plan so as to eliminate duplication of effort, and it seeks a more coordinated effort with the states. As the review covers a number of portfolios and government agencies, I will consider its recommendations fully in consultation with my ministerial colleagues. At the same time, I will encourage feedback from science industry and other stakeholders. I would wish to thank the Chief Scientist for his very valuable effort.

          —I thank the honourable member for his question. The government is very committed indeed to reforming the AQIS meat inspection system. The program to date is to ensure that we do, indeed, have a world&amp;hyphen;class and cost&amp;hyphen;effective system. Broadly speaking, reforms fall into three areas. Firstly, we are pursuing a workplace agreement to change the terms and conditions of employment of meat inspectors. Secondly, we are pursuing on&amp;hyphen;line efficiencies to enhance such
          <break page="6114" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           arrangements as line balancing, which will increase productive output per worker. Thirdly, we are promoting the adoption of HACCP based quality assurance programs where greater responsibility for meeting food safety outcomes will be placed in the hands of industry under strict AQIS audit arrangements.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The project is known as project 2 and, under it, we will be introducing contestable third party inspection systems. At the same time, the meat inspection system is being restructured via the creation of a separately funded and managed meat inspection division. Under the proposed project 2 changes, trials will be conducted in export meat plants of government supervised HACCP based quality assurance systems with routine on&amp;hyphen;line inspections incorporated into each abattoir's quality assurance system. That overall system will remain subject to continuous government veterinary officer supervision and regular comprehensive system audits.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government is absolutely convinced that this approach is the way of the future. It allows for a stronger emphasis to be placed on minimising the risk posed by chemical or biological contaminants which are largely invisible to the naked eye or, in other words, to the old methods of securing meat safety. Accordingly, the government has sought the support of Australia's major meat trading partners for the trial of the new arrangements. We have been encouraged by the results to date.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The United States has recently published Australia's trial proposal in its federal register where it is open to public comment for a period of 60 days. To further demonstrate the government's commitment to meat inspection reform, can I say that I have made contact recently with my opposite number in the United States, the Secretary for Agriculture, Dan Glickman. I will be talking with him again shortly to further progress the initiative. I am especially encouraged by a similar proposal now being developed by the United States Department of Agriculture which was also recently published in that United States federal register. The United States proposal pursues the same objective and embodies the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          same principles as the Australian trial, albeit with some minor differences in the level of direct government supervision of company performance.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is a growing consensus that the system that Australia is proposing to trial is at the leading edge of meat safety and will become the way of the future for international meat inspection and certification systems. Reforms are being vigorously pursued. They will help underpin an efficient, cost&amp;hyphen;effective meat industry, one with the highest standards of product safety.

          —My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Acting Prime Minister, are you telling us that the only steps you took to satisfy yourself of Mr Prosser's compliance with your guidelines was to read Mr Greiner's letter, made worthless by the subsequent appearance in this place of the minister last night when he contradicted its content, without your own personal checking with Mr Greiner or seeking access to the subsequent correspondence made on behalf of Mr Prosser's companies? If that is so, what was the nature of your subsequent consultation with the Prime Minister on Mr Prosser's misleading of the House, on the nature of his discussion with Mr Greiner and on the fact that the minister had clearly breached the code of conduct for ministers? Why hasn't the Prime Minister taken the time to sack the minister? Is that decision on his part a product of your inadequate informing of him?

         That censure motion is substantially the motion that we attempted to move last night when an extraordinary confession was effectively made by the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser).

It was nothing more than that. No matters were related to his business interests. It was just a cold, hard set of addresses. `This letter proves it,' said the Leader of the House when he came in. `This is the thing: it's game, set and match,' he said. `No more needs to be said about that.

          If you take a look at the absolute plethora of propositions which go into that ministerial code of conduct, whether it be related to misleading the parliament or misleading the public or misleading whatever, seated in the centre of it, Mr Acting Prime Minister, when you answer this particular debate, is a set of words which says this: an appearance of benefiting.

Then when he finally was confronted—and we claim no credit for this—with the journalists in the gallery who said, `Hey, hang on. We are convinced about the value of our sources,' he had his lackeys up around the gallery briefing, `Well, perhaps something was done about it,' and subsequently he was quivering in this place himself, saying, `Yes, I did, in fact, discuss the Target store.'

          So we ask you today, Mr Acting Prime Minister: what did you do to get assurances that what you are handling here was or was not a breach of conduct? This is a serious matter, in case you have not noticed—it has been around the traps for a bit lately—as far as this minister is concerned. This minister's behaviour has created a crisis of confidence in a very large section of small business, as they attest to frequently in public. This is not a small, irrelevant matter as far as your constituency is concerned or as far as the people of Australia are concerned.

We would have thought that a person acting in the Prime Minister's position would have started at that point, particularly as this flimsy, subsequently repudiated, letter was going to be the substance of the defence of the minister whose fate you are supposed to hold in your hands. No, you did not discuss it with Mr Greiner. You did not seek to ascertain the facts. You did not seek from Mr Greiner whether or not there had been mention of the minister's private business interests or a matter related to the minister's private business interests in the remarks that you subsequently made.

This is a letter from a privately owned company to Coles Myer based on a conversation, the starting point of which was your minister. That was the starting point of it.

If you do, Acting Prime Minister, we will be happy to hear it in the debate, because you have not chosen to vouchsafe us with that during the course of question time, though I would have thought it would have been, at least in part, a useful defensive position for you to have done so at that time.

          The central point of all of these issues is that the people of this country are entitled to be confident that they are governed in a manner that is based on personal disinterest. That is what the people of this country are entitled to—that ministers are not there utilising their positions to advance themselves, they are not there making judgments about issues that come across their desks and they are not making judgments about those issues, tainted in some way by an element of personal interest as far as this is concerned. These are difficult and serious matters, but governments must confront them.

          What would ex&amp;hyphen;Minister Short be thinking these days? He is probably very happy with his salary, as the sole recipient of the one job that this government has managed to produce in 15 months of government. If he was still interested in a ministerial career, he would contemplate this and say, `What did I do? I was a very minor shareholder in ANZ and I approved a completely routine decision related to one of ANZ's holdings.' And he went, and so he should have gone.

You trade on the fact that this parliament rises three or four days from now, that there is to be a six-week break, that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is overseas and that, really, nobody would expect you to be responsible for anything, nobody in their right mind would think that you would be responsible for anything.

           With regard to point No. 2 raised by the Leader of the Opposition, we have the comment that there was an outrageous step of contacting a fellow member of the Liberal Party to make an allegation, which I will not repeat to the House. Can I just make a point in relation to this: the one person on the board of Coles Myer who would not be influenced by a junior minister, ex-member or continuing member of parliament would be Nick Greiner. He is one of the most case&amp;hyphen;hardened ex-state politicians who ever served as a government leader in New South Wales. He would think nothing of a junior minister's status. He has been through all the hoops that you could possibly have thrown at him in the bearpit. The consequence is that it meant nothing. In fact it meant so little that Nick Greiner said, `I don't want to know about this. You put it in a letter from your brother.' That is exactly what happened.

           In point No. 3 the Leader of the Opposition alleges that this all constituted a wilful misleading of the parliament. In that regard we have two statements which were tendered to this parliament yesterday. In a statement by Nick Greiner, the fourth paragraph is absolute: `There were no discussions between Mr Prosser and myself about any of the details about which his brother subsequently wrote to me.' The statement by the minister for small business to this House yesterday made the same point again. They are absolutely as one; they are not contradictory.

The Leader of the Opposition said that there was no reason to doubt the word of Nick Greiner. There is no reason to doubt the word of Nick Greiner.

            Point No. 4 goes to the question of daily work. Yes, let me confess to something I did last weekend. Let me confess that, during the course of the weekend, I actually opened two gates on my farm with my son, Harrison. Why did I open those two gates? To let some sheep out of the yards around the woolshed so that they could run back down to the paddock where they were being housed overnight. Big deal! But what else do I do? I ring my share farmers from time to time. I ring my share farmers, in effect, for a point of contact on heavenly matters—to find out whether or not it has rained on my farm. Is that a sin?

Once again, the answer given by the minister for small business on Thursday, 19 June, needs to be read carefully, given the hurly&amp;hyphen;burly of question time. But it is absolutely adequate and it has been reaffirmed by his statement of last night. There has been no change. Indeed, it is a very honest affirmation by the minister.

As a minister of the Crown he has used his ministerial position in a way which we believe is in conflict with his duties as a minister, has used his ministerial position to advantage perhaps his own business interests and has used his ministerial position quite obviously to mislead this parliament.

          Ministers should not exercise the influence obtained from their public office . . . to obtain any improper benefit for themselves or another.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          As we said yesterday and as we have said today, the basis of this particular motion goes to the very heart of the defence which the Acting Prime Minister brought to this place today. The fact is that, in answer to a question in this parliament last Thursday, this minister for small business once again sought to conceal the truth from the parliament as to the extent of telephone conversations with Mr Nick Greiner, the deputy chairman of Coles Myer, in respect of a lot in Bunbury, Western Australia, a lot on which the minister for small business and his business partner—his brother, the manager of his business, as he claims in this place—sought to get some material benefit. That was to see a Target shopping centre constructed on that site; or was it?  We will wait and see on that question.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          But the simple fact is that, the moment the minister for small business—and I think in his heart of hearts the Deputy Prime Minister knows this—put his hand on the telephone, lifted it up and dialled Nick Greiner, he was in breach of ministerial standards and the ministerial codes laid down by his Prime Minister. The Deputy Prime Minister, the Acting Prime Minister, said that there was absolutely nothing different between the answer which the minister gave in this place last week on 19 June and the response from Mr Greiner. Acting Prime Minister: that is simply not true. The minister said in answer to a question that was put to him last week:

         <para font-size="-=2">

          Any suggestion there that he spoke to Mr Greiner about Target?  Answer—no.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Yet the Deputy Prime Minister is relying on a carefully drafted fax from Mr Greiner that arrived in this place at 3.47 p.m. yesterday, according to the time; of that fax he says, `I have absolute faith in its contents.' That fax from Mr Greiner said:

          As I have previously indicated, Mr Geoff Prosser rang me. We had a short conversation.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          That should be enough to hang this minister then and there. A minister of the Crown has rung the Deputy Chairman of Coles Myer about his business interests. Where in this fax in its entirety, does it mention Eaton, Acting Prime Minister? Where does it mention the issue of Target? Nowhere. Yet you stood up in this place this afternoon in your defence of this minister and said that his answer on 19 June was exactly the same as this fax which Mr Greiner sent yesterday. That is not true.

          Again, I just trace the history. Last week: question to Minister Prosser on Eaton, Target store and their relationship. Answer: no, didn't do it. Spoke to Mr Greiner but we did not talk about specific issues; no, didn't do it. There were three specific questions in this place yesterday. He refused to answer. Afterwards there was a censure motion in this place. He refused to answer, refused to confirm. He then scurried in here at 8.40 last night to lay down this statement that confirms everything that we have been asking about.

          To return to the Minister for Industrial Relations: in answer to that question, Mr Reith said, `Oh, well, there's a very simple answer to that,' that is, mention of Target. `I think that, in Geoff's mind, Bunbury—the Eaton lot—does obviously refer to Target.' He did not ring up Nick Greiner to ask him whether the price of fruit and vegies was going to be up or down next week. He did not do that.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          He rang him up to ask him about planning issues and issues associated with the Eaton lot in Western Australia. If that is not the case, why did this minister come in last night and supposedly correct the record—supposedly, with his introduction, at the first opportunity? Minister, it was not the first opportunity. There were three questions yesterday and a censure motion and you did not do that. You scurried in when you thought all the journalists were gone and you thought you would lay that down. A bit later on, Mr Reith talks about the contact point again. In that radio interview this morning Mr Reith said, `All he was asked for was a contact point,' and the only sort of follow up to that was that Greiner said, `Get your brother to drop me a line.' And that was the end of it.

I haven't been caught. I haven't done anything like that.' I know the defence is going to come up here, and I can see the Treasurer (Mr Costello) smiling—

          The minister tries to tell this place that the Acting Prime Minister should not be censured for not sacking him, for misleading the parliament and for going absolutely and totally against the ministerial code, which, as I have demonstrated before in this place, is what has happened. Acting Prime Minister, that code is just not worth anything anymore. It is not even worth taking the bit that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ripped up the other day and putting it in a country outhouse.

          What is the essence of the charge? The essence of the charge is this: the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser), somebody who has candidly put on the record his business interests, made a telephone call to Mr Nick Greiner and asked for a contact for his brother. Let us go to the conclusion: it amounts to a reason to censure the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer). Let us strip it of all of the puffery, let us strip it of all of the false logic, and let us state the Australian Labor Party proposition: the minister for small business rang up Mr Nick Greiner and said, `Who does my brother talk to in Target?'—and that warrants a censure of the Acting Prime Minister.

           You can see what happened at the tactics meeting this morning. They walked in and they said, `How do we keep this going? We had a bad day yesterday.' The only person who has actually come in and given any disclosure at all is the minister himself, who, in order to make sure that everything was plain and on the record, came into the parliament last night. You have sat around and said, `We have got nowhere against the minister; let us try and get somewhere against the Acting Prime Minister.' And, when you get nowhere against the Acting Prime Minister, you say, `Have you seen the brother's letter? Have you spoken to Nick Greiner? Have you seen your wife this morning? Have you brushed your hair? Did you clean your teeth?'

           Do you know what it is called? It is called a fishing expedition. You go fishing when you have nothing; and you have nothing. You have nothing against the minister, ipso facto you can have nothing against the Acting Prime Minister. There is no conflict of interest. There is no misleading except from the opposition itself, which has engaged in a scummy little campaign as a distraction against the minister, where it is getting nowhere. This censure motion will be treated with the absolute contempt that it deserves.

          The Procedure Committee report also proposed certain conditions to govern the use of
          <break page="6136" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           electronic means of communications. The previous government had not responded to the report when the House was dissolved on 29 January 1996. Since the time of the report, technology has advanced even further bringing both greater clarity in transmission and lower costs.

         <para first-indent="16">
          On 26 March 1997, following a request from me to the Leader of the House (Mr Reith), the House authorised the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training to take oral evidence from witnesses who were not physically present where the committee meeting was being held. That authorisation expires on 26 June 1997.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          On 29 May 1997, the Employment, Education and Training Committee conducted a public hearing using video conferencing facilities. A quorum of committee members was present in a committee room here in Parliament House. Over a period of two hours, 17 witnesses representing three organisations gave evidence from the Berwick campus of Monash University. That was the first time that video conferencing facilities had been used by a House committee, although Senate committees have made use of this technology a number of times. The hearing was a complete success.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There are some differences between taking evidence from witnesses who are not physically present and the more conventional arrangements. The quality of sound and vision has to be of a good standard so that it does not impede or distract from the proceedings. Obviously, it is not possible for witnesses to pass documents across the table to members, although the technology does exist for electronic versions of documents to be shown simultaneously to both sides of a video conference and for those documents to be transmitted and printed. It is even more important than usual for witnesses to identify themselves clearly before speaking, particularly if they are appearing as a group, so that Hansard is able to attribute correctly the comments of speakers.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There is no reason why a committee could not effectively manage these differences, and the benefits from using video conference facilities can be substantial in terms of sav
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           ings in time and money. There is considerable convenience in being able to hold hearings in sitting weeks with witnesses who are interstate. A quorum of the committee could easily be arranged in Canberra for the 29 May hearing.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The need for a trip to Melbourne by committee members who live elsewhere, secretariat staff and Hansard officers was able to be avoided. The time savings alone from avoiding travel were considerable. The Sound and Vision Office has indicated that the charge for the link between Canberra and Melbourne is approximately $30 per hour. No charge was made to the committee for the use of the Parliament House facilities. The commercial cost of hiring the Monash University facilities is $150 per hour, although they were kind enough not to charge the committee for this inaugural video conference hearing.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Therefore, the cost of the two&amp;hyphen;hour hearing held by the Employment, Education and Training Committee was only $60, but it could have been as much as $360. The total cost of an eight&amp;hyphen;hour link between Melbourne and Parliament House, Canberra, would be $1,440. By comparison, the cost for two secretariat staff to travel to a full day hearing in Melbourne would be approximately $1,345, consisting of taxi fares, $145; airfares for secretariat staff, $820; and, travel allowance for secretariat staff, $380.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          To that would have to be added the cost of hiring a venue if one could not be found without charge and the loss of productive hours spent by the staff while travelling. Of course, Hansard would incur similar costs for its staff travelling to Melbourne for a hearing which, although they do not come out of committee expenses, are still additional costs to public revenue.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          A hearing in Melbourne also would involve some members travelling from their electorates to Melbourne and the costs resulting from that should also be taken into account. There is no doubt that a day's hearing in Melbourne would be considerably more expensive than hearing from the same witnesses via video conference. For a hearing of fewer than eight hours, the use of video conference facilities
          <break page="6137" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           linking Canberra and witnesses in another city becomes even more competitive.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Obviously, there are advantages in a public hearing where the committee and the witnesses are in the same place. Interaction between witnesses and committee members is easier where eye contact is possible and body language clues can be read. Members also have the chance to talk with witnesses before and after the formal hearing. Therefore, the committee does not recommend that video conferences be considered as a substitute for the more conventional hearings but rather as a useful adjunct when the circumstances warrant it.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The committee recommends that the standing orders be amended as quickly as possible to allow as a matter of course the holding of hearings using video conference facilities. The use of this technology will maximise the capacity of committees to take evidence efficiently and effectively and result in significant cost savings.

           —By leave—The first report which I have tabled concerns the proposed decontamination for disposal of the former Albion Explosives Factory site, Deer Park, Melbourne. This project was referred to the committee in March 1994, but the committee was unable to report on it for reasons which I will explain later.

          The project examined by the committee involves a proposed agreement between the Department of Defence and the Victorian Urban Land Authority for the decontamination of the site of the former Albion Explosives Factory at Deer Park. This is part of a series of steps which would also allow the
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           Urban Land Authority to develop the 460&amp;hyphen;hectare site for housing, industrial, retail and community services and setting land aside for nature conservation purposes, for open space and for habitat protection.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The Urban Land Authority will be responsible for the management of decontamination of the site and its development for sale. The return to the Commonwealth would be a series of payments from the Urban Land Authority based on the value of the land assessed in an uncontaminated state. Under these arrangements, the net cost to Defence for the remaining remediation works was estimated to be $3.84 million.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The committee has recommended that Defence enter into the proposed arrangements with the Urban Land Authority. The proposal put to the present committee is vastly different from the earlier proposal. That proposal, referred to the committee in 1994, was for the decontamination of the site, with no development. The cost of the earlier proposal—and I ask the House to note this—was $57 million. This was in addition to about $15 million or $20 million which had been spent on cleaning up 60 per cent of the site before the matter was referred to the committee.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It was due to the diligence and persistence of the previous chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), that these savings to the Commonwealth are now possible. Therefore, the present proposal, estimated to cost $3.84 million, is a marked improvement on the earlier proposal and demonstrates the effectiveness and importance of the Joint Committee on Public Works as a watchdog on public expenditure.

          Mr Deputy Speaker, as you are well aware, there is no shortage of people prepared to criticise parliamentarians on both sides of this House and the role of committee work. The proposal that I currently put to the House actually illustrates the value of this committee. It is tangible evidence of the money that the committee has been able to save the parliament and the people of Australia because it was alert to the unintended but effective wastage that was occurring. Mr Hollis can be proud of the fact that he was

          The main findings of the committee's report are that there is a need to decontaminate and remediate the remaining 40 per cent of the Albion Explosives Factory site, and there is a need for total site disposal. Furthermore, any costs to the Commonwealth of decontamination and remediation should be offset against the potential value of the property.

          The committee also concluded that the involvement of the Urban Land Authority as the manager of the clean&amp;hyphen;up and development of the site can be justified on the basis of expertise and proven track record. It was suggested that the developer of the site should have been tested on the open market. The committee considers, however, that the decision by Defence to enter into a single source arrangement with the Urban Land Authority, without testing the market, was based on independent advice to Defence from a number of sources.

          Contaminated soil stored on the site or still in situ will be relocated to specially engineered repositories. Based on expert advice, of the remediation options considered, the on&amp;hyphen;site repositories are feasible technically, offer the greatest flexibility and have cost advantages. Whilst the Commonwealth will retain the long&amp;hyphen;term risk arising from site decontamination, expert advice to the committee indicated that there will not be any health problems caused by the use of on&amp;hyphen;site repositories. The question of responsibility for monitoring the repositories remains unresolved. The committee has therefore recommended that this responsibility be assigned to relevant state authorities at the time of the finalisation of the formal agreement for the remediation, disposal and development of the site by Defence and the Urban Land Authority.

For this reason, the committee has recommended that, in land transfer negotia

          I note that this reference has caused some hilarity around the chamber. I point out to those who are in the chamber that it is something of an irony for the Public Works Committee, because there was an occasion when the Public Works Committee was involved in the location of a building in Canberra—Mr Hollis will know which building—when it was discovered that the site proposed for the building was on the only other area in the nation with a sizeable legless lizard population. Effectively, in three years, the Public Works Committee has found itself involved in proposals that have affected the habitat of this endangered species, the legless lizard, with both of these proposals being centred in areas with a high population of this particular little beast. If the legless lizard ceases to be an endangered species, it will have the Public Works Committee of the federal parliament to thank.

          The so&amp;hyphen;called `do nothing' option is not feasible. To do nothing would result in a decline in the level of service to passengers and compromise the efficient operation of the terminal. In terms of aircraft, the option would result in aircraft possibly waiting for one or 1&amp;half; hours on taxiways before accessing aircraft parking positions. Inside the customs hall, passengers could be left waiting for up to two hours for their baggage. Clearly, this is unacceptable at any time and it is particularly unacceptable in preparation for the 2000 Olympics. The House should note that, even if a second airport were to be constructed starting tomorrow, the completion of that airport would take at least five years. In that time frame, the demand for these facilities at

          Against this background, the report concludes: first, that Sydney airport, as the main gateway to Australia, has an essential role in meeting increasing passenger demand into the next century. Secondly, as no decision on the location of a second Sydney airport has yet been made, Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport remains the only international airport in New South Wales. Thirdly, if the improvements required to cater for increased traffic are not made, the ability of the airport to cope with demand will be seriously impeded. Fourthly, the timing of the Olympics and the associated pressures on facilities mean that any improvements will need to commence immediately in order to avoid construction during the Olympic period. Finally, forecasts provided by the Federal Airports Corporation indicate that 10 additional gate positions and associated facilities are required, which would satisfy requirements until 2003.

          There is one matter about which the report is critical of the Federal Airports Corporation. The proposal had not received the required clearances by the relevant Commonwealth environment protection authorities before it was referred to the committee. Many of the issues raised by local government authorities and community groups regarding the impact of further development and the Federal Airports Corporation's responses to them should have been the subject of environmental impact assessment and subsequent clearance by protection authorities before the public hearing.

           It was stated by the FAC that issues raised during the committee's inquiry would be taken into account in the preparation of the impact assessment. The committee does not see itself as a substitute for an appropriate environmental assessment of any proposal. This responsibility rests with proponents complying in a timely manner with the provisions of the act before proposals are referred to the committee. The committee has therefore recommended that any further development of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport should have appropriate environmental clearance before being referred to it.

People do not go on it to make a great political career—look at me! Nevertheless, it carries out a role that I believe the parliament is here for—as a watchdog over public expenditure. I do not want to detain the House or bore the House, but there are a whole range of projects on which money has been saved—$10 million here, $8 million there or $7 million. But in this case the $30 million saved was because of the work of the Public Works Committee, not only the previous committee but the current one. I am sure that that committee will continue with its very important role of watchdog for this parliament.

This is a government with no industry policy,
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           and its having no industry policy is the reason why unemployment continues to climb and why the manufacturing industry has no confidence in this government and has been calling for an industry plan.

         The reality is that what the government has ended up with so far by way of an industry policy has had nothing to do with them; it has all been of Labor's making. I mention the circumstance the other day of the car plan—Labor's car plan essentially embraced by this government. Having labelled it three hours before in the parliament as cheapjack populism, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was humiliated into going into a press conference that night to accept the thrust of Labor's car plan. We still want to see the detail of the replacement for the export facilitation scheme, and we are still of the view that the review of the industry should be brought forward to 2003.

         Apart from those two items, the rest of what the government has embraced Labor campaigned on from the end of last year onwards. The government resisted it, was forced to accept it and now has a car plan. A week before, it was saying that we did not need a car plan, it did not have a car plan and, when it finally announced its car plan, it embraced Labor's car plan.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is similarly the case with the bounties. The government abolished four bounties in the budget before last—those which covered the book publishing industry, the shipbuilding industry, machine tools and robots, and the computer industry. The government has now agreed to restore two of those four bounties—those relating to ships, and machine tools and robots. The book publishing bounty has been extended by six months, but the government has still fallen six months short of what Labor had in place, and the computer bounty is still being opposed by this government. I will come to those aspects at a later stage in consideration of the message from the Senate.

         For the purposes of this part of the debate, I want to concentrate on just the shipbuilding bounty, in relation to which the government did another massive backflip. They told the shipbuilding industry in August last year that they were going to abolish, without any

The same invitation was extended to the government and not taken up by one member of that government. They make these decisions without understanding the impact. They make these decisions without understanding the ability of this industry to come from nothing and be a world&amp;hyphen;class competitor effectively exporting all of what it produces but having to compete with a distorted world trading environment because countries with whom they have to compete offer significant incentives.

         These countries, Italy in particular, offer significant incentives to their industry to build these competing vessels. Italy offers a bounty in the order of 20 to 25 per cent.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The catamaran producers of Australia were saying, `We can compete with a bounty at five per cent versus 25 per cent but we cannot compete at zero. What we expect is a bit of support from the government to recognise that it is on the margin that it is going to be putting us out of business. We need to retain this bounty.'
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It was Labor that ran the campaign to retain the bounty. It was run by the member for Lyons (Mr Adams), the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) and the member for Franklin (Mr Quick). It was also run by our Western Australian members of parliament, the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) and the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) as well as Senator Cook. We have visited the producers of these vessels all around the country. We understand what they have come from to be, and we insisted that the bounty be retained.

        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          Finally the government buckled under pressure and agreed to the retention of that bounty. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), who is currently in Santiago, issued a press release on 7 May, outlining an agreement that he said was the government's position, extending the shipbuilding bounty to 30 June and essentially meeting almost all of Labor's demands, except for the point that we will not wipe out the bounty in 1999, which has been extended to 30 June 1999.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We are saying that we will not wipe it out then if the other countries with whom we are competing have not signed up to the OECD shipbuilding agreement. There is no guarantee that they will, and we have argued that. Nevertheless, the industry have said, `Don't push for the extra point on the OECD agreement. We're happy as it stands now, if we get a timely enough review before 30 June 1999 in which our position can be reassessed'—in essence, to take account of whether the OECD shipbuilding agreement is acceded to by the other countries.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Let me put on the record that Labor will be going into the next election saying that it will not be reducing the bounty if those other countries have not signed up to the shipbuilding agreement. That is not the government's position; it is Labor's position. We will be arguing that at the appropriate time. We said to the shipbuilding industry that we were not prepared to hold up the agreement that they had reached with the government, through our pressure, for that point alone. That is further down the track; we can deal with it at a later time.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          But, having got the agreement, this government threatened over the weekend—threats by Minister Moore's office as well as by Senator Abetz in Tasmania—that, because Labor had won in the Senate on computers and on getting an extension in relation to books, that meant the end to the shipbuilding agreement. Such a condition was never put by the government when it said to the industry, `We will reach an agreement with you.' But it was what Senator Abetz was campaigning on in Tasmania over the weekend, and I had many calls from the media about it. The government
          <break page="6146" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           was introducing a new factor—not the shipbuilding industry standing alone, but a conditional agreement with the shipbuilding industry: `If you sink the computer industry, if you sink the book publishing industry, we'll keep shipbuilding afloat.' We reject that nexus. Our response at the time was, `Go ahead and reject the shipbuilding bounty, and we'll be down in Tasmania campaigning on this issue again,' the government has backed off from that nonsense.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I will conclude this aspect on this final intervention, because it is important to understand that this is a government that has no strategic approach to any aspect of industry policy. It responds only to pressure. It is a government that, in all of its positions, will crumble to pressure. It crumbled in the case of cars. It crumbled in the case of ships. We got a semi-crumble in the circumstance of the book publishing industry. But, then, because we won the other two bounties, the government sought to use that fact as a threat to the shipbuilding industry.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We think the shipbuilding industry deserves better treatment than that. We were immediately to their defence—not just I, as the shadow minister, but all of our members in Tasmania and our members in Western Australia. Those states are the two big centres that are the beneficiaries of this bounty. We need to understand the position in Tasmania, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins. It has an economy with horrendous unemployment. The shipbuilding industry is the largest private employer in that state. It employs almost a thousand people, and this government's budget decision of last year would have put them out of business. If you do not believe that, Minister, go down there and talk to the shipbuilding industry. Do what your senior minister was not prepared to do at the time: go and talk to the industry.

          The only time Minister Moore, Black Jack, has visited the shipbuilding site in Tasmania—maybe there was a new game opening at the casino, I do not know—was when he was forced into accepting Labor's position and did a double backflip to restore the shipbuilding bounty. They have done backflips on the issues of ships and machine tools and robots.
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           They have also got to do a backflip on the issue of computers and they have got to do it fully in relation to the book publishing industry, because that is the other message that has come back from the Senate. They are the amendments the government will not accept.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I say to those industries, `Remember the history of the shipbuilding industry. Remember that the government abolished the shipbuilding bounty in August of last year, but it's now restored. It's restored because an effective campaign was run to have it restored, and Labor was at the forefront of running that campaign. We concentrated on the regional dimensions. We concentrated on the jobs at threat. But we also concentrated on the fact that, if the bounty were to be retained, we would not only protect the existing jobs but also get more jobs and more exports.'

         <para first-indent="16">
          I would have thought, Minister, that the two most pressing economic problems facing this country were jobs and the balance of payments; yet the decision that you took to abolish the shipbuilding bounty put both of those into the negative. You would have seen job losses and no more exports. Labor's plan is to keep the bounty in place until the other countries reduce theirs and to use the fact that we are keeping something there as a form of pressure on those other countries to reduce theirs.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Why would they be pressured if we had nothing to bargain with? What we were saying is: keep the bounty and we will get more jobs and more exports. Labor had a plan for jobs. Labor had a plan for exports. This was a government too stupid to see it, until the final pressure succeeded in the campaign with the amendment that we have here today.

         <para first-indent="16">
          My message is: congratulations to the government for accepting Labor's plan on the shipbuilding industry. But to the book publishing industry and to the computer industry, the message very clearly is: develop your campaign to properly have your bounty restored too. The Senate is on&amp;hyphen;side with you. We have the numbers in the Senate; the government has not. The Senate is prepared to back sensible industry policy.

The ships bounty is very important to the Incat operation in Tasmania. There are over 1,060 employees in this operation and it generates enormous economic activity for southern Tasmania. I think there are about 170 apprentices and 82 trainees presently in traineeships at that plant and those people are gaining very valuable skills and adding to the economics of that part of the state.

         The interesting thing is that the management of this company has said that if they could not keep that five per cent bounty, they would certainly be laying off employees.

All they wanted was to be treated basically in the same way that other governments were treating their shipbuilders, especially throughout Europe.

         Of course that comes back to this government's failure in its industry policy area. It really does not have an industry policy.

Where the boats should go is a matter of some debate in Tasmania.

         I was very disappointed with Senator Abetz, the Liberal senator from Tasmania, over the weekend. The position being run in Tasmania is that because the Senate had held up the other three amendments to this bill, dealing with the robotics, machine tool making and books bounties, that therefore was going to mean a loss of the ships bounty. That was certainly untrue. That was just making mischief, really, and giving concern to the workers at Incat that there may be something that would affect their jobs.

That was a disgraceful performance. Thousands of workers involved in this industry, and the investors and all those associated with it, were suddenly placed in a position where those who had created the environment for the change of policy that this government was forced into were being told that the amendments that have been put forward ultimately by the government were going to be withdrawn unless there was a change of heart by the opposition in relation to associated bounties—books, computers and the like.

On the weekend, Senator Abetz issued a press release in Tasmania, the thrust of which was that, unless there was a backdown by Labor in relation to the other bounties, the government would withdraw the commitments it had made with respect to the shipbuilding industry. No wonder that perished in such a short period of time, because the unbelievable betrayal of all those people associated with that industry, the uncertainty and the lack of confidence in the industry that would have immediately been manifest plainly showed how stupid and destructive that threat was.

         The government does not accept the Senate amendments, which would remove the provision in the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill for early termination of the book bounty on 30 June 1997. Early termination of the book bounty on 20 August 1996 was announced by the government in the 1996-97 budget as part of its strategy for fiscal consolidation. Termination was extended by the government, in December 1996, to 30 June 1997 in recognition of contracts already in place at the time of the budget.

The industry will continue to benefit from the existing copyright arrangements, which provide Australian copyright holders with a strong incentive to print in Australia. It is the government's belief that this bounty should not be extended past the currently announced termination date of 30 June 1997. Accordingly, the government opposes these amendments.

         In August of last year the government announced that it would knock off the books bounty in June of this year. Again under pressure from Labor we got an extension of that decision by six months. We have just heard the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) say that that was done in recognition of contracts already in place.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The real problem is that the book and book publishing industry expected this bounty to continue until the end of 1997. It was told as much during the election campaign when this government was out there campaigning. It had contracts entered on the basis of that full extension. So, if the argument is right that the government has extended it by six months, why not extend it to 12 months, in accordance with the Senate proposition and with your promise in the last election campaign, which interestingly enough happened to be the recommendation from the Industry Commission for the book publishing industry?

         This is a government which commissions reports from the Productivity Commission and the Industry Commission, and ignores them.

         We are not pleading for a special handout for this industry. We are just telling the government that it needs to have regard to what its competitors do. For example, New Zealand has a 50 per cent subsidy on production costs of certain books. New Zealand is the sort of economic model that it suits the government to hold up from time to time. It is supporting its book publishing industry. Singapore is another country that we often have quoted to us. It is one of the Asian tigers. It has tax breaks and incentives specifically to support its book publishing industry. So ours is an industry that is not playing on a level field.

         We are saying that it is important to enable this industry to continue to compete until those countries reduce their levels of protection. Again, we are talking about a minimal level of support versus huge levels of support. This is an industry which, in Australia, can continue to operate, function and compete with the level of assistance provided by the book bounty but not with it being cut from underneath it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Again, it is important to understand the impact of this industry on the nation. It is estimated that 2,600 jobs will be lost in the printing and publishing industry if the book publishing bounty goes. We have already seen some of those jobs lost in Adelaide, where, with the announcement in last year's budget that the bounty was gone, Griffin Press laid off 140 workers. What they are looking for is the restoration of it.

         Another area which is terribly important—and I know the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) will want to speak about this—is the impact in regional areas.

Of the work force of Maryborough, 25 per cent is in jeopardy because of this government's decision. We know that, because we visit these areas.

In the lead&amp;hyphen;up to the last election, the book publishing industry thought they had that in the promises that were made to it by the current government. The simple fact of the matter is that they were lied to by the government. A very explicit promise was made to this industry that this bounty would be retained but, no sooner had the government come to power than—in its first budget—it sought to emasculate the provisions that had been put in place for this industry by the previous Labor government.

As the honourable member for Hotham has indicated, at the end of the bounty period—at the end of this year, according to the original plan—we would have required the Productivity Commission to examine the progress of our trading partners in reducing assistance measures to their book publishing industries, and we would have instructed the Productivity Commission to investigate the impact any changes might have in regions and on jobs.

          —So that there is no misunderstanding, let me just say this to the industries that depend on the book publishing industry in Maryborough and Adelaide and to the workers and communities of Adelaide and Maryborough: step up the campaign. You have had partial success. The campaign you have run, with Labor, has seen the government already extend the book publishing bounty by six months. Only six months more and you have got what that government promised it would do when it got elected but then ratted on when it introduced its first budget.

         Keep up the pressure. It is a government that will crumble. They crumbled on machine tools and robots, they have crumbled on the shipbuilding bounty. Why not book publishing? Why not computers? Step up the campaign, run it regionally, run it with a view not just to securing existing jobs but to talking about the potential for job growth and export growth. These are the issues that the Australian community wants addressed. Whilst they have got a government dismantling programs in a way that runs against the very essence of those things, they will turn on you and turn on you badly. In the meantime, Labor will be in there seeking to have this restored. We have already got the numbers in the Senate; we only need them in here next.

           series of amendments to this bill are designed to restore what rightfully belongs to this industry according to the plan that the previous Labor government introduced for this industry and which was agreed to and promised by the current government in the context of the election campaign in March 1996.

         The honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) has already alluded to the fact that these particular firms in this industry are located primarily in regional areas. He mentioned the town of Maryborough in Victoria, which both of us, as I mentioned in my previous remarks, visited in the wake of the first Howard budget when these particular bounty measures were to be withdrawn.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let me say that the executives and the workers in these particular firms spoke in quite disparaging terms about this current government. Even then, they referred to the fact that it was a rudderless government in terms of industry policy. Even then, they said they had a weak industry minister. But they were hoping that some commonsense would prevail and that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) would intervene and perhaps carry the day on their behalf with some logic and with some support for the promise he had made to the Maryborough community. And they were hoping they would receive some support from the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) and the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), who know this area intimately.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But, sadly, they were betrayed by the member for Ballarat and the member for Bendigo. Sadly, they were betrayed by a hapless and hopeless industry minister. Sadly, they were betrayed by a Prime Minister who cutely divides his promises into core promises and non&amp;hyphen;core promises. And today, in this House, they have been betrayed by a minister who should not be occupying the position that he does in this place at this point of time.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So, when we look at the triumvirate of the Prime Minister, the industry minister and the minister for small business, we see that the people of Maryborough have been badly betrayed. They will not forget, as I said in my previous remarks. The honourable member for Hotham, the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams) and I have all been there to
         <break page="6154" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          deliver support to the workers and to the management of the firms in these particular areas. They will not forget this act of betrayal in the first Howard budget.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The words of encouragement that have been given to the people in these areas by the member for Hotham, I can only reiterate and support. This is a weak government led by a weak Prime Minister. We know from past experience that, when the heat is turned on them, they roll over like little puppy dogs, have their tummies tickled and eventually come to the party.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         All we are attempting to do in supporting these amendments is to ask the government to keep faith—to keep faith with the promises they made to the people of Maryborough and the people of Adelaide, and to keep faith with the workers who have done so much to restructure their industry and to position their industry for future job growth.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We want the government to keep faith with the promises they have made to the people across the length and breadth of regional Victoria. The people of Maryborough have suffered badly at the hands of a Liberal state government. There is no discretionary income because of the gambling situation in Victoria. Wages are very low because of the flexible wages and conditions that have been introduced by this state Liberal government and now this federal government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These people were asking for some certainty and job security. They have not got it from this government. They have not got it from the Prime Minister, the industry minister and the hapless small business minister, who hangs around now swinging in the breeze waiting for his comrades to cut him down.

The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), who is in Santiago, put that proposition up—that is, we will retain the computer bounty, no ifs, no buts. Now it has hit the fence and we the poor old hapless junior minister, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser)—and junior minister not much longer; he should be preparing his further defence—in here today having to defend a position where the Senate have sided with Labor to force this government to honour its election promise.

         You went to the last election promising to match Labor's retention of the bounty to the end of 2000. Labor had put in place a very successful strategy, part of which the minister has alluded to in terms of his glowing report on the success of this industry, but it only happened because there was an industry policy in place. The computer bounty was part of it. The partnerships for development program was another part of it. The commitment to research and development was another part.

         There were many different elements, but all of them were geared to the fact that, if companies were to get the assistance, they had to commit to growth in investment, in jobs, in research and development and in exports.

         Total industry exports, including hardware componentry and printed circuit boards, trebled over the last five years. That was under Labor's plan.

We have seen the government admit the error of its ways in relation to the shipbuilding industry, a vital industry for Australia and particularly for some of our regional parts such as Tasmania and the east coast—shipbuilding is a very significant part of their work force. But the reality is that the IT and communications industries are an even more substantial part of Australian industry. Shipbuilding is important, books are important and the robot and machine tool bounties all have a significant role to play. Yet IT and communications is a multibillion dollar industry for Australia and, unfortunately, it is a multibillion dollar industry where we are losing the race in terms of our regional commitments.

The reality, if we look at the Intergraph example in Victoria, is a complete disaster, costing the government money and not saving it. If you look at the EDS example in South Australia, you can see that outsourcing to multinationals does not produce savings. Those savings are completely illusory and you lose all control over the industry.

I made it clear to him that that story was not accurate, yet he got up in front of 2,000 workers worried about their jobs and told them that that was exactly what the government was going to do. It was a gross bit of misrepresentation.

He made a living out of taking the storemen and packers out of every export industry in Australia. We could not get wool out of the country, we could not get computers out of the country—we could not get anything out of the country. And he says he is pro exports! That is how he made his living. Nothing has changed. He still thinks he is at the factory gate, as he harangues this place and carries on.

         The trouble is that the member for Hotham does not have any solutions. He is telling us he wants exports, and his solution—it was endemic in his period as a minister—was to borrow money from the rest of the world and pay it out in bounties in the hope that the rest of the world might buy some of our goods. We saw his government's debt blow out to totally unacceptable levels, and it has to be paid off by people who do not even have the vote yet. His policy was to keep pouring the money out without ever giving the industries concerned any incentive to stand on their own two feet after a reasonable period of assistance.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It is interesting that he wants the world to believe that the tariff decision of this government was all his work. I tell you what: he has a very inflated opinion of his own influence on this side of politics. We think he is a loudmouthed fool, and he has no influence. He also has a very inflated opinion of himself, and that is his only asset. It has fared pretty well for him, I might add, because he sucked in a lot of people in the trade union movement and he enjoyed a good, comfortable living and then got a transfer to a job up here.

         The member for Hotham tells us all about tariffs—a total turnaround from the lectures he gave this parliament and Australia when those opposite were in government. I made the comment just the other day, because the situation is so silly, that depending on tariffs to protect industry is a bit like a medieval knight relying on his castle walls after gunpowder was invented.

Over this period, bountiable production has increased. Removal of the 4.5 per cent bounty six months ahead of time should not have significant adverse impacts on the printing and publishing sectors. Accordingly, the House of Representatives opposes Amendment Numbers 3, 4 and 5.

          —The opposition supports the Carriage of Goods by Sea Amendment Bill, which amends the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, which relates to the giving of effect to the Hague Rules. The act currently has an automatic trigger in it which would take effect on 20 October 1997. But the government, the industry and all affected parties believe that it is a good idea to remove this automatic trigger and to provide for a regular review before the Hamburg Rules are adopted. The legislation also clarifies the situation with respect to the availability of legal rights within the Australian legal system not being impinged upon by the fact that arbitration in the United Kingdom is provided for in the existing legislation and broadens the regulation making power.

         The bill is essentially a compromise between shippers, shipowners, insurers and other interests in the industry and it reflects the report of the maritime cargo liability working group. The Hamburg Rules are better for cargo owners than the existing Hague Rules, but only 22 countries have adopted them, most of them in Africa, covering only approximately one per cent of international trade. The bill also facilitates technological improvements, such as the adoption of new

         The opposition supports the bill. We have substantial problems with the broader government policy with respect to the maritime industry, particularly the government's proposals to introduce foreign guest workers into our domestic transport system in the form of coastal trade, to expand the risk of ships of shame causing environmental problems with respect to our coast, to reduce seafarers' wages and conditions and to deny fiscal support to Australian shipping to place it on a competitive level playing field with international shipping. But, with respect to this specific legislation, the opposition supports the bill and does not propose any amendments.

          —The Carriage of Goods by Sea Amendment Bill 1997 amends the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1991. When the original act was debated in 1991, there was objection to the previous government's inclusion in the act of the Hamburg Rules provisions without any set period for their proclamation. As a compromise, an automatic trigger mechanism was included in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act; thereby, if the government did not adopt the Hamburg Rules within three years from the making of the act, these provisions would come into effect unless parliament determined otherwise.

         The matter was deferred in 1994 for three years. Had nothing been done in October of this year, the automatic trigger would have come into operation. A cargo liability working group was set up in 1995 to examine the issues involved in this debate and make recommendations to improve the cargo liability regime for Australian shippers. The group included representatives of shippers, carriers, shipowners, marine insurers and marine lawyers—all relevant groups in the industry. In October 1995, the report of the marine cargo liability working group was presented to representatives of concerned industry groups and a package of measures was endorsed.

          There is acute difficulty at times in the carriage of goods and people by land, sea or air in terms of legal interpretation and analysis. Whenever anything that remotely resembled a problem that arose in relation to carriage of goods by land or by sea, or where air carriers' liability was concerned, a whole host of rather complex legal situations came into play and limitation periods abounded. A lawyer acting in the matter had to be extremely careful to ensure not only that his own professional indemnity insurance was up to date, for fear of an error that could be made with the very strict limitation periods and unusual traps for young players that were in those pieces of legislation, but also that the right steps were taken.

          In essence, this legislation, in my view, attempts not only to rectify some inequities in the system but also to unravel some of the oddities involved. Shipper's liability and liability at sea have bedevilled jurisprudence for many years. If you care to peruse the Lloyds law reports, you will see numerous cases involving interpretation of liability conventions, rules and common law developments that arose from interpretations of various pieces of legislation.

          It was an absolute legal minefield. Basically, it is largely due to the peculiar risks, I suppose, and the mode of transport that was used as it evolved from very primitive sailing vessels, vessels that were not particularly seaworthy, to the much more modern fleets that are around. As we saw from the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Ships of shame

          The unusual development of rules, and certainly the particular dangers that are at sea, have never been conducive to plain sailing. For example, many people would think that the real dangers are there the further you go out to sea—sailing around Cape Horn and so forth. When I was at sea, I can recall that the worst weather I ever encountered was off Jervis Bay. I have sailed across the Pacific several times, across the Tasman, across the Great Australian Bight in the Roaring Forties, off the coast of the States and up in the Far East, but the worst weather ever was off

           Jervis Bay. That is why, when you are looking at the sorts of rules that have evolved in this area, it is no good saying, `The insurance premiums jump up slightly the further you go out or the closer you are to Cape Horn.' A different set of regimes and intricacies are involved.

          It is important for the exporters. In my own electorate, I have some exporters who avail themselves of shipping lines to export their goods. A company in Brendale exporting a substance called bentonite uses containers for that purpose. It is important for them in particular that the shippers, the owners of the goods, have a bit of security for their goods. Over the years that has been a fairly negligible thing. Liability has been avoided through some rather unusual provisions in the insurance contracts and in the conventions and rules.

         <para first-indent="16">
          It is important to bear all those things in mind and to ensure that the peace of mind of those people who are shipping goods is enhanced, so that our competitive edge can be improved in what is a highly competitive international market. If we can assist and facilitate the movement of goods and give some comfort to the shippers of these goods, we are assisting in earning much needed export earnings. These particular measures go at least a fair way to doing that.

          On the question of vessels starting and finishing in various localities, basically it stands to reason that ships can be in a tropical area when they set out and end up somewhere off Newfoundland at the end of their voyage. There are a lot of peculiarities involved and damage to marine cargoes can result from all these things. The problems that have arisen because of all these things have basically, you could say, piled up like deck chairs over many years. Carriers, insurers, lawyers and politicians have tried valiantly to reach some accord on the laws relating to the carriage of goods by sea but, like so many ships sitting at the bottom of the ocean, the chance of universal agreement has frequently sunk without trace up until recent times. The fact that the world still grapples with this problem can at least give us some comfort as we proceed along this road, a road that I think is

          The current act did seek to charter a safe course through the maze of marine cargo liability and, in effect, adopted the Hague Rules as basically a safe bet. They have been around since 1924 and were remodelled in 1968, 1969 and then in 1979, and these became the amended Hague Rules. Notwithstanding the longstanding acceptance of the Hague Rules, a new sail, if you like, was sighted on the horizon in the Hamburg Rules and was thought to be a thing of the future, shifting more of the responsibility to the carrier. They were included in the 1991 act and, as I said, were to come into effect in 1994. Due to a relatively slow international response, landlocked countries accepted them but most of the major shipping countries did not and deferred them, as did the parliament here.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As I said, the Hamburg Rules trigger this year basically pressed the industry and in effect all relevant groups in consultation to come up with some acceptable compromise because to be automatically adopted in October 1997 would be an obvious commercial disaster. What has occurred in reality has been a very good compromise and is one that is supported by the industry.

          Briefly put, the Hamburg Rules trigger is deferred for 10 years. Bearing in mind the time that has elapsed leading up to this position, it is a relatively short time, one would think. The ongoing reviews of the system are provided for with full consultation with all parties. A wide&amp;hyphen;ranging power by regulation to engross the solutions as they develop is included. This relates to points such as documentation and deck cargo and will be covered by the liability regime provided that, no later than at the time of booking, specific stowage requirements of the shipper have been notified to and agreed by the carrier.

          As to the duration of liability, the carrier liability is extended to the period where the cargo is in the carrier's care within the limits of the wharf or terminal at port of loading and discharge. There is coverage of importers and carriers may be made liable for loss due to
          <break page="6166" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

          Nautical fault—I will not go into that in any length—is another area that has been looked at. In the past it has been an escape route for many international shipowners or carriers. We have an arbitration situation now as well. There should be explicit provision for arbitration in the act. A reference to arbitration in Australia should not constitute an ouster of jurisdiction offending section 11 of the act.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In essence, it is a solution that has come about effectively by a good deal of negotiation and a great deal of compromise, I suppose, on the part of some people. On the other hand, the relevant groups, particularly the insurers and the lawyers in the industry, have come up with something that hopefully will promote people like my constituents who are looking to secure safe passage for their goods overseas and to have those goods delivered promptly, efficiently and in an undamaged condition and, if they are not, that they will be paid if the loss has come about as a result of what has occurred between when the goods were left on the wharf and when they arrived on the wharf for their point of destination.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In my submission, these measures are good and are the sorts of measures which will promote those seeking to export goods while, at the same time, providing a little more certainty and equity in an industry where there has been a good deal of uncertainty brought about by legal interpretation, prolonged litigation and frequently injustice at the end of the day where shippers of goods have sustained substantial loss as a result of negligence and/or other actions of the carrier. In all, I support the bill.

          The Hamburg Rules, as was mentioned earlier, shift the onus of liability from the cargo owner to the ship operator or owner. Australia's ability to utilise the benefits of the Hamburg Rules depends very much on what our major trading partners do in respect of the Hamburg Rules. We can go it alone. As the previous speaker, the member for Dickson, has said, it is mainly the landlocked countries that have embraced or ratified the rules of that convention, but our major trading partners have not. We can come back to that later on.

That is consistent with the existing liability that applies to domestic land transport, that is, road and rail. Such freight is normally covered by consignment notes. However, where a domestic leg is part of an international trade, then it would be covered by the provisions of this legislation.

It includes all people and organisations that are directly or indirectly involved in the movement of seaborne cargo and people. It is a voluntary association of people and organisations committed to growing Australia's maritime services. Movement of freight by sea generates greater expenditure and activity ashore than at sea. When one takes into account all the shore related professional services, such as ship design services and all the other matters in which employment and expenditure are incurred, the greater share of expenditure and activity is onshore. In other words, the blue water sector is the minor

          This bill, in covering liability for carriage of goods by sea, goes to the heart of Australia's maritime network. Australian marine insurers, who are world competitive in rates for iron ore to Japan, are locked out of that market by agreements between Japanese iron ore purchasers to insure only with Japanese insurance companies. These companies do not compete with each other and are not world competitive. Yet this government and the galahs in Japanese cages in this country mouth the platitudes about efficiency and competitiveness that emanate from those opposite and from Japanese steel mills.

We should be doing everything possible to create opportunities for Australia's marine insurers and maritime service providers.

That innocuous little clause, tucked away in the charter party—often unread—has served to protect the London legal profession from competition from maritime lawyers from the Antipodes. There was a time—not far distant—when London legal costs, expressed in £ sterling would simply have the £ sterling sign changed to $A when the service was provided by Australian lawyers, so great was the difference between the charge made by Australian lawyers and that made by London lawyers. So effectively £1 sterling equalled $A1 for the same service, if it was our service here.

           The London arbitration clause hindered the development of an Australian based arbitration forum and Australian lawyers with specialised local knowledge of the region. It has been a chicken and egg situation. Experience is essential, but there must be opportunity to gain that experience. This legislation will ensure that the barriers to gaining that experience are removed. There are qualified Australian maritime arbitrators available.

It is a murky world in which we delve when we turn to the maritime industry. But, at federal level, this government is pursuing a policy designed to wipe out the carriage of freight between Australian ports by Australian flag ships. As a preliminary, we are seeing an acceleration of the use of foreign flag ships between Australian ports in certain circumstances under single voyage permits.

            This action is aimed at taking the jobs of members of the Maritime Union of Australia, thus weakening the union and, the government hopes, crippling it. However, as I said last week in the AN debate, the single voyage permits they have aimed at the MUA are striking the rail industry in Australia. Let me quote some figures to support this. In 1995&amp;hyphen;96 foreign flagged ships operating under SVPs carried 3,236,701 tonnes of cargo between Australian ports. Included in those figures were 13,829 containers, 20&amp;hyphen;foot equivalent units, which were moved between Australian ports by foreign flagged ships under SVPs.

In the six months from 1 July 1996 to 31 December 1996, 3,715 TEUs, or 67,727 tonnes, were carried by foreign flagged ships between Sydney, Melbourne or Adelaide to or from Fremantle. In TEU terms, the first half of 1996&amp;hyphen;97 is equivalent to 69 per cent of all TEUs carried on those courses in 1995&amp;hyphen;96, and in tonnage terms it is 71 per cent.

            Turning to the state scene, most relevant to this legislation is the attempt by the Queensland state government to levy an 8&amp;half; per cent stamp duty on all marine insurance contracts on ships while in Queensland ports.

How are you going to segment out the bit that covers coming into territorial waters, into the port for 24 hours and out again and then levy 8 per cent on that share of the premium?

If the Queensland Office of State Revenue think that they will somehow be able to do what everybody else cannot, that they are the Dick Traceys and they will be able to track them down and get the money—good luck to them.

I would suggest that maybe the reason the shipping industry benefited from that cargo may have been because of the less than efficient operations of AN in recent years.

         The Carriage of Goods by Sea Amendment Bill gives effect in Australia to an international convention—the amended Hague Rules—relating to carrier liability for loss or damage to marine cargoes. The amending bill is supported by industry. It is supported by shippers, shipowners, the marine insurance sector and maritime law groups. The member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) has left the chamber, but I understand that he has a particular interest in that discipline. The member for Shortland alluded to some of the inequities that exist in the industry as far as arbitration is concerned.

          The amending bill also removes the Hamburg Rules trigger from the legislation. Only about one per cent of Australia's international trade is with parties to the Hamburg Rules convention.

          . . . the Government will not be moving to implement the Hamburg Rules until it is in the commercial interests of Australia to do so.

That gives credence to my comment that this government must continually maintain the flexibility to react to changes around the world with the countries we are dealing with. That is certainly going to be the case.

I am sure people will accept that this government has a very genuine attitude towards improving the movement of sea cargo in and out of Australia—as we have a view to reforming the entire transport sector in Australia for the betterment of the entire nation, not just for specific interests.

          —My contribution will be brief, but I am pleased to make a short contribution to this important debate. The Carriage of Goods by Sea Amendment Bill is, in some parts, fairly technical but, as has been shown, it is a non-controversial piece of legislation. Indeed, as the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) has said, we are not always at each other's throats in this chamber. There are many issues, far more than people outside realise, which go through this House with bipartisan agreement. The
          <break page="6173" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           opposition, as has been pointed out by the shadow minister, is supporting this legislation.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The Carriage of Goods by Sea Act gives effect in Australia to an international convention—that is, the amended Hague Rules—relating to liability or loss to marine cargo. It contains an automatic trigger which brings into force an alternative international regime, known as the Hamburg Rules, on 20 October 1997. From that point of view, there is a small degree of urgency. These rules were originally to take effect on 1 November 1994, but in October 1994, as the member for Lyne said, the parliament resolved to defer acceptance or repeal of the Hamburg Rules for a period of three years.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As has been pointed out by other speakers in this debate, the Hamburg Rules are typically favoured by cargo owners whereas the Hague Rules are preferred by operators. The principal difficulty, however, with the Hamburg Rules is that only 22 countries have implemented them and most of those countries are landlocked states in Central Africa. The rules are used by countries that amount to about one per cent of our international trade.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The purpose of this legislation is to implement a package of enhancements to Australia's maritime liability regime. This legislation deals with liability for loss or damage to sea cargo. Herein lies my interest in this legislation: liability for loss or damage to sea cargoes. Mr Deputy Speaker, you should ask yourself: what causes damage to cargo on the high seas? What gives rise, therefore, to liability? So often it is the condition of the vessel and the competence, or the lack of competence, of the crew. This is an issue that many of us on this side of the House, no-one more than the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), have been arguing for some time. In fact, we have been arguing it for many years.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It must follow that, if you have a badly maintained vessel and a poorly trained crew, the possibility of loss and damage must be considerably enhanced. As is well known, the world's fleet is ageing. Few are building new ships and so often people are not attracted to the sea. There is no disputing the fact that
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          shipping is a competitive business and that corners are being cut.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This has resulted in some very disturbing aspects in Australia. For example, the way some crews are treated has come to our attention. There is also the increasing occurrence of crews being of mixed races speaking many different languages. It often happens that you may have as a crew on a ship people of half a dozen different nationalities, all speaking different languages. This is, in effect, a way of controlling the crews, which has been shown in many cases recently.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Increasingly—and I have noticed this at Port Kembla—as my friends at the Mission to the Seaman also tell me—often when ships go there and pick up a crew there might be half a dozen different nationalities. Some of us suspect, indeed, some of us have evidence, that this is a method of controlling those crews.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         On this point, too, I cannot understand why this government is so keen to do away with cabotage and to open up our coastal routes to the rust buckets of the world. We are told so often that this will bring the cost of shipping down but, as far as I am concerned, that is a nonsense. It will not bring the cost of shipping down. When people say that bringing rust buckets crewed by people on starvation wages to take produce around the coastline will bring the cost of shipping down, they never say what the cost of the damage will be to the environment when something goes wrong. When we have the inevitable environmental disaster, someone is going to have to pay for it, and it will most likely be the Australian taxpayer. Therefore, instead of bringing the cost of shipping around the coastline down, this will actually increase it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the long term, it is better to have well&amp;hyphen;maintained vessels crewed by well&amp;hyphen;trained seafarers. If people want to cut costs—and I know there is an argument about smaller crews; I have seen ships in Denmark where they say they are going to have only five crew and things like that—it seems to me that, when ships are carrying expensive cargo, it is much better to have a smaller, but much better trained, crew. Therefore, if you have a large crew, and even if you are only paying
         <break page="6174" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          them starvation wages, costs mount up. But, if you have a small, very highly trained crew, a competent crew, I am sure that that is what will bring the costs down.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I might also indicate my total opposition to the suggestion of opening a second registry in Australia. I have never seen the benefit of this. It is more than a cost&amp;hyphen;cutting measure; it is a tax avoidance measure. I think it was the honourable member for Shortland who touched on the possibility of increasing the number of Australian flagships. That is something that I have always supported and will continue to support.

It is important to very briefly take up the comments of the member for Throsby. It is a continuing theme: trying to link the winding back of cabotage to the introduction to our coastal trade of unseaworthy, rust bucket ships. He should be acutely aware of the fact that cabotage is a form of economic regulation and it is totally unrelated to the continuation of Australia's ship safety regime, which is administered by AMSA, the federal agency responsible for monitoring ship safety in Australian waters.

The first removes the provisions which would allow the determining officer to impose a fine on medical practitioners found to have engaged in overservicing. That is to clarify any concern regarding inappropriate use of judicial power. The only financial penalties are those relating to the repayment of medical benefits. The second element allows for an increase in the maximum periods of disqualification to three years full or partial exclusion from access to medical benefits. The third element allows committees to have access to documents subject to appropriate privacy provisions prior to the hearing. The fourth element clarifies possible confusion that the committee may use sampling techniques in assessing a practitioner's conduct, but may not choose to use such a technique. There has been some concern that in some way the committee is obliged to use those sampling

         We all know that Medicare is an extremely popular form of universal health insurance for Australians. In my electorate, between 1 July 1995 and 1 May 1996, almost 1.4 million Medicare services were provided. The vast majority of these claims are genuine and they represent a very significant reliance by Wills constituents on the Medicare system. It is worth noting that, of these claims, 80 per cent—or more than 1.1 million—were direct billed. It would be useful to obtain more information on Medicare claims for the sake of comparison, but the minister for health has proved himself very stubborn in this regard.

         Following lengthy negotiations with the government of the day, the Health Insurance Commission and professional groups, the professional services review legislation was born, based on the premise that a doctor should not be engaged in `inappropriate medical practice' defined in the Health Insurance Act 1973 as `conduct that is unacceptable to the general body of members of the profession or specialty in which the practitioner was practising when he or she rendered or initiated the services in question.'

         The HIC's responsibility under the scheme is to identify practitioners whose conduct causes concern. If there is no significant change in the practitioner's conduct after counselling by an HIC medical adviser, the doctor is referred to the director of the professional services review scheme. The director is a statutory officer, independent of the Health Insurance Commission. The director then considers the material provided by the HIC and may dismiss the case or, alternatively, empanel a committee to review and consider the behaviour of the doctor.

         A PSR committee consists of three members, doctors who are peers of the clinician who is under investigation. This is carried out in confidence and may involve access to patient records held by the doctor in question. If a finding of inappropriate medical practice is made, it is forwarded to a determining officer to fix a penalty. One of the criticisms that came, particularly from consumer organisations, against which the then minister, Graham Richardson, admirably held out, was that they felt it was inappropriate for doctors to be considering the behaviour of a doctor who had come to the attention of the Health Insurance Commission. I can only say that the only people who can really judge whether a professional person, in this case a doctor, has or has not done the right thing is a group of his or her own peers.

         The other thing that we would come up against was that doctors would turn up to medical committees into overservicing, as they existed before that, with a team of lawyers—the best lawyers that money could buy. It was very difficult to get to the bottom of the problem. Some practitioners would engage quite skilful and expensive lawyers and frustrate the entire process—effectively, a process which had been underfunded and which had been manned by well&amp;hyphen;meaning, but basically part-time, individuals.

         In summary, what happens is that a statistical aberration of a medical practitioner's claims is detected by the Health Insurance Commission. It might be a practitioner who has a very large number of claims or, in some cases, it is a practitioner who has a very low number of claims. There is a popular view in the community that doctors who provide a lot of services are the ones who may not be doing the right thing. A proportion of them are not but we find—and I have found this over the years—there is as much inappropriate behaviour, if not impropriety, at the other end of the spectrum, where doctors are providing very few services.

         The commission looks at the statistical profile of the doctor and then brings that doctor to the attention of the medical advisers. The advisers then visit that doctor after having written to him or her.

         In the end, if that doctor comes into the professional review services program, his or her behaviour is judged on a clinical basis.

         A number of issues have been raised in relation to the legislation since it took effect—firstly, the definition of `peers'. Doctors who are vocationally registered general practitioners, for example, who have agreed formally to continuing medical education and quality assurance programs have been sitting in on judgments of GPs who are not vocationally registered. These amendments seek to formalise the categories of medical practitioners so that doctors feel in a real sense they are being judged by their own peers.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There have also been concerns about procedural fairness, including a concern regarding the ability of doctors acting as peers

          complying with the expected administrative law principles. The Attorney-General's Department will be providing committee members with advice and training—and that makes good sense.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There have also been issues of cultural sensitivities. Some doctors from a certain cultural background other than, if you like, the dominant Anglo&amp;hyphen;Celtic one felt that they should be judged by only doctors from their own cultural background. I have spoken to the professional services review director, who said that, following consultations with large groups of ethnic doctors in Australia, they are of the view, as I am, that in Australia we ought to practise medicine under one set of values and one set of standards and principles. Whether a person may be practising inappropriately is irrelevant to the cultural background of that doctor or indeed the cultural background of the patients which he or she is treating.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Nonetheless, to deal with that a number of doctors from a range of cultural backgrounds are being added to the list of doctors from which panels may be put together. If, for example, a Vietnamese, an Egyptian or an Indian doctor is under inquiry, if it is possible and practicable a doctor from that cultural background would be added to the committee.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another criticism is that so far only GPs have been the subject of inquiry. Considering the number of panels that have been formed and the number of general practitioner services provided in Australia, that is probably not too surprising.

          The professional services review, as I have said, is an improvement on the earlier system of having a medical services committee of inquiry, which relied on only a statistical sampling. It was necessary to look at only individual services provided to individual patients. So what happened was that we had people coming up before MSCIs who might have been accused by the commission of providing inappropriate services in 200 or more cases. The committees had to work through every single patient service that had been provided and quite high&amp;hyphen;priced lawyers would sit on the other side of the table arguing the detail of every single case. So an important part of this legislation has been the capacity to use at least some degree of statistical sampling and, from that, try to make some judgments about the extent of inappropriate servicing and the recovery of Medicare benefits. A penalty could be applied in relation to only those services actually determined to be excessive.

          This system enables the medical profession and the Health Insurance Commission to take into account the entire pattern of practice of the doctor in question. For example, if a consultant psychiatrist were seeing 50 patients a day, that would raise some question about the quality of the service and indeed the detail that was being provided. The legislation has given the reviewers the capacity to take that into account as well as look at individual cases.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          A further significant aspect of this legislation, as I say, has been that a decision may be made on the basis of a statistically valid sample of services provided. But it has been infrequently used and in some cases it has been unworkable. In future the test will be for committees to reach an opinion regarding the practitioner's conduct in all cases rather than considering the appropriateness of individual services in some cases. The committee will report, setting out its findings on whether, in its opinion, the person under review engaged in inappropriate practice in connection with the referred services.

          The other interesting piece of research I did was to discover what proportion of services being referred to the professional services review was directly billed or bulkbilled.

I ask all members of the House, whether it be on my side or indeed on the other, to remember that, whilst we need to enthusiastically go after those who are providing inappropriate services, and certainly those providing them fraudulently, there are some values in this country that are worth upholding.

If we try to tear apart some of the values which actually got us to where we are in this country today, I think our ignorance of the consequences of that will be rather significant. There are few things that Australians can believe in today; but let us hope that confidence in professional people and perhaps the processes that support them, like this legislation, will remain one of them.

The opposition supports the government's measures, which are essentially tidying up and strengthening enforcement and review procedures.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I understand that the ANAO found that somewhere between 1.3 per cent and 2.3 per cent of medical and pharmaceutical benefits payments are inappropriate payments, but that includes, as I understand it, payments made with respect to someone, for instance, who wins a workers compensation case and subsequently pays back the Health Insurance Commission. But even that 1.3 per cent to 2.3 per cent of inappropriate claims, given the massive amount of money that is provided to Australians for medical services, constitutes a significant sum of money. It is somewhere between $110 million and $190 million a year of inappropriate payments.

         We in the opposition strongly support any measures that are required, even if they are stricter measures, that give viability and efficacy to a system which we say is vital to the health of Australians. As the member for Bradfield indicated, there has been some success in stemming the extent of fraud and excessive servicing. The action has become increasingly sophisticated since the ANAO report No. 17 on medifraud and excessive

But the ANAO, when they analysed those enforcement procedures more recently in their 1996-97 report No. 31, said:

         I note the member for Bradfield graciously gave credit to the role of former Senator Graham Richardson in terms of the origins of the enforcement and review system. Indeed, I understand that in 1995-96 over $1 million was recovered from inappropriate services and, in 1994-95, just under $1 million of inappropriate Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits payments was recovered on behalf of the Australian taxpayers.

         A more recent and perhaps dramatic example is a situation involving Dr James Tankey. The Professional Services Review Tribunal directed the repayment of in excess of $580,000 from the one practitioner. I will not comment on the merits of that case because I understand that Dr Tankey is following his appeal rights, and it is inappropriate that the merits of the case be further discussed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The point that I am making is that the procedure does have some teeth in it in terms of the global sum that can be recovered, and indeed the sum that can be recovered from individual practitioners is significant indeed.

        <para first-indent="16">
         As I say, the opposition supports the bill because, in its implementation, some difficulties have been revealed. Firstly, the bill removes the power of the determining officer to impose a fine, thus ensuring, as the member for Bradfield indicated, that there isn't that blurring of the administrative and judicial functions which our constitution requires to be kept separate to protect the civil rights of
         <break page="6183" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          any individual who may face arbitrary or capricious administrative action. They should have their separate rights of appeal through the legal processes, and that is an appropriate distinction to restore.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Partly in order to offset the inability to impose a fine, the bill, the opposition agrees, appropriately imposes a longer period of disqualification—or at least the power to give a longer period of disqualification—for up to three years full or partial exclusion from access to Medicare benefits. Again, that is in contrast to the initial position taken by doctors in the period of the Whitlam government and in the early days of the Hawke government when they vigorously opposed the Medicare procedure. It is interesting to note that one of the penalties imposed now by their peers is a preclusion from access to that very system that so many of them opposed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Be that as it may, the bill appropriately addresses, as I have emphasised, compliance measures. The bill imposes greater penalties for failure to produce documentation as, one would appreciate, the assessment of these doctors' conduct and their methodology of practice necessarily depends upon documentary evidence. If they were able to prevent access to that documentation, obviously it would make the task of considering their practice extremely difficult.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But at the same time, the bill appropriately recognises that a medical practitioner has the ability to claim the privilege against self-incrimination in circumstances where that medical practitioner was going to face criminal charges. As I understand it, no such criminal charges have resulted from these procedures, although obviously there are significant civil penalties that can occur.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill also clarifies, as the member for Bradfield indicated, the ability of the professional review committee to use sampling techniques rather than being required to analyse every piece of paper relating to the service provided by the medical practitioner.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I understand that some doctors under investigation have argued that, because the scheme provided for sampling, sampling was mandatory, requiring the review procedure to literally analyse every piece of paper. The
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          member for Bradfield, in his experience, was able to recount the situation where lawyers would, in effect, run interference on the review procedure by scrutinising and disputing the review of each and every service. The bill appropriately enables the committee to use sampling techniques but it is in a discretionary sense; it is not mandatory.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I must agree with the comments of the member for Bradfield that, while the system requires constant vigilance because the very small minority of practitioners who will abuse the system will always attempt to push out the boundaries, just as happens in the case of tax law, it casts a corresponding obligation on the government of the day and the public servants charged with the administration of the system to look at what is going on and modify, refine and strengthen, if need be, to ensure that our extremely valued Medicare system continues. Indeed, fortunately, the Medicare system appears to be becoming one of the Holy Grail items in Australian politics. Even the conservative government before the last election had as their policy the retention of the Medicare system. We on this side of the House hope that it is not watered down in terms of any supplementary payments that are imposed as a result of government policy.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill itself indicates the very significant role of the Health Insurance Commission in administering the system. Indeed, it is a very essential role in the counselling procedures. It is a pivotal role. In that context I can understand an answer to a question on notice which I received from the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) earlier in the year. I asked the minister whether he would consider opening a Medicare office in Kogarah in my electorate of Barton, there already being one in Rockdale. The minister advised me that there were some 200 doctors who had their principle place of practice in the Kogarah post code, which was the eighth largest district in metropolitan Sydney and, I gather, one of the largest in Australia. Of course, in my electorate, very close to my electorate office, are both the St George Public Hospital and the St George Private Hospital, which opened in November 1995. So in summary, it is a very significant area
         <break page="6184" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          for the provision of medical services. Given that, I asked the minister whether he would open a Medicare office and the minister replied to me:

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">

        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         On receiving the answer to that question, I let the issue lie, it being indicated to me that the Health Insurance Commission was autonomous on these matters, that is, the location of their Medicare offices, and given, as this bill indicates, their central and pivotal role in the overall enforcement of the Medicare system, one might consider that that autonomy was not inappropriate. Given the minister's answer to me, however, and his specific statement in the answer, and indeed on the record of the House, that decisions regarding the location of Medicare offices are made independently of government but rather determined by the Health Insurance Commission, I was perhaps more astounded than any member of this House when I received notification that some 17 Medicare offices, including the Medicare office in my electorate of Barton, were to be closed.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I recall the minister, in an answer to a question without notice from one of the coalition members, openly stating the policy of the government regarding the closure of Medicare offices had been motivated by a government policy decision to provide Medicare offices in regional Australia. One might say that regional Australia has a predominance of conservative party electorates, but I was so astounded because it was entirely inconsistent with the advice I had received from the minister that the location of Medicare offices was a matter within the autonomy of the Health Insurance Commission with decisions to be made independently of government.

         Especially in the age of computers, when all records are documented, Medicare charges are easily accessed and anomalies in any statistics are easily brought to light. I think it serves as a good warning for people who think that they can rort the system to know that they cannot, because people are watching and it gets easier day by day to find anomalies. That is what this bill does. If a statistical anomaly pops up that says, `That is outside the normal range for a doctor,' then it should be investigated.

         An average GP will see 120 patients a week. In fact, the Health Insurance Commission in 1994 paid one doctor for seeing 600 patients a week. In some instances, the HIC has alleged inappropriate billing only when a doctor has claimed to work more than 24

         On the other end of the scale, a number of complaints have been brought to my attention recently about one doctor in my electorate who will be seeing between 50 per cent to 55 per cent of patients within the next seven days. That is a practice that doctors can be counselled against, so they send someone on their way and say, `Come back and see me if you don't feel well,' compared to making an appointment for them and saying, `You will come back and see me next week.' People rely on their doctors. If a doctor says that they need to see you again, by and large most people will come back and see them. As the member for Bradfield has put forward, it is very important that this does not lead into a doctor bashing episode. It certainly is not designed as such.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is only by the majority of doctors falling within the large section of the bell curve that we are able to identify the anomalies. With the new procedure of counselling coming in, a doctor's practice can be examined. Quite frequently, where people have been put through a sausage factory type clinical examination and have an ailment that is difficult to diagnose, they will see several doctors and be unhappy with the diagnosis. They finally will be referred to someone who has a reputation for being able to diagnose. Obviously the diagnostics of that doctor will be above the norm. That is to be expected and will be catered for in this legislation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It costs in the region of $120,000 just to keep your practice open. So a tremendous incentive is there for a doctor who is not paying practice costs to throughput patients. That is to be discouraged. Certainly, if you are doing genuine clinical diagnostics work on very difficult patients, that will come out in any subsequent interviews with the counsellors.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other thing I would like to emphasise is that a number of people in my electorate have complained to me that it is very difficult to get home visits today. In my region, public
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          transport is not always that good. Not everyone has access to cars, especially for spouses where one takes a car to work. A significant proportion of doctors record no home visits. That is a statistic which is clearly available through the Medicare billing system and can be brought to light.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So there are a number of things that we can now monitor with computers through the billing system that is in place in Australia, and I think it is very important that we do that. While the Medicare levy is 1.5 per cent of taxable income, it accounts for only eight per cent of the cost of medical services. Those medical services will only get more and more expensive as things like MRI become more commonplace than, say, X-rays and we move up to the Rolls Royce of medical technology from systems that we have been using for a while.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Diagnostic techniques and treatments are getting more expensive and more technologically advanced, and that costs money. So I do not see that in the future our health bills necessarily will come down. We certainly have to work at getting the best use for money that we possibly can. That includes closing down any avenues for people to rort the system.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill goes some way to doing that. No doubt in future, as further rorts appear, we will have to make a further effort. There is always that very small minority who bring any profession into disrepute. It is most unfair to label all doctors with the same tar brush when examining this bill. It is a small part of the move by our Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) towards a better health system which will function for Australians in my electorate and will serve us well through to the next century. The minister is to be commended on his efforts, and I commend the bill to the House.

         The most common form of inappropriate practice in Australia is overservicing. It is indefensible. The characteristics of overservicing, which include inadequate consultation time, incomplete examination of the patient and the lack of definitive diagnosis, increase the margin for error in the care of the patient. At first blush, that might be thought to be underservicing, but it leads to more consultations than if adequate time was spent in the first instance.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is widely accepted by the bulk of medical practitioners that adequate time needs to be spent with a patient to ensure that a high level of care is administered. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners noted in a 1996 publication that, while individual consultation times vary according to clinical need, the average consultation time should be no less than 10 minutes. This minimum standard has been ignored by every one of those general practitioners who have in the past been deemed to overservice patients by the PSRS. As the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) rightly observed in his second reading speech, `a high throughput of patients is also detrimental to the financial state of our ailing health system.' This was borne out by the 1995&amp;hyphen;96 annual report produced by the director of the professional services review scheme. Detailed case studies of those who had come under review for `inappropriate practice' in that year were presented in the report, as is the legal requirement.

         Case A provided information on one practitioner who had performed in excess of 19,500 services in the referral year, attracting a total Medicare payment of approximately $425,000.

The same practitioner had also claimed for in excess of 140 services per day on 26 occasions. One especially busy day saw this individual claim for 181 services. A third example cited in the report provided information about a GP who had claimed $396,000 in Medicare benefits for more than 18,600 services performed on only 3,661 patients. The same doctor had claimed for approximately 500 home consultations over the course of that year.

         Invariably, general practitioners who have been investigated by the PSRS have argued that long working hours and efficient work habits explain their high throughput of patients. This justification has not yet been accepted by any review committee. Overservicing should not be and is not being tolerated, either within the medical fraternity or by the general community. The establishment of the PSRS, which became operational on 1 July, 1994, sent an unequivocal message to the Australian medical profession that overservicing was not acceptable. The purpose of the review scheme is to:

         It is based on a peer review process, which is vital to ensure impartiality and differentiate between the separation of judicial and executive powers.

         The minister, in his second reading speech, implied that overservicing in Australia is the product of an increase in doctor numbers. He said that inappropriate medical practice has:

         His position was reinforced by the director of the professional services review scheme—who, incidentally, is a ministerial appoint
         <break page="6187" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
          ment—in his 1995&amp;hyphen;96 annual report. The director wrote:

        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         I would like to make two points about that. The first is about the number of medical professionals involved in overservicing. If, as the minister would have us believe, an oversupply of doctors is the reason for this practice, one might expect to see a large number of medical practitioners come under the scrutiny of the PSRS for overservicing. That is simply not the case.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As at March, 1997, a total of only 35 cases had come under investigation. In the year 1995&amp;hyphen;96, the director of PSRS received 16 referrals of suspected inappropriate practice. All of these involved medical practitioners in general medical practice. In that same year Health Insurance Commission figures show that a total of 19,652 general practitioners made claims on the HIC. Put another way, less than 0.1 per cent of doctors in general practice came under scrutiny by the PSRS because of overservicing in 1995&amp;hyphen;96. This data simply does not support the minister's assertion.

         That brings me to my second point. The 1997 report into private health insurance by the Productivity Commission made it clear that the demand side of the equation also requires recalibration. The report noted:

        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para font-size="-=2">

          Restricting service provider numbers will not introduce a greater cost consciousness into the system, and that is what is desperately required. The government must instead implement policies which encourage immediate and ongoing participation in private health care funds. The Productivity Commission found that households in the wealthiest and poorest income brackets suffered from the lowest drop in private health insurance membership since 1983. It is middle income Australia that needs to be wooed away from its dependence on publicly funded health care.

          The government's decision to penalise medical professionals who participate in overservicing is supportable.

This is an entirely different matter that needs to be dealt with immediately and more thoroughly.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The government has suggested that this legislation will tighten up certain procedural aspects of the PSRS. That is good policy. However, I am concerned by the subjective terminology that plagues both the explanatory memorandum and the bill itself. Subdivision B remakes certain paragraphs of the principal legislation to allow the PSRS to access documents before a hearing into inappropriate practice commences. Permitting advance access to records that may substantiate overservicing is also supportable. However, new subsection 105A(4) allows for documents
          <break page="6188" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           to be inspected and retained by the PSRS `for a reasonable period'. What exactly does this mean?

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Similarly subjective language is used in the explanatory memorandum to define the additional powers being bestowed on the determining officer under this legislation. It is proper that anyone in the medical profession who is found guilty of inappropriate practice should be required to pay the Commonwealth an amount equivalent to the whole, or at least part, of the Medicare benefit paid to them. But this bill means to give the determining officer—who, like the director, is appointed by the minister—the `discretion' to deal with `degrees of culpability' in this instance. The determining officer will decide whether a `substantial proportion' of the money claimed will have to be repaid.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I maintain that it is appropriate that anyone found to have been involved in inappropriate practice be compelled to repay the money to the Commonwealth. However, I fail to see how providing the determining officer with the power to determine `substantial proportions' in any way `provides a clearer approach to calculating the amounts of Medicare benefits to be repaid', as the minister claimed will be the case. This change is supportable, but it is not likely, using again the minister's words, to `improve the administration of the process of reviewing a practitioner's conduct', as the minister would like to suggest.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Further, the determining officer will have the discretion to decide if the practitioner is disqualified, for Medicare purposes, for `a long period'. Subsection 106U(3) of the bill will extend the maximum period of partial disqualification from Medicare to three years. Full disqualification is also being extended, under subsection 106U(4), from the current limit of six months to a new maximum of three years. Only those medical professionals abusing the medicare system will have cause to argue against the more severe penalties, of course. What I find objectionable is the fact that the determining officer will have the authority to interpret the meaning of disqualification for a `long time'.

          <para first-indent="16">
           The explanatory memorandum states that overservicing should not be condoned and that the practice warrants `strong action' at the `top end' of the measures provided. I do not sanction overservicing—and that is apparent from what I have already said—but it is not satisfactory that such loosely defined terms as `strong action' and `top end' frequent this legislation. These phrases should be reviewed and replaced with very specific alternatives.

           It is strange that the government has seen fit to introduce amendments that, on the one hand, consolidate the separation of the judicial and executive power, but will simultaneously provide the determining officer with greater discretionary power.

          —I thank the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) for his courtesy. The professional services review scheme was introduced in 1994. It was designed to combat overservicing in the Medicare program, including in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. It is necessary to finetune the legisla

         There are three types of amendments in this bill. The first is the major motivation for the amendments to the legislation—that is, to clarify that the judicial power is not being exercised by the executive under this scheme by removing the ability to recover an amount in addition to any Medicare benefits paid.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Other major amendments are designed to define the classes of practitioners so they are consistent with the Health Insurance Act 1973, enabling a better test to be applied in terms of a practitioner's conduct and, as a consequence, to clarify the test under which a committee reports on the conduct of a practitioner, to remove the statistical sampling provisions which have proved to be unworkable in practice and to increase the partial and full disqualification periods from access to Medicare up to a maximum of three years in both cases. The third type of amendment makes minor changes to improve the administration of the scheme.

         This scheme is the government's primary means of investigating allegations of inappropriate practice and taking action where those allegations are proven through the administrative review process. General practitioners accounted for $3.4 billion of the $6 billion of government expenditure for Medicare in 1995-96. To put that in some context, we spend about the same amount on Medicare benefits as the budget of the state of Western Australia, and GP expenditure is over half of that.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In any scheme of this sort, it is necessary to strive to develop a review process which is both fair and equitable to individual practitioners and the community as a whole. It is important to ensure that Australian taxpayers receive value for their Medicare dollar while at the same time ensure that practitioners obtain procedural fairness.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It is my view that the overwhelming majority of medical practitioners are absolutely honest. The number of practitioners who will appear before this tribunal is very small, but there has to be the capacity to deal with those practitioners who are operating in a way that is unacceptable to the vast majority of the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          medical profession. That is what this scheme is about.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is not a scheme that is run by government. It is a scheme where a medical practitioner is judged by his or her peers as to what practice is appropriate. That is not a decision government should make, but maybe a practitioner's peers do have the right to say that a person practising three&amp;hyphen; to four&amp;hyphen;minute medicine, a person who does not keep notes, a person who may not appropriately treat their patients, a person who may not practise preventative medicine, may not be an appropriate person to be earning $400,000 to $500,000 a year. I think that is eminently reasonable.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To ensure practitioners obtain fairness in the scheme, the review process has a practitioner counselled more than once by medical advisers in the Health Insurance Commission and given a chance to change the way they practice. They are given every opportunity to call their own witnesses and to make submissions before a committee of peers, including having a solicitor present at the review to provide advice. They are able to make submissions on a draft determination before the determining officer has made a final determination. They are able to appeal to the Professional Services Review Tribunal the determining officer's decision, be legally represented at the tribunal and be able to appeal to the Federal Court on any errors of law considered to have been made at any of these stages. I would think most people would think this to be very fair and reasonable. The scheme in the end aims to achieve a proper balance between the rights of the individual practitioner and the community's needs as a whole to ensure that Medicare dollars are wisely spent.

         I thank honourable members for their contributions and for the overall support of the House for this piece of legislation. I will just comment briefly on a number of areas that were raised. The first is that a number of honourable members raised a specific practitioner who has been before this process. It would be improper for me, as health minister, to comment on a specific case, except to say that, in this case, the practitioner has been judged by his peers, not by the government.
         <break page="6192" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         The second comment that I would like to make is to reply to the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) who, in his contribution, talked very much about the demand side of medicine and then finished by saying that there was a tenuous link between medical costs and supply. I understand the member for Curtin's comments. Many economists feel this way. Demand is a fashionable thing to talk about in economics today; supply is not. Of course, if we were talking 20 years ago, it would have been the reverse. It would have been very fashionable to talk about supply and not talk about demand.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The simple fact is that if you believe the OECD—and I do—70 per cent of the increase in health costs between 1961 and 1997 were generated on the supply side. This is not surprising. There are two factors that operate in health that are different from hiring a taxi or buying a hot dog on a beach—both of which are examples that respected economists use, but seem not to be able to extend to health. The first is that there is a great degree of emotion involved in health and, in economic terms, that means there is demand inelasticity. People demand more of the product regardless of the price. So normal demand signals do not have as big an impact here as they might have if we were merely buying hot dogs on a beach or catching a taxi.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second aspect about health economics is that there is a big mismatch between the information providers have and the information consumers have. Normal markets, as we understand them today, rely on information balance between those purchasing and those providing. That is clearly not the case in health. In health, a pensioner is not going to see a doctor, walk out with a prescription and then, having looked at it—they will be lucky to be able to read the handwriting—say, `Well, I'm not really $3.20 sick. Scripts have gone up 50c; I'll stick it in the bin.' Consumers do not have information, so most of the costs in health are driven on the supply side. I could not pretend that demand does not have any effect but, in the end, if you do not

         I had dinner a couple of weeks ago with the South African health minister, Dr Zuma. We were talking about new technology. She was telling me that Johannesburg has about the same number of MRI scanners as Australia. She was lamenting the fact that her 14&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old daughter had gone to school and, during the day, developed a headache. Had that happened in Australia, her daughter would have gone to the sick bay, been given two aspirins and sent home. Dr Zuma's daughter went to the sick bay and was then sent to the public hospital for an MRI scan. By the time she got home at 4 o'clock, she had had the scan—which, of course, was absolutely normal. Dr Zuma is wondering why she has a problem with costs in the South African health system! I think I was able to tell her why.

         Finally, I was not here for the comments of the honourable member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) but it is hard to see how they fit within the scope of this bill. Obviously, the Deputy Speaker at the time allowed a wide ranging debate. He used the privilege of this House to cast aspersions on me because of a donation made to the Liberal Party. I will leave it up to him and his constituents to make the decision as to whether it is appropriate for him to have his staff members using the resources of the Parliamentary Library to trawl through donors to the Liberal Party, and whether they think it is appropriate to use this forum to make an attack on a person's character. All I will say is that I would suggest to the honourable member for Wills and his staff that they be very confident of their own behaviour before they decide to do that, because two people can play that game.

         I would further say, for the record, that there was an instance where the federal Liberal Party sent a return into the Electoral Commission of donors to the party. One of them did include my post office box; that was news to me. I checked with the Liberal Party. It was an oversight and a mistake on their part, and I understand that it has been corrected. The member for Wills may seek to take short&amp;hyphen;term advantage on this, but I think

         I use that quote for a very specific purpose.

         Those who have maintained employment do it at a cost. The cost is the family, the demeanour of the family, the life of the family and the health of the family. A woman walked into my office two weeks ago. She was at the end of her tether. Her husband is lucky. He has maintained a position in the public sector in Canberra, but he is doing the work previously done by five people. We could laugh, scoff and say, `There must have been four not needed' but I think that is a bit of a cop&amp;hyphen;out.

         There is another example. A personal friend of mine had been working in the computer area of a public sector department for some time.

He is a family man with two children, a 10&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old and an eight&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old, and a wife. Since that happened, he has been fortunate. The company that took over the computing services for the department employed him, but he is now working 12 to 14 hours a day, five days a week, plus at least one compulsory full day every weekend, with no additional compensation.

         On the evening of 6 October last year, while walking home along a main road in Cairns, 19&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old Cleis Norbury was brutally bashed and left to die, lying in a pool of blood. She spent the next few weeks in a coma in Townsville Hospital's head injury unit, with her mother, Rhonda, always by her side, hoping, praying and wondering if—against all odds—she would ever recover. Doctors believed that she would not.

He lobbied both large and small Cairns businesses to pledge their support.

         Gerry Fitzgerald, the Vice-President of the local St Vincent de Paul Society, is convinced that this is becoming a regular habit for many because of the lack of emergency accommodation for young people in Cranbourne. Mr Fitzgerald said that he had contacted some six housing workers. One said that she had six youths in recently, yet could not find a bed. Another with an emergency client was told that the nearest available bed was at Brunswick in downtown Melbourne, more than an hour away, and the agency preferred not to place a Cranbourne youth as far away as that. `It's shocking', said Mr Fitzgerald. He said that there should be eight to 10 emergency beds available in every town the size of Cranbourne and, in fact, there are none.

         In investigating this matter further, the following statistics were provided to me by Hanover in Dandenong, which provides emergency and crisis accommodation and advice to people in our burgeoning and growing south-east corridor of Melbourne, including Cranbourne.

         Hanover Dandenong has around 50 new clients seeking their services each week.

          are paying more than half their limited income on rent. More than one-third are homeless because of a family or  relationship breakdown or some form of violence occurring in the home. One-third are living in the precarious situation of doubling up, staying with parents or friends on a couch, floor or perhaps a spare bed. They have the added concern of no secure home and no security of tenure. Daily they see clients needing emergency accommodation. Because of the obvious stresses that go with this type of arrangement, this leads to inevitable breakdown. Most of these clients who are doubling up—their numbers are increasing significantly—are doing so because they are unable to locate any affordable or vacant property to rent, a consequence of the record low vacancy rate at the moment.

The two groups remaining in the competition are a consortium led by Australian Defence Industries Ltd, offering the Bushmaster vehicle earlier bid by Perry Engineering South Australia, and a team called Australian Specialised Vehicles Systems, located in Brisbane, bidding the Taipan, which derives from the proven Mamba series of mine-proof vehicles developed in South Africa.

          —Yesterday I explained to the House the means by which this government has put on the fix to site Sydney's second international airport at Holsworthy. Of the two sites notionally under consideration, Holsworthy and Badgerys Creek, only Holsworthy can accommodate the larger 360,000&amp;hyphen;movement airport being pursued by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp). He has distorted the EIS process so that the site acquired at Badgerys Creek prior to 1996 is effectively one-third too small for the type of airport specified in the EIS guidelines. Further land acquisition, bound by the provisions of the Australian constitution, may take another seven years, providing Mr Sharp with the alibi he has been seeking to secure his preferred site at Holsworthy. How else could a government which said nothing about Holsworthy prior to the last election reveal such a radical and dangerous plan for the second airport within weeks of the election result? The fix is on, pure and simple.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Against this background it is difficult to understand the obsession of some with Badgerys Creek. I have consistently maintained that the interests of south-west Sydney are best served by fighting Holsworthy first and foremost. Unlike Badgerys Creek, this site is without a substantial buffer from large residential areas. The Howard government was
         <break page="6197" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          elected on a mandate for building Badgerys Creek, not Holsworthy. Perhaps it was yet another non-core promise.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Not content with deceiving the people of Sydney's west and south-west on this issue, the Liberal Party has organised a low&amp;hyphen;level campaign against Badgerys Creek by a number of community organisations. This campaign has been led by Ms Kay Vella, a resident of 2 Gordon Place, Windsor Downs. Why else would someone living 30 kilometres from Badgerys Creek, the same distance as Seven Hills or Liverpool from Mascot, so obsessively campaign against a proposal which clearly will have no impact on her or her nob hill neighbours?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Why else would Ms Vella have stood as a candidate at the Lindsay by-election last year and funnelled preferences to the Liberal Party even though the Howard government is committed to increasing the size of the second airport by one-third and possibly turning it into Sydney's main airport? I warn residents in Sydney's west and south-west against Ms Vella's campaign. She clearly represents a front group for the Liberal Party with an agenda shared by the transport minister; that is, to site the airport at Holsworthy.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Ms Vella is being assisted in her campaign by Mr Greg Frawley, a resident in the seat of Macarthur. Mr Frawley has organised an absurd campaign describing Holsworthy as a distraction—something the government has raised to make Badgerys Creek look better. Some distraction when it directly and dangerously threatens the lifestyle of 500,000 residents in the south-western suburbs of Sydney! By undermining the campaign against Holsworthy, Ms Vella and Mr Frawley are effectively acting hand in glove with Mr Sharp. Their agenda is the same as his; their actions are adding to the alibi the Howard government is seeking to select Holsworthy as the second airport site.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government's intentions are clear: to say at the end of the EIS process that the Badgerys Creek site is too small for the large airport it wants for Sydney's west and that the public opposition from the likes of Kay Vella and Greg Frawley has divided opinion on the second airport in Sydney's greater west. I fear
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          the government will use the campaign of these individuals and the groups they purportedly represent against Badgerys Creek as a public justification for the site selection of Holsworthy.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The fix is on: shabby business deals prior to the last election about Holsworthy; rigged EIS guidelines prepared last year, with not a word said about the proposition prior to the March 1996 election; and now front groups undermining the campaign to fight Holsworthy first and foremost. Clearly, it will take the election of a Beazley Labor government to stop the Holsworthy plans from proceeding any further.

          —In rising to say a few words this evening, I wish to pay tribute to the Christian Brothers of Australia. We desperately hope they will not leave Charters Towers and they will play the same role they have played for so many years previously at Mount Carmel College, the Christian Brothers school in Charters Towers.
         </para>

        <para first-indent="16">
         The Christian Brothers were asked to come to Charters Towers nearly a hundred years ago when Charters Towers was the biggest city in Queensland. By their going there—my great&amp;hyphen;grandfather played some small role in getting them to go there—they played a very central role in shaping the thoughts, aspirations and identity of a young, new country. The pupils were Catholic, and this started them in life with a handicap; but never in all of my family's time going through that particular school was any of them told that they were starting life with a handicap. They were taught not to question the system, but to compete within it. If their students started with a slight handicap, this meant simply that they had to try harder, and they were expected to try harder.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In all of my years, my father's years before me and my great&amp;hyphen;uncles' years before him at the Christian Brothers college, we never heard the slightest hint of criticism of any other Christian faith or any other faith whatsoever. The anti-English attitudes which were present so much in the Australians of Irish descent were never present in the teachings of the
         <break page="6198" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Christian Brothers in Australia. They are an order that are very Australian. Whilst many public schools have traditionally revelled in asserting their Englishness, the Christian Brothers schools were unashamedly and aggressively Australian.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In an age of trendyism and political correctness, their simple teachings of traditional Christian values provided a rock upon which students in the tempestuous seas of youth have found some small degree of security. It seems to me more than passing strange that I cannot think of a single student of the Christian Brothers schools, of which I am very familiar in North Queensland, that has been one of our suicide victims.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I cannot help but be specific in paying tribute to people I knew over those years. I do so with very great regret. There are so many great men that I knew as Christian Brothers that it seems terribly unfair to single some of them out, but I think it is important that I do. My father brought me up constantly quoting Brother Gettons, who was obviously a towering individual in my father's upbringing. He constantly quoted Napoleon Bonaparte, the great warrior. When Napoleon Bonaparte was asked what was the greatest day of his life, he did not talk about Austerlitz or any of his other great victories. He said, `The greatest day of my life was the day of my first Holy Communion.' We were told about Brother Gettons and probably one of the finest men in all of history, Louis Pasteur. When Louis Pasteur—probably a quarter of the human race would not be alive today if it were not for Louis Pasteur—was asked what was his great ambition in life, he said, `My great ambition in life is to achieve the simple faith of an ordinary wife of a fisherman.'

        <para first-indent="16">
         Brother Skeehan was most certainly a very formidable figure in my upbringing. I used to be very ashamed to see the headmaster of our school always picking up papers whenever he was walking around the place. I thought that a person in such a very high, prestigious and powerful position should not bend over and pick up papers. But, as I grew older and wiser, I saw the incredible humility of a man who taught all of us never to bend the knee to anyone. If there were a theme that he could
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

         . He constantly reiterated the hard intellectual background for belief in God. That was something that was unashamedly put before all of the kids that went through the schools in those days. I single out yet another brother, Brother Kruger, who was quite the most remarkable rugby league coach in this country, having coached six successive state premierships from a tiny school in Charters Towers. He is one of the secrets behind the success of the Broncos in Brisbane as well. I asked Kelly Egan, one of the more famous footballers in the recent past in Australia, why they were so successful. He said that it was the respect, affection and admiration they had for that particular brother.

Yesterday the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Amanda Vanstone, announced the establishment of a small business incubator for the Central Coast—one of only 10 new business incubators to be established throughout Australia in the next few months. This business incubator will be built at Ourimbah on land provided by the Central Coast Campus of the University of Newcastle.

He has come from a disadvantaged background, has become successful and can employ hundreds of Australians.

        (1) The Port Phillip Region Airport and Airspace Study did not specifically recommend that the airport management advisory committee meet to discuss any changes to the number of aircraft movements at Essendon Airport, but the Study did make the following recommendations with regard to aircraft movements at the airport:

        (2) The Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) has advised the Airport Advisory Committee has not formally met since 1995. When the councils of Essendon and Keilor, which represented the local rate payers on the consultative committees, were amalgamated into the City of Moonee Valley, the Councillors were replaced by appointed Commissioners. The amalgamation of the relevant councils removed the need to consult with multiple local councils in a formal committee.

        Essendon Airport management wrote to the newly appointed Chief Commissioner in February 1995 extending an invitation to himself, fellow commissioners and officers to visit Essendon and continue the line of communication and consultation that was in place with the previous councils.

        As a result of this invitation the Commissioners and officer level staff visited the Airport, which included a presentation and tour, in March 1995.

        Additionally, both before and after the amalgamation process the FAC advises that it has continued to consult with representatives of the State Government with regard to activities on the Airport.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        While the Committee has not met on set occasions, the FAC considers that the co&amp;hyphen;operative arrangement established has enabled the discussion of issues. This has allowed the consultative forum between the representatives of the rate payers of both Moonee Valley, State interests and local airport management to continue.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        However, now that there are elected Councillors, the FAC has agreed to re&amp;hyphen;establish the committee formally, and has invited other nearby local councils to attend.

        (b) Housing choice in East Perth has increased markedly since the redevelopment commenced. The Commonwealth has worked with the WA Government to establish a mechanism for the provision of fifty (50) affordable housing dwellings in East Perth. The first phase of this commitment has commenced with the East Perth Redevelopment Authority making available two sites in the Haig Park precinct for the development of community housing for low to moderate income households. Submissions from community&amp;hyphen;based agencies were sought in February 1997 and detailed negotiations are currently underway with a proponent to construct a minimum of 14 dwellings. Additional housing will be provided to meet demand.

        (2) Yes, the Better Cities Program Agreement between the Commonwealth and the State of Western Australia was confirmed by a Deed of Variation between the parties dated 29 April 1997. However, the Better Cities Program ends on 30 June 1997 and Commonwealth involvement will then cease. A separate commitment to provide the 50 affordable housing units at East Perth was confirmed in correspondence from the Western Australian Minister for Planning, the Hon Graham Keirath MLA, to the Parliamentary Secretary for Transport and Regional Development, Hon Michael Ronaldson MP, on 14 April 1997.
