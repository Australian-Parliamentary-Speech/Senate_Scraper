          —I am rising to the dispatch box this morning a little earlier than I anticipated only because we seem to have lost a minister who was supposed to introduce some legislation this morning. But the opposition is always happy to assist those aberrant ministers who cannot get themselves out of bed in the morning to come in and perform their duties on behalf of the government. If it gives us an opportunity to speak perhaps a little longer and have a few more speakers on this Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997, then we are only too happy to continue with that process.

         The bill we have before us this morning, which has been the subject of some debate in the last day or so, and certainly a lot of comment both in the media and in the broad constituency that is Australia, relates to the proposition this government is advancing to have a constitutional convention later this year. This bill sets out the mechanism whereby delegates are elected to attend that convention. It sets out the method of voting to elect those delegates who will be attending. It is silent somewhat on the appointment of appointed delegates and who they will be and the process by which those appointments will be made. It also sets out, as I have indicated, the voting system to elect those elected delegates.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The opposition has indicated that in the main we will support the passage of this legislation but that we will be seeking some amendments. We do so because we believe that this process is fundamentally flawed. We believe that this is an unnecessary step that has been imposed on this issue. The issue is a vote by the people of Australia on their future—as to whether or not they believe this country should be a republic.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          We have said that we would rather have had an indicative plebiscite and ultimately a referendum. We believe that the money that is going to be expended on this little exercise, this flawed exercise, is something which we could have saved, which this government could have saved.

          —Thank you very kindly, Leader of the House. I was saying that I have always been a republican and one who believes that Australia should have its own head of state. This was a view I came to very early on in my lifetime. I first started to think about the issues associated with what we were to be as a country, where we were to go and where we could be in the future probably around the time that I started university down here at the ANU. The late 1960s was a period of great change. It was a period when much was happening around us, when much was happening in the world. It was a time when Australia was active in a military sense in South&amp;hyphen;East Asia. It was a time when people started to think about our relationship with what had been formerly the British crown and the United Kingdom. Even the connotation that is placed on `Great Britain' gives us, I think, some inkling as to the sort of relationship that perhaps some people saw as still in place between the `mother country', as it was described—Great Britain—and Australia.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But we have gone well beyond that. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said yesterday in his contribution, this is not an attack on or a put-down of the present Queen of England. This is not that at all. What this is about, and the personal view that I am expressing—and one which I am pleased to say our party has adopted—is that Australia should be a republic, that it should have an Australian as a head of state and that the system of government that we have in this country should continue the way it is.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A lot of mythology surrounds what the republic is all about. The view that was put forward by Paul Keating when Prime Minister was open to misrepresentation as it was a minimalist position. It simply said that we wanted to elect an Australian as a head of state. We would remain in the Commonwealth, just as Fiji now wants to go back into
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          the Commonwealth—if you can believe some of the newspaper reports emanating out of that country at present. But Fiji is a republic. The way it got there is certainly very different to what is being proposed in this country.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If you look around the world, those countries which have their own elected heads of state as presidents are part of that Commonwealth and no difference would apply to Australia. What we want on this side of the House, and what I suspect a large number on the other side want as well, is for Australia to have an Australian as head of state, to be part of the Commonwealth, certainly, and to continue the system of government that we presently enjoy. There would be no interference under the model that we have proposed. The system of government would continue. The Australian people would choose the government of this country. The Australian people would choose who, therefore, was going to be in opposition. There is no change proposed in the model that we have put forward, but the model we are debating today, regrettably  reflects the rather confused thinking of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and, of course, his own avowed bias in respect of whether or not Australia should be a republic.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I do not think anyone, in seriously looking at the way in which this model has been proposed, would think that it is anything other than as described yesterday by my colleague the member for Banks (Mr Melham) as `a process for constitutional reform based on fear'. I suspect when many of the abnormalities associated with the process of going forward with this bill are put in place, it is going to lead to not a reasonable outcome for most Australians. Let me elaborate on one or two of those particular issues.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I have said, the Australian Labor Party would much prefer to have an indicative plebiscite followed by a referendum. We do not think that this particular staged process is required, except of course that it does reflect the Prime Minister's own views. What it does is confuse the whole issue. We think that it could be fairly said that the government, in fact, is rigging the process. We think, when you have a clear understanding and a clear

          —My good friend and colleague the Chief Government Whip is saying that he does not agree that that is the case. I wonder whether you have had the opportunity to have a look at some of the information that came out of the Senate inquiry on this particular matter and at some of the evidence that was presented by people from the Australian Electoral Commission and elsewhere. The process itself of distributing the information to voters in Australia is open to tampering—there is no question about that. I remember in the last election campaign—and it has happened before—certain parts of my own electorate where my campaign committee, having raised its own funds and had material printed, and so on, wanted to distribute it around the electorate. We did so. The cheapest way, as you know, is to use Australia Post, at 7&amp;half;c a letter, to get it out into the community.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What we found was that some of the workers from Australia Post were simply taking the bundles of those `To the householder' letters in high&amp;hyphen;rise unit areas of Wollongong and sticking the whole lot on the top of the letterboxes. That is not what was supposed to happen. They were supposed to go to each individual household and that did not happen.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The same sort of process, under what is proposed here, could happen in this case. Even more insidious a part of this, and arising out of the evidence which was given to the Senate committee, concerns what you will actually be given and how that process then will unfold. As I understand it from the shadow minister for justice and the shadow Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, there will be an envelope, about the usual size for A4, and contained in that will be two other envelopes in which you send back your votes. There will be the voting paper itself and also some biographical details on each of the candidates seeking election to be part of this convention.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I do not know about you, Chief Government Whip, but I suspect that there are going to be a lot of people who put their hand up wanting to be elected to this convention.
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          Therefore, an envelope that is about yea big will have within it two envelopes to send the ballot paper back, the ballot paper itself and biographical information about each of the candidates. Arranging that in itself is going to be an exercise which I do not think is going to be appropriate in these circumstances.

         We have some real concerns also about the voluntary postal ballot process. We are talking here, are we not, as was suggested yesterday, about not requiring Australians to have a say on their future. What this government is about is saying, `We will give you a voluntary postal ballot. You don't have to be in it. You don't have to have a say.' By logical extension—and I am not really one for conspiracy theories on this side of the House—the question has to be asked: is this going to be a testing ground for what some people in the government—Senator Minchin is a prime example—would like to see for the future, to get away from the compulsory attendance at a ballot—not compulsory voting as some people think it is, but compulsory attendance at a ballot—which is what the law of this country requires?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Once you are there, you do not necessarily have to vote. That is not what the law says. It says you have to turn up to vote. I wonder whether this is the first phase of the government's desire to eliminate that as part of the Australian voting system. I wonder whether this is the first phase of a process which will mean that in future the less advantaged in the community—those people who come from non&amp;hyphen;English speaking backgrounds, for example—may not, unless you have some compulsory element in this, get out to vote.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Clearly, there is one side of politics that would be affected more by that process than the other. I do not think I have to point out in this place who that might be. The material that is going to be distributed as part of this ballot process is only going to be in one language, and that is English. That has to be disadvantageous to quite a number of constituents. Certainly in my electorate it will be. In the electorate that I represent, the city of

         The other thing is, who is going to receive that envelope? The Australian Electoral Commission has indicated that two million Australians change their address each year. Since this ballot is going to be held 18 months since the last election and no habitation review is going to be held, it may well be that up to two million people do not get the ballot papers and therefore do not vote.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is a very tight window of opportunity when people are going to be asked to vote. It has been estimated by the Australian Electoral Commission that there are something like 200,000 Australians who are going to be overseas and they are not going to be given an opportunity to vote either. They are simply going to be denied a part in this process.

        <para first-indent="16">
         According to recent opinion polls, it is interesting that something like 72 per cent of Australians support compulsory voting that we have in this country, and I see no reason why we should not do that again on this particular occasion. There is some quibbling on what it might cost to do that. On the best estimates, we are talking about $40 million as against $49 million. If we are going to spend that amount of money on a step that I do not believe is necessary, I do not think the government should be afraid of spending that extra $9 million to make sure there is a compulsory element in this so that there is a genuine representation of people's views.

         The voting system itself is also something which is of concern because it has been likened, according to witnesses at the Senate inquiry, to people going along to the local TAB and having a punt on a Saturday afternoon. When questioned about whether or not people in this country would have difficulties voting above or below the line—the same as for the Senate, but with some subtle vari

          ations—it was said at the Senate inquiry, `All Australians are punters. They all know how to do it at the TAB.' I do not know if that is right. Having heard the views of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on gambling, I am not sure if he would know how to fill in a TAB ticket on a Saturday afternoon. He might surprise me, but I am not quite sure. So maybe his vote will not count either. I am sure he will get the ballot paper, because he will want to vote a particular way, and I have a pretty fair idea of which way that will be. In yesterday's second reading debate someone likened the process to a bet on the Dapto dogs. It was said that that was insulting. I am not sure which part was; certainly not going to Dapto—that is not insulting, I have to tell you. But the voting process is.

         I also have some concerns on how delegates are to be appointed. Under the current proposal there is no doubt that the appointment of 40 parliamentary delegates—20 to be drawn from the Commonwealth parliament, with each state sending three delegates and the territories one each—will advantage the government parties because of the current political make&amp;hyphen;up of parliaments around Australia. The only saving grace in that—thank God there is one!—is that people like Collins in New South Wales and Kennett in Victoria are very pro&amp;hyphen;republic. That is good. At least there are a couple of people's votes that our side of politics can count on among the people who are appointed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We want to see that make&amp;hyphen;up changed—and we will be moving amendments. We want to see the number of elected delegates increased to 80, to be chosen from the states and territories in a manner which more properly reflects what is happening here. Even Kate Carnell, the Chief Minister of the ACT, said that it was outrageous that her opposite number will not be given an opportunity to come along as part of that convention and to vote. I think Kate happens to be right on this occasion.

         We are suggesting that 16 parliamentary delegates should be appointed from the federal parliament: eight members or senators from the Prime Minister's side, six by the Leader of the Opposition, one by the leader

          of the Democrats and one to be appointed from the remaining minor party or Independent members or senators. That is quite reasonable in the circumstances. We do not want to see one side advantaged over the other. As was said yesterday by the member for Banks (Mr Melham) in his speech in the second reading debate, we have outlined all these sorts of concerns and the way in which there ought to be a different approach in the balance of people who are going to be here.

         Finally, I want to comment on the necessity of having an independent chair.

We think that there is some merit in that proposal.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I come back to what I said at the start: if you look at the make&amp;hyphen;up of Australia in the 1990s as we are about to go into the next century, you will see that it has changed dramatically from what it was 100 years ago. Given the make&amp;hyphen;up of people who are here, their backgrounds and the way in which the relationship with the so&amp;hyphen;called mother country has now changed, there is no doubt—and certainly the polls suggest this—that the overwhelming majority of Australians would like to see us a republic with an Australian head of state. People have their own views on this and I am quite happy to accept those different points of view. In that hundred years the UK has become very closely integrated into Europe; all the colonies that the UK once had have simply disappeared.

         This bill, the Aged Care (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1997, establishes the transitional provisions and consequential amendments to move from the current legislative framework for aged care to the new system under the Aged Care Bill 1997. This bill repeals provisions of the National Health Act 1953 and the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954 that are no longer required and maintains other sections applying to periods prior to the commencement of the Aged Care Bill 1997. It also contains necessary transitional provisions for a smooth transfer from the old legislation to the new.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In addition, the bill amends relevant legislation of the Departments of Social Security and Veterans' Affairs and others to take account
         <break page="3722" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          of the new aged care provisions. These are technical amendments only; for example, the bill amends definitions in these acts to reflect the changes embodied in the Aged Care Bill 1997.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In considering these transitional issues, we have adopted an approach that provides security and minimises intrusion into the lives of those persons already receiving aged care. For example, formal agreements between hostel providers and residents concerning entry contributions and fees will be maintained as resident agreements under the Aged Care Bill 1997. This will protect these residents from having to pay any more in entry contributions than they have already paid.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Current approvals and classifications will be maintained for existing residents, ensuring that they will not need to go through another approval and classification procedure until those classifications expire. This bill also clarifies a number of exempt status issues for residents receiving these services. For example, existing exempt residents will continue to pay the same exempt fee and will not be income tested.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill ensures that current service providers are not unduly burdened with administrative red tape in moving to the new system. This bill gives providers of aged care certainty in the transition from the old system to the new. For example, approved operators currently providing care, or who have approvals to provide care under the National Health Act 1953 or the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954 before the commencement of the Aged Care Act 1997, will automatically become approved providers under the Aged Care Bill 1997. This approval will be retained whether or not these organisations are incorporated. This bill specifically allows existing approved operators to choose not to incorporate at the time of transfer to the new system.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Aged Care (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1997 also makes provision for applications made under the old legislation that are not finalised at the commencement date of the Aged Care Bill 1997 to be considered under the new bill. For example, applications for approved operator status will be considered as
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          applications for approved provider status under the Aged Care Bill 1997. In addition, sanctions on providers that are now in place remain as sanctions under the new bill. In addition, for Commonwealth funding received by providers up until the commencement day of the new legislation, this legislation will preserve the accountability processes so that this funding can be acquitted after the commencement of the new act.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The consequential amendments will also redirect the payment of residential care allowance—formerly rent assistance—to providers of residential aged care rather than to residents. This is a technical change only that is designed to simplify administrative arrangements. It will not significantly affect either the amount of income residents are left with after they pay the base fee or the total funding available for providers.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill will also amend the National Health Act 1953 in relation to a 1997 budget announcement to increase the number of days of respite that a person in receipt of the domiciliary nursing care benefit is eligible for. This will be an increase from 42 to 63 days of respite per year from July 1998.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         While this amendment is not directly linked to the residential aged care reforms, which are the main subject of this bill, it supports greater flexibility in the broader spectrum of aged care services that are available. People who receive the domiciliary nursing care benefit do so because they provide 24 hour a day nursing home level care to their spouse or to another relative. This amendment recognises the dedication of these carers to their family member and is another step towards honouring this government's commitment to carers.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We are committed to achieving substantial reform in the residential aged care sector. This bill is essential to that reform and is the link between current legislation and the new Aged Care Bill 1997 that will allow this transition to occur.

         My main focus in this debate is the nature of the process. Two comments put this in context. As an observer at the recent Pakistani elections, the former Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Fraser, stated that democracy in Pakistan was under question and was very threatened in the future, despite the massive majority of the new government. There were two essential reasons he gave for that: the continued intervention by the armed forces in Pakistani politics and, more importantly, the very low turnout of about 37 per cent. The
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australian

         of 5 February 1997 stated:

        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         The Pakistan Muslim League, which has claimed victory, has said it was satisfied with the conduct of the polls. Mr Fraser conceded, however, that the low voter turnout could affect the new government's legitimacy.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         What we are seeing is a process that is aimed to discredit itself. The other comment that throws light upon this is from the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) on page 37 of the May 1997 issue of the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Adelaide Review

         Even if republican candidates win two thirds of the vote in the election for delegates (a heroic assumption in the light of the republican movement's inability to sign up more than 6,000 members after six years of media boosting) that still leaves the Convention "do you want a republic?" vote at about 88 to 64, which is hardly a "consensus" or even a particularly overwhelming majority for change.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         So what we are seeing, as I say, is a rather tawdry effort to ensure that there is minimal participation, that large numbers of people do not vote, that people are discouraged and find it difficult so that, at the end of this process, after the vote, regardless of the percentage that the republicans or the monarchists poll—and as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) well realises, the likelihood is that the majority, as indicated in virtually all polls, will plump for change—they will be able to say that there were problems with the process, ballot papers were lost, there were indications of fraud, there were indications of people interfering
         <break page="3724" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          with people's ballots, there were collection problems with ballots in certain areas, et cetera. So the essential aim of this process, rather than all this talk about consulting the people and giving them a say, is really to minimise their participation.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In retrospect, it seems rather cynical that we had these people saying in opposition that the previous Prime Minister was autocratic in his attempt to change the constitutional process in this country. They continually attempted to assert that he wanted to bypass the people and the parliament and do it in a very despotic and autocratic style. The process they have put before the people of this country is, as I said, essentially about making sure that they do not have a say and, when they do vote, minimising the effectiveness of it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The most disturbing of these changes is the introduction of a voluntary voting system in this process and, at the same time, the decision that it be by postal vote. This is the linchpin, the opening of the door, for Senator Minchin's determination to change the processes that this country has operated under since 1924. Many speakers have referred to the secret ballot as the Australian ballot. We know, historically, that the nature of the population of this country, the experiences that the people of this country had in the lead&amp;hyphen;up to Federation—their knowledge of the very undemocratic processes in the United Kingdom before the 1832 Reform Act, of the fact that people did not have secret ballots, that the local landlord controlled the ballots, that England was full of rotten boroughs where families could allocate or sell seats to people—meant they wanted to do something about it. So they introduced a secret ballot.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         At the same time, experience in the first two decades persuaded people of all political inclinations—free traders, protectionists, labour, et cetera—that there had to be an encouragement of a sense of civic duty and being part of the system for people to feel an identity with it, to feel that they had a role and that government and the political system related to them. So, in 1924, without much debate, they introduced compulsory voting. That came 14 years after Australia's introduction of compulsory registration.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          That process has served this country well. Anyone who follows the number of countries that have looked to this country for advice, for help and for structures in regard to electoral systems knows that it has served the country very well. Introducing this measure for the convention is, quite simply, an attempt by the government to give it a try out and to undermine the 72 per cent support in this country for the current system.

         <para first-indent="16">
          What voluntary voting is about, if we look at all the surveys in the United States, New Zealand and western Europe, is attempting to make sure that fewer people participate. All of the surveys show that those who do not participate have certain predominant characteristics. Unlike Senator Minchin, I do not think it is as clear&amp;hyphen;cut, in regards to the two political parties in this country, as to who will be advantaged. Increasingly, politics in this country is less class based.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          What we have seen in the US surveys is that it is the transient population of the country, the blacks, who basically tend to be interrelated with social and economic deprivation, young people and the less educated who are the people who do not participate in the US political process. They are the characteristics. It is obviously the thrust of Senator Minchin's determination to make sure that those people are not part of the process, to make sure they do not participate and to make sure they do not have a say.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          When we talk about compulsory voting, we all realise that the reality, the truth, is that one is not compelled to vote but one is compelled to turn up. Despite all of these claims about how people resent having to be part of it all, it is interesting to note that, when this country and its states moved from voluntary to compulsory voting, the actual increase in the number of people voting informal—basically making the choice to protest by not voting for any candidates—was, with the exception of South Australia, extremely minimal.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There is not evident in the electorate a demand, a push, to get rid of this system. It is essentially partisan driven. It is driven by a belief, on the part of Senator Minchin, that there can be political advantage in this change. It is also interesting to note that,
          <break page="3725" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           despite all the loyal speeches of those opposite, the ANU's survey of candidates at the last federal election showed that 44 per cent of coalition candidates support the continued presence of compulsory voting in this country. There is no reason to suspect that that poll was unrepresentative.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We have a very grave concern with this process being utilised as a forerunner to a wider introduction of voluntary voting. It is not only a question of the past—that is a very simple, opportunistic and cynical kind of approach that some people have taken. If we look at the political system in the United States, we can see very good reasons why this voluntary voting system they are putting forward for this election process is wrong.

         <para first-indent="16">
          As other speakers have noted, there is a situation in the United States where Timothy McVeigh and the militias are representative of a wide disquiet in American politics. At the last election, something like 27 per cent of people in the American electorate actually voted for the successful candidate—I think a little over 50 per cent of the electorate voted at all. People feel marginalised. They feel ignored. They feel that the political parties are not representative of them. They feel that they have no say in the system—it is big government, unrepresentative government, an establishment, something that does not relate to them. This is the ultimate outcome of the kind of process this government seems to be setting out on the road to.

          Unlike in the period of Roosevelt and even up to the 1960s when they actually made an effort to enrol more people and to get people to participate, what America has created, with the increasing sophistication of political advertising and computers and direct mail, et cetera, is a political process where those who are more likely to vote are those the political parties aim to persuade. They are the people who are targeted. They are the people whose views essentially dominate the political system. It is a self&amp;hyphen;perpetuating process where millions upon millions of people feel that they cannot have a say, that it is not worth having a say and that it is not worth participating.

          What you see in the US political system is not only this appeal to conservative socioeconomic values and the power of suburbia but also—parallel with that—the development, internally within the parties, of fringe specialist interest groups which are obviously far more persuasive in that system than they would be in Australia. Here the two political parties essentially have to appeal to a broad spectrum of the electorate. They have to persuade the vast majority of Australians as to their particular attitudes and issues.

          As I have said, we have very grave concerns with the introduction of voluntary voting in this process. We feel that it aims to discredit the process by poor participation. It is interesting to note that people have referred to 1977 and the various referenda then. When people walked in the door to the ballot box that time to vote in the referenda and for the actual elections at the same time, half a million people did not bother participating in those referenda. So one has to put forward the proposition that there is going to be a very poor turnout.

          Part of this tawdry effort to minimise the Australian people's say and to put power into the hands of the Prime Minister and a small majority within the National and Liberal parties is the reality of a few of the other processes that they are involved in. We know that at the last federal elections approximately 450,000 Australians changed their enrolment in the election period. We know that the current government is attempting to shorten that period—on the surface, because of supposed fraud in the process. They are attempting to minimise people's right to change enrolment during an election period by reducing the time. In the debate about this

          If there is any person who should tell the Australian electorate how important this decision is—and I find it difficult to believe that he thinks the change is that fundamental—it is the current Prime Minister. He has belaboured the point of how important this is to the future of the country. At the monarchist selection meeting at the Sydney Town Hall last week, one of the candidates said that this process was more important than the Second World War against Hitler. So a process that is supposedly so important, so fundamental to our identity, so fundamental to our society is essentially going to be carried out on the basis of minimising people's rights to be part of it because it will cost a few dollars.

          The opposition is also concerned about the predominance of appointment in this process—once again, a deliberate manoeuvre by the Prime Minister to essentially minimise the input, the say, the participation, of the people and to basically monopolise it as far as possible in the hands of politicians. This kind of process goes against the constitutional issue of this country, the fact that he is attempting to ensure that not only do people have minimal say in it but also a majority of the appointees are from his side of politics.

It is interesting to note in the British papers this week that Barbados is considering its continued connection with the British Crown.

         As McKenna points out in his paper `Tracking the republic', the question of an Australian republic actually began in 1788 when, as McKenna puts it, `Australia was settled by a people who believed firmly that a colonial state was a temporary stage of political development,' and that the final stage would be `independence, separation from the parent state and the declaration of a republic'. So the first settlers very clearly saw that a republic was the necessary outcome of a mature democracy. In many cases, the United States was seen as an example of colonial development and as proof of the inevitable destiny of Australia as a republic, not necessarily in the same form, I might say.

         I think it is fair to argue, as McKenna and others do, that from white settlement we have been part of a society undergoing a process of maturation, resisted by some and albeit often slow. There is nothing inevitable about this maturation: it requires effort, it requires foresight and it requires dedication, and we have seen that in the past, from our politicians

         For example, one of the things that we need to achieve as a mature society, apart from becoming a republic, is reconciliation with our indigenous people. The current debate about native title, the Wik decision and reconciliation shows all too clearly that need for effort, for foresight and for dedication and the necessity too for vigorous and persuasive leadership. Without it, we fall into dissent and disunity.

         Despite its long history in the Australian political debate, the republican ideal and, indeed, the label republican have often excited extraordinary fear and loathing in the minds of the defenders of privilege and the status quo. Sometimes they also defend the monarchy, but it often seems as if they are more interested in defending the status quo. The sound and fury of rebellion and bloody revolution appear still to reverberate with some when they think about the republic.

         I would like to draw the attention of the House to an amusing example of early attempts to discredit and scapegoat those who questioned government authority and looked to, for instance, the possibility of a republic. Two incidents in particular illustrate the controversial status of republicanism in colonial New South Wales, and I use these examples to indicate this long history of antipathy, although they do have some humour.

         `In 1795 the English republican John Boston, who had allegedly sailed to Australia toasting the King's damnation, discovered that one of his best sows had been shot by marines in a close belonging to Captain Foveaux. Although Boston's aspirations to become a colonial merchant saw him in economic competition with officers of the corps'—something that many lived to regret—there is little doubt, as McKenna puts it, `that his republican sympathies contributed to the loss of his sow. At the civil court hearing in 1795, Boston heard Lieutenant McKellar denounce him as a man who had "publicly drank to the murder of his King and the annihilation of the constitution of his country". McKellar also

          explained that the pig was shot `not in malice or in wantonness' but because it was, amongst other things, destroying the property of Captain Foveaux.' Again, to quote from the court proceedings:

         `In the eyes of Lieutenant McKellar, the insidious pestilence of republicanism was even capable of converting farm animals into active advocates of subversion.' Although it might not be a pretty image, it is quite likely, as McKenna put it, that Australia's first republican martyr was a pig. That is not to say anything about the contemporary supporters, but it does show that the word `republican' was often used, and is still used, as a means of discrediting those who question government authority.

         Another example that I think gives voice to this is again one quoted by McKenna. `In 1806 Joseph Smallsalts, a convict who dared to utter "expressions of inflammatory and seditious practices" by declaring his support for the philosophies of Thomas Paine'—extraordinarily seditious—discovered the very harsh penalties awaiting republicans in New South Wales and was actually given 100 lashes and sentenced to hard labour in the Newcastle coalmines.

         I use these examples to indicate what I think is the sentiment behind this bill. There is a great deal of reluctance. It is very small minded and it still has resonances of this sentiment. The bill is sadly characteristic of the Howard government. It is timid, it is lacking in excitement or vision and it is pretty manipulative and mean in its approach to

         They were also very clear at the time that they were embarking on the people's business. They were not doing it for themselves and for their own short-term political gains.

         Many will remember that, when the member for Mayo, Alexander Downer, was the Leader of the Opposition, he was in a bit of a pickle and suddenly we had the people's convention. It has transmogrified into this strange beast we see before us, neither elected nor nominated fully.

         The legislation is clearly designed to reduce the likelihood of achieving a republic by diminishing the authority of the part elected and part nominated convention. I know there will be people working extremely hard to make sure that is not the case. I myself am a member of the Australian Republican Movement and, in my own area of Fremantle, I spoke recently at a very well attended forum on this matter. So there are people out there working very hard indeed to ensure that this is a people's convention and that it will be taken seriously by the wider community.

         I think there is also a measurable risk that the forum will be used for other agendas and other purposes. I am sure many people have in recent days noted the publicity given to the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). She indicated in an interview that her followers would probably—I think she almost said certainly—run a ticket for the people's convention. But, interestingly, she refused to say what their view was on the desirability of a republic or of retaining the monarchy. So I think that is a fair indication that this will simply be used as an electoral test for other agendas which have nothing to do with either of those matters. From my own point of view, I think it is inevitable that some members of the far right and their fellow travellers, who will remain nameless, will find the platform irresistible, and I believe that will be very dangerous indeed.

         The principal weaknesses in the legislation, apart from these philosophical problems, turn around the question of the method of voting that is to be adopted—that is, the voluntary postal ballot—how the ballot will actually be carried out and the selection of community and parliamentary representatives. I think the combined effect of these weaknesses will significantly undermine the credibility of the convention. Indeed, I believe that is the clear intent of the legislation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The clear intent is to minimise participation, to reduce the voter turnout and to then be able to claim retrospectively that this shows a lack of community interest, and therefore either that we should not proceed at all or that the matter should be delayed. As many members have already said, the bill provides for a very unwelcome departure from the usual form of voting in federal and state politics: it is voluntary and it is by post.

          It is likely they will not even know it is going on. Those whose first language is not English will find it difficult.

         This is a significant and deliberate watering down of the idea of a universal vote. It is not a question of cost. We have already heard that the margin between this and a compulsory attendance ballot would be as little as $9 million. It is a critical decision for Australia's future and it should not be hostage to the Prime Minister's peculiar spending priorities—either it is important or it is not. In any case, I think there is a lot of evidence to suggest that the Electoral Commission and Australia Post may be underestimating the cost of this postal voting system. In Western Australia, they have recently introduced postal voting at local government level and, in some cases, there have been costs of over $3 per elector. Given the number of candidates who will need to be described on these ballot papers, it is unlikely that the usual standard envelope will suffice.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think it is inevitable that the Australian Electoral Commission's final estimate will prove to be an underestimate and I hope that Australia Post are not left to carry the can if their assessment of the cost is wrong. In any case, the critical question is whether or not people should be given an appropriate vote, and a postal ballot falls short on all scores.

         It also creates a worrying precedent, especially given the government's flirtation with the idea of voluntary voting at ordinary elections. Previous speakers have highlighted some of the problems with this. It has all the hallmarks, to my mind, of a trial run for voluntary voting despite the fact that the majority of Australians have clearly shown that they are in favour of the retention of compulsory attendance at the ballot.

         I want to speak briefly on the voting system and how the ballot will actually be conducted. The selection of postal voting has resulted already in a number of undesirable features being foisted on the voters. Firstly, a very incomplete and confused adoption of the Senate style voting system. I was appalled, when I read the Australian Electoral Commission's submission, at their blithe adoption of the analogy with current betting systems. I, for one, have never set foot inside a TAB, and I am sure there are many others who have not, but it does show how far Kennett's obscene casino culture has penetrated our society when such an august body, and such a usually thoughtful body, should draw such parallels. I must say to the commissioners that I object.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The mechanism, too, is inordinately complicated and clearly disadvantages those who do not want to vote the `ticket' of grouped candidates and who want to vote for individuals. It will mean a great deal of informal voting, there is no doubt about that, or people being forced to not vote at all because they cannot vote the `ticket'.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It also needs to be said—although people do not want to hear this because we do have postal voting for some purposes in Australia already—that postal votes run the risk of being rorted. If you think about the way post is delivered in large complexes with a high turnover of residents, there is every chance that ballots will be picked up by people for whom they are not intended. Preventing that may well result in further informal voting: for instance, requiring people to put their date of birth on the outside of the envelope, which is one thing that has been suggested, or the person who forgets and therefore has an
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          informal vote although it may have been perfectly proper. So there is a very considerable difficulty. And it fails our long&amp;hyphen;cherished requirement for a secret ballot—the so&amp;hyphen;called `Australian ballot'. It is inevitable that it will be subject to the scrutiny of others—not in every case but in many cases—especially given the delay between the delivery and the closure of the polls.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I also want to speak briefly about the appointment of delegates. Although the bill does not specially deal with it, clearly the whole convention depends upon the balance between the elected and the nominated delegates. They will make up half the convention and they will be very influential. First of all, it is clear that there should be a proper balance between the various political parties in this country, and what we have seen here is a breach with precedent so that the conservatives clearly have the upper hand. The representation will be biased in favour of the conservative parties. I must say that I am not sure why there should be any parliamentary representatives. We have our opportunity to vote; we have our opportunity to discuss these matters in these places. Why should there be parliamentary representation? If the Prime Minister is absolutely clear about this being a community consultation process, why have members of parliament?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The community representatives, too, are likely to be chosen because they are known to the political parties, in particular the Prime Minister and his supporters. It is inevitable—and you have heard this said by some of them—that they will be prominent citizens, again not necessarily representative of the wider community. Generally speaking, this balance of parliamentarians and selected known and prominent citizens will mean that there is a bias not only in favour of the conservative view but also towards older members of our community. It is almost certain that, if you look at the bias, it will be in favour of the older members and, as Bean, one of our prominent political scientists has indicated, age has the most consistently strong effect on choosing a monarchy. The older the citizen, the more likely they are—perhaps not surprisingly—to oppose republicanism. So
         <break page="3731" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          again it is going to be stacked by pro&amp;hyphen;monarchists, by prominent citizens who will typically be older, and there is no guarantee, despite what the Prime Minister has said, that women will be properly represented; and that is something that I want to touch on a little further.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the things that is very interesting about the nomination of these delegates is that the government has clearly failed to notify the community that they could self-nominate and has left it to senior political figures to nominate on their behalf. Again, that hardly smacks of participation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Looking at the question of the involvement of women, I feel very strongly that, since no women participated in the constitutional conventions of 1891, 1897 and 1898, we should remedy this in this current convention and women should be eligible to participate, as they are through voting, through nomination, and it should be an important opportunity for women to participate equally in the constitutional debate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That means the government has a particular responsibility through its nominations to ensure the proper representation of women. It should undertake a community education campaign to make sure that women put their names forward. There are some suggestions which are backed by a great many women's organisations that the names of men and women are required to be alternated on group tickets registered with the Electoral Commission, ensuring that we do have equal representation of women in these very important considerations.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Finally, I want to talk very briefly about the procedures of the convention, which are nowhere referred to in this legislation but which we deserve to be able to discuss. Firstly, who will chair it and how? We certainly recommend there be an independent chair. What will be on the agenda and how will it be fully discussed? I am not aware of this being discussed with anyone in this place. How, for example, will a consensus be reached? How will we know when there has been agreement? What will be required by way of a vote or discussion? Does it mean 100 per cent consensus needs to be reached
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          or will a majority vote do? My suspicion is that anything short of 100 per cent for a republic will see the whole matter put on the backburner for a very long time.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I conclude where I started: this bill really resonates with the anti&amp;hyphen;republican sentiment that has been part of the conservative philosophy in this country for a very long time. It need not be. If we were to have a full and open discussion of this, an indicative plebiscite would be the best way to go. This strange beast, this convention, serves no purpose other than to diminish the weight of opinion, which is clearly in favour of a republic.

          —The opposition has proposed a series of amendments to the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997 because this legislation as it stands is seriously flawed. This legislation compromises the noble process that the nation should be engaged in at this time as it moves further down the road to full political maturity—that political maturity being Australia's final statement and expression of its structural political independence: the creation of an Australian republic, a republic led by an Australian.

         Labor courageously put this issue firmly on the national political agenda in the life of the last parliament.

         We took that action at considerable political cost. When we did, we acknowledged our unique history and the contribution of the British political system to Australia's political development. When we put this item on the national political agenda, in no way was it seen to be a comment on the performance of the monarch, and it was not meant in any way to cause offence to those in the Australian community who deeply believed that Australia should hold to its current political structures and retain the Queen of England as the Queen of Australia.

         We put this item firmly up the political agenda, at considerable political cost. That cost was extracted by the conservative parties in this country when in opposition. They sought to diminish a fine national debate by dragging it into the partisan political arena. Nothing has changed since they came to power. This whole notion of a people's convention has simply one aim in mind; that is, to diminish and delay the process by which Australia finally moves to become a republic and to have an Australian head of state. That is the real agenda that was put by the conservative parties when in opposition and the one being pursued now that they are in government.

         No government that firmly believes in the principle of widespread public debate before significant constitutional changes are made and in participation and fairness would have come up with such a bill and presented it to the House.

         Unfortunately, this government is squandering one of the most unique opportunities we have had in this century to propel Australia to a new level of national debate over an issue central to the formation of our identity and to our political development beyond the year 2000. We can strip all the arguments away because it all comes down to one proposition: at the core of this debate in the parliament today about constitutional conventional processes is the essential question that nobody

          can deny or avoid, and that is, simply, should Australia have an Australian as its head of state? That is the core issue. This bill is merely a reflection of and an attempt to establish a flawed process by which Australia as a nation should be considering this essential question.

         There is one very easy way to test the water on this in a national, political sense, and that is to put the basic proposition to the vote, put the simple question to the Australian people: `Do you want an Australian to be the head of Australia?' I think that, when we put that question, there will be an overwhelming and resounding positive statement by the Australian people that the time has come in our political history for us to take the final step and to unleash the great energies of this nation to give hope to our young people that there is a new dawn approaching in the Australian political system and there is a new dawn in their own history. That is not a statement that denies our past, but it is time that we made a statement about our future.

         The responsibility for the carriage of this most critical and important national debate rests fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Prime Minister. It is the Prime Minister who really has the leadership role in this critical issue of national debate. What has this Prime Minister done in his time in opposition and now in his time in the prime minister's chair? He has thrown every political obstacle and mounted every political argument against the basic proposition that Australians should have an Australian head of state.

         I would have thought any person in this parliament and outside of it who was committed essentially to Australia, to the formation of its national identity, to the preservation of its cultural traditions and to the preservation of its great democracy would answer that simple question in the positive, that Australia should have an Australian as its head of state. Yet here we have a Prime Minister of a nation who cannot even take the one simple step of leadership and say to his own constituency and to the national constituency that it is time that Australia had an Australian head of state.

          It is deeply regrettable that in 1997 the Prime Minister of Australia cannot in his own mind and in his own heart countenance the very simple proposition that Australia should have an Australian head of state. It is not surprising that this Prime Minister cannot take that final step, because in every area of his prime ministership the issue of leadership keeps cropping up. The Prime Minister has consistently failed, in the brief time that he has occupied the prime minister's chair, to demonstrate to this nation his capacity for real political leadership.

          It is a matter of common political knowledge that the coalition parties turned to John Howard because they had nowhere else to go. The dream team, the fabulous twosome, the young turks, the young bucks that were going to lead the coalition parties beyond the year 2000 fell at the first steeple. To whom did the coalition parties turn? To John Howard as Prime Minister, somebody that the Australian people had rejected on a previous occasion and even his own party had rejected on other occasions.

          So it is not surprising to me that the Prime Minister cannot take the final mental decision to commit himself to the proposition that Australia should have an Australian head of state. He has failed the leadership test on ministerial standards. We have seen in the life of this parliament already a considerable debasement of the ministerial code of conduct that the Prime Minister held to his breast and waved before the Australian people at the last election. He has failed to impose the ministerial standards on his cabinet that were the simple hallmark and were the simple principles by which Labor ministers lived in their ministerial jobs for some 13 years. He has failed the test of ministerial standards and he has failed the leadership test in that area.

We can simply resolve this argument tomorrow with a simple plebiscite, a simple question put to the Australian people, but the Prime Minister refuses to do it. He wants to go in a convoluted way to try to debase the process and debase the issue. We are proposing a series of amendments to this legislation in the hope that what comes out at the end of the tunnel, what comes out of this parliamentary process, although the process might be flawed, is a bill that reflects some honour and reflects some—what shall we say; what can it reflect—

My colleagues have gone through the limitations of this legislation, and those limitations are substantial. The first one of course is the voting system that is going to be employed. We know that this is the thin end of the wedge as far as voluntary voting is concerned. It has been pointed out by my colleagues that the financial difference between holding a compulsory ballot and holding a voluntary ballot is in the region of $9 million to $10 million.

This legislation compromises the notion of a secret ballot—the `Australian ballot'—that we hold dear and that is really at the heart of Australian democracy. This legislation will disenfranchise many people in this country. The Australian Electoral Commission admits that there are two million people who move their places of residence in any one year.

          The honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) has quite aptly pointed out to me some of the more interesting features of this piece of legislation. It devotes some 16 sections to how voting will be undertaken in Antarctica. There is no provision here to ensure that the 200,000 Australians who are travelling abroad in any one year—people in London, for example—are able to cast a ballot or a vote in this process, but here we have 16 sections of the bill devoted to how voting might be undertaken in Antarctica. Section 85 provides for assistance to the frail aged and the infirm in Antarctica, but nowhere in this piece of legislation is there a provision to assist Australians who might be travelling overseas to cast their votes.

          In conclusion, there is the need for the Australian community to engage in this critical national debate. I recently participated in a community forum organised by the Centre for Citizenship and Human Rights and the Constitutional Centenary Foundation. It was held at the Deakin University's wool stores campus. The topic for discussion was `Towards the 21st century: our possible tomorrows'. The member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) participated in that debate as well. It was a very important community forum and participation in these sorts of community forums ought to take place right around the nation in considering this very important issue.

Because we know already, from the local government elections in Victoria and those other places where this postal ballot approach has been taken, that the people who miss out the most are people of non-English speaking background. Also, when we consider that the Aboriginal community will not be able to take advantage of the mobile booths that they have become accustomed to, the Aboriginal community will miss out.

          —When I concluded my remarks, being interrupted on 26 March 1997, I was talking about victimology, despair and failure. The issue is one where too many young people—in fact too many in our society, particularly over the past 13 years under a Labor administration—have come to believe, and have been told by people who believe they are doing well in the social welfare field, that these individuals are victims of society and that there is nothing about their circumstances that they themselves
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           can do to improve, that society needs not only to look after them but also to nurture them, foster them, develop and provide for them.

         In a sense, in Australia we have become too dependent on outsiders. We have become too dependent on government and government services. In a sense, we have partially lost that age old tradition of taking care of ourselves, doing for ourselves, growing within ourselves and benefiting from our own work and efforts. I hope that the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill will start to help us redress a minor portion of that problem.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Over the last few weeks since the parliament stopped sitting in March I have had the opportunity to talk to hundreds and hundreds of young people around Australia who are school age children. Over and over again I or one of my colleagues asked these children what they thought of the work for the dole scheme, whether they thought it was fair and equitable, whether they thought they would participate if they could not find a job or whether they thought their colleagues, friends and neighbours who were currently on unemployment benefits and on the dole would approve of such a program. I can tell you that universally the hundreds of young people I spoke to approved the concept of the work for the dole scheme.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is significant that young people themselves apparently believe that it is right and proper that, if a person is to receive assistance from the government for their living expenses when they cannot find work, they should put something back into the community, which is funding their living expenses, in order to help the community. Many of the young people that we spoke to said they believed that many young people who were on unemployment benefits really just did not want to work. They may have been naive to some degree, and I could not tell you to what degree that is, but there was a strong feeling that there is work available for young people. It might not be the kind of work that they wanted. It might not be a management job, it might not be the managing director's job and you might have to get your hands dirty. It might be menial work that is sometimes uninteresting and
         <break page="3744" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          sometimes at inappropriate or inconvenient hours, but that work is available and, for those who wanted to work, employers in the main are willing to give young people a go.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is really significant. These hundreds of young people believe that, if they have the right attitude and if they have a bit of skill training, they can find some meaningful employment—some employment in some field in the area in which they live. These young people universally said that they approved of the work for the dole scheme and that they thought it would help those who do not have work and depend on the public for their living  to have a better life, improve themselves, and understand better the nature of work, what it is all about and how they have to approach that work itself. There is no question whatsoever that anyone who has never worked cannot truly understand the nature of work.

         I recall back in March the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) was talking about the time when we had a system of on&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;job training in Australia. He was, in a sense, decrying the fact that that age had gone. I have no disagreement with the member for Curtin. I too might wish that that time was still here, but it is not. I might wish that the time when the majority of society was made up of what we now call nuclear families still continued and that the high divorce rates that we see today did not exist in our society, but wishing will not make it go away. The nature of work has changed. The nature of jobs has changed. The kinds of jobs that we have out there in real work have changed. All have changed and we have to learn to adapt, work and live with that.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The work for the dole scheme is not a panacea for  unemployment. It is not meant to be seen as giving young people the permanent kind of real employment that they need. It is seen as an opportunity to benefit those who do not have work and who need some work experience in order to be able to convince future real employers that they may be able to benefit their company, operation or business. That is certainly very positive. They will gain skills that help them better fit into society, to have meaningful lives; real work

         During committee travels over the last few weeks while parliament has not been sitting I have spoken to numbers of Aboriginals and others having to do with the CDEP scheme. That scheme, run by ATSIC, is for unemployed Aboriginals. It provides basically the same incentives as the bill we are talking about today will provide: work for two or three days proportionate to the amount of receipt of the dole. The people who accept the CDEP scheme—those Aboriginal young people and sometimes middle-aged people who work under that scheme—voluntarily give up their social security payments as the dole and instead they receive a payment for work that they do on that program.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The responses I had from people telling me about whether those programs worked or not differed depending on which Aboriginal community was talking about the program. Some were very positive. They said that the work they undertook involved good community development programs that helped the communities overall and that the young people developed a sense of worth and more of a sense of belonging to the community because they were contributing to the community. They had also developed some work skills and some understanding of what the world of work was like. Others were not so positive. They said that some of the jobs were a bit demeaning and sometimes they did not produce the outstanding results that appeared in other communities. But it is inevitable when programs are run that there are varying results depending on the area and depending on the people.

          —In supporting the amendment moved by the member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin) to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill 1997, the Labor Party recognises the serious problem of youth unemployment and the major
          <break page="3745" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           social consequences arising from this problem. However, we believe the government's proposal is, at best, a lazy one that has not been thought through. It is an unconsidered attempt to overcome this problem and I really believe that our young unemployed deserve better.

         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The proposal of the government is important in many ways as much for what it does not say as for what it does. Firstly, it is a clear indication that the government does not expect unemployment to drop significantly in the near future. This is understandable when you consider that the official unemployment figures had increased to 810,800 or 8.8 per cent of the work force in January of this year.  The figures for March and April were 8.7 per cent. But the important point is that full&amp;hyphen;time employment continues to decline.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The proposal is a panic move. As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) himself said during the election campaign:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         We do not support the introduction of a work for the dole scheme.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) also said some time back in 1995:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         There is no thought at all . . . of making any kind of work for the dole scheme a compulsory scheme.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         But that is what the government has done. As Alan Ramsey said in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Sydney Morning Herald
         </emphasis>
         of 22 March:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         And if the scheme is so popular, both with the community at large and young people themselves, why the necessity to legislate for compulsion? Why does the Government want the right to force people to work in what is supposed to be essentially a range of pilot programs if there are, as it claims, so many people willing to take part?
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         The second issue that this proposal tells us about the government is that there was no real program to get unemployed people back into the work force. Unlike what the Labor government achieved with its Working Nation program, which created over 739,000 jobs in the last three years of that government's term, the coalition government has responded to rising unemployment by ripping out $1.8 billion from labour market programs.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          Even the choice of the appropriate minister to run this program gives us an insight into the government's thinking. Senator Vanstone, who is the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and who administers what is left of labour market programs, has been overlooked. The junior minister, Dr Kemp—the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training—has been given the responsibility for running this program. I hope the relationship between schools and working for the dole is purely coincidental.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The third issue that arises out of this proposal is that it is award free. The minister, Dr Kemp, in his second reading speech, specifically said:

          No way. The government does not want these people covered by an award because this would allow these people to stand up for their rights. It might even get the trade union movement involved—and, clearly, the government would not want that to happen. Once again, I believe the coalition government is using the work for the dole scheme to condition people not to be too worried about award coverage when and if they enter the work force on a full&amp;hyphen;time basis.

          The fourth issue that causes me some concern in the proposal—it is not clearly spelt out—is whether people who are working for the dole will take the jobs of other people. This is a major problem. Unless the work involved is as menial as sweeping the footpath—and if that is the case, the proposal is a waste of time—and if there is any element of skill or value to the community, whether it be in tourism, environmental work, restoration work or a community service, there is an
          <break page="3746" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           important principle that should be followed; that is, this work should be carried out by people employed on a full&amp;hyphen;time basis under award conditions. This would enable unemployed people to have full&amp;hyphen;time jobs and some self&amp;hyphen;respect. It would take them off social security and make them self&amp;hyphen;respecting taxpayer members of the community.

          The fifth issue is the proposal that people work for the dole either two or 2&amp;half; days a week. This is a clear case of conditioning people for part&amp;hyphen;time work as a way of life. This is an attack on the working conditions of Australians. Job growth is in the part&amp;hyphen;time area, as we all know. In January there were 38,400 new jobs created: 35,000 of those were part time. The government is saying that if you work 20 hours you are considered as  being in full&amp;hyphen;time employment. Part&amp;hyphen;time employment means that working conditions that are so important to the blue&amp;hyphen;collar, middle&amp;hyphen;income and lower income people could well be lost. Very important conditions such as annual leave, long service leave, sick leave, maternity leave and compassionate leave will tend to drift into the past under the government's work for the dole proposal.

The third point is that participants must be guaranteed accredited on&amp;hyphen; or off&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;job training within the work activity.

            Another way to build upon young people's experience of part&amp;hyphen;time, casual and temporary work would be to recognise it better. The intention here should not be to build recognition around national competency standards that assume continuity of employment within a defined occupation or industry, for young people who spend significant periods of time on the margins of the labour market rarely spend continued periods of time in the same job. The intent should be to recognise basic employability attributes that are important in all work, rather than those competencies that are specific only to some forms of work, and by recognising them better, help to define and shape them in the minds of young people and of employers. Better recognition of the skills gained in part&amp;hyphen;time, casual and temporary work would also involve a much clearer documentation of the skills that young people acquire at particular work sites, and the building up of these, together with a record of progress in achieving key generic employability attributes, into a portfolio or skills record.

          —In early January, prior to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announcing the introduction of a work for the dole scheme, I floated the idea of a work for the dole scheme in my electorate of Capricornia whilst being interviewed by the leading
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Morning Bulletin
          </emphasis>
          news journalist, Mr Jason Purdie. The idea received front&amp;hyphen;page headlines and a lot of positive community reaction. I made the suggestion on the basis that if it was good enough for Aboriginal communities to work for the dole under the community development employment program, then it should be good enough for other recipients of unemployment benefits to work for the dole as well. While there are two sets of rules in this country—for black and white—the country will continue to be divisive.

        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We Australians live in a multicultural society. I do not care what is the land of your origin, the colour of your skin, the look of your face or the accent of your tongue. We all have a common goal—that is, to make Australia the best place on earth to live. The public reaction to the work for the dole scheme was mixed. But what most surprised me was the reaction from the young people in the community. Almost all of those who were approached by different sections of the media supported a concept of a working system for the dole.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When we floated the idea, we were approached straightaway by many different community service groups, like New Horizons and Centacare. When we looked at the scheme, we thought that maybe local councils should become involved in it. Basically we would have the mayors of each of the shires
         <break page="3749" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          on our board, particularly from places like Capricornia because there are so many shires within that electorate. The idea was to ensure that projects put forward for work for the dole recipients to do would not take work away from small business. As far as I can see, it is absolutely imperative that small business be looked after, particularly in respect of these schemes.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The scheme could go many different ways. Participants could help the elderly by mowing lawns, taking the elderly shopping and acting as carers, basically helping them to remain in their homes longer. Many of the elderly wish to stay at home and do not want to be put into nursing home centres and those sorts of things. They would love the opportunity to be able to stay at home. I am more than sure that, if implemented in the right way and with the right people with the right attitude, this could happen with the work for the dole scheme.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So, as far as that is concerned, I commend the young people in my electorate for this positive attitude in relation to their statements in the media on the work for the dole scheme. However, some of the older generation in the community did not agree that they should work for the dole, and some of them wrote to the local newspapers and telephoned my office to voice their protest. Most of these people were genuinely looking to find employment, but they could not find anything in their hunt for that elusive job. They want to continue to look for that job on a full&amp;hyphen;time basis.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am compassionate towards their point of view and I would much rather see people searching for a job on a full-time basis as long as they were actually doing something to ensure that they were going to get a job, and there are many different systems that we could implement. Therefore, before we impose the work for the dole requirement on people over the age of 21, I would like to see a set of standards imposed on claiming unemployment benefits and those who do not meet those standards can then be required to work for the dole. The sorts of standards I would look at are based on the number of jobs
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          applied for and, of course, interviews undertaken, particularly over a given time. We could evaluate this through the social security employment diary that was implemented by this good government in the past year.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is fair and reasonable that young Australians in receipt of the jobsearch allowance participate in approved work for the dole programs in return for such payments, especially until the job market picks up and there are more employment opportunities available. The reason I say that it is fair and reasonable to expect young people to work on these programs is that most of them have never had a job and have never paid tax. This means that they have not contributed to the welfare of this country, yet they expect to be supported by the government. I know there will be moans and groans out there from some parents that they have paid tax and contributed to welfare so the welfare system should look after their children, but in so many cases today we see the parents unemployed as well which causes an enormous drain on this country's finances.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I believe we should restrict unemployment benefits to young people under the age of 21. I believe we should institute a program that provides young people with a number of alternatives to unemployment benefits. They should be required either to have a job to go to, to attend a university or TAFE training, to go on the work for the dole scheme or—and I have floated this idea before and there are many people out there who agree with it—to go into a type of national service or, as some like to call it, boot camp.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We should be instilling in our young people, especially those still at school, that there will be no access to unemployment benefits until they have worked or paid tax for at least two years. This, I believe, will engender a different philosophical attitude among our young people. Currently they are being told by their teachers, parents or their mates, `If you can't get a job, go on the dole and the taxpayer will keep you.' That attitude must cease. It is creating a lethargic society of young people. They must learn that it is tough out there in the big wide world and that this world owes them nothing.

        <break page="3750" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          As far as I can see, they must get in there and have a go, put their best foot forward. They should be encouraged to stand up for themselves and make sure that this is the best way to go. I am sure that the young people will realise that they have to contribute to society rather than look for that inevitable handout. I am also sure that, when prospective employers start to search for new staff, those people who have been on the work for the dole scheme will be the sorts of people the employers want to pick up. Those people have a work ethic. Those students who have just left school want to have a go.

          I am a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training and we have spoken to many employers and youth groups. The employers have said, `If we're looking for an employee, we'll look for somebody who has probably done some time at McDonald's or somebody who has gone out there and had a go and done some part-time work.' This is indicative of the way the country is. Employers want young people who have a good attitude to work.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          A number of employers in my electorate have indicated to me that they would view someone who has been on this work for the dole scheme more favourably than someone who has been unemployed for 12 months or more. I am aware of some complaints that the work for the dole scheme does not provide these young people with job training and only treats them as slave labour. While the scheme is not meant to provide specific training needs, I am certain that any young person who volunteers for one of these programs will work better, particularly after getting a working education, than someone who has sat in front of the TV for so long.

           —Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Training is expensive. We have seen how much it can cost with the figures provided by the former government's new work opportunities scheme, which cost the princely sum of $143,000 per head to train people. For what? It was only to go back on the dole queue again. In most instances, the training they received was totally wasted. Sure, they learnt how to plant trees and lop branches and, as the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) promotes, the painting of rocks. You really must question his credibility. He attacks the government about putting forward a scheme that the majority of good Australians are calling for, but I am sure something could be arranged should the government make it an order of the day.

          Commenting again on Labor's new work opportunities scheme, what was the use of it all, especially when no level of government was increasing its work force in the parks and gardens area or employing more rangers to look after the environment? In fact, most levels of government were shedding staff. All we ended up with was a surplus of nurserymen and women that nobody wanted. What? For $143,000 a pop? You have to be kidding!

         Where has its genesis been? It has been in the polling which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Liberal Party have done. It is a phrase that resonates in the community and they think—as the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Marek), who has just scurried out of here, obviously believes—that all young people in Australia come home from school, sit around in front of the television and bludge off their parents. They think that, when young people leave school, they do not particularly want to get a job, instead they want to club in together, get a house somewhere, go to the beach all the time and just live off government welfare. As a consequence, work for the dole has been introduced as a concept which this government thinks is going to salve the economic ills of this country.

          Let us look at the reality of what is being proposed here, and it was even in the budget released earlier this week. Ten thousand pilot projects form the basis of this great bit of social revolution, this great centrepiece of economic fundamentalism in Australia—10,000 places. They are notionally targeted at young people but, even as admitted by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) himself, this could also apply to any age group within the broad Australian community. Whoopee&amp;hyphen;do. What about the other nearly 900,000 people out there who presently, not through circumstances of their own making, not through their own fault, are also looking for employment opportunities?

          We have had this government hell-bent on destroying anything that the Hawke-Keating governments put in place—whether it be in social security, whether it be in employment generation opportunities, whether it be in anything—simply because they want to extinguish from the landscape anything those former governments did. The honourable member for Capricornia talked about some of the One Nation programs and said, `They didn't do anything.'

          What is being proposed under this work for the dole scheme? My colleague the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) was talking about painting rocks and so on. In fact, that is exactly the sort of thing the Prime Minister used to refer to when talking about these schemes before he suddenly had some sort of Damascus like conversion to saying that this was what was needed. And why? Because it was simply a phrase that resonated out there in the community.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Suddenly, the Prime Minister jumped on the bandwagon—like he does with everything else he thinks is popular out there in the electorate. There was no leadership, no vision, no guidance from Australia's point of view. He said, `This is what we'll do. Here are 10,000 pilot projects. We'll give them a few dollars and get them out there in green corps or get them out there doing weed clearing somewhere.'

There is going to be no piece of paper saying these people were lucky enough to be part of the 10,000 out of the 900,000 unemployed. There is going to be no piece of paper to say they have some accreditation at the end of the scheme so they have something to set them up for life.

           I think this issue is a bit beyond the joke that it has turned out to be. What was the genesis of this little brainstorm that the government had? The genesis was that the Prime Minister turned up at the Channel 9 studios one Sunday to be interviewed by Laurie Oakes. The government was under a tad of strain at the time because one of its number in the Senate had been caught out. There was some concern about Senator Woods and what he was and was not doing and whom he was doing it with. As a conse quence, the Prime Minister decided he needed some sort of a circuit breaker. He needed to make some sort of an announcement just to try to get the heat off the government. What did he come up with? Work for the dole.

           on Monday 24 March 1997 by Glenn Milne under the headline `Work for dole plan hardly greeted with heavenly trumpets'. In this particular article, Milne goes through the circumstances of the scheme's genesis and talks about some views expressed by people and organisations that have delivered services to young unemployed and older unemployed for some time.

           He talks about the opinions of the Australian Youth Action Coalition, the Brotherhood of St Laurence, the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission, the Australian Council of Social Service and the Salvation Army. He talks about the Adelaide City Mission, the Australian Volunteers Association, the Sydney City Mission, the Open Family, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Australian Local Government Association. He talks about their views and he clearly indicates that these organisations—business and welfare organisations—were less than enamoured about the proposal. Having gone through and talked to all of these people, he says:

           So, to sum up: five of the most representative church and social welfare umbrella groups in the country—groups conceivably critical to work for the dole's success—have fundamental objections to the scheme. The remaining social welfare groups have reservations about the scheme's worth without real training.

           That is right. I think that the concept of having younger and older unemployed people involved in some sort of a scheme is not a difficult thing to grasp. We did it under One Nation; we did it under Working Nation. But we included the training component with it. What is the point in simply putting people for six or 12 months on some sort of task which has been ill&amp;hyphen;defined so far and then at the end of the day not having them trained in some way to be available to be taken on as `real employees' in—to use that dreadful term—

           People talk about part&amp;hyphen;time jobs in a derisory fashion. They say that part&amp;hyphen;time jobs are no good, and that everybody wants a full&amp;hyphen;time job. Well, people do not! I am sure a majority of people in the community want a full&amp;hyphen;time job—and that is right. We all in this place should be striving to achieve that by economic policies that will see this country continue to grow. But there are other people who want part&amp;hyphen;time jobs, so they should not be put down. They should not be simply dismissed out of hand and told, `You are some underclass; you have a part&amp;hyphen;time job; you should not really be doing that; you should be striving for a full&amp;hyphen;time job.' Parental responsibilities in some cases cannot allow that, so you do not put those people down. The Glenn Milne article goes on to say:

           I think that is dead right. We on this side have tried to take a reasonable approach to this. We have actually moved a second reading amendment, not declining to give the bill a second reading in this House but having made some positive contributions to the debate. We have pointed out the training issue. There is a need for training for people—there is no question of that.

           Recent statistics indicate that people now change employment three times in their lifetime. At each of those occasions, they have to go through some reskilling, retooling and retraining. This program being advocated by this government does not even give them

            the first step, the first leg up to something which is as important as training. Australia has passed into this incredible technological society as we lead into the next century.

           If we are going to look at the concept of work into the next century, we have to change some of our more traditional views of what that means. It is not simply going to work from nine to five and doing a variety of tasks. We have to harness that technology and we have to make it work for us so that we make work for us, and that is an important element in any discussion here. We also need this two&amp;hyphen;way commitment, this reciprocity.

           I have heard coalition speaker after coalition speaker advocate that when we had some form of social security system in place, when we were in government, there was no reciprocity, there was no commitment on behalf of the recipients of social security benefits to give something back. That simply was not true. If people were not actively looking for meaningful employment, if people were not out there actually being case managed by people if they were longer term unemployed, their benefits were reduced or cut. There was reciprocity there. It was not the television syndrome that the member for Capricornia referred to. There was reciprocity and that is why it is an important element in any scheme of this nature. It is something that has to be really borne in mind.

           At the end of the day, we should not be debating these pilot programs that are bandaid solutions to the more fundamental problem in Australia. Both sides of this parliament should be embracing an appropriate industry policy with two pinnacles: education and R&amp;D. In the last 14 months since this government has been in government, it has cut R&amp;D funding by $2 billion. You talk to any overseas country—any of the Asian tigers. Why do they have the substantial growth rates that they do? Because their governments know that they have to invest in those twin reasons, education and R&amp;D, to stimulate their economies. If you look at Malaysia, Singapore or

            any of those Asian tigers, it is in R&amp;D and education that investment is being made. For some unknown reason, this government in this country has decided that we do not need to do that. It is called business welfare.

           It is not business welfare; it is national welfare. It is something which will assist industries promote new job opportunities to take up the slack that exists now from some of the industries which have more traditionally provided employment opportunities. I will give an example from my own electorate of Wollongong—and I have referred to BHP in a similar way before: in 1983, 26,000 people were directly employed at BHP; now, 6,800, and about to become about 5,000, yet productivity has gone through the roof. The steel industry is working effectively in the port of Port Kembla and in Wollongong more generally. The reason they have increased productivity is the investment of about $3 billion worth of high technology in that steel plant.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           That illustrates the difficulty for a region like the Illawarra. How do we offset those job losses yet at the same time recognise that heavy industry is still prospering and productivity is high? We have to look for something different. That is why the Illawarra Regional Economic Development Organisation two  weeks ago released a new economic strategy, a blueprint, a business plan, for the Illawarra. It talked about these sorts of things and the need for R&amp;D and education as fundamental rights of people in Australia.

           Regrettably, this work for the dole scheme skirts all of that. It is a bandaid solution. It does not meet the needs of this country. It does not meet the need for a meaningful industry policy. It does not do anything for education. It does nothing for R&amp;D. It gives young unemployed people and older unemployed people, of 40 years plus, no security in life. It does not give them any horizon or any vision because, regrettably, this weak Prime Minister, this weak leader, has no vision, has no philosophy, for where we should be going, and that is an absolute disgrace.

         The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill sets out the amendments required to implement the popular work for the dole program. I know it is popular in Townsville because I have asked many of my Townsville constituents how they feel about this initiative. I can report to the House that it is widely accepted and warmly endorsed. The Townsville community supports both the philosophy and the intent behind this initiative.

         Earlier this year I held a public forum in Townsville. More than 130 people attended that meeting. On top of discussing a range of popular issues at the time—the Wik decision, euthanasia, crime, law and order, and so on—I specifically raised the issue of work for the dole. The feedback I received was that Townsville people are overwhelmingly in favour of the government implementing a work for the dole scheme.

         Might I also add that the people who attended and supported the concept believed the government had not gone far enough and that we should be introducing a far more stringent work for the dole program than is being proposed. There was great interest in and popular support for reintroducing some form of national service. Interestingly enough, this particular concept came predominantly from the younger people at the Townsville meeting. I personally have reservations about this. Yes, it might help instil discipline and drive in our young people, but the Australian Defence Force is not a social security safety net. If young people want to do part&amp;hyphen;time military service, then they should inquire about joining the reserves.

          My office started to receive initial calls from people about the work for the dole concept immediately after the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announced the program. From there the level of interest has grown remarkably. While project submissions will not be sought until early June, the number of individuals and organisations already approaching my office with ideas about community projects indicates there is a high level of interest in the program in Townsville. I can only say that Townsville will put up such quality projects that I expect we will receive two pilot programs instead of one.

Mr Deputy Speaker, I would not be surprised if it were even higher than that in some parts of Australia. Indeed, at that last Townsville community forum I held, as a straw poll I asked for a show of hands from those people who supported the idea of work for the dole. About 75 per cent of more than 130 people who attended said they supported the concept of work for the dole.

           Many different ideas for projects were floated at that meeting, including linking bike paths throughout Townsville and Thuringowa, and house renovation and maintenance work for elderly and impaired citizens—very worthwhile projects indeed. Other people have suggested local environment projects such as erosion control for Townsville's northern beaches and the eradication of noxious weeds like lantana. All these ideas are worthy of development by the community groups who suggested them and of consideration for adoption by the government.

          —The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill has been put forward, as some of those in the government say, not as a response to solve the problem of youth unemployment. They have said that bluntly and frankly and they are correct. The truth is that it is not an answer to youth unemployment; it is simply a political positioning of this government responding to the natural and legitimate concern that they are hearing from all around Australia, particularly in regional and rural Australia, about the crisis that we face in being able to provide jobs for young Australians. They have put something up that will distract attention from the real issues and which has some superficial, glib coverage of support across the community.

          I am not at all critical of those who support the idea of asking people who have been unemployed for a substantial period to make a contribution. There is a legitimate basis for building a system around the idea of mutual obligation. You would think that this government was the first to discover that idea. But in fact that was the whole idea behind the Working Nation scheme. What we did in government, when we were aware of exactly the same sense of need within the Australian community, was to devise a national scheme that applied to everyone so that no Australian who was out of work for a period of longer than two years would be left without the opportunity and the requirement to undertake work training programs of a substantial nature which would lead them to be better job ready.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Those kinds of training programs, work generating programs, were in place and were cut by this government in its first budget. That is a national tragedy, because we were not talking about 10,000 people who were going to be singled out for a special program, after which they would not have improved their work related skills at all. We were talking about every Australian, whatever their age, who had been out of work for two years. It was not a voluntary scheme. It was not a scheme that relied on the goodwill of those who were unemployed for that period. What occurred under the Labor Working Nation initiatives was that, once a person reached that benchmark to maintain access to benefits, they had to undertake those training programs.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There was a direct relationship between the recipient of future ongoing benefits with willingness to improve their work related skills, to undertake training programs and to be involved in initiatives that would improve the community. All Australians who found themselves in that situation were the beneficiaries of that program. When this government came to office, what did it do? The biggest budget reduction across programs was in exactly those training related programs, in exactly those programs which did impose mutual obligation.

           There is basically nothing that gives hope to a person who is long-term unemployed. A long-term unemployed person can face for years the prospect that they will not be given the resources and the opportunities to get back into the workplace and that their skills base will not be increased. It is certainly true that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) has introduced some smaller programs of a significantly diminished nature which the government represents as being equivalent to those which they replaced. But you just have to look at the dollar figures to realise what a complete fraud and what a complete hoax that proposition is.

           They have replaced programs that were extended to all with programs that will extend to few.

To cover the deficiency and to cover the fact that everybody would have correctly identified as a moral failure of government leaving people long-term unemployed without improving their resources and without making them job ready, they came up with the idea that you could get some words that would appeal to and resonate with the Australian public—as if they were doing something. It would be cheap and it would not apply to many Australians. But you could go out and say, `We've introduced a new program that most Australians will support.' They called it work for the dole.

Certainly, they feel that in relation to other kids in the street. It is a pretty normal, expected and predictable human reaction.

This government has singularly failed to do the job. Not only has it singularly failed to do the job with respect to those people who are long-term unemployed, but it is also actually increasing the number of people in that predicament.

That is what we have got here—a cheap, down and dirty solution not addressing the structural issues that this economy has generated, not doing what is required to extend the program across the whole of the community, but looking to respond to the natural and legitimate concerns of parents about the future of their kids and elderly people about where they are going in the future with a program that is simply designed to be a fig leaf to hide the underlying realities.

It should do something for the 40-year-olds who are facing insecurity in the employment market. It should do something for people across Australia and not just wave a rhetorical flag symbolically in order to distract attention from the crucial issues which should be at the heart of Australia's national policy making.

          Richmond/Tweed/ Mid North Coast, unfortunately, has one of the highest levels of regional unemployment in Australia. The most recent ABS figure was 13.3 per cent—the third highest in the state. However, I suppose it is pleasing to note that the unemployment rate has been starting to come down since September, at 16.7 per cent, and in October last year, 16.9 per cent. The DSS figures also indicate that the unemployment level is levelling out with newstart. In the last month it totalled 51,081, compared with 54,000 in January and 53,000 in March.

         Similar schemes were proposed by the Hawke Labor government and also came through in the Fightback document of the Liberal and National parties in 1991, but none were implemented. One project which has been implemented, a work for the dole program which has been continually in operation since 1977, has been the community development employment program—better known as CDEP—which enables Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to engage in community projects instead of receiving unemployment benefits. ATSIC pays these grants which are equal to the dole, plus oncosts and capital support. This has worked exceptionally well in these communities, particularly in my area at Cabbage Tree Island where, if it wasn't for the CDEP program, unemployment rates in these communities would be well over 90 per cent.

         When you look at other countries, even in the last more notable British campaign the Tories and Labour both had what they called a `workfare' plan—work for welfare. The Tories workfare pilot gave long&amp;hyphen;term jobless 13 weeks help in finding a job. If the search was unsuccessful, 13 weeks of compulsory work followed. If the unemployed person refused to search for a job or take a compulsory one, their unemployment benefits would cease. The result of the pilot studies was that many people stopped claiming benefits once presented with these alternatives.

         Tony Blair has a workfare concept as well, under which he plans to offer around 200,000 people under the age of 25 and jobless a six&amp;hyphen;month scheme offering a number of options, which is very similar to our work for the dole scheme. If you look at the United States, their welfare&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;work program as part of their job opportunities and basic skills program has worked very well in a number of states. In Iowa, a family investment program requires

         I think it is important to look at the coalition's wider perspectives in creating employment. One of them is the jobs pathway program, which will act in tandem with the work for the dole and acts as a bridge for students at their most vulnerable time—when they leave school. By providing a direct link from school straight into work, this government wants to stop unemployment before it begins. The new apprenticeship scheme is another example of a government which is recognising and responding to the needs of the labour market. Under the previous government, apprenticeship levels fell to the lowest level in 30 years. Taking on apprentices was overly bureaucratic and dominated by the Trades and Labour Council, which did not encourage apprenticeships in growth industries, resulting in a lack of skilled workers in some of the most rapidly emerging industries.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Under this government, there will be substantial benefits given to take on traineeships. Over $265 million is included in this budget for over 100,000 new apprenticeships. Isn't it better to give people something longer than just a labour market program, where, after a number of years, they walk away with a trade and a skill? This is certainly encouraged by the 7,000 small business operators in the areas I represent—Tweed, Ballina, Murwillumbah and Byron Bay. The national apprenticeship scheme will provide a means to employ them, to put on a trainee.

         The other area of expenditure in this budget geared towards providing skills for our young people to get better employment is $1.3 billion going to vocational training—the amount of money going into TAFE—and, most importantly, the amount of money going back into education for the improvement of literacy skills, to give young people the basic life skills so that they can go out into the labour market, be attractive and be taken up. This was not recognised by the previous government.

          Another area is the small business package. This should not be underestimated. Over the last 12 months, the removal of the unfair dismissal law, the changes in the capital gains tax and the cutting back on red tape have provided an impetus for small businesses to take on someone.

          Seeing that we have had some comments from the ALP, I would like to look back at the ALP's track record on their labour market programs. When Working Nation was introduced—and perhaps it was introduced with the best intent—in the six years from July 1990 to March 1996 Labor's policies added only 7,100 additional full&amp;hyphen;time jobs. One particular DEETYA report on labour market programs found that programs like the new work opportunities program effectively resulted in four per cent of participants gaining work, at a cost of $143,000 for each additional job. That record is disgraceful, and I am curious that these sorts of figures were not published by the department. Surely DEETYA were doing this kind of research when the ALP were in power. Did previous ALP DEETYA ministers, including Kim Beazley, simply ignore the research of their own department?

          The work for the dole budget in 1997 is an allocation of $21.6 million. There is $15.5 million for up to 70 community based pilot projects for 10,000 participants throughout Australia for 12 months. The remaining $6.1 million will cover administration, monitoring and assessment of the initiative. The $15.5 million includes $12.4 million to community organisations to run the projects, around $520,000 for child-care costs for participants and over $2.5 million for that extra $10 a week for travelling expenses to allow those unemployed people to actually get to their project.

          The last point I would like to touch on is youth suicide, which should be bipartisan and go beyond the politics that happen in this chamber and the other chamber. Unemployment is seen as one of the major factors contributing to the shameful level of youth suicide. In 1993 our youth suicide rate per 100,000 was 23.7 for males and 3.7 for females. This level is amongst the world's worst and is simply unacceptable. By giving young people something worth while to do with their time—it is not seen as a panacea—the work for the dole scheme may just break that unemployment cycle. Unemployment goes hand in hand with loss of self&amp;hyphen;esteem and of motivation and often leads to high levels of depression and family break&amp;hyphen;ups.

          In conclusion, the work for the dole scheme is a positive initiative. It goes hand in glove with the other government programs for addressing unemployment. Traineeships get a massive boost. This gets away from the six&amp;hyphen;month programs which dominated the previous government's approach. Policies to assist small business—theirs is still a waiting game—will make them feel more confident so that they can put on more staff, not fearful of draconian industrial legislation and able to have the benefit of making some profit. Other areas addressed include vocational training, education, better life skills and, of course, overall having better fiscal management of the country to allow the private sector to flourish so that it can start to tackle that enormous social problem—it is not just an economic problem—of unemployment. I commend the bill to the House.

What happened to the quest for real, meaningful, sustainable jobs? Mr Deputy Speaker, I think you would allow me to put this in the context of the opening week of this session, where on Tuesday night we saw the bringing down of the government's budget. Even more, that question should be emphasised: what has happened to the quest for real jobs?

         An analysis of the forecasts within the budget brought down by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on Tuesday night shows that at the end of the next financial year the government expects unemployment to be at a level of eight per cent. If we look at their forecasts for  the present financial year, one has to doubt their ability to correctly forecast the figure at the end of next financial year, because at the time of the budget last August the prediction was that unemployment would track down to a level of 8.25 per cent. This was subsequently amended by the Treasurer to a level of 8.5
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          per cent. What is the level of unemployment in Australia at the moment? It is 8.7 per cent. So can we realistically depend on the types of forecasts that are contained in the budget?

         In a more real sense, if we look at the context of this piece of legislation, in the explanatory memorandum it correctly says that this legislation grew out of an announcement by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in February this year. The announcement was made on a television show at a time when the government was receiving great criticism about the behaviour of senior members of the government. It was seen, I think quite correctly, as a decision that was put forward as a distraction to the real issues that obtained at that time and, in a way, continue to obtain now.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is typical of the `developing' nature of the policies being made by this government: it is an illustration of a decision being made on the run. Somebody's good idea was plucked from thin air, announced outside of this place and then the Prime Minister asked his ministers to rush off and try to figure out how these things could be put into place. It was an idea that was not thought through and an idea without much substance.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Regrettably, this is not the only example that we have of this type of policy decision making on the run. A number of the decisions made in the areas of employment and labour market programs are of the same ilk. During the non&amp;hyphen;sitting period between these two sessions we had the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) deciding that it might be a good idea to reward schools for placing people into jobs. These claims were made on the basis of some of the work done under the pathways program at a school somewhere in Queensland that they think is a great idea. But it does not seem to underscore and acknowledge the work that schools, through careers teachers, already do. It does not acknowledge that the schools did that with the cooperation of the Commonwealth Employment Service. It does not acknowledge that the real need to even be suggesting such a scheme is because the CES is to be abolished. Again, it was something that was plucked out of the air—a decision
         <break page="3764" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          apparently made on the run. Regrettably, these ideas are strewn like confetti across the political landscape, where there appears to be little thought.

         Yesterday—and I acknowledge this is an unrelated matter—we had the Prime Minister developing a position on the run about the optional nature, perhaps, of the taxation rebate on savings. I offer that as an illustration of the way in which either in real terms—and that is the position I am putting—but, at the most charitable, in the perception stakes, this government appears to be continuing to make policies on the run. Perhaps these are somebody's ideas that occur to them in the morning when they get up, before they sit down to brekkie. Whatever the case, the policies are not based on thinking both the issues and the outcomes through.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In this case, we have a piece of legislation which, right from the title of the bill, sets the scene and the flavour for the legislation. We have a government that, in opposition, continually denigrated the programs that we had under Working Nation, such as LEAP, because they would supposedly not provide real jobs. We were told that it was unfair on the unemployed to have them participating in these schemes because, under some definition, the then opposition and now government felt they were not meaningful. What happens? The government is elected and Working Nation is smashed, not for any real reason bar the underlying ideological preferences of the government.

         Now they sit there and chant the mantra, `Let the marketplace create jobs. Let the unemployed look after themselves.' Indeed, this seems to exemplify the overall thinking of the government. Take a look at this week's budget. There is not too much, just a few smokescreens that try to attract a few headlines because of superficial criticism. Now, a couple of days later when there is detailed  analysis of these policies, everything is falling apart. At least we are seeing some fair dinkum criticism of this year's budget, unlike the way the media, in a flim&amp;hyphen;flam way, looked at last year's budget.

We know that they recognise that they have failed because one of the best things they have to offer—well, they claim it is a good thing—is this piece of legislation. Even before their much heralded employment service market has been put out to tender, they know they have failed and they have had to come up with something else to be seen to be doing something for the unemployed. What they have done with this piece of legislation tells us a lot about them and the mealy&amp;hyphen;mouthed ideas that fill their heads.

          Instead of reintroducing labour market programs to provide the unemployed with training and support while they get work experience, now the unemployed are to be dragooned into a scheme that simply requires them to work. This is clothed in the language of reciprocal obligation; but, of course, this is a deliberate con. No&amp;hyphen;one in the opposition is against the idea of reciprocal obligation; Working Nation was based on the idea of reciprocal obligation. But, while borrowing the language of reciprocal obligation in Working Nation, this scheme is based on a far more pernicious concept—punishment.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Whilst I acknowledge the comments of the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) in concluding his speech, when he talked about youth suicide and the fact that employment brings young people a degree of much needed self&amp;hyphen;esteem, the negative nature of this program is not the type of signal that should be sent out to young people. It is not a matter of saying to the unemployed, `If we train you, give you work experience and assist you in identifying a vacancy then you have a reciprocal obligation to take that vacancy.'
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          That was the core of Working Nation—the notion that each party to the job compact had obligations. This program is about saying to unemployed youth, `You owe us. To receive your income support from the social security system you must earn it. Our only obligation as a nation is to pay you. We don't owe you
          <break page="3765" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           a real job. We don't owe you training and job search assistance and other support which has been part of our social security net for many years. You, the unemployed, owe us.'

         <para first-indent="16">
          This is a fundamental shift in social policy in this country. It is a change from the notion that income support is owed by society to individuals as compensation for the failure of the labour market to the notion that individuals owe a debt to society for income received during the time that they are unemployed.

          I acknowledge that this might have some short&amp;hyphen;term appeal to the pollsters; it might have appeal to the Ray Martin set. But this decision will come back to haunt this government. It is appalling that a term that carries with it such negative and derogatory connotations as `dole' should actually be included in the title of the legislation. What signal does it really send out to the people that are on unemployment benefits? More than anything else, this reveals the agenda for the government: we cannot fix unemployment so we will blame the victims, stigmatise the unemployed.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The one small positive thing to emerge from this shabby debate is that it puts into perspective how pitiful the level of income support is if it can be worked out in only 15 hours. The opposition has an 11-point plan which details the minimum criteria for acceptable labour market programs. The first and most important of these points is that no scheme should displace the jobs of existing workers.

          Sadly, many unscrupulous employers may seek to take advantage of the government's proposal unless adequate safeguards are in place. In fact, the day after the Prime Minister made his work for the dole announcement—done without the knowledge of appropriate ministers—anecdotal evidence from my electorate suggested that some employers were already intending rorts. My office told me of an example of a factory owner who said, `I'm not putting anybody on. I'm going  to sack 10 and put on 16 from the work for the dole scheme.'

The government must ensure that employers do not act to dismiss people on the false premise that they can get a couple of young unemployed kids to do their jobs. Yet, there is nothing in the second reading speech of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training to indicate that this type of rort will be prevented.

          Other points in the opposition's criteria include the provision of training in any of these schemes. This legislation provides no obligation on the part of any prospective employer to provide those in his or her charge with on- or off-the-job training. The government attacked Working Nation labour market programs on the basis that they did not lead to real jobs but simply churned unemployed people from training scheme to training scheme.

         <para first-indent="16">
          But what does the work for the dole scheme do? It does not even ensure that participants learn anything during their time on the program. Whilst it heralds that they will learn a form of work ethic in that they will have to turn up, some of these people, especially as they will be people unemployed for over six months, need a lot of support in the run-up to them being able to develop that work ethic.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This scheme is simply about filling in the unemployed person's time on the grounds that they owe the government for their unemployment benefits and should be punished accordingly. It does not ensure that there will be jobs available at the end of the scheme for those who have participated in it. Therefore, the opposition has called upon the government that in this work for the dole program the government force participating organisations to state up&amp;hyphen;front the proportion of participants who will receive permanent employment after the placement. Any further contracts with the government to provide services under the scheme should only be based on the participating organisation's performance against this figure.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Another worrying feature of the proposed scheme is that the relationship between the unemployed participant and the participating organisations is not clearly defined. What
          <break page="3766" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           arrangements are in place with regard to safety standards, superannuation or industrial relations? If this is to be fair dinkum work experience, those matters have to be addressed. Yet, the participants are to be exempted from all of these requirements of this type of legislation. Perhaps the most damaging comment about the work for the dole scheme comes from the minister's own second reading speech, in which he said:

          What a damning indictment of this whole sorry episode.

By his own words, the minister confirms the suspicion that this scheme is all about punishing the unemployed for being unemployed. It is not about jobs for the unemployed.

          I wish to raise on that point one of the farragoes that surrounds the Green Corps program. During the election campaign, this was offered as something that was to be aimed at providing labour market programs for unemployed youth. But that has now been denied and we are told that Green Corps is an environmental program. In conclusion, I suggest that members of the House look at the budget related paper to do with the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs where, under student youth support, it says that the Green Corps programs involve young people in protecting and restoring Australia's natural heritage. But it is under the heading of a support scheme as a labour market program.

As all members in this chamber know, I have a high regard for the member for Scullin, as I believe most members do. But he drew a very long bow in his introductory remarks when he suggested that we should question the whole work for the dole proposal on the basis of the statistics run in Tuesday night's budget.

         The member for Scullin was critical of all statisticians on the grounds that a difference between an 8.7 per cent and 8.5 per cent projected unemployment rate somehow indicated a remarkably loose use of figures. What the chamber should be considering is this underlying truth about unemployment: the figure of 8.7 per cent is better than once it was and if the  Treasurer (Mr Costello) is right and the government achieves an eight per cent figure—not all that remarkable—it will be the best figure, albeit, I freely concede to the member for Scullin, not good enough, since 1990. That is the best figure after six years of the previous government's various job creation schemes.

         So, far from being critical of the work for the dole proposal, the opposition ought to see this proposal for just what it is. Opposition speakers have suggested that this was the only suggestion that this government was offering to the unemployed, that this was the only technique that we had to help people back into the work force. Instead of that, it is one of a segment of ideas that we are putting to the unemployed.

         The real solution to unemployment, as parliamentary members—not government or opposition—know, is the creation of what the member for Scullin has called `real jobs', a term somewhat derisively observed by the member for Denison (Mr Kerr), as the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) was here to attest. But I pick up the member for Scullin's term. I know what he means by `real jobs' and I know what I mean by `real jobs'. I know that real jobs are created when the marketplace believes there is an opportunity to employ people and to employ them productively. So the obligation the parliament has is to cultivate a marketplace that will put on people in order to be more productive. Frank

         The member for Denison had much to say, much of it critical, about all of the government's proposals. He said, `Look at all of the cuts that the Howard government has made.'

         The reality, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you well know, is that all of the cuts that the Howard government has been forced to make it has been forced to make because of the budget deficit. The Treasurer has every right to be proud of the fact that in one term he will have taken a budget deficit of $10 billion—I am the first to concede, should the member for Scullin want some reassurance, that it is not the first time that there has been a budget deficit—and turn it into a budget surplus. That is good news for the unemployed, but it is not the impression you get from opposition members participating in this debate. All of the cuts that have occurred have occurred in order to generate a budget surplus, because the alternative to that was to jack up income tax, payroll tax, company tax, excise and other rates, which would, of course, be further damaging to economic recovery.

         There was once—and I know very little about it—a philosophy around called the Protestant work ethic. There was this understanding that because people had not been asked to be born and discovered themselves here with various talents, they wanted an opportunity to use those talents as part of a community. That is roughly my understanding of the Protestant work ethic.

         Previous speakers have also made much of what they have seen as the work for the dole scheme: simply getting people involved in menial tasks. As most people in the parliament know after 14 years, before coming into this place I employed people in menial tasks, principally fruit picking. If there is one thing that I really resent participating in debate in this chamber it is the emphasis on so-called menial tasks, as if to be the cleaner in the House of Representatives was some task that ought to be dismissed relative to being a member. The facts are that we need Australians who discover how menial tasks, so-called—as I said, I am dismissive of the term—can be rewarding and how there is an opportunity to feel that the skills and the

To pick up the concluding remarks of the member for Richmond (Mr Anthony), it is a scheme that allows young people to feel a greater sense of self&amp;hyphen;esteem because they have a role in the community, and the tragedy of youth suicide is best addressed by allowing young people to feel that they have a role and that they are needed and wanted by the community at large. Far from being dismissive of the scheme, we ought to be giving it a shot, because nothing else has worked thus far.

I will pick up a couple of the points made by my colleague opposite, the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew). He said that working for the dole is popular. I, for one, would not contest that, but the better question to ask the people of Australia is: do you think that every Australian who wants to should be able to have meaningful work? I think we would get an overwhelmingly strong and positive answer to that. Neither the previous government nor the current government—perhaps much less, the current government—has been able to fulfil that overwhelming desire for work for all Australians, particularly those who are unemployed.

          It was interesting that at the last election the Labor government—and you would expect that of the Australian Labor Party—was concerned to get unemployment down. We did something that was perhaps foolish for a government to do. We said that, by the year 2000, we believed we could get unemployment down to five per cent. I say it was foolish because, whenever governments set a target, if they meet the target, people say that it was probably too easy; if they exceed it, they say it was certainly too easy; and if they fail, then they say it is just another failure of government. However, in government, like any other form of organisational activity, we need to set targets.

Mr Deputy Speaker, I need to remind you and the government that one of the first actions of the Howard government was actually to cut out funding for 117,000 training positions for the unemployed.

The modern dilemma that we have in Australia—and in fact in other economies—is that, if you do not do anything, particularly with the long&amp;hyphen;term unemployed, you will have an overhang of long&amp;hyphen;term unemployed. As your economy picks up, you will pick up the new school leavers and those re&amp;hyphen;entering the work force but you will also have an overhang of long&amp;hyphen;term unemployed.

It puts them at least almost on a par with other people in the community.

We in this illustrious chamber, the House of Representatives of the Australian parliament, have not been through that frustration.

How do 10,000 of these jobs stack up against the 117,000 positions that the Howard government has already cut out of the training programs that we had in place? Unfortunately, the scheme does not necessarily mean that any one of those 10,000 is actually going to be more job ready. Yes, there is the discipline of getting up and, yes, there is the motivation associated with the work—there are those pluses—but, unlike a training program, it is not going to get any of them more job ready.

            in investment, in industry policy, in encouraging job growth and in having the reduction of unemployment as a very high priority in society, need to come to grips with whatever the percentage is who will remain unemployed, whether it is three per cent, four per cent or five per cent. Whatever the percentage is, these people should not be considered to be second-class Australians. These people are entitled, as I am, and as you are, Mr Deputy Speaker, to the notion of self-esteem, self-worth, dignity and being meaningfully involved in our society. The Labor Party in that regard still has a long way to go to deal with that issue.

          —I wish to participate in this debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill. However, before I do so I must say that it was interesting to hear the member for Chifley (Mr Price) say they were well on the way to developing a policy to help the unemployed. They had 13 years to do it!

         I heard this morning the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), who is currently leaving the chamber, say that this work for the dole scheme is nothing but a bandaid solution. That means, to me, that all the programs of the previous government, over their years on the government benches, could not come to grips with the problem. Maybe one could say that the bandaid solutions were simply theirs. What we are seeing here today, and what we are debating in this legislation for work for the dole, is not a bandaid solution. It is a real solution.

         I am surprised that the opposition derides the work for the dole scheme. The feedback I have had from my electorate indicates that it certainly has the community's support.

         I believe one of the most devastating results of unemployment is the loss of the work ethic. We are now seeing a phenomenon of young adults who left school, went straight on the dole and have never worked. They have
         <break page="3772" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          no work ethic to even relate to. This, I believe, is the direct legacy of Labor's social program which created a welfare culture and a generation of Australians who have been socially manipulated to their detriment. We know that not only do long periods of unemployment lead to a loss of motivation and a desire to seek work but vital training time is also lost.

         A cry I hear often from young adults is that employers offer jobs for which they do not have the skills. There is no doubt that the unskilled labour market is shrinking. But this does not mean that the job market is shrinking; it means that it is changing form. We cannot hope to compete with the cheap labour force available in other parts of the world, but we can compete in other growing markets, such as technology, science and the service industries. Today, for the first time, companies are including in their assets the skills of their individual employees. They are no longer looking at staff as a necessary adjunct of business but as the vital core of their business.

         Young people play a vital role in our work force, but I believe we must redirect their focus. For example, let us consider the ordinary, everyday work skill of typing. Once, only young women learned to type and typing skills led them into the work force as receptionists, clerks and secretaries. Typing was a vital skill for women. I can remember when a young man was considered a bit sissy if he took up typing. Today, touch&amp;hyphen;typing skills are just as necessary for men and women, and computer technology means efficient typing skills are necessary at both junior and senior levels.

         Just as learning to touch&amp;hyphen;type is not a difficult task, neither is learning a computer program. No longer does the ability to type place a worker straight into the old typing pool or at the reception desk but into all aspects of business and trade. I believe it is vital that we get young people out of the mind&amp;hyphen;set that women type and men drive trucks. Their skills and potential skills might not be evident, not even to themselves. Therefore, programs such as work for the dole are a way to enforce this awareness.

          Our young people have been deceived for more than a decade by a Labor government that created training programs which did not lead to jobs. Instead, most led straight back to the dole queue. Young people believe the previous government was concerned, but the figures show only a facade, even worse—a farce.

          We are creating systems which prove there are jobs for young people. The school to work program has already shown that it can be done. Working on the principle that schools are well placed to build a bridge for students from the classroom to the work force, a pilot program was established in my city of Brisbane. The first results have been more than impressive. Both Marsden and Acacia Ridge state high schools bid for the government contract to find jobs for their school leavers. Since January, Marsden has found work for 147 teenagers and Acacia Ridge, which came into the program a little later, has already placed 30 students in jobs.

          So much for Peter Baldwin's statement to the House in March that work for the dole was a `pathetic mickey mouse scheme'. We have already shown it is possible to break the start of that deadly pattern of classroom to the dole queue. We are doing what the opposition said was not possible under our programs: we are already putting young people in jobs. Our jobs pathway strategy does not start and end with work for the dole or the school to work program. While both break the system of leave school, go on the dole, do a training course, go back on the dole, they are just the beginning.

          A decade ago I would have considered it unusual to be talking with young adults of 26 years of age who have never had a long&amp;hyphen;term full&amp;hyphen;time job, let alone a couple with a newborn baby. This couple, whom I know well, both live on government welfare, and neither have ever seriously considered seeking anything other than part&amp;hyphen;time work. Now in their mid&amp;hyphen;20s, it is doubtful they realise just how many years of vital training they have lost. We know, with the benefit of hindsight, it is unlikely they will be taken seriously by an employer looking for senior staff. These young adults are not lazy, nor do they enjoy living on the dole. But their lifestyle has developed to include a great deal of leisure time and the pursuit of hobbies which they find emotionally and physically fulfilling and rewarding. It is not surprising at their age when they apply for jobs that the salary, commensurate with their skills or their limited range of skills, is geared for a jobstarter not a mature age adult.

          It is like trying to teach an adult to read using kindergarten primers. Boredom tends to set in quickly and job changing has become the career path of the young. Therefore, I believe any scheme or program which gives the unemployed the chance to gain from constructive effort is of great value. The work for the dole scheme is one such scheme. With wise placement, young people will find themselves working in fields they may never have considered a potential career path—the environment, for example. This is an area which has been erroneously considered the domain of the greenies. The environment, which has many facets, is an industry where many specialists work alongside community groups.

          The work the for dole program has been carefully considered. The ultimate aim is employment for young people. The previous government said a great deal and congratulated itself on programs while more and more young people fell by the wayside. This government recognises the need to change the way we as a society must act to help those who have difficulty in finding work. Work for the dole is a positive part of our jobs pathway. Work for the dole is just one step and leads ultimately to an improved apprenticeship or job training system. As it is an active work program, any participant who has a child or children will be able to place that child in government funded care.

          I support this bill because I know it is imperative we remind our young people that they are of value. We need to remind them that they are a vital part of our community, help them become an integral part of a team and, ultimately, assist them acquire skills which they can utilise in the workplace. Voltaire summed up the situation in one sentence: `Work keeps at bay three great evils, boredom, vice and need.' Australia will be an even greater country when we see our young people off the dole queues and living fulfilling lives. This is just one reason why I give this bill my wholehearted support.

          —At the outset, let me say that I believe the subtitle of this particular piece of legislation—work for the dole—is highly derogatory. It is a name that we have given something which is trying to arrest a problem that I do not believe that either party has got a handle on. In fact, many of the major economies around the world are struggling with huge unemployment problems, particularly in the area of youth unemployment. In the second reading speech of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) to promote this bill, he said that the value of the work for the dole initiative lies in bringing young unemployed people back into a work culture to help instil a positive attitude to work and that it will give young people a chance to engage with

         Those are very worthwhile sentiments expressed there but, having said that, I am afraid that the philosophy of this bill has gone somewhere off the track because later in the House I heard the minister refer to `these people' and that they had certain obligations to the community. When we have 28 per cent of 15&amp;hyphen; to 19&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds unemployed in the western area of New South Wales, when we have 30 per cent of youth unemployment state&amp;hyphen;wide, I wonder whether we should, as those statements imply, be suggesting that it is their problem and not ours. It is our problem to generate jobs for the youth of this country and for those who have been put off by the downsizing of industry, by the lack of an industry policy and by the exporting of jobs because of our inability to compete.

There were processing jobs, jobs in industry and jobs in the mines. But now many of those jobs have been taken away by technology. They have also been taken away by the fact that labour is cheaper offshore than it is in Australia.

We have highly skilled people as well being laid off in the prime of their lives unable in many cases to contribute. Corporatisation is the precursor to privatisation.

They were forced to return for 18 months to the dole queues before they could qualify again for that program.

They need to be transferred urgently to the new digital recording technology.

One of the proudest achievements of this first Howard government will be that we took a $10.3 billion Labor deficit and we turned it into a $1.6 billion coalition surplus. A turnaround of that dimension—of around $11 billion or $12 billion over the course of the first parliamentary term—is a turnaround of about two per cent of GDP. This is a government that has put in place a program for national savings and led the way.

           We must say that with a great deal of mirth we saw the Labor Party out talking about national savings and various schemes for national savings that they would like to think that they would have introduced, if they had only been able to stay in office for more than 13 years. But nothing could have been less pro national savings than their fiscal policy. Their fiscal policy would

And those measures which we put in place on Tuesday night to put to bed the tawdry episode of deceit over the l&amp;hyphen;a&amp;hyphen;w tax cuts were measures open to all and open to all kinds of saving.

A person on $20,000, under the l&amp;hyphen;a&amp;hyphen;w tax cuts, would have received a tax cut of zero. The Keating Labor ministers in 1992—those people now concerned about progressive tax systems—voted for themselves, with the l&amp;hyphen;a&amp;hyphen;w cuts, a tax cut of $1,252 per annum—and for the battlers of Australia, nothing, not one dollar.

The first point I want to make is that, like people who were earning under $20,000, the Labor Party's now discredited superannuation l&amp;hyphen;a&amp;hyphen;w, law scheme provided absolutely no benefits at all for self&amp;hyphen;funded retirees. The scheme that we have abandoned was savagely penal so far as self&amp;hyphen;funded retirees were concerned. For those opposite who interject, might I remind them of something that was said by the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate on 10 May 1995. He said:

        <para style="Para">
         In other words, they decided to divert the money away from retired Australians. Retired Australians have worked their lives contributing money and when that money was collected by the federal Treasury, what did the Australian Labor Party decide to do? They decided to spit in the faces of those retired Australians, they decided to say to those retired Australians, `We won't give you any access to the l-a-w law tax cuts.' He went on to say:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Obviously it would be desirable, from the point of view of self&amp;hyphen;funded retirees, to be able to deliver them tax cuts. But there are lots of things that are desirable that are simply not attainable and not achievable. There are more immediate priorities . . .

         The now shadow Treasurer was saying in 1995 that there were more immediate priorities in the eyes of the Labor Party than delivering tax justice to self-funded retirees in this country. So can I say to the member for Fairfax that one of the most important elements of our plan is that self-funded retirees will get a fair share in relation to the taxation rebate, unlike under Labor, which offered nothing in this area to self-funded retirees. All self-funded retirees will be able to contribute.

Why then have you acted to ensure that over 1¼ million full rate age and service pensioners will get nothing at all from this rebate, even if they have substantial savings earning around $2,500 a year in interest income?

The facts are that, with the therapeutic group price premiums, the additional costs for people are totally avoidable. Let me repeat that: patients, if they do not wish to pay a premium, can choose to change to another brand that is no more expensive than what they are paying at the moment. It very simply maintains people's right to freedom of choice while properly limiting taxpayers' liability. It will also introduce substantial price competition into the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, something that does not exist in most areas at the moment because the government subsidises the cost of drugs to 100 per cent.

         There is a very dramatic difference between the attitude of the government to helping these students and the attitude that the Labor Party showed when in office. Over the last 13 years, the message that the Labor Party gave young people in years 9, 10, 11 and 12 in school was that, if you were not going on to university, you were not going anywhere. But the problem was that 60 per cent of students were not going on to university and very little indeed was provided for these students over the whole 13 years of the previous government. In fact, in the first term of the Howard government, this government is providing almost four times as much to support vocational education courses in schools as you provided over the whole 13 years of your government. In fact, as we know, the main contribution of the new shadow minister for education is that he wants to close up to 366 schools. That is his contribution to education for young Australians.

         This initiative builds on initiatives announced in the budget to fund over 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships over the next 12 months, and these apprenticeships and traineeships will be in high growth industries such as technology, tourism, hospitality, finance, sport, as well as the traditional trades. More than $415 million has been set aside for the new national apprenticeship system, which will provide thousands of young Australians with the quality training that will lead them on to real jobs, something that the Labor Party failed to do. The Leader of the Opposition knows that better than anyone because, when he was minister for employment, youth unemployment rose to 34 per cent. It is no wonder that young people turned away from you in droves at the last election.

         When you see the Labor Party getting up here and going in and out and doing their mental gymnastics, the people of Australia have only got to take into account one thing: Labor is against reducing taxes on savings. That is all you have to understand here. The coalition is in favour of reducing taxes on savings and the Labor Party is against it. They always do this. They sit there and say, `Oh, we are really in favour of it, but we have a thousand reasons why we can nitpick and raise points.' What was the question that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition put to Prime Minister? What was his big point? Why aren't you giving tax cuts to people who don't pay tax? That was your big point. Why is it night when the sun is not out? Why is it day when the sun is out? These are very deep questions, and I am sure you sit around in your office and try to think them up but they go nowhere. Here we have the twin act, Beazley and Evans—up, up, up, up, trying to figure out reasons why they are against reducing taxes on savings.

          This is not some sort of arcane matter of detail. The reality is we are trying to say to the small business community that they have the support of the government with a sensible system to go out and give somebody a job. And what is the Labor Party's message? Their message is: don't give somebody a job. Their message is, `Oh, look.

I ask the minister: what is his reaction to these statements and reports, and how does this reflect on the attitude of the opposition to the recent restructuring of BHP's steel interests.

         we promised that we would proceed to deliver a national museum for Australia. And in this budget we have done so. But prior to being able to proceed with the museum, we had to discern where was the most appropriate site. After the election, a committee was established and determined that it would be Acton Peninsula. We also had to give effect to a land swap between the government here in the ACT and the Commonwealth. It was started by the previous government but never completed. That land swap has now been completed and the museum will be able to go ahead.

But, Minister, is it not the case that this increase in the domiciliary nursing care benefit will be funded by taking at least 15,000 children with disabilities off the child disability allowance for a net saving of $19 million? That is $19 million off carers. Is it not a fact that children with severe asthma, diabetes or attention deficit disorder will no longer get the child disability allowance? Is it the intention of the minister to keep her $450 tax rebate while taking $2,000 away from parents of children with disabilities?

         The first and most important of those is that in March of 1996 the newly elected coalition government inherited an underlying budget deficit of $10,500 million. By the third year of our first term in office we will have turned that into a surplus of $1,600 million.

I concede to not having been able to hear the very beginning of it because of the cacophony of noise that was coming from the other side. I understand at the beginning of his question he referred to some remarks that Dr Mahathir, the Prime Minister of Malaysia, made which were reported in the Australian media. I can tell the honourable member I did see the newspaper article which he drew to my attention. I will put it this way to the honourable member: the point that Dr Mahathir was

          —Mr Speaker, I would like to add to another answer. Yesterday, I did the Australian Labor Party a very great injustice. I said that in the last six years when the Labor government was in power they ran up $75 billion of additional debt to purchase an additional 7,100 full&amp;hyphen;time jobs. I am advised that that figure was subsequently revised by the ABS to 16,000. So they spent $75 billion to buy 16,000 full&amp;hyphen;time jobs.

          —Mr Speaker, and I am seeking your guidance in this respect. I did notice—and I am pleased the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) is still here—that what was tabled as part of those papers today at item No. 7 was the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997 supplementary explanatory memorandum. It said on the paper that was in this chamber this morning, `Not available prior to tabling.' As that legislation is in the middle of debate in this House at the moment, I wondered whether the supplementary explanatory memorandum would therefore have any bearing on the debate that has proceeded in this House

The agreement will also result in a doubling of the number of air freight services between Australia and Singapore.

         If I may depart from my written text and interpolate, one of the events that I remember most from my visit to Singapore was a gathering at the Australian High Commission of some of the hundreds of the alumni of Singaporeans who had been to Australian universities over a very long period of time. As a reminder not only of the past but of the continuing close relationships between our two countries, one graduate of Sydney University from the early 1960s approached me and pointed out that his daughter and my daughter are currently classmates at Sydney University and that they had participated

         This was a personal reminder to me of the depths of the links between us and the way in which those links span different generations of Australians. It is also a very proud reminder to any Australian politician of the massive contribution that the Colombo Plan and those educational links between Australia and Malaysia and Singapore in particular have made to the very strong bilateral relationships we have. It drives home to all of us that the association between Australia and the nations of the region is not a recent thing: it is something that is very deeply rooted in the post&amp;hyphen;World War II experience of Australia and something to which great contributions have been made by leaders of both sides of the Australian political divide.

         My visit to China had, as a principal objective, establishing a good working relationship with the Chinese leadership and suggesting new horizons for our economic partnership.

Their participation sent a very positive signal to the Chinese government about the commitment of the government and the business community to work together in strengthening the relationship with China.

         Might I again interpolate another recollection of a personal kind in connection with the business delegation. One of the members of that business delegation is a businessman well known to many members of the House, Mr Lewis Ting, who is the managing partner of Ernst and Young. When we had a meeting with the Vice Premier, Mr Zhu Rongji, who will visit Australia very shortly, Mr Ting was amongst the four members of the business delegation who was invited to make a presen

And then he rather dissolved the gathering into some laughter—particularly on the Chinese side—when he expressed his regrets that he was not nearly as fluent as the minister in Mandarin. It was another very good reminder of the personal links between Australia and the nations of the region, which are so very important to building sound relationships at a national level.

         Given our mutual interests—and the importance to the region of cooperation between us—good communication between Australia and China is crucial. I proposed—and the Premier Mr Li Peng agreed—that we should strengthen dialogue at a political level. We agreed that we would meet regularly at head of government level. I also proposed that the ministerial framework for discussion of economic cooperation be upgraded and broadened, in order to ensure our economic complementarities achieved their full potential. In short, my government is seeking a partnership in growth with China. I am pleased that we will have the opportunity to continue our discussions on this when the Vice Premier, Zhu Rongji, visits later this month.

         China is already our fifth&amp;hyphen;largest trading partner. In the past decade, Australia's trade with China has grown twice as fast as our trade with the rest of the world. By the year 2000, China could be our third largest trading partner, after Japan and the United States. Australia will maintain its track record as a reliable supplier of mineral and agricultural commodities.

         I drew the Chinese leadership's attention, however, to the much greater role that Australia could play in fuelling China's economic growth. President Jiang Zemin responded well to this. Australia can play the part in China's economic growth that we played during the rapid industrialisation of Japan and Korea. Possible areas for expansion include LNG and

The composition of the business group that travelled with me reflected the scope for this partnership to expand into new areas, including manufactures, construction and services. In particular, my visit highlighted Australia's strength in financial services.

There will, of course, be differences from time to time between us, reflecting our different traditions, cultures and political systems. My government's approach to China will be based on the principles of mutual respect and recognition of our mutual interests.

         The rather anodyne and unexceptional statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) conceals—I am not saying deliberately; nevertheless it conceals—something of a hiatus, if not to say crisis, in relationships between Australians and the nations and the region around us. In the case of China, a very poor relationship has developed over the course of the last six months or so. In fact, it could be said that this particular visit of the Prime Minister, which has been on the agenda for some considerable time, had a question mark over it as to whether or not it would take place at all.

Right around the globe over the course of the last few months the Chinese have been clearing the decks in their relationship with a number of countries where there have been points of disagreements in the recent past as they seek to focus on that matter alone. That is not to say that necessarily any of the problems that have been associated with those concerns have been set aside.

          There are many state premiers who have done very well in that regard as they have presented themselves in China. As something the equivalent of that, so did the Prime Minister. He presented himself effectively in Beijing as a state Premier with Australia's considerable wares to lay on the Chinese table. But that is the job of a Premier. That is not the job of a Prime Minister. The job of a Prime Minister is to engage the major powers in this region across the board, across the board of all our strategic and security concerns, across the board of all the issues that we regard as morally important in the region, be they on human rights or anything else. It does not mean you march in and rub people's noses in it; it means that you raise it forthrightly in the sessions which you have. When you have those concerns, you raise them effectively.

          —I rise this afternoon to speak on an issue of major public importance and it goes to the question of what I would describe as a fairly important road show—the Mr Wishy-Washy and Mr Smug Road Show. I want to deal with the performance of that road show over the last 12 months and, more importantly, in the last couple of weeks. Because I tell you what: this road show in the last couple of weeks has gone out of its way to create certain expectations in the Australian community.

         One of the most important issues that the Australian community is looking for some leadership on at the moment—and the road show has even touched upon this issue in the last couple of weeks, especially in the media in regional Australia—is that all important question of jobs, the sense of job security. I suggest that an emerging major problem confronting Australia at the moment is not just the issue of youth unemployment but, importantly, the issue of rising unemployment amongst blue-collar middle&amp;hyphen;aged males.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The problem with the road show goes to the failure, I suggest, of the government to address in its budget the need to find jobs for 802,300 unemployed Australians, including 264,400 long&amp;hyphen;term unemployed Australians and, unfortunately, 90,000 young unemployed, who, even this week, have to confront cuts in expenditure on education and training, contrary to what the Minister for Schools, Voca

         The 1997 budget has failed to deliver. It has failed to deliver miserably to the Australian community on the issue of jobs and job security. It has failed to deliver to the battlers and their families. It has failed to deliver to the mob that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) likes to refer to from time to time. I suggest in passing that failure to deliver represents a continuation of trend with respect to the performance of this government since they were elected 12 months ago. They have failed to deliver to the Australian community on a range of matters. The real issue that the Australian community is looking for with respect to leadership at the moment is the issue of jobs—the question of some hope and security for the future of the Australian community. That is the No. 1 agenda item out there in mainstream Australia at the moment.

         What did the wishy&amp;hyphen;washy and smug road show say to the Australian community today? It was not a big tick about doing something to create jobs and a sense of security in people's lives. It was a big snub to the battlers. That is what it was: a huge snub to the Australian community about the issue of jobs and a sense of security and hope in life. I will tell you why it is worse—because, in the last couple of weeks, they finally got some feedback from the Director of the Liberal Party, Mr Robb, who has recently vacated the chair. One of his parting gestures was a message to the Prime Minister along these lines, `Look, Mr Prime Minister, your minister for employment, Senator Vanstone, is right'—you know, the senior minister of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training—`when she basically suggested that, if we do not deliver on the jobs front'—and she has said it on a couple of occasions, much to the upset of the Prime Minister—`then you really do not have a right to be re&amp;hyphen;elected at the next federal election.'

         You look around at the big issues—and budget night is about the big road show. The Australian community sits there and listens to the television and the radio. It is looking for direction. It is looking for the hard decisions.

Where has he been on the all&amp;hyphen;important question of industry policy? Again, missing in action. Where has he been on the issue of regional Australia—the question of Cairns, Ballarat, Bendigo, all those important regions which are experiencing great difficulties with respect to unemployment and social dislocation at the moment? Where was he on industry policy in regional Australia? Gone missing in action.

I suppose leadership does require a bit of stature, a willingness to make hard decisions—not intellectual pygmies who go missing in action when the hard decisions come around, but people who are prepared to lay out a plan and basically, in essence, put their heads down and tails up and get on with the job of doing

         I suppose budget night is about lots of lights, dazzle, big numbers and big speeches. We even had the Treasurer (Mr Costello) dancing around—a bit like some have suggested before, the loaded dog, at the dispatch box last Tuesday night—tongue hanging out one corner of the mouth, the make&amp;hyphen;up on and the stick of dynamite hanging out of the other side of the mouth. He was prancing around because, unfortunately, the Speaker was a little bit late and he wanted to spit out this great picture about where Australia is going on the issues of jobs and job security. All of a sudden he rises to his feet: `Here I am to tell Australia about how fortunate they are. Firstly, they have got me'—the loaded dog—`as the Treasurer of Australia. But I am going to tell you about your future this evening.' So he starts off at page 2: `These are the key issues, helping families'—well, I think jobs and job security are important to families—`boosting small business, creating jobs'—the third point on page 2—`and encouraging saving.'

         We sat here. We have looked at all the regional press and the stories—all the expectations that have been created in the last couple of weeks. I recall that that was the same day that the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the long&amp;hyphen;term unemployment figures and the figures relating to unemployment in regional Australia.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Just over a month ago I did have cause to look at these regional unemployment figures. In question time some months ago the Prime Minister said to me that after 12 months of a coalition government I would have the right to ask him a question about unemployment. So I waited for that 12 months to lapse—I am a very patient man—and what did those figures say about regional unemployment? They said 77 per cent of regional Australia is worse off on the unemployment front as a result of the first year, one-third of the normal life of a parliament if it runs its full term, of the Howard government.

        <break page="3803" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          Since those figures came out the message has been spelled out by Mr Wishy-Washy and Mr Smug Road Show all around Australia, backed up by Dr Do&amp;hyphen;Little, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. He does very little for jobs, very little for universities, very little for equality of access to education. I think he is concerned with only one issue at the moment: Dr Do&amp;hyphen;Little feels he should be sitting at the cabinet table rather than his senior minister.

          Today the Prime Minister wanted to talk about the reaction of some of the business community. I listened to his long list of friends, but there are other commentators—such as Katie Lahey, who is only the Chief Executive Officer of the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce. It is appropriate we quote what she said about the budget because it is fairly relevant to the issue of unemployment:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          <emphasis font-weight="BOLD">
           There were no real initiatives (in the budget) to help business soak up the unemployed, which is a concern.
          </emphasis>
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          I agree with her. She even did a survey of members of the New South Wales chamber. And what did that survey say? It said—and this is factual—that 76 per cent of members surveyed by the New South Wales chamber believe that the budget would not create jobs. That is what the business community believes.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Then I go to Access Economics—friends of the coalition, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, and frequent advisers who do detailed work in the preparation of coalition policies. What did they say today? It is reported in the media that they have suggested—and I believe this is also the view of the Research Bank Governor and the Secretary to the Treasury, as spelt out last week; unfortunately, the minister for employment did not know the difference between the two when questioned last week—that economic growth of 3.75 per cent would lead to an unemployment rate above 8.25 per cent. That is what Mr Richardson of Access Economics said this morning.

          Anyhow, the road show has gone on, and unfortunately the reviews have not been too good. The critics have been looking at the budget, including the Treasurer of Queens

          The problem is that, when the reviews start to go bad—and we understand some of the critics get a little bit bitchy at times—the main players, Mr Wishy-Washy and Mr Smug, go around backdooring one another. That is what is happening in the gallery at the moment. Mr Smug is up there saying, `Look, if I had had my way it would have been a better road show. But, unfortunately, Mr Wishy-Washy was interfering. It is also his budget. If I had had my way, we probably would not have even mentioned the issue of unemployment in the budget because that is not a real priority.'
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          So at the end of the show we are going to have to live with the bitchiness between the road show main players, Mr Wishy-Washy and Mr Smug. It might be appropriate for them to play their little games, but it is about time we faced up to the fact that $21 million on the work for the dole scheme, with its 10,000 places and people working two days on and then having five days off, will not produce the goods. It is about time we faced up to the fact that the Federation Fund of $1 billion—with funding to commence not this year (I wonder why it will not commence this year) but in 1998-99, stretching out to 2001; and it will be interesting to see the pork&amp;hyphen;barrelling that occurs under the Federation Fund—will not produce the goods either; nor will the government's savings policy, that great rip-off that is occurring with the frontbench of the government looking after itself, produce the goods.

         <para first-indent="16">
          It is about time we faced up to the fact that after 12 months this government has failed on the unemployment front. Unemployment is higher. Youth unemployment is higher. I understand why there is some sensitivity on the other side of the House: because it is now accepted in the Australian community that those so-called battlers that the Prime Minister was going to do so much for have been forgotten—forgotten on the savings front and forgotten on the unemployment front. What is the real problem confronting middle&amp;hyphen;aged male battlers now? The real problem is that
          <break page="3804" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           there is little hope for them or their families on the unemployment front as a result of this budget. There are 146,000 men between the ages of 35 and 45 who are looking for work and direction.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The time has come for this government to face up to the fact that it has got to stop and think about what it is not doing. What it is not doing at the moment is delivering on the issue of jobs, delivering on the issue of job security, delivering on the need to get our young people back to work and delivering on the need to get out there in middle Australia, amongst those middle&amp;hyphen;aged men who want to look after their families, and ensure that we create a sense of hope and security for their future.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          That is the challenge for Dr Do&amp;hyphen;Little and for Mr Wishy-Washy and Mr Smug Road Show. When it comes to performance, after all the expectations of the last couple of weeks the critics are going to be just as negative as they have been over the last couple of days.

          pathetic performance today, that this is nothing new from the member for Batman. When he was President of the ACTU, some 600,000 trade union members actually walked out of the trade union movement, which would have to be the most abysmal performance of the century by any ACTU president.

         But of course the ACTU have absolutely no credibility on employment because they were the people pulling the strings throughout the whole period when the previous Labor government was creating the problem that this present government is fixing.

Over the last six years of the Labor government, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said in question time today, the Labor Party succeeded in creating 16,000 additional new full-time jobs.

         Let us just have a look at why Labor failed so badly, because we certainly heard nothing today which would give anyone any impression that the Labor Party have a policy to deal with unemployment. They have no policy
         <break page="3805" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         Let us look at the reasons for their failure. I suppose if you went to the core of their failure and asked why the unemployment situation is as bad as it is in this country, you would find that it is because for 13 years the Labor Party, manipulated by the ACTU, trampled right over small business. With the highest interest rates in the world, they drove tens of thousands of small businesses in Australia into bankruptcy. During their last major recession, they destroyed some 300,000 jobs in small business.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         And then, just in case that was not enough, the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), sitting here at the table, the architect of the unfair dismissal law, went out and told small businesses that no matter how unsatisfactory any of their employees were the government was going to make it almost impossible for them to dismiss them and give a full-time job to somebody who could do the job. Sitting at the table today are the two great job destroyers in this country. We have had to take the necessary action to get rid of their laws, to get rid of their job destroying policies, and that is what we have been about.

        <para first-indent="16">
         When you get down to the economic fundamentals, you will not create the jobs we need in this country when Australians are not encouraged to save. The greatest dis&amp;hyphen;saver in this country for the last 13 years of Labor government, and particularly for the last six years, the years of the Keating&amp;hyphen;ACTU government, was the Commonwealth government. They had $75 billion of accumulated deficits. They were spending money they did not have, after they had put up taxes and after they had ripped off small business in budget after budget. They put in place the most complex tax laws this country had ever had. Between 1983 and 1994 the tax act tripled in size from 1,300 pages to 3,792 pages.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The compliance costs for company tax equalled 22 per cent of the total revenue they got from company tax. It was so expensive for business to comply with the tax laws the government had put in place. The fringe
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          benefits tax was a nightmare. The act was 300&amp;hyphen;pages long. How was small business supposed to cope with that? New Zealand had 50 pages. But, no, the Labor Party needed 300 pages. The capital gains tax compliance costs were also burdening small business.

         On top of all that, you could not stop Paul Keating spending. When the present Leader of the Opposition, the weak Leader of the Opposition, was the Minister for Finance, Paul Keating as Prime Minister trampled right over the top of him and spent up very big indeed—$75 billion worth of deficits—and ran Australia into a huge debt. They were the job destroying policies that this government is now coping with.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         On top of that, of course, Labor completely failed to respond to the changes that were affecting young people in particular—the huge changes taking place in the youth labour market. Between 1983 and 1996, there was a disappearance right across Australian industry of the unskilled jobs that young Australians dropping out of school early used to get. They let the apprenticeship system die on its feet, because the trade union movement of course liked all those complexities. They were not going to interfere with the apprenticeship system. They were just going to leave it there to die.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Consequently, in 1995, the last year of the Labor Party in government, the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the work force was the lowest for three decades. At the end of 13 years of Labor, 30 per cent of 14 year-olds in this country could not read properly, and that is why small business was finding it so difficult to give these young people jobs. They did not have the literacy skills. They did not have the numeracy skills. They could not work the cash registers. What happened to vocational education and training? Almost nothing was done on it. Nothing was done in schools over the 13 years of the Labor Party government. Vocational education and training went down the drain.

         In the last year of the Labor government, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) spent $500 million on his new scheme. It had a four per cent success rate. He bought jobs at the cost of $143,000 a job, almost bankrupting the country. And the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) says, `Let's go back to Working Nation. That's what we need for Australia's young people.' Let me say that this government has a commitment to provide young Australians with quality training.

         The saddest thing I suppose—I cannot resist pointing this out—is that if you go around this country and you ask where the biggest problems are they are in Labor Party electorates. Go into the Labor Party electorates in the cities and what used to be the Labor Party electorates in the regions and ask: what did the members do for their constituents over the 13 years they were in power? Some parts of these electorates look like war zones.

         What did they do in 13 years? There are some people who are unkind enough to suggest that the Labor Party deliberately likes to keep its supporters struggling, because it thinks it can scare them into welfare dependence and then it will tax the rest of the community to provide the benefits and frighten them that the coalition is going to take away all their welfare benefits. It likes its supporters to be poor. Of course, its supporters have realised that, and that is why they turned against the Labor Party in droves. They know that, unless you have a government with the leadership, the courage and the understanding to address the fundamentals, you will never redress these problems.

For the second time in a row, in this budget, there was no increase in income tax, no increase in company tax, no increase in wholesale sales tax and no increase in petrol excise. In fact, there

We have simplified the fringe benefits tax.

The first national literacy plan in the history of this country has been put in place, and every child in this country in grades 3 and 5 will be tested against those national standards. For the first time, we have got commitments to have a look at the literacy level of every child when they come into school and to make the resources available to give those children the skills they need.

         For the first time in this country's history, we will have, under the policies of this government, a national apprenticeship system. This budget provides funding for over 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships in the coming year. This government has committed itself to $187 million to expand vocational education and training in schools and to make sure, for the first time, that students have the opportunity to get industry recognised and accredited skills in schools that will lead them on to jobs. We want to give to those students who are dropping out of school something to keep them in school, something relevant—that they can see is relevant—that will help them move from school into employment.

That is the difference: we are putting into place solid policies.

In March 1997, there were 34,000 more people in Australia unemployed than there were in March 1996, when that government came to power. As well, there are 14,000 more in the ranks of the long-term unemployed.

         The budget that was handed down a couple of days ago should have made the question of what this government is going to do to address the problem of unemployment one of its central planks—and it did nothing. Responsible, informed and competent commentators have also indicated that as far as unemployment is concerned the budget offers nothing.

         When the Labor Party came to government in 1983, unemployment in Australia was almost 11 per cent. When we left government, it was below 8&amp;half; per cent and was edging down. We made as our target a level of five per cent by the end of this decade. After the budget was presented, the commentators indicated quite clearly that the figures that were being presented by the government in connection with the budget were fudged. When they spoke about unemployment coming down to eight per cent at the end of this next 12 months, the commentators said, `No, it will not.' The growth figure that they projected is recognised as being insufficient to bring their 8.7 per cent unemployment down to eight per cent over this next 12 months. The good doctor, Dr Kemp, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, who just responded to the shadow minister for employment and training, has the responsibility in this chamber for representing his senior minister—I think the position should be reversed—from the Senate.

          My colleague the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) referred just a short time ago, by way of a very constructive and useful interjection, to the fact that what we should be doing is referring to the situation which has developed in our area—in the area of the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) and the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris)—of Newcastle. Let me do so.

          At the end of March, in the Hunter region as a whole, the unemployment rate was 12 per cent. It was up 2.5 per cent in the previous three months. The number unemployed in the Hunter region was 31,000. That had increased by 7,000 in the previous three months. The participation rate in the Hunter was 61 per cent—one of the lowest in Australia. We might ask ourselves: why were people in the Hunter, unlike people in many other areas of Australia, including those on the lower North Shore, giving up on the prospect of getting a job? Why were they opting out in disillusionment, frustration and despair? Why were they giving up the struggle to find a job? They are giving up the struggle because there are no jobs there.

          If the same proportion of those people who could be in the labour force in the Hunter were looking for jobs as are looking for jobs in the lower North Shore, then there would not be just 31,000 people identified as unemployed in the Hunter; there would be over 60,000. The unemployment rate—which is officially 12 per cent in the Hunter—would be not 12 per cent but 21 per cent.

The number of people who will now, as a result of that decision by BHP, find themselves unemployed is 2,500 directly in BHP and, of course, the flow-on effect will mean there will be somewhere between 6,000 and 12,000 people in the Hunter region who will be unemployed as a result of that.

          I was talking as well about the breakdown of the market. This is what happened to those people in Newcastle. In 1983, the output per worker in Newcastle was about 160 tonnes per employee.

But they were told then it had to reach 1,000. In the face of that, BHP announced its withdrawal and this government sat on its hands.

This government has faced up to the reality. We do not hide people in short-term, worthless, fruitless programs like you did.

I would say that perhaps even the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) would be able to find a few jobs for people if someone put $143,000 per job into his pocket.

         Let us have a look at some of the programs. In my own electorate of Longman, which is a beautiful part of the world, we have gone a long way towards working with the community to address the problem of unemployment. No longer do we shove the unemployed into short&amp;hyphen;term programs, hope that no-one sees them and that they are forgotten. We are having the community work with them. The Caboolture area schools industry links scheme—CASTLES as it is known—which is part of the school&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;work program has been successful throughout Australia in a number of locations, including Labor strongholds such as Port Adelaide. Here we have business working with schools to ensure that young people have every opportunity from the very start to get into the workplace. They understand what work is about and, more importantly, business also starts to understand the young person. That is a great initiative which involves the community. The Marsden school has picked up on the pathways program. They have almost completed their first stages which have been wonderfully successful. Approximately 150 young people deserted by Labor were picked up through an innovative program.

          The structural differences between us in the Liberal Party and you in Labor are quite distinct. This government rejects big government. It rejects the big taxing and big spending mentality that you are renowned for at every level. We in this budget have addressed the underlying problems created by you the Labor Party, that is, the high deficit of $75 billion in the last 6 years and record low national savings and household savings. We have introduced practical industrial relations laws. We have removed your unfair dismissal laws. We now have low sustainable inflation and low interest rates. This Howard government is about letting business get on with creating real jobs for the Australians who were deserted by Labor so that Australia can prosper once again.

It is entrenched, I would suggest, by economic policies that are not working particularly to the benefit of those who do not happen to be shareholders and do not happen to be part of that sector of the economy that is doing particularly well. In that downsized economy, where thousands of jobs have been shed, these people are victims of a policy of four per cent growth. For the first time in our history, it is non&amp;hyphen;jobs growth. That is certainly not a situation peculiar to Australia.

         Mike Cardinal, MLA for that particular province in Canada, came up with this scheme in 1991. He later became the Minister of Alberta Family and Social Services and immediately set out to reform the entire welfare system. His philosophy was that people wanted to work; any job was a good job. Training was the key. That is something that is noticeably absent from this work for the dole project, despite the very strong suggestion from the Prime Minister on the day he announced it—in the way I referred to earlier: off the hip,  not very confident about it—he did say, or strongly suggested, that there would be a training component.

It also may be a good one, because unemployment is this country's major problem as it comes into the year 2000 and the next century. The figures as they are today—8.7 per cent—are enough to shame any government. But, unfortunately, Australia does not face this problem of high unemployment alone. It is endemic around the world—particularly in Europe. At the same time, I note that the US has a current unemployment rate of 4.9 per cent, and I will refer to that later.

I sat down and talked to them for quite some time. I asked them what I, as somebody who was doing a needs survey, could do for them, and they said, `Find us jobs.' That was general amongst these kids, who were, as I said, the tougher looking kids. They were the sorts of kids that you would try to avoid if you went down the street, because you would wonder what was in their mind. In fact, all that was in their mind was a job.

          Last week the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia appeared before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration and was questioned quite closely about unemployment and what he saw as the future. The governor made it very clear that he divided it into two areas: growth in GDP and structural growth. He said that he could not see growth in GDP bringing a decrease in unemployment of more than perhaps 2.7 per cent. He was talking about good sustained growth to the end of the century. He said that, if we really want to bring down our unemployment rate, we have to look to structural adjustment. Of course, in that he meant greater flexibility in the workplace.

          I would hope that the Governor of the Reserve Bank was not suggesting that we would go totally down the American road, although, when you look at the American statistics, you will see that they are extremely impressive. In about the 1980s our unemployment rate was about six per cent and theirs was 7.2 per cent. They are now down to 4.9 per cent and we are up to 8.7 per cent. While their unemployment rate has gone down, ours has increased. The OECD has put that this is a result of greater flexibility in the US market.

           actually tripled. I believe the figure is something like 379 per 100,000. In Australia in the same period it has gone from something like 68 to 88, so it has increased by a third. There is a huge difference in that country, and I suspect that that is not a statistic that we would like to copy. I cannot say that that rise in crime or in prison population is a result of that extreme flexibility in the United States, but I would be surprised if there was not some connection between the two.

          As the member for Calare said, we have to look to creating new jobs for the unemployed. We have to have some fairly inventive ideas to do that.

The accepted mythology in this place is that the work for the dole scheme has widespread support. That is based largely on anecdotals from the media, from the minister and from members opposite.

         The work for the dole scheme is predicated on a fairly simple and weary and old political strategy that can only lead to bad public policy.

Rather than confront the contradictions in our economy, rather than confront the difficult decisions which actually deliver solutions which create employment and sustained economic growth, we seek to introduce these sorts of schemes which lead the community to believe that it is the unemployed's fault that they are so.

         Dr Kemp and others have made great speeches saying how popular this proposal is. They have suggested that the vast majority of young people support the proposal. Why then make it compulsory?

The reason they are making it compulsory is to introduce an idea into the minds of the public that it is the unemployed's fault that they are unemployed, that they do not get off their backsides. We have heard a lot of claptrap about instilling a work ethic. The fact of the matter is there are more people who would like to work than there are jobs available.

         Let us debunk some of the misconceptions about the scheme. The scheme does not apply to just young unemployed people, it applies to all age groups. The scheme will not just be used in the community sector. Indeed, a lot of the examples member opposite have used that will be good for this scheme to adopt have engaged the community sector. The reality is that the private sector equally can use the scheme to replace their own waged employees. The boss will not have to pay anything to the person at all. No occupation is exempted. In fact the scope of the program is virtually unlimited, except for the 10,000 cap.

The conscripts will not be paid in accordance with the award. The government has selected the wrong rate—a lower rate of pay that is not appropriate—because the lower rate of pay in the award is in exchange for real training. That is not provided in the scheme.

          If the boss can engage a conscript for free, with no wages and with no safety or training responsibility, then I believe Australian workers have a lot to fear from this legislation because it will be tempting for some employers to terminate their waged employees in order to attract conscripts. I hope this does not occur, but I think there are unscrupulous employers who will be tempted to do this.

          The scheme should not displace prospective workers either.

About 50 per cent of the original hands went up. Then we said, `How many of you would support work for the dole if it could be replacing paid employment—that is, the employer does not have a prohibition on terminating a waged employee to put on a conscript?' No hands went up. In the absence of the detail on first blush, many people thought this would be a great idea, but the devil is in the detail and, in my view, it is Dickensian.

          —I did anticipate that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel), would have spoken for a few more minutes, but it is pretty clear that he ran out of steam on a bill—the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill—about which he professes to have a great deal of passion. I think it is very disappointing for the Australian people to hear the Labor Party, which was overwhelmingly rejected at the last election, seek to criticise and condemn what this government is doing: that is, bringing in an innovative scheme which will give people, principally the young, the opportunity of working for the dole. In doing so, they will obtain a work ethic, and also make a substantial ongoing contribution to the community. It will create a situation where a person who has been on a work for the dole scheme will clearly be more employable and will have a greater sense of self&amp;hyphen;respect.

         The Labor Party was a total disaster during its 13 years in office. Youth unemployment at the time of the last election rose to about 30 per cent nationally and the Labor Party had no answers. Since we have been in office over the last 14 months we have got the economy going to give small business the opportunity of growing, expanding and creating jobs.

         We have a comprehensive range of solutions. Unemployment is not an easy problem to solve but at least this government, unlike its predecessor, has brought forward suggestions and ideas. We know that young people are a very important resource for this nation. We do not think that it is acceptable that 30 per cent of them should be thrown on the job scrap heap. We do not believe the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), who is at the table, should  throw his hands up in the air, as did his

         I am pleased to join the debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill.

Unfortunately, long&amp;hyphen;term unemployment without any chance of a job destroys self&amp;hyphen;esteem and brings about a whole range of other social problems, including family breakdown and a very high level of youth suicide. To avoid this we need to create jobs, and create an environment where people are able to get into work.

We aim to help to make sure that they do not feel left out by society the way the Labor Party shunned 30 per cent of our young people. I think that was very sad.

         The government believes that it is fair and reasonable that people receiving unemployment allowances from the community be asked to make a contribution to the community in return. Arrangements for work for the dole projects are currently being developed and, most importantly, the minister has pointed out that pilot projects will be located primarily in areas of high youth unemployment in rural and regional Australia. And the Sunshine Coast, an area that I am proud to represent, is an ideal location for a pilot project because we have chronic high youth unemployment. The minister was no doubt as

         But the fact of the matter is that employed people and unemployed people right across the Sunshine Coast saw this as being a worthwhile idea. It is an attempt by the government to give young people a chance, yet we find those opposite—who are negative, who for 13 years did absolutely nothing to create opportunities for young people—are now not supporting this government's initiative. I want to highlight a report from the same newspaper where a young unemployed person aged 17 is referred to, Andrew Roberts. The paper says:

         I found that the response of Andrew was similar to the attitude of so many other young people right across the nation. The minister at the table, and in my view he is one of the very best ministers in the government, has brought forward this program which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announced. It is fairly clear that the community is on side, it is obvious that unemployed people are supportive, but once again we find that the Labor Party is out of step. Once again we find that the Labor Party is a group refusing to recognise that it ought to be supporting the program brought in by the work for the dole initiative.

Some of them fall into crime and a lot of them watch television. At the end of the day, if and when they apply for work, they are less employable.

         We are not looking at this as a slash and burn program. We do not aim to save money through the work for the dole scheme. Some pilot projects in rural and remote areas may cost as much as several thousands of dollars per participant in addition to the unemployment allowance payments. This government is making a genuine attempt to assist young people. The priority group for the pilot projects will be those aged under 25 years and who have been in receipt of unemployment allowances for at least six months. However, work for the dole pilots will not be restricted to that age group. People aged 25 years or more will be considered for some pilot projects. It is very important to recognise that unemployment in this country is not limited to those under the age of 25 years.

         The honourable member for Fraser quite incorrectly peppered his whole speech with the term `conscripts'. Personally, I find that offensive. I think that is inaccurate and entirely inappropriate. If he wants to oppose the government's policy, let him get up and do so, but in speaking out against what we are saying, as is his democratic right, he should at least keep to the truth. The fact of the matter is that we will not have conscripts. Referral to pilot projects will be, as much as possible, voluntary. However, if the response from volunteers does not provide enough participants, then eligible clients will be compulsorily referred. Referral of eligible clients to projects could involve a strategy which ensures that a mix of clients, all of whom would have been unemployed for at

         A criticism of the scheme is a claim that training is not involved. The Labor Party is the last group in Australia which should talk about training. Let us look at their training programs. They placed a lot of people in training program after training program, seeking to give them some skills for jobs which simply did not exist in the community. When I was doorknocking in Caboolture prior to the 1993 election, a person said to me, `Look, I have been to eight training programs.' But at the end of the day he was still out of work.

         The work for the dole initiative will give people the opportunity to work at the workplace. In doing so, they will obtain practical training that will fit them out for a real long&amp;hyphen;term job when they successfully obtain one.

         Work for the dole is not designed to artificially manipulate the measured rate of youth unemployment. The initiative is expected to have little, if any, effect on the reported youth unemployment level. We all know how the former government placed people in training schemes at critical times in the political cycle so as to depress artificially the official rate of unemployment. What they did was dishonest. Our scheme will give people a work ethic and enable them to make a contribution to this country at a time when they would otherwise be sitting at home and not working.

         We believe that, in exchange for the dole, people ought to make such a contribution. Does the Labor Party believe that people

There is a win for the community because the projects involved will have long-term benefits. We will create a pool of employable people. When employers advertise in newspapers, they will get people who understand what getting up and going to work is like. Employers will not waste their time interviewing people who simply do not understand how important it is to be prepared to work.

         Another benefit of this scheme for the community is that the social problems associated with unemployment will be reduced. If young people are active, motivated and happy within themselves, obviously the levels of family breakdown, youth homelessness and certainly crime we have experienced in the past will be reduced. So the scheme will provide ancillary benefits to the community generally.

         The Treasurer (Mr Costello), in his televised speech on the budget, mentioned the word `unemployment' only once. For the first time in living memory a budget speech failed to disclose the record on jobs and on growth for the past year. The reason why was simple enough. The Treasurer predicted last year that he would bring the unemployment rate down to 8¼ per cent. Instead, it has risen to 8¾ per cent. The most recent figures show that nearly a quarter of a million people are now long-term unemployed—a 23&amp;hyphen;month high. The economic growth which was forecast for next year, despite the pick&amp;hyphen;up in the world economy, comes in at just 3¾ per cent—still under the four per cent which the Prime Minister and everybody else accept is necessary for any genuine, serious reduction in unemployment.

The Labor Party indeed pioneered the term `reciprocal obligation' in its job compact between the government and the unemployed as part of the Working Nation jobs programs.

We have a government whose cuts to labour market programs have meant that an estimated 117,000 young unemployed people have lost access to these programs. Those opposite have the nerve to come in here and say, `Look at us. We want a pat on the back. We're introducing a work for the dole scheme for 10,000 people,' yet they have cut places for 117,000 young unemployed people. Make no mistake, this is a mickey mouse program.

         In their view, unemployment is a problem only for taxpayers. If people are working for the dole, taxpayers will feel happier about their taxes contributing to the jobsearch allowance or unemployment benefits, and therefore the problem is solved and will go away. But unemployment is much more than that. It is a problem—a most serious problem—for the unemployed themselves. It does lead to increases in crime, it does lead to family breakdown and it does lead to suicide, as other speakers have mentioned. It is also a problem for the nation in that we fail to utilise our productive capacity. This is no solution for the problem of unemployment at all.

We think that participants need to be able to leave the scheme, to accept employment opportunities without penalty and that access to financial assistance ought to be available to potential employers to cover costs such as supervision and materials. Through these sorts of amendments, this program can be turned into something worth while which, presently, regrettably, it is not.

Claims of better economic prospects next year do not change the fact that the government has caused the economy to grow too slowly and, as a result, thousands of Australians are needlessly unemployed.

As the Howard government closes its CES, Social Security, Medicare and tax offices, 16,500 more public service jobs will be lost mainly in rural and regional Australia. This follows the 12,600 already gone. And you can add some 4,000 private sector jobs that will go as these offices close. In addition, more than 20,000 jobs are to be lost from Telstra and the government's Defence Efficiency Review will mean the loss of a further 8,000 defence jobs, many in regional Australia.

          The announcement of the new federation slush fund will do nothing to `generate jobs' quickly. It does not even begin until July 1998. Meanwhile, vocational education and training funds have been cut for the second year running and, sadly, even the number of apprenticeships fell in 1996&amp;hyphen;97, as did the growth rate of traineeships. That is what happens when a Prime Minister and his government just do not care.

          Yesterday at the Press Club the Treasurer nominated national saving as the government's most important economic objective. But the government's decision to scrap the superannuation co&amp;hyphen;contributions policy is a huge blow to national saving. Let's remind ourselves where the $3.7 billion stolen from workers' super plans was going. It was
          <break page="3828" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

          That $3.7 billion has now been pinched to pay for a re-election slush fund. And there's a savings plan that only the most well&amp;hyphen;off can really benefit from. The effect on national saving can only be negative. It frightens us to see just how negative. The three plus three per cent co-contribution scheme alone would have contributed an extra $400 billion to the national savings pool over the next 20 years. And the coalition has just knocked it off.

But I will tell you where they stand naked before the Australian people, where all the fudges and the statistics can't protect them: it's when people lose jobs. It's when the BHP board comes out and says that 2,700 workers are going to lose their jobs in Newcastle when the plant closes down.

In response to BHP's intention to pull out of steel making in Newcastle, the Labor government implemented a steel plan: a plan which everyone supported, including the Prime Minister, who said he agreed it saved the steel industry in this country and that he would—and I quote—`not be stingy about giving credit to Senator Button for what he was able to do in relation to that'.

          —This is obviously non&amp;hyphen;controversial legislation. The opposition supports it, so I do not intend to detain the committee by making any sort of lengthy speech. Obviously, it reflects the extension of Australia's network of double taxation agreements, a clearly important move from the point of view of fostering trade and investment flows between Australia and other countries, particularly those in our region. The specific measure here in relation to tax sparing was one where the present government had an exchange of notes on 22 November 1996. It is completely uncontentious and we support it, and I will say no more than that.

         These notes were exchanged with Vietnam on 22 November 1996 and give effect to Australia's undertaking in 1992 regarding double taxation.

         Tax sparing is a situation whereby Vietnam offers tax concessions to attract foreign investment. Under these tax sparing credit arrangements, an Australian investor who takes up an offer of specialised tax concession is deemed to have paid the tax actually forgone by Vietnam for the purposes of Australian foreign tax credit rules. These arrangements are necessary in that, without tax sparing credits, the concessions granted to Australians by Vietnam could be negated by Australia's foreign tax credit rules.

         Three conditions must be met to qualify for tax sparing concessions under the terms of these notes. Firstly, the activity undertaken must meet the conditions of a specified Vietnamese law contained in the notes. Secondly, the incentive must be for a specified activity listed in the notes which will result in genuine economic development and active business income. The third condition allows for the exclusion of certain activities and tax sparing incentives. These include the banking and the finance sector, and some shipping and aircraft operations. Also included in this condition is a general anti&amp;hyphen;avoidance provision.

         At the time of the negotiations on the parameters of the credit notes there were a variety of tax rates applicable to foreign investors in Vietnam. These ranged from 25 per cent down to 10 per cent. It was therefore important to establish a benchmark for the underlying rate in order to calculate the amount of tax forgone by Vietnam. It was agreed that this benchmark rate would be 20 per cent.

There is provision for the extension of this period, which began on 1 July 1993, on the grounds of a future agreement. The notes will enter into force when the future exchanging of diplomatic notes advising of the necessary constitutional processes has been fulfilled. A final binding treaty, and the enactment of this legislation, will complete the processes required by Australia for these purposes.

         Double tax agreements are generally supported in principle by Australian tax experts and are acknowledged to be an integral part of our economic internationalisation. However, a submission made to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties in March of this year on behalf of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the ICA, reveals a number of concerns with this particular agreement. The ICA is concerned not only with the limited application of the

         The member for Braddon (Mr Miles), in his second reading speech on behalf of the government rightly points out that tax sparing is utilised by the Vietnamese government to encourage international investment in Vietnam. He also suggested that without tax sparing credits:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . Vietnamese tax concessions granted to Australian residents could be negated by Australia's foreign tax credit rules which would effectively top up Vietnamese taxes paid to the level of tax that would be payable on an equivalent amount of Australian domestic income.

        <para style="Para">
         He paints a very rosy picture of the benefits of tax sparing for Australian investors in Vietnam. Those Australian companies which qualify for the exemption will no longer be forced to pay the difference between Vietnam's tax rate and Australia's. This is both reasonable and sensible.
        </para>

         The Institute of Chartered Accountants makes it clear that whilst tax sparing does not represent a cost to Australian revenue:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Many of the features of the tax sparing agreement are those insisted upon by the Vietnamese government. These include the cap on the tax sparing rate, the exclusion of accounting and auditing services from tax sparing relief, and the defined permitted activities.

        <para>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The ICA acknowledges at the same time that these conditions are consistent with Vietnamese domestic taxation law. However, it is obvious that only a limited pool of Australian investors in Vietnam will benefit from this agreement. Services—including accounting, consulting, banking, commercial and insurance—will not be able to utilise the tax sparing agreement.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Treasurer (Mr Costello) has also conceded that aircraft and shipping operations will only benefit in part from this tax relief. Many tax experts believe this to be inappropriate. The Institute of Chartered Accountants maintains that other prospective tax sparing agreements should not be restricted to reflect the domestic law of the country in which the tax sparing income is sourced.

         To date, our trade with Vietnam has been quite limited. Australia's 1995&amp;hyphen;96 trade table showed Vietnam as 32nd among our top 45 trading partners. Total two&amp;hyphen;way trade between Australia and Vietnam in that year amounted to around $527 million, which represented a 0.3 per cent share of our total trade figures. Significantly though, our total export dollars were almost half that of our total import expenditure. In fact, our net exports are calculated at minus $131 million for the year 1995&amp;hyphen;96.

         This figure represents a substantial reversal in the flow of trade from 1989 to 1990, when Australian exports exceeded Vietnamese imports by some $66 million.

          Neither the ATO nor the Treasury should wield discretionary power in this matter.

          Amen to that. That was what the minister had to say 12 months ago; yet here we are today, debating only the second international tax agreement since he made that remark, and we have both the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties questioning the treaty making process.

However, it would not bring about a reform of the subjective manner in which the ATO arrives at the details of future tax treaties, if the present example is to be relied upon. Further, this proposal will not guarantee more time for discussion by experts and interested persons unless the ATO publishes, or makes available, details early on in the negotiation stage.

         Essentially this proposal is concerned with the notion of tax sparing, which has to do with allowing Australian companies to gain a tax concession on the basis that they have been given a tax concession by the government of Vietnam. The government of Vietnam, like many Asian countries, gives tax concessions for investment in various industries and also concessions when profits are made.

          In this situation it is important that you do not get a negation of that effect by the company then having to pay tax in Australia and being put in an awkward position. This bill is intended to extend this notion of tax sparing in relation to Vietnam so that we have a situation where companies can claim the same concession basically being transferred into Australia.

          It is interesting that this phenomenon is occurring and I read out before the other countries with which we have these arrangements—they are all Asian countries. What is important here is that it is in Asia that we see this massive effort—not just in Asia but primarily in Asia, especially in Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and China—to give big concessions to industry for investment.

          We are supposed to think of ourselves as part of the Asian region and associate ourselves with the Asian region. Virtually every country in Asia gives significant and major concessions for industry development, especially manufacturing industries, and we do not. We don't do anything. There is absolutely no reason why anybody should invest in Australia when facing the kinds of concessions given to companies to invest, especially in manufacturing and production, in other parts of the world but especially in the Asian region.

          Vietnam has opened up its economy and more and more foreign investment is going into Vietnam. I read recently that Vietnam is trying to copy what has been going on in China under the policies of Deng Xiaoping. I have just come back from a visit with a parliamentary delegation to China. You would not believe the development and the production that is going on there. It is very hard to believe.

          This kind of development is also starting to happen in Vietnam. In China, they build whole cities like Shenzhen—with 3&amp;half; million people in 15 years—and huge skyscrapers, railway systems, roads, bridges, five&amp;hyphen;star hotels and factories, one after the other. There is production, manufacturing and development.

          Compared to all that dynamism, the Australian economy is a disgrace. Yet we are saying, `Let's try and get Australians involved in this process.'

          But we have learnt nothing ourselves from all of the developments in the Asian region. We do not give these sorts of concessions; we do not even think about it. We are obsessed with only one thing and that is whether or not there is a surplus in the budget. We have no idea about spending a dollar so as to make two or three in the future, especially in infrastructure development.

          When we think about budgeting, the analogy is often used about the household. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) said you cannot spend what you do not have. If you took that idea totally literally, nobody would ever buy a house on a mortgage because they certainly do not have the money. They have to borrow the money.

           Borrowing for investment in growth, infrastructure and development of industry is an investment in the future. Such borrowing is going to come back in a positive way, just as when you invest in a house and you go to the bank and you borrow money, it comes back positively. That simple fundamental economic lesson seems to be one which is totally missed here because this government is totally obsessed with an ideology that is out of date; it has been rejected around the world. What are even conservative governments around the world doing? Most conservative governments are actually borrowing. They are investing, they are growing their economies, they are pushing them along—with the exception of the Australian government.

           That shows the total ignorance our public servants have about what is happening in Asia. Basically, they are hopeless.

           Let me give an example. What would happen to a businessman in Vietnam or China who applied for a visitors visa to come to Australia to have a look around and see what business he could do? He would probably be rejected. A number of businessmen in China and Vietnam and so on have been put off by the fact that they cannot come here because they cannot get a visa for a month or two to have a look around. They are given a grilling. This is our idea of how to do business with Asia.

The legislation could have been more extensive. It could have allowed for greater investment and, most importantly, it could have been based on consultation between the people affected, in both Vietnam and the Australian companies and individuals interested in doing business with Vietnam.

Some regions of China are reaching 15 per cent growth levels, and yet we think that three to 3.5 per cent is going to be sufficient to achieve something in this country.

          There is no doubt that the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997 is a very important bill. It will give the force of law in Australia to the exchange of notes that took place on 22 November 1996 amending the Australia&amp;hyphen;Vietnam double taxation agreement. The exchange of notes was announced by our Treasurer (Mr Costello) on 22 November 1996. The notes implement, effectively, the tax sparing provisions of the double tax agreement.

          A benchmark rate of 20 per cent has been set for the Vietnamese tax otherwise payable. If the prevailing Vietnamese tax rate drops below 20 per cent that lower rate will become the benchmark. When the notes were negotiated, a variety of nominal tax rates were applicable to foreign investors in Vietnam, ranging from 25 per cent down to 10 per cent. Under the notes, the tax sparing is for the 10 years commencing from the date of effect of the Vietnamese double taxation arrangement, which is 1 July 1993.

          The government firmly believes that this exchange of notes will contribute positively to the strengthening of trade and investment and to a wider relationship between Australia and Vietnam.

         Later in 1995, the Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill 1995 was introduced and passed through the House.

Only three of those recommendations have not been adopted in full. Recommendations 1 and 3 sought to limit the power to take body samples and conduct examinations, particularly of breast swabs in the case of recommendation 3, to circumstances in which the offence was punishable by imprisonment for five years or more.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The government has applied this recommendation, save that it has reduced the scope of the exception to apply it to indictable offences only. It also appears, on the basis of further consideration, that the Senate committee, in agreeing to recommendation 3, failed to fully appreciate the nature of the procedures contemplated by the relevant provisions. Accordingly, the opposition believes that these amendments are appropriate.

         Recommendation 2 prevented the taking of dental impressions. This recommendation was based on the state of forensic dontology as it was in 1995. I am advised that technical developments made since that time mean that low&amp;hyphen;invasive techniques for the taking of dental impressions are now available.

          It follows that this bill remains, in essence, and largely in substance, Labor's 1995 bill. I note that this bill is also designed to serve as a model for state and territory forensic procedures bills. I hope that the various jurisdictions will give strong consideration to bringing their laws into line with those to be adopted in this bill. The consistency of Australian criminal law has long been overdue. As it is implemented, it will greatly enhance citizens' knowledge of and consistent treatment by the law. It will also enable our law enforcement authorities to spend less time worrying about which law they need to apply and more time catching and prosecuting criminals.

          The benefits of the bill, both in its longer term use as a model for the states and territories and in its immediate application to provide consistency of forensic procedures for the prosecution of Commonwealth offences, are obvious. What concerns me on a personal level is that I had some reservations in the previous parliament on aspects of this bill. I voiced those reservations within the caucus committee of the Australian Labor Party. A number of those reservations are still relevant.

          We have to be very careful as a parliament not to bring in legislation just to the lowest common denominator. If we are going to be invading people's liberties, then there has to be some protections. Whilst the opposition will be supporting this bill, I put on notice to the government that there are a number of submissions that I anticipate are still coming to the opposition as to how the bill could be improved.

          I put the government on notice that, between the passage of this bill in the House of Representatives and its final consideration in the Senate, the opposition is going to be consulting with a number of community groups and individuals who are working at the coalface to ensure that this bill has adequate protections and to see whether it can be further improved.

          We are not going to do that in a destructive manner. We hope to do it in a constructive fashion, because there have been some improvements in terms of forensic dontology and other aspects of forensic behaviour in that time. We also need to look at these things afresh. Some time has elapsed. We want to get the federal model right so that the states can pick it up, but we want to have the right balance. We want to be very careful that we do not put in some protections because they are too hard or because some states might not like them. I put that reservation on the table.

The Labor Party does not want to just take an oppositionist role. These things have important ramifications when they affect the powers of police. I am not one who subscribes to the view that what we do is legislate to the lowest common denominator and then you have a situation where some police could abuse these powers. And that is the situation—there has been a number of royal commissions conducted around this country that show that police have abused powers that have been given to them.

          By and large, the opposition is supporting this bill.

          —I am always very concerned about amendments to legislation which give police greater powers. I am always concerned that those sorts of amendments have to be carefully looked at. Having said that, I wish I had more time to carefully look at these amendments to the Crimes Amendments (Forensic Procedures) Bill. We must always remember what was said nearly 150 years ago by Vice&amp;hyphen;Chancellor Knight&amp;hyphen;Bruce, I think it was, in a case that I cannot remember the name of. In talking about the striving to get people convicted if they were guilty, he included a cautionary note in relation to the question of truth. He said, `It may be pursued too keenly. It may be loved unwisely. It may cost too much.' It is a principle that I think has to always be borne in mind in considering these sorts of matters.

         It is always a matter of getting the balance right between the community's interest in ensuring that people who commit serious criminal offences are convicted and punished, and the interest of the individual who may be caught up in that process and who has been dealt with harshly in being so caught up. There have been a number of very prominent examples of that this century where individuals have been caught up. As I think I have said before in the House, once the criminal process begins it is not very nice to be on the other end of it. It is a very all&amp;hyphen;embracing process and people who get swept up into it really find it very difficult to get out until those magic words are pronounced by the jury.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I have seen a number of cases where judges have virtually told juries to acquit because of the paucity of evidence and the way the investigative procedure has been conducted. With that in mind I also say that, on the other side of the coin, it is important for police to be armed in a modern age with all the powers that lead to the undertaking of forensic procedures so that they can carry out investigations in a thorough and proper way. The investigative arm conducted by the police is not frozen in time, and ought not to be frozen in time.

         There are constant changes and developments in science and technology that must be kept pace with. In that regard I think it is also important, in the overall context of the community's interest in ensuring that guilty people do get found guilty and do get punished, to say that the end result must also be considered. I have, for example, great difficulty—I mention this since the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General is here—with the fact that appeal courts can enter verdicts of acquittal where scientific evidence is being questioned.

         A very notorious case in relation to that is the case of the Queen and Raymond Carroll. Carroll was charged with the murder of Deidre Kennedy. It was a shocking crime that occurred in 1973 in Ipswich where a 17&amp;hyphen;month&amp;hyphen;old child was murdered. Carroll was charged quite a number of years after—I think almost 10 years after—with the offence. He was found guilty by a jury but the court of criminal appeal quashed the conviction and entered a verdict of acquittal. In that case, the question of a bite mark on the child's thigh was concerned and the admissibility or reliability of various evidence about that particular matter came into close focus. With the advances in technology that case may well be able to be re&amp;hyphen;opened but for the fact that the court of criminal appeal has pronounced on it.

         Mr TONY SMITH —I am very concerned about the powers of the courts of appeal to enter verdicts of acquittal. I throw that into the melting pot merely to emphasis the fact that in a legislative package like this, we have to think of all of the ends that are sought to be achieved. It is no good having these sorts of procedures which are good, in general, if we do not also look at the powers of the courts of appeal. Generally speaking, I do not believe that a court of appeal ought to have the power to enter a verdict of acquittal, but there are always exceptions.

         Very briefly, in relation to the bill, they are model provisions drawing on the 1989 Coldrey report. It is basically the creation of a code for taking bodily samples for examination. It balances the interest of the public and the rights of the suspect, and there is a great emphasis in the particular legislation on the rights of the suspect. Non&amp;hyphen;consensual examination can occur within strict guidelines. It does end the present reliance upon varying state jurisdictions for their particular legislation. For example, in Queensland it is section 259 of the criminal code. In passing, I would like to have, as a defence lawyer, this particular set of provisions in Queensland instead of section 259, which is a fairly rigid section in terms of the powers that are given to take samples. I do not need to go into it, but the rights of suspects in relation to section 259 of the code are very much circumscribed. But, of course, there is always the supervisory jurisdiction of the court at trial and the exercise of discretionary principles that might arise under Bunning v Cross, and other cases.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I have mentioned before the fact that forensic science is not frozen; it is constantly evolving, and this has to be borne in mind. I have just a couple of concerns about the bill itself—I emphasis again, I have not read it all, unfortunately. I find a couple of inconsistencies in the bill and I think that these should be addressed. Generally, may I say at the outset, there is an awful tendency on the part of legislators, and even at courts of trial, for courts to patronise people of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent. At times, it can become nauseating at the bar table to hear prosecutors asking questions of Aboriginal people in a manner which I do not think is intentional, but gives the impression that they almost believe that the Aboriginal person does not have a brain at all.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I mention that in order to point out something that perhaps should be addressed in the legislation. Clause 23WX, subclauses (1) to (4), and also clause 23XR—by way of looking at the trend in the legislation—cover procedure, of course. Clause 23WX in part reads:

         I have no problem with that provision. But you cannot say that, because a person is an Aboriginal, they are somehow different in terms of knowledge and understanding. So there ought to be a discretion for the applicant to make that assessment: it is quite common in other legislation. Similarly, there is that trend in clause 23XR.

        <para first-indent="16">
         But the time limits in the bill, in relation to people under some disability, are such that the examination for forensic procedures must be carried out within two hours, for a child or an incapable person not in custody. In relation to Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander persons, there is also a two hours mandatory provision. But, for a suspect not covered by either (1) or (2)—that is, not a child, an incapable person, an Aboriginal person or Torres Strait Islander person—the limit is four hours. I see that as inconsistent with the other clauses of the act. Really, there should be a discretion there—to follow the clauses that I have referred to—to permit a longer period if the applicant, the investigating police officer or some person involved in the investigation believes on reasonable grounds that, having regard to the suspect's level of education and understanding, the suspect is not at a disadvantage.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It seems to me to follow; otherwise, you are drawing a distinction between one section of the community and another, and there are plenty of people of European descent who are at great disadvantage in the community, and plenty of people of ethnic and other origins who also are at great disadvantage, and they are not covered. Looking at the rest of the act, I believe there should be a provision that allows a degree of liberality, if you like, so that we are not focusing on one section of the community and patronising it by saying that, somehow or other, that section of the community requires a two&amp;hyphen;hour limit because we accept that that section of the community is simply not generally capable of having the same level of understanding and judgment that another section of the community has.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, from many cases I have done in your neck of the woods up in the South Burnett, there are many people of Aboriginal descent who, in terms of their level of understanding and knowledge, would leave for dead some people of European descent whom I have acted for. On the other side of the coin, there are people of Aboriginal descent who do need great assistance in relation to interview procedures and procedures of this particular nature. It is a matter that really ought to be looked at, to give some sort of consistency to the overall thing. I put that point respectfully, Mr Attorney, and I am sorry for the notice. I did speak to one of the officers only this morning about this. It is something that I think should be looked at, overall.

         Another thing occurred to me: what about the position of transsexuals? I can imagine the case arising where a transsexual person is going to have to be examined. Where do we go, in terms of the act, with that person? That is going to happen. It is not so unusual to find oneself in that situation today, and yet that is really not covered in the bill. After all, we are trying to construct a piece of legislation which will lead to a more effective administration of the criminal justice system.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I have looked generally at other sections. As I say, it is a much more comprehensive piece of legislation, which I generally support—subject to those qualifications and subject to the fact that I have not considered the entirety of the bill. But, generally speaking, I support it as an instrument that balances fairly the needs of the community against the individual rights of the suspect who is being interviewed. Subject to those particular matters and the important matter

          of ensuring that the whole package in the criminal justice system is always looked at when one is introducing measures of this nature, I think, on the whole, it is a valuable piece of legislation in the Commonwealth Crimes Act and one that will, in my view, achieve a good deal of good by ensuring the administration of the criminal justice system.

          —The Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams) commenced his second reading speech by saying that the Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill is long overdue. It does, as previous speakers have indicated, arise from legislation that lapsed when the parliament was prorogued before the last election. As the member for Banks (Mr Melham) indicated, the opposition supports the legislation. On the basis of the bill including some of the proposals that have come out of the Senate committee process, it believes the legislation is in some respects a modest improvement on earlier legislation.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The legislation represents a very important step towards a higher level of commonality between the various criminal justice jurisdictions in Australia. In this area of the law, as the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) indicated, there is not yet adequate commonality. Certainly, this legislation contributes to that and builds on the pioneering work that was done in Victoria and makes it better.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are a whole range of areas in the administration of the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General where evolving commonality is clearly desirable. Perhaps one of the closest examples to the processes involved in this legislation is the national automated fingerprint identification system—and that involves a very important collaborative effort between different jurisdictions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I mention also the evolution of the role of the national exchange of police information process, the operations of the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence and the establishment and work of the National Institute for Forensic Science. There is a range of evolving areas where, as a national parliament and on a bipartisan basis, we ought to be doing everything possible to ensure that this greater degree of commonality between Australian jurisdictions continues to evolve. Obviously, the gun laws, in the context of the discussions here last year, are another important example of that on&amp;hyphen;going evolution of commonality. This legislation, hopefully, will take that process forward in the very important area of forensic procedures.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill also seeks to strike the fundamentally important balance between ensuring the rights of the accused to fairness in the investigation and prosecution processes and ensuring that our law enforcement agencies have the advantage of the most up&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;date technical capacities in relation to investigation and prosecution.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would imagine that the principal application of this legislation will be in the area of biological samples. In the forensic science area there is a range of other technologies that may relevant, including the analysis of textiles, for example, and the analysis of glass or metal specimens taken from crime scenes and the like. But I think it is in the biological specimens area that this will be the most relevant, and that is clearly a rapidly advancing area of technology and one which is very important for the reasons I have suggested. It is certainly a technology that has a very powerful capacity to implicate suspects. It also has, probably even more importantly, a very important power to exculpate or remove a suspect from consideration in relation to a particular offence.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We should not get too carried away by the importance of this—and I will get onto the point of not getting too carried away by the aura of science in a moment. In very serious offences such as murder, the scientific evidence may only be peripheral. In a large number of murder
         <break page="3848" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          cases there would not be much doubt about the identity of the person who carried out the killing. The question before the court is usually one of intent rather than identity.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In relation to matters such as rape, often the courts are not dealing so much with identity or with the act of intercourse that may have occurred, but with the question of consent. The question of consent is often before the court in those matters. One should not be unduly carried away and think that this particular technology is going to solve all the problems, but it is clearly going to be important.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It needs to be understood that the aura of science should not dominate process. Not too long ago, in the United States in particular, serious questions were asked in the courts about DNA sampling. For example, in the early 1990s, arising primarily from a case called the Castro case, the US National Academy of Sciences said that DNA technology was sufficiently questionable for it to call for its non&amp;hyphen;admissibility in relation to court matters.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Earlier in this decade, the Tran case in New South Wales was often talked about as one which raised serious questions about the quality of the DNA evidence being presented in our courts. I am advised by forensic scientists—and I make no pretence of understanding the particular technologies in a scientific sense—that PCR technology is now commonly used in most Australian jurisdictions, though I think there is some doubt about what Tasmania uses. As I understand it, many of the problems related to the adequacy of the scientific techniques and the scientific methodologies of earlier technologies have now been overcome.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I add the cautionary note that forensic science is not without its faults and problems. The most notorious case in recent times in Australia was the Chamberlain case, which led to the 1987 Morling Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Chamberlain Convictions. It was found that the scientific evidence in that particular case was seriously flawed. According to Morling, a number of tests were done without the results being verified. It found that there was a failure to use adequate controls, particularly in testing blood samples from the Chamberlain car.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The commission also found that testing was done on articles from which a clear result could not be expected and that there was a failure to use a control or scientific methodology in such circumstances. The commission found a failure to take adequate account of the effects of heat in a car with the effluxion of time when interpreting test results.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Things have moved on considerably since that time but, nonetheless, as well as the findings of the Morling royal commission in relation to scientific evidence, there has been a range of other cases, such as the Stuart matter in South Australia and the Shannon royal commission, which found reasonable doubt as to the validity of scientific evidence used in the conviction of Edward Charles Splat. The list goes on.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There has been a tendency unfortunately, I would submit, for police, courts and juries to give an aura to scientific evidence. In many cases that aura is undesirable. It has led to a situation where, as a community, we need to make sure that there are rigorous controls in relation to the evolution of that science at all times and that an adequate balance is achieved.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This legislation has considerable merit in that respect but it is a matter that needs to be continuously and rigorously looked at if injustices are to be minimised in the future. It is very important in that process that the commonality of approach between jurisdictions in Australia be rigorously pursued. If there are major problems in scientific evidence in one jurisdiction, that will discredit similar evidence in other jurisdictions. It will create circumstances where not only do innocent people run the risk of being convicted—as was the case in the Chamberlain matter—but where guilty people are not convicted because the evidence is tainted.
         <break page="3849" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          This was the case earlier this decade, in my understanding, in the United States, where, as a result of the Castro case and the position argued by the Academy of Sciences in the US, there was very serious doubt. Guilty individuals who should have been convicted were not convicted because that evidence was not presented.

         There are also questions of costs involved in this process. Once again, we do not want to get carried away, but it can be a very expensive technology. I understand that the Victorian Institute for Forensic Medicine charges something like a couple of hundred dollars to carry out elemental DNA testing. In some circumstances, that can rise significantly higher, so there are limitations on the utility of some of this stuff.

         The bill also provides for the establishment of a database where blood samples are taken from individuals convicted of serious offences. That is going to be an extremely important tool to investigations provided it is properly managed and properly utilised in the same way as the national automated fingerprint identification system. But it is a more complex matter and a more difficult matter than fingerprinting.

Perhaps the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, in winding up this particular debate, might be able to update us as to where the evolution of that particular proposal is. It is clearly a very important one, but it is one that, in the context of forensic evidence generally, because of its importance both in implicating and exculpating suspects, needs to be extraordinarily carefully managed if it is to retain credibility.

         I am sure that the database is not going to be particularly useful in prosecutions. I would have thought that if it was put before a court or a jury that a significant basis for prosecution was that the person had been checked off on the database and a match had been found, that would be clearly indicating to the jury that the person had prior convictions. By definition, a person is not going to be on the database if they have not had a prior conviction. A person is entitled to be tried without the jury having knowledge of prior convictions. How the database will be used in the process of prosecution or what the utility of it is in that respect is very much a matter for discussion. I would welcome any comments from the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General on that. It is quite clear to me at least. I hope that the relevance of the database is going to be for investigation and not for prosecution.

         Overall, the opposition does support the bill, as I indicated at the outset. In fact, the member for Banks indicated that there are some modest improvements in the legislation as a result of the government picking up some of the Senate committee's points. We wish it rapid progress. But I have a feeling that the legislation is going to be back before the parliament in the not too distant future, given the fairly dynamic nature of this area and the evolution of forensic science for some further update, and that seems eminently sensible and appropriate.

          —The Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill 1997 is an example of parliament trying to keep pace with rapidly changing technology. It can be seen in a number of other areas that are readily used today such as the Internet, where our children find it very second&amp;hyphen;nature. I think the older generation has some difficulty coming to grips with it. The problems are then with parliament. With it being prorogued, our major democratic system finally comes round to catching up, as it were, to technology.

         The technology here is not very high flying. There are things as basic as fingerprinting. We have gone so far with DNA identification now that we can actually isolate genes which are

Technology is presenting us with so many moral questions well ahead of our human and moral development to be able to answer any of those questions.

         While you have crime in the community, people's perception of crime escalates. They become very apprehensive about crime, demanding solutions to the problem that is affecting them in their environment. This is true especially of females in that the ordinary use of the community is severely curtailed by apprehension about their movements after dark, thinking, `Am I alone?' or `Is the taxi safe?' Every female suffers some curtailment of her ordinary right to the night by that fear of crime, especially rape and sexual abuse. That severely curtails females' rights to go about their business in society and it changes their behavioural patterns quite considerably.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Women are demanding some action on that. They can see where technology is going. They can see the extraordinary science that is available and they also see a number of alleged criminals beating the rap. Often in a lot of sexual abuse and rape crisis counselling the female is put on trial at the trial rather than the suspect. This sort of technology just facilitates the police roles and meets the public demand for not only apprehension but conviction. This sends a clear message to the community that crime does not pay—`You will be apprehended and the chances of you getting off are very narrow; we will have all sorts of technology to beat you.' Certainly in the future, the way that technology is going, that will be so.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Currently, the forensic procedures we are looking at are really quite basic and non&amp;hyphen;intrusive. I refer to the external examination of the genitalia or anal area, the buttocks, or, in the case of the female, the breasts; the taking of a sample of blood; the taking of a sample of saliva or a sample by buccal swab; the taking of a sample of pubic hair; the taking of a sample by washing from the external genitalia or anal area of the buttocks or, in the case of the female, the breasts; the taking of a sample by vacuum suction; scraping or lifting by tape from the external genital or anal area, the buttocks or, in the case of a female, the breasts; and the taking of a dental impression. These are not really the intrusive types of examination that is available and will get exceptional results.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The dignity of the suspect is also protected in a number of areas in terms of who is able to take that sample. It generally has to be an appropriately qualified person, generally a medical practitioner, a nurse or a dentist. In some cases, such as taking a sample of hair, other than pubic hair, or the taking of handprints, fingerprints, toeprints or footprints, it can be a constable. So we are setting up safeguards to protect the suspect's dignity. Obviously the samples will be taken by individuals of the same sex and there is the option to have the whole procedure videotaped or recorded. Again, that is protecting the suspect. They can decline to have a video taken and, again, that protects their dignity.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is also an important section, clause 23XU, which provides for the sharing of samples with the suspect. In other words, if any samples are collected, the suspect must be given an examinable amount so that he can carry out his own testing procedures, using his own expert. If there is not a sufficient amount taken to provide that, then he is entitled to be present when the appropriately qualified person tests that sample. That is an important preservation of the suspect's rights.

         As the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) said, there is a lot of scepticism about technology today. I think the Lindy Chamberlain case was the classic case. There is scepticism
         <break page="3851" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          about technology: yes it is high tech, yes it is very accurate, but how many people are experts? Whenever you introduce technology into a bureaucracy, and you give it to people who signed up as policemen 20 years ago to organise, there is some standardising that has to occur. There has to be some training and there has to be some expertise developed in the area to satisfy people's wariness of new technology. The classic example is radar traps. We are still having ongoing disputes about the use of radar in order to convict speeding motorists. That technology is still being challenged in the courts and the operators are being found to be wanting in some cases.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When you introduce technology it has to be probably not as current as what is available, but it has to be sufficient that those currently in the field can get up to speed with it, and use it appropriately and accurately. It is the accuracy that is available to us with modern technology that is being sought and demanded by the public. They are demanding not just an apprehension or far flung accusations; they are demanding a conviction. This technology is there and, in the future, I think criminals will be very wary about their prospects of getting away with anything as more and more technology is incorporated into police procedure.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Currently, we have seen a classic move in the drugs scene  where people have gone from secreting a drug in their luggage and passing it through Customs in various forms, to having it on the person, strapped around the body, and now to it actually being in bodily cavities. As technology moves and as police procedures move towards apprehension, the criminals, who do read papers and are aware of the movements and the powers of police, continue to move to avoid them.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These procedures are just one step in the continual process of being able to apprehend and convict people who have committed crimes in our society. I think the member for Maribyrnong had some scepticism about the databases that can be created from these procedures. They are purely statistical and statistics are very important. He mentioned a few in relation to whether it was actually the intercourse in a rape case which was being disputed or whether it was the consent.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         With statistics, police can analyse where their cases are falling down and where further funds need to be spent to repair the holes in the prosecution case. With the statistics which will be collected on that database of samples and of convicted people, we will start being able to profile things. There are safeguards such that personal information relating to that sample can be deleted. It really is a database just to give us more information on crime and to analyse crime, criminals and our actual conviction procedures.

A lot of material has to be tested within a certain time, a lot of material has to be destroyed when it is tested.

         The whole movement today in criminal apprehension is always a balancing act between demands of society for the right to go about their business, and use public areas with immunity, and the individual's right to be treated with dignity, to be innocent until proven guilty and not to have to submit to a number of invasive or intrusive or degrading procedures to prove his innocence or otherwise. It is always a balancing act. This act has certainly got
         <break page="3852" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

You will still see a greater push by victims of violent crime wanting greater powers of investigation and greater certainty in conviction, and procedures where the witness does not have to go through the whole trial again with forensic evidence when a lot of circumstantial evidence is able to be produced which clearly puts the criminal at the scene of the crime. With an act of sexual intercourse or with drugs, it puts them fairly well in a limited narrow sphere where they are relying on defence such as consent or very legal technicalities to get out of it.

         The important message is that the rope is closing. We are doing more. We are moving a fair way down the track to give the night back to females and to really frighten off the criminals with the certainty that they will be caught. We do have national legislation, which will gradually see adoption throughout all the states, where they cannot come to the ludicrous situation that occurred with one of my constituents. The sexual assault occurred in Tasmania, the offender went to Victoria, they moved to New South Wales, and nothing has happened because, out of the three jurisdictions, it all got too complex. Evidence collected in Tasmania would not be admissible in New South Wales.

Within an hour, you are changing states, you are getting out of jurisdiction and you are getting away with murder.

         This bill has been developed after a most exhaustive process of consultation.

         It does provide a comprehensive scheme for obtaining forensic samples, setting out in clear detail the powers and obligations of police and an exhaustive range of safeguards to protect the rights of individuals, with particular provisions for Aboriginal persons, Torres Strait Islanders, children and incapable persons. Unless a suspect gives his or her informed consent after receiving all of the relevant information, including the right to refuse, no intimate procedure may be performed except by order of a magistrate. To make that order, the magistrate must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person
         <break page="3853" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          committed a relevant offence, that is, the same standard as for arrest. However, if a person is in lawful custody, non&amp;hyphen;intimate procedures may be carried out by appropriately qualified persons, as ordered by a senior constable.

         Further safeguards include: time limits for conducting procedures; the right to contact a lawyer and to communicate with him or her in private wherever possible; the right of certain suspects to interview friends; the right to an interpreter when necessary; tape recording of requests to consent and the conduct of procedures, and the provision of full information about the relevant procedure.

         Most importantly, the bill includes a legislative barrier to the admissibility of evidence which is obtained from forensic procedures which are carried out in breach of the legislation. All procedures must be carried out by appropriately qualified persons. There is a right to have a medical practitioner of choice present during most procedures, and a medical practitioner of the same sex if practicable. There are limitations on the numbers of constables that may be present during the carrying out of a forensic procedure and restriction on the presence of opposite sex constables to cases of necessity. There are also comprehensive requirements for the destruction of forensic material after a conviction is secured or charges dropped.

         The government is grateful for what might be described as the lack of opposition by the opposition to the bill, although the member for Banks did indicate that the opposition proposed to monitor the debate in order to see whether the bill could be improved during its passage through parliament. That is, of course, legitimate. It would help that if any deficiencies, or alleged deficiencies, are identified, they are made known to us so that the issue can be addressed and an appropriate answer can be given if there is one.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Recommendation 1 limits the operation of the bill to offences with a maximum penalty of five years or more. This has not been adopted. The relevant offences tend to have maximum penalties of two to five years, being offences against the person in the main.

         Reference is made to dental impressions. I think the member for Banks acknowledged that there had been an advance in technology since the original bill was prepared. Evidence before the committee, I am advised, was in fact outdated and came from the mid&amp;hyphen;1980s. The government has received up&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;date expert advice, which indicates that such evidence, using modern techniques, is both reliable and useful.

         The third recommendation was that the examination of female breasts should only be in relation to alleged offences of over five years maximum penalty. Similar arguments apply to that as I offered in relation to the non&amp;hyphen;adoption of the first recommendation. In certain crimes, especially violent or sexual crimes, evidence may be found on any part of the body, and the government saw no more reason to exclude the female breast area, subject to appropriate safeguards, than any other area of the body.

         Recommendation 9 was to the effect that the suspect definition be confined to persons a constable believes, rather than suspects, on reasonable grounds to have committed a relevant offence.

         The member for Dickson expressed some concern about aspects of the bill relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, particularly the possibly patronising effect or appearance of provisions treating Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders as disadvantaged.

         The member for Maribyrnong expressed some reservations about the reliability of DNA evidence and he raised some questions about databases. The bill does not require a court to admit any forensic evidence and it does not require a jury to give forensic evidence any particular weight.

         Recent criticisms of DNA evidence are an understandable reaction to the widely held but inaccurate view that DNA matching can always conclusively determine guilt or innocence. In fact, the value of DNA evidence varies from case to case, depending on the quality of the sample at the crime scene, the nature of the tests performed and the distinctiveness of the DNA in question.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In some cases DNA evidence will be of little value; in others, it may show a high probability that DNA found at a crime scene is the suspect's DNA. The defence can conduct its own analysis of the defendant's DNA. If it is able to create real uncertainty as to the reliability of DNA evidence on which the prosecution relies, a jury would be unable to find the defendant guilty beyond reasonable doubt.

         In relation to databases, the bill does not establish any database, nor does it require any law enforcement agency to create a database, but it does recognise two kinds of existing databases. The first are identification databases, such as fingerprint databases, which contain a description of certain forensic material and the identity of the person from whom it was obtained. This allows police to match forensic material found at the scene of a crime against material in the database to identify suspects. However, as soon as forensic material is required to be destroyed, all information about that material must be removed from the identification database. All other material will be destroyed if proceedings have been unduly delayed, if the suspect is not
         <break page="3855" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        <para first-indent="16">
         The other type of database that the bill recognises has a quite different purpose. Information about forensic material taken in accordance with the bill may be entered in a statistical database, but only in a form that cannot be used to identify any person. A statistical database of forensic material is a necessity. Much forensic evidence involves comparison with a large sample group. For example, the more DNA records the police have, the more accurately they can state the probability of two samples of DNA having come from the same source.

         A couple of other matters were raised that I think warrant comment, not because they were critical, but in a sense because they were supportive and raised issues of some significance. In the course of raising questions as to the quality of some evidence, in particular DNA evidence, the member for Maribyrnong suggested that science should not dominate the process. I think what I have said in relation to DNA evidence in particular should answer that, in that at the broad level science does not under the rules of evidence dominate the process. And I do not think competent lawyers or courts will allow it to do so. The question of cost does arise, but that is really outside the terms of reference of this particular bill and no doubt will be a matter addressed in other forums, in particular those dealing with legal aid.

         The member for Lindsay perhaps adopted a slightly different approach to some issues than other speakers. That might not be surprising, given that all the other speakers were male and the member for Lindsay is female. The principle that there should be certainty of identification, a high level of skill in investigation and therefore the probability of greater conviction is important in offering the community both assurance of protection and the fact of protection. Women in particular have a perception that there are great risks in the community. Statistically those risks are in fact quite slight and the perception is of a greater risk than there really is. This is well documented by work done by the Australian Institute of Criminology.

         The member for Maribyrnong referred to the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, the National Police and Research Institute and the Institute of Forensic Science and made the point that there is cooperation between different law enforcement agencies and, in particular, police forces, through these cooperative bodies. That is a very important point to be made. I think we could also add there that the Institute of Criminology, with its Criminology Research Council, similarly operates, in effect, as a cooperative body. There is a great deal of cooperation between the different law enforcement agencies.

         The existence of the ABCI, for example, enables the possible setting up—to give another example—of a paedophile database. The existence of the National Exchange of Police Information, another cooperative body, was crucial in setting up appropriate uniform procedures for registration and licensing of firearms under the uniform gun laws that have been introduced in the last 12 months.

         The uniformity of law that would arise if each jurisdiction adopts a bill based on this model, a model developed by the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee, would be undoubted, a point emphasised by the member for Lindsay.

          —The Child Support Act and associated regulations are by their very nature complex and technical, and they deal with very emotionally charged issues. The task of the Child Support Agency is, of course, an enormous one. It has responsibility for most areas of child support, from regulation to assessment, to collection of child support and payment to the custodial parents. It must also assess and adjudicate on any request for a variation of child support liability, based either on an estimate of changed circumstances or on any other review grounds contained within the act.

         There have been a number of problems with the Child Support Act, many of which were identified in the 1994 report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. Of course, those of us working in our electorate offices have people coming in daily talking to us about the human consequences of the problems of dealing in this highly vexed area and the act as it now stands.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The amendments contained in the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996, which is before the committee today, are designed to ensure that the child support system continues to evolve to meet its objectives in the future as best it can. They represent a number of commonsense administrative changes which were flagged by the joint select committee that I have just referred to.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In particular, the Child Support Act was introduced to address the need for a better, more informed system of ensuring that a parent's child support and child maintenance obligations are assessed accurately and met regularly. The underlying principle of the child support system
         <break page="3857" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          is that both parents, custodial and non&amp;hyphen;custodial, have a joint obligation to provide for the care and upkeep of their children as best they can.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When the child support legislation was first introduced, the stated objectives of the cabinet subcommittee on maintenance and child support were that: non&amp;hyphen;custodial parents share in the cost of supporting their children according to their capacity to pay; adequate support is available to all children not living with both parents; Commonwealth expenditure is limited to the minimum necessary for ensuring that those needs are met; work incentives to participate in the labour force are not impaired; and the overall arrangements are non&amp;hyphen;intrusive to personal privacy and are simple, flexible and efficient. These principles remain the guiding force in the government's consideration of the child support scheme and any reforms that are necessary. In particular, the final objective is addressed by these amendments being debated today.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 contains three main changes. These changes are to the estimates provisions, the employer withholding provisions and the treatment of child support liabilities by the Family Court. The bill also includes consequential changes to child support legislation to reflect changes made in the Social Security Act 1991, the Family Law Act 1975 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. These changes are aimed at increasing flexibility for the Child Support Agency and for the parents involved, reducing the level of intrusiveness, and improving certainty and the clarity of the law.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Currently, where the Child Support Agency is involved in the assessment of child support, it calculates the amount to be paid based on the non&amp;hyphen;custodial parent's income from two years ago. This figure is offset against the income of the custodial parent once that income reaches a certain threshold.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the difficulties with this situation is that a person's economic and employment circumstances can change dramatically within a two&amp;hyphen;year period. People may find themselves in a situation where the amount of child support that they are paying is much higher than if they were assessed on their current income—or, alternatively, it could be much lower.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Currently, to address this problem, the child support system incorporates an estimate procedure. Either parent can apply for a variation of child support payments if they believe that their income in the current year will vary by more than 15 per cent. The reassessment is then backdated to the end of the previous financial year.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This process is fraught with practical difficulties. It often means that the custodial parent has to refund to the non&amp;hyphen;custodial parent money that they have already spent on the care and upkeep of their children. It could have been spent on education, clothing, food, sporting activities or housing. It also may mean that the parent paying child support has to repay much of the amount which would be refunded later in the year when they may not be in a position to do so. So it is very often a lose&amp;hyphen;lose situation, and it affects not just the parents, but the children. It may cause tensions and stress, as well as economic hardship.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The provisions contained in the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 will amend the effect of an income estimate election to make it less likely that a person receiving child support will be asked to repay amounts in the future, and they will make the effect of an income estimate election a much more accurate reflection of a paying parent's capacity to pay.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Revised assessments, on the basis of an estimate, will apply only from the date that the estimate is lodged. These amendments allow that a custodial parent will not have to refund money that they have already received but, rather, any overpayment will reduce the amount
         <break page="3858" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          that the non&amp;hyphen;custodial parent is required to pay for the remainder of the year. The only exception to this would be when the amount payable, after the readjustment, is actually lower than the amount that has already been paid.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another important change is that non&amp;hyphen;custodial parents, when unemployed for part of the year, will not have to pay child support. The revised income estimate will be used by the Child Support Agency to reassess the amount of child support payable for that year. These measures, it is important to note, do not actually change the amount of child support that a person is liable to pay. They simply change the way in which any reassessments affect the timing of liabilities and ensure they reflect the person's ability to meet their child support obligations at any given time. These changes therefore address one of the main disadvantages for custodial parents who are having to repay child support that they have received and spent in good faith. It is a significant change for custodial parents, particularly those who may have a variable income.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Such amendments are of particular importance for many people in my electorate where we have numbers employed as seasonal workers. It is very difficult for seasonal workers in the food producing, fruit picking and transport sector—which is very subject to seasonality—to accurately forecast what their income will be from one year to the next. Seasonal workers are often given short notice as to extension of their employment—extra overtime in the factory, some night work. Due to the uncharacteristically good season, they might find themselves with many more weeks of work than they had expected, at a higher pay.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Many of these people are anxious to meet their child support obligations, as are all parents. Ensuring that they do not accumulate large arrears debts is also a major concern for them. Under the current system, if they lodge an estimate at the time their income is about to increase, the increased amount of child support is backdated to the end of the financial year. This can then be a disincentive for additional work. While parents are prepared to pay additional child support when their circumstances improve, being hit immediately with an arrears debt and even further increased payments is often unfair, and is certainly felt as unfair.

         The Child Support Agency can collect child support in a number of ways. Another option for collection is that the paying parent pays the amount directly to the Child Support Agency. There is also the possibility for parents to reach a private arrangement between themselves as to the amount and payment of child support. In these cases, the support agency will not intervene unless the custodial parent has applied for a means tested social security benefit, for example, a supporting mother's pension or disability support pension. In these cases, the Child Support Agency must make a child support assessment.

         The evidence given to the 1994 Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues found that approximately one&amp;hyphen;third of separated parents are clients of the Child Support Agency, while the rest have made private child support agreements. The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 seeks to amend the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 to allow a payer of child support to make payments directly to the child support registrar in certain circumstances. Obviously, the main criteria will be that the registrar is
         <break page="3859" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          satisfied that the person will meet their child support obligations. These are simple administrative measures, but they have some very important effects.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         At present, the Child Support Agency is often seen as invading the privacy of a non&amp;hyphen;custodial parent when it takes employer withholding action. Even though that parent might have the very best intentions towards their family, they still feel a great sense of being accused of wrongdoing and wrong intent.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These changes will reduce the intrusive nature of the child support collection process in many cases. The changes also provide greater flexibility in the way the child support payments are collected, which we expect will substantially reduce administrative costs. The changes will also reduce the compliance costs placed on employers who are directed to withhold child support payments, as more people will now be allowed to pay directly to the Child Support Agency if these amendments are passed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Such changes are especially important given the government's commitment to reducing paperwork and the costs for small businesses. While it may be relatively easy for large employers to meet their withholding obligations under the child support system, it is a further burden on small employers, especially when in many cases it is not necessary for them to be involved at all. This is particularly a problem where you have family members—perhaps the family of the custodial parent—employing the non&amp;hyphen;custodial parent. Matters of privacy can become very important. In having to be directly involved in maintenance payments, there can be a lot of inter&amp;hyphen;family stress.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is important to ensure that children are never disadvantaged in the event that child support is not paid on time, or at all. The child support register will maintain the primary responsibility to ensure the collection of child support in a timely manner. This, of course, is as it should be.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The amendments provide for strict safeguards in the event of default. If a person elects to pay directly to the Child Support Agency and then defaults in payment, there are a number of important safeguards in place which are to ensure that the children are not disadvantaged by the failure of non&amp;hyphen;custodial parents to meet their child support obligations. If a person does default, the CSA can require that child support be withheld by a person's employer in the future and a payer will not be able to make another election for direct payment for six months.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In most cases, payers who default after choosing to pay directly to the registrar, will have strictly limited future access to this provision. Where a person applies for direct payment to the registrar and this application is refused—presumably on the basis of a history of default—this person will not be able to apply for direct payment again for two months.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These amendments reflect recommendations 55 and 57 of the joint select committee report and remove the situation where, under section 43 of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act, the child support registrar is required, as far as practicable, to collect child support from the wages of the employed, liable parents.

         I understand that the practice of the Child Support Agency, in compliance with this legislation, is that, as soon as they become, or are made aware, of the employer of a non&amp;hyphen;custodial parent, they take action to commence employer withholding. Often the first notification that the person has that their salary is being withheld to meet their child support obligations is when they receive a reduced pay packet, or their employer advises them of the notice that they have received to make these deductions. That is hardly fair and, as I said
         <break page="3860" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          before, can lead to very substantially exacerbated tensions between the parents of the child. In this case, of course, the child suffers as much as the parents.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Evidence presented by the Child Support Agency to the joint select committee indicated that there had been an improved level of voluntary compliance. For example, it was reported that 56 per cent of all child support liabilities registered under the scheme were paid on time and that almost half of these were paid without the use of automatic withholding. It is important that parents are given the opportunity, where appropriate, to pay their child support voluntarily, and these amendments help to make that happen.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill will also amend the Family Law Act. The amendments will mean that the court can take child support liability into account when ruling on property and spousal maintenance issues, even where a child support assessment has not been issued. This will help to ensure that property settlements more accurately reflect the true situation of both the parties and take into account the impact that future child support liabilities may have upon the non&amp;hyphen;custodial parent's financial situation.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It is clearly desirable in family law matters that parties reach agreement on pivotal issues such as child support. However, the current arrangements mean that parties must apply for a child support assessment—even where they wish to make private arrangements—before the court can take into account those commitments when making orders regarding property or spousal maintenance. These amendments reflect the position that all parents should be treated in the same manner, and we support that strongly.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I support the changes proposed today as practical and sensible amendments to the child support legislation. The business of taking care of children in a situation of separated parents is one that the state must overview—in this case the nation—but we must also give parents the greatest possible chance to continue to live in harmony so that their harmonious relationships offer the best possible chance of parenting to their children.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In particular, I should also add that we believe that these amendments are supported by both sides of the House and we believe that they have had a strong investigation by both parties in previous times as joint select committees have worked through the issues. In particular, these amendments give parents dignity and a greater chance to continue cooperative relationships. I therefore commend the bill to the Main Committee.

          —As the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) has indicated, there are few areas of government responsibility that raise emotions more than matters pertaining to family law. Certainly, since its introduction, the Child Support Act has created a lot of angst within the Australian community. It is an act that is in need of reform, there is no doubt about that.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Before going on to those matters, however, I think it is important to recognise that the system we have today is much better than the system we had previously. The introduction of the Child Support Act was probably the biggest shake&amp;hyphen;up in terms of family law in this country since the introduction of the Family Law Act of 1975. It was an important initiative, one which has delivered to this country a much better system than we had previously.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It addressed the high cost of applying for maintenance before the courts in this country. We must remember that, before the introduction of the scheme, only about 26 per cent of sole parents were in receipt of some form of maintenance from the non&amp;hyphen;custodial parent. It addressed the problem of the lack of indexing of the commitments of non&amp;hyphen;custodial parents as determined by courts of the land.

          It overcame the difficulties inherent in enforcing court orders. We can now rely upon the tax system and the powers of the Child Support Agency to ensure that non&amp;hyphen;custodial parents in this country make their contribution, quite rightly, to the children they have fathered or mothered. The previous situation was unacceptable. We had a situation in this country where it was the taxpayer generally, through the provision of the sole parents pension, that was carrying the maximum weight of the cost of raising these children, rather than the responsibility being sheeted home to the person responsible for fathering or mothering the child, that person no longer having contact.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The scheme was a very important initiative and I think that, as a matter of principle, it enjoys the support of both sides of this parliament. But it is desperately in need of reform. That is why today I am supporting in this place the amendments put forward by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). This bill, while I welcome its initiatives and while I am happy to say that it will go some way towards addressing some of the inadequacies of the scheme, does not go far enough. It fails rather poorly to pick up the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. I know that a number of those on the other side will say that the former Labor government failed to put them into practice, but we were getting there. Many of them were introduced or picked up, and the reform process was continuing.

          The Child Support Agency was a great ogre in the eyes of many on the other side when they were in opposition. Now, 14 months into this government, what we see is this Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996, which does very little indeed to address the inadequacies of the system. I point that out to members on the other side with some great pleasure.

           —My team introduced the scheme in the first place. You will remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the success of the scheme was originally underestimated. No&amp;hyphen;one ever dreamed that the success of the child support scheme would be so large. It was originally under&amp;hyphen;administered; not enough money was going into the scheme to enable those very hardworking members of that area of government to properly administer the scheme. That is slowly being addressed.

          The former Labor government picked up many of the recommendations of the joint select committee, and that process was ongoing. Having heard the whining from the other side when they were in opposition, this is their attempt at fixing up the child support scheme. They are making a few very minor changes which I welcome, as I said, but they are going to do very little to address the problems faced by both custodial and non&amp;hyphen;custodial parents in this country.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I note that, very subtly, many of them have raised concerns that they have on a wider basis. They have all given examples of how they continue to experience problems with the system, particularly with respect to non&amp;hyphen;custodial parents, and yet their bill before the House today does very little to address those problems—and there are plenty of problems.

           that I think the pendulum has swung too far the other way. It was the case that, prior to the introduction of the scheme, the non&amp;hyphen;custodial males were getting away with murder. They were being carried by the Australian taxpayer. Now, instead of the pendulum swinging back to the centre, I think it has gone a little too far the other way. Now there are too many male, non&amp;hyphen;custodial parents out there with problems—and, indeed, female, non&amp;hyphen;custodial parents as well. Although I have not come across them, I am sure they are out there.

          I know how dangerous it is to say this because I know that whenever someone prefaces a racial remark by saying, `But, let me say, I am not a racist,' I immediately come to the conclusion that they are. My preface in signalling my concerns about non&amp;hyphen;custodial parents is not going to help me much, but I felt an obligation to say it. I also feel an obligation to say that the system is acting as a disincentive to many workers because, over time, it is not a proposition to them anymore; it is not worth their while.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The system is leaving many non&amp;hyphen;custodial parents with no opportunity to start again. It is leaving them without the financial means to start life again. And, of course, those financial strains also flow on to strains on the relationship with their second partners and, subsequently, this can lead to a second breakdown and another child support liability—and it goes on and on. For the non&amp;hyphen;custodial parent, the whole thing can be disastrous.

          The scheme does not take into account a child's income. Theoretically, if I separated from my wife, I could have a 17&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old child earning $80,000 a year and still have a liability to my ex&amp;hyphen;wife. It does not take into account the income of the new partner of the custodial parent: if I had an ex&amp;hyphen;wife, she could be living with or be remarried to someone earning $1 million a year and yet my liability to my children would not change. Obviously, in those situations, my commitment should remain. I should always have a liability to my children—and I am pretty confident that most non&amp;hyphen;custodial parents believe they should have, too—but commonsense must prevail.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          With the introduction of the actual means test used to assess one's eligibility for Austudy, we now take into account much more the direct income stream of the parents involved. We look at a few other functions as well, including their expenditure patterns and other liabilities they might have as a family. It would make a lot of sense to apply those same principles to the child support legislation because, for example, it does not now take into account the cost incurred by the non&amp;hyphen;custodial parent at those times when he or she enjoys the company of the children. When you are estranged from your children, you want to give them the very best during those short periods you have with them. You want to treat them; you want to take them out; you want to take them to the show, and you want to buy them good things. Under the child support scheme, your liability does not take into account the cost involved.

         <para first-indent="16">
          So I think there is some scope for some big changes there. Probably the more important point to make is that we in this place should be talking about family law generally rather than restricting ourselves to amendments to the child support scheme. For example—just to quote one case—I have a very distressed constituent who has a child support liability to, I think, six children. He is a coalminer and therefore enjoys a pretty reasonable income. But his liability to child support is very large, as you can imagine.
         </para>

          He is not complaining about that; he pays almost happily. What he is concerned about is the welfare of his children. When the custody was being determined, while his ex&amp;hyphen;wife enjoyed the benefits of the support of legal aid, he did not. He was forced to represent himself before the Family Court and his child support liability was so large that he was left with no money

          So where does my constituent turn? He cannot go back to the courts to appeal the custody decision because he has no money, mainly because of his child support liability.

          But, as the member for Werriwa points out in his amendment, this bill reflects the absolute lack of commitment on the part of the government to address the real issues contained within the child support legislation. It displays absolutely their unwillingness, now that they are in government, to address the real issues in terms of family law and, while we are not denying the bill a second reading, of course, I think that it is important to highlight that fact. I commend the amendments of the member for Werriwa to the House.

In every suburb throughout the electorate people are experiencing contact with the Child Support Agency. The marriage and relationship education courses in Frankston and other Peninsula locations are offering people improved encouragement so that they do not find themselves in the situation of having to separate from their children and from their partners, and basically to help them get on with the rest of their lives. The Child Support Agency is an important part of the institutional framework that seeks to ensure that the children of discontinued relationships continue to be cared for and develop with the support of both parents, where their parents move on to pursue separate lives.

         What I like about this child support legislation is that it seeks to further humanise this institutional framework with changes that ensure that the legal and administrative arrangements can take account of real people's lives and their individual circumstances. The bill before this committee will not be the last word on changes to the child support scheme or family law. It is a partial response to some of the recommendations from the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, whose November 1994 report has been well documented. It is the

         It is interesting to look at some of the remarks members opposite are making, and particularly the amendments offered by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham).

         As a member elected in 1996, I am well aware that this inquiry received 6,197 submissions, the highest ever for any parliamentary committee in our country. I remind the House that non&amp;hyphen;custodial parents made 3,292 submissions, or 53 per cent of the submissions, and custodial parents 32 per cent. Further changes are required to respond fairly and effectively to the many issues raised during the inquiry and since then, and I am committed to pursuing them.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 is a start. Today's bill addresses three areas. It aims to make income estimate elections notified by parents paying child support a more accurate reflection of their ability to pay. So when a payer's income drops more than 15 per cent, and they lodge an income election, their future liability will be reduced, rather than the complicated and annoying system that operates at present. This will lessen the chances of parents who receive child support already spending the money but not being aware that the paying parents income election has changed the amount of moneys effectively due.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Fewer payees will be required to repay overpaid amounts of child support, and payers who are unemployed for part of the year will not be required to pay child support. The child support system will be better able to accommodate changing circumstances of the non&amp;hyphen;custodial parents. As I was saying, this change will help to avoid the hardship created when the agency seeks to recover payments from custodial parents who may well have already spent the money on raising the children.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Secondly, the bill seeks to reduce the big brother nature of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 where it is unnecessary. The amendment allows child support payers with a good record to make payments directly to registrars rather than going through employers. Importantly, a person must have a good payment record before he or she can make payments in this way. If a default occurs, payers will not be able to remit moneys directly to the registrar for another six months. In the meantime, they will have to revert to garnishee orders through their employer as a penalty.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Finally, the Family Law Act is to be amended to enable people voluntarily paying child support to have that taken into account when the Family Court is making a property or spouse maintenance order. No longer will court orders fail to reflect the true circumstances of a person already paying child support. This measure will remove the current disincentive for parents of goodwill towards each other after a separation who have amicably entered into an arrangement for a child's care only to have these private arrangements ignored when the Family Court makes orders.

         As with most members, my office receives case after case of constituents' concerns regarding child support and family law. I would just like to compliment all the staff in electorate offices from all sides of the House who have to deal with these cases. They are often very emotional, very highly charged and very difficult to deal with, and I extend congratulations and best wishes to the staff of the Child Support Agency who I suspect experience similar exchanges with people involved with the system.

         I want to point to a couple of examples. They highlight how the difficulty with the Child Support Agency is not typically skewed to one party, whether it is a matter of gender or custodial responsibilities. I have a constituent in Mornington who says it is all too easy for custodial parents to deny access, to make false accusations and have them acted upon through intervention orders.

        <para first-indent="16">
         My constituent says there is no accountability and there is no deterrent against vexatious accusations that are costly to defend. He asserts that people can perjure themselves in the Family Court with apparent immunity. If you do not have the means to be able to take that matter further, then simply your access to your family members is curtailed because of those accusations.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I have a female constituent in Karingal who has equally valid concerns. Her case is more complicated—it dates back almost a decade. Some ambiguous, badly drafted order from the Family Court has been interpreted by the Child Support Agency in such a way that she is now faced with having to refund over $3,000 of payments. I doubt, quite sincerely, that there has been an overpayment at all. It again shows the difficulty that many people experience with their interaction between the Family Court and the Child Support Agency.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When we turned to the Family Court for assistance it was unable to access any records to shed any light on this case. Now this person has the difficulty of not only raising the children but also having the fear of the $3,000 hanging over them, which the Child Support Agency asserts—and I greatly doubt—needs to be refunded. The performance of the Child Support Agency has improved; I will not go over that, but it is an encouraging sign.

         This is the first step and there is more work to be done. I cannot see how people can expect to look for better behaviour from people who have gone through a difficult, emotional, and often very financially significant, experience such as a separation, if the system is not structured to encourage it. Far too many non&amp;hyphen;custodial parents come into my office, despairing at the difficulty they are having in re&amp;hyphen;establishing their lives. They have moved on to new relationships, they may even have new families, but because of some of the arrangements that are in place at present they find it very difficult to make a fresh start.

         They point to the way that entitlements and payments are calculated and that the circumstances of the other former partner are not taken into account in the same way in which their own are. The capacity of both former parents to contribute to the raising of the child does not seem to be equally investigated. At the end of the day that is the key; it is what is in the best interests of the child.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Far too many people come into my office—excuse me if these terms are unparliamentary—and elect to take the `stuff it' option. It is just too much for them.

One partner explained to me how, upon separation, all the family furniture and the family house was provided to the parent who was going to continue the primary custodial duty.

But every time that extra effort is made, more of the resources go out of that person's pocket into the custodial person's pocket, in the non&amp;hyphen;custodial person's eyes without due cause. That person is saying, `Hang on, the capacity to raise the children is something that we share; it's a responsibility we both have to bear, and as our lives move on, surely the circumstances of both of the original parents should play a larger role in calculating the child support payments.'

         I was somewhat disappointed that some very constructive measures that the subcommittee of government backbenchers put to the government were not incorporated in the budget. Some members on the other side might find that as an opportunity to have a go at us. But what I am suggesting to you is that work is going on; we understand that there are problems here.

         But my message to the government is that we have not gone away, that those concerns remain, and our efforts to address them will continue. The great disappointment in the motion of the member for Werriwa and the contribution of the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) is that they were simply carping away, saying there were issues that have not been resolved—that is right; we understand that—just as the more contentious recommendations in the joint standing committee's report were left on the shelf by the previous Labor government. There is no gain in their contributions. There are families out there battling to make ends meet and that contribution is absolutely useless to the task that is before us. I encourage all those members opposite who have a contribution to make, to make it in a positive way. These are real people's lives and they are doing it pretty hard out there.

         In sticking with the theme of encouraging people to do the right thing, the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) outlined, in his contribution, some of the ideas that we have been working through. These include: the way entitlements are calculated; how income is treated; what level of payment should be made once someone gets to 2&amp;half; times the average weekly earnings; how the custodial parents' circumstances change and how they should be addressed; the amount of exempt income so that people can get on with their lives; and the cost of raising children. If the task of raising the child is beyond the means of the two partners, we then have to look at whether our family payments system is supporting the raising of that child.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Payments for child support should represent one of the first obligations all non&amp;hyphen;custodial parents have. If, after making those payments, their circumstances leave them in such an impoverished state that they are not able to carry on with their own lives, and perhaps the raising of other children that have come about from a subsequent relationship, we should take that into account. That costs money. We have to argue our case well and we are endeavouring to do that. I respect the government's role in making sure we are not doing anything too hasty that is not going to improve the situation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The issue about how reviews are conducted also troubles me. From the research I have done, the approach of the Child Support Agency seems to vary from state to state. I wonder whether it is not time to introduce the same sort of statement of principles you see operating in the Department of Veterans' Affairs so that all cases are dealt with equitably.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In a state such as mine, a review application for child support payments far too often sees arrears wiped off. The fact is that it is money that the custodial parents would and should have had in their pockets to help with the raising of the child but it is wiped off. I understand that
         <break page="3867" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         I also believe there is an argument that says the question of visitation to children should be linked with people's performance in honouring their child support obligations. For people who cannot see their way clear to honour those obligations, I think there is an argument that says that the benefits and the joy of being involved with the development of your child should be curtailed. People say that that is harsh and unfair but, at the end of the day, it is about making sure the resources are available for the education, learning, training, growth, feeding, clothing and housing of the young child. If people cannot see their way clear to honour those responsibilities, I wonder whether they should be able to have as active a part in the rearing of that child.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But there is a flip side to that for those non&amp;hyphen;custodial parents who are paying their way, and who find themselves in a situation where the custodial parent decides to move to Queensland with the child, which is often the case in the sunny Mornington Peninsula—sadly, some do not appreciate the beauty of our environment. I try to understand what it would be like if, heaven forbid, my relationship broke down and I was not able to have a role in the development of my child. I would consider that an enormous loss.

         I would want the opportunity to make a contribution in the development of something that I have played a part in creating so that needs to be weighed into the equation. If that means that the cost of gaining access to the child has to be somehow reflected in the payments, so be it. If that means that the non&amp;hyphen;custodial parent has to look at those visitation rights, and if it means that the Family Court and the Child Support Agency have to consider how they can more effectively interact so that the two sets of issues mesh more comfortably, then we should also be looking at that. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

The changes were necessitated by the proposed demolition of the power station chimneys near James Rocks which, because of their high visibility, had been used as a VFR entry point to Jandakot Airport for aircraft arriving from the

However, commencement of the field work associated with the social survey and measurement of aircraft noise was delayed due to unseasonably wet winter conditions in Perth which reduced activity levels at Jandakot, together with a community view that aircraft noise levels and the impact of aircraft noise on local residents would be more effectively assessed in the busier spring and summer months. Analysis of the field data then took longer to complete than originally scheduled by the consultant, which has led to a delay in completion of the study.

        (4) Section 235 of the Customs Act 1901 already provides that where a person is convicted of importing a commercial quantity of an illicit drug, he or she may be imprisoned for life. Subsection 4B(2A) of the Crimes Act 1914 provides that where the offence provides for a maximum penalty of life imprisonment the person may also be fined up to $200,000. Further, there are extensive powers in Division 3 of Part XII of the Customs Act 1901 to confiscate property (such as motor vehicles, aeroplanes and boats) used in the commission of drug offences and to impose pecuniary penalties which allow the Commonwealth to deprive the offender of his/her benefits derived from commercial drug dealing through the sale of property. In view of the existing penalties, there is not much scope for increasing them. However, with the Attorney-General's encouragement all drug offences (State, Territory and Commonwealth) have been reviewed as part of the Model Criminal Code exercise. It is expected that a discussion paper on serious drug offences will be released by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in the near future. The paper will look at ways of improving the effectiveness of our laws and reducing differences between State, Territory and Commonwealth drug laws.

                   Provide advice to the Minister and the Department regarding an industrial relations strategy for the implementation of waterfront reform. The Government is committed to reform on the waterfront and in the shipping industry. The Industrial Relations legislation will form the basis for these reforms but a strategy will be needed to ensure the competitiveness of the waterfront and shipping reaches international standards. The successful implementation of these reforms, with the minimum disruption to the national economy, will need to take account of likely responses from the union movement and the approach taken by the industry, states and the users. Internal resources with the specific skills to conduct this evaluation were not available within the Department.

In the period leading to sale, the Commission and management must continue to operate the organisation while at the same time selling it. The Government initially planned to restructure AN and install a new management team at AN for the period leading to the sale. It was necessary put this role to tender. A consultant was required to assist in the preparation of a request for tender and draft the Consultancy Brief to facilitate the proposed restructure of AN. The Department did not have the resources or the specialised skills to progress these tasks effectively.

                   Investigate the factors relevant to female drivers' involvement in serious injury crashes. While female drivers have a lower risk than male drivers of involvement in a fatal crash, their risk of involvement in a crash resulting in serious injury is actually higher. The Institute for Gender and Health at the University of Newcastle will undertake a survey of 5,000 women to identify socio- economic, mental health and physical health factors related to risk. The results of the study will be used to frame Government policy on female drivers.

A need for training was identified for staff undertaking a project to assess the adequacy of rail and road infrastructure on major Australian transport corridors to the year 2020. Staff with adequate expertise to carry out this training were not available within the Department. The objectives of the course were to provide participants with a good understanding of current basic engineering concepts and techniques in Australia. The necessary skills to pass on this knowledge were not available in the BTCE or the Department and it was necessary to obtain the training through a consultant.

        (2) (a) School education in Australia is the constitutional responsibility of the State and Territory Governments, and as such the Commonwealth does not intervene in specific curriculum matters.

        In 1989, the State, Territory and Commonwealth Ministers of Education endorsed ten common and agreed national goals for schooling in Australia. Part of this strategy involves Health and Physical Education, which aims to expand students' knowledge and understanding of a range of issues, including "the role of food". This learning area includes a study of food's nutritional value, dietary trends and other factors that influence dietary practices, and as such provides an opportunity to educate Australian children about the importance of healthy dietary habits. All States and Territories are implementing some version of this strategy in their own systems.

        The NNESP undertook intensive research and development in the area of health, food and nutrition education in schools over the period from December 1992 to June 1995 with the aim of encouraging health promoting behaviour in the area of food and nutrition in students from kindergarten to year 12 throughout Australia. The project maintains that students must not only develop food and nutrition knowledge, but must also develop skills in critical thinking, decision making, problem solving, food preparation, food selection and advocacy. The project is now in its second phase with educators being trained in providing the necessary skills to students.

The activities proposed to be undertaken within the project aim to build capacity to support the health promoting schools concept at local, state and national levels.

        I will be shortly releasing the report of the Vietnam Veterans Mortality Study which will provide substantial information about deaths of male Vietnam veterans. The report analyses the 3,249 deaths that were reported in Australia up to 31 December 1994.

        (1) The Department of Defence has advised that most Australian personnel served in Vietnam between 23 May 1962 and 11 January 1973, a small guard unit remained in the Embassy until 1 July 1973 and some RAAF personnel served during the evacuation of the Embassy in April 1975.

        (3) Of the 58,230 male Army, Navy and Air Force personnel who served in Vietnam 499 died in Vietnam. A further 3,249 died between the time they returned to Australia and 31 December 1994.

        (5) I do not know how many personnel committed suicide in Vietnam. The mortality study identified 242 deaths of Vietnam veterans due to suicide since returning to Australia, but estimates that the actual number may be around 280 (the report of the mortality study elaborates on this point in greater detail). The number of identified suicide deaths by year of death are detailed in the following table:

The balance, of $102,000 was forwarded to the then New South Wales Department of Urban Affairs and Planning in June 1995, following signature of an Agreement between the two governments on 16 June 1995. The Agreement set out responsibilities regarding the assessment and nomination process. As required by the Agreement, the New South Wales government was responsible  for the disbursement of all funds. The New South Wales Government also made contributions to the project from various State agencies.

        Note: The number of ASO4 positions increased from 62 on 1 March 1996 to 409 on 1 March 1997. This increase was related to the implementation of point of contact decision making in February 1997. Consequently, 232 positions were created in the Geelong Teleservice Centre. At 1 March 1997 only 46 of these positions were occupied pending selection of staff.

        The measure to introduce a single classification system and assessment instrument across the residential care sector from 1 July 1997 will ensure that residents will be funded according to their care needs no matter where they are. The development of this new instrument will take proper account of both the physical and mental frailty of residents and match this to an appropriate level of funding. Consistent with and complementary to the Reform Package is the National Carer Action Plan which aims to improve support for carers, including carers of People with dementia.
