         The transfer of the University of Canberra from Commonwealth to ACT jurisdiction was first proposed by the University of Canberra. The university considers that its future is bound up with the growth and development of the ACT, since the university is a key provider of professional education and advice in education and research. The transfer will bring the university closer to ACT activities such as infrastructure and land development, health education and the ACT school system.

         The Commonwealth and the ACT governments agree that there will be considerable benefits to the university and the Canberra community in the university being more closely identified with the city. The university's comprehensive undergraduate teaching programs and expanding presence in graduate education, research and international education services are of great importance to the continued economic and cultural life of the city. There are strong mutual benefits to be obtained from facilitating collaboration between the university and territory government agencies, businesses and community organisations.

           —by leave—The Charter of Budget Honesty Bill had its genesis in a recommendation from a previous report of the Joint Public Accounts Committee in the previous parliament. That report was tabled in November 1995. I believe that the government had adequate opportunity, if it wanted to, to adopt the recommendations of that report. It did not so do. It was left to this government upon election to adopt the principle of the charter of budget honesty. In adopting that principle, it then embodied the principle in the legislation of this bill. In the budget speech on 20 August 1996, the Treasurer said:

         <para style="Para">
          The reason why this charter of budget honesty is being introduced and given effect is so that no other government will ever be placed in that position again. As I said in my speech on this bill in this House, I did not believe that this bill ought to be referred to the JCPA; but the Senate in its wisdom so did and we reported.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As honourable members are aware, the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill was referred to the JCPA on 3 March for tabling today. As a consequence of this tight deadline, the committee held only one public hearing, taking evidence from the stakeholders in the public sector and from peak representative groups in the private sector. Those groups which were unable to attend managed to make submissions within our tight timetable.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The committee supports the framework in the bill as it implements mechanisms for improving the accountability and transparency of government fiscal policy objectives, strategies and outcomes. The JCPA believes that the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill is another element in the improvement of the overall fiscal accountability framework. Transparency is the essence of such a framework, and this bill legislates for the provision of regular

          Mr Speaker, it should be noted that there is no opposition to this bill as such in the House. The opposition has been supportive of the need for such a charter as was indicated during the second reading debate in this House. Although for 13 years they did not adopt one, they support the adoption by this government. It is very simple to support these measures in opposition, but it is another thing to have the intestinal fortitude to introduce them and to give them effect when in government.

         <para first-indent="16">
          During its review of the bill, the committee encountered widespread general support and very little criticism. However, there are several important aspects which I wish to draw to the parliament's attention.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Schedule 1, clauses 12(3), 16(3), 19(2) and 24(3): while the committee applauds the requirement for fiscal reports to be prepared in accordance with recognised external reporting standards, the committee believes firmly that the reasons for any deviations from those standards should be fully explained in the reports.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Schedule 1, clauses 12(4), 16(5) and 24(5): although the committee recognises the need to suppress information of a confidential commercial or national security nature, it believes that a statement providing a general description of the information being suppressed and its aggregate amount should be included in the reports.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Schedule 1, clauses 13, 17, 28 and 32: the committee is pleased that the fiscal reports being legislated by this bill provide an approximation of whole&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;government reporting. However, the above named clauses enable Commonwealth agencies to withhold information. Where this occurs, then a statement showing the effect of this omission and its aggregate amount should be included in the reports.

          Schedule 1, clause 22: the committee notes that a pre&amp;hyphen;election economic and fiscal outlook report is to be released within 10 days of the issue of the writ for a general election. Given that a writ can be delayed up to 10

          My final point, Mr Speaker, is to seek the agreement of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to include a review component in the schedule of the bill so that the full reporting process can be assessed after the next election. I am confident that our report reflects the concerns of the parliament. The JCPA looks forward to receiving the government's response to report 351.

            An Advisory Report on the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996
           </emphasis>
           . I concur with most of what the chair of the committee, the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), has said with regard to this legislation and this report. It certainly has the support of the opposition. I might say that in some of the discussions we had at the committee there was not always that high level of agreement. However, I think the report we have come down with is quite a modest but important contribution to the consideration of the bill.
          </para>
         </talk.start>
         <para first-indent="16">
          A number of issues around this legislation which were mentioned by the chair, and some others that were not, need to be looked at with respect to its operation. I will briefly mention some of those in the short time that I have.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Certainly it is true that the comments regarding the bill that came before the committee either from witnesses or, in some respects, in submissions were generally positive. I think generally there was strong support out there. However, there is certainly a question as to just how this bill will actually work, and certainly some concerns were expressed at the hearings regarding the detail of that in practice.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The consultation process around this particular piece of legislation and the consideration of it by the committee was quite short. In the circumstances we only had submissions open for, I think, a matter of days because of
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           the very tight time line placed on the committee by the motion through the Senate. As I understand the position of the government, they need this legislation through during this session. I think that has limited the capacity of many individuals and groups to go through the detail of how the operation of the bill will occur and what the circumstances will be of the actual utilisation of this legislation in the future.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Having said that, certainly there is an expectation publicly that this legislation is not only a good thing but that it will lead to a material change. I am not so sure about the material change aspect. As the chair mentioned, this is a bill more suited for opposition than for government, but certainly in my position I hope for significant change. But I remain to be convinced.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          A number of issues were raised regarding this bill, and a number of them were covered by the chair of the committee, but I would like to pick up on a couple of comments. This legislation is largely a codification of existing practice. There are some improvements, and I commend those improvements, but it is largely a codification of existing practice. I think the circumstances were summed up best, from my point of view, by Professor Marc Robinson who made a submission to the inquiry. He said:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          No legislation can compel fiscal responsibility . . . The most positive view of the Bill is that it is merely the latest in a long series of incremental improvements in fiscal reporting requirements.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          What it does is largely build on what the previous government had done over some 13 years. It makes some improvements but, with respect to some of those improvements such as intergenerational reporting and the pre&amp;hyphen;election statements, we will have to see how they work in operation versus the question of what the expectations are.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Another issue which came up during the inquiry is the question of forecasts made by Treasury particularly but also in general terms regarding the private sector. The thing about the forecasting of economic indicators and projections is that it is crucial in terms of the political debate, not only in terms of budgetary implications with respect to actual judg

           ments being made and produced by government and by departments as being where we are really going on a financial basis, but also in terms of the expectations of what will occur in the future. A comment was made by the Secretary of Treasury on this issue, which I quote:
          </break>
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          . . . it is in the nature of forecasts that they will always be wrong and we have to do our best to minimise those errors.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          Obviously that statement is self-evident, but I do not think it is a statement which is really understood in the broader situation of the media and the public. Quite often, things do go off the rails but it is not on the basis of some form of chicanery, as is suggested on occasions by some. It is more in terms of the fact that the detail that is there is not sufficient and the circumstances change.

          Another issue I would raise briefly is the question of the signing off by the secretaries to the Treasury or Finance with respect to economic and fiscal reports produced by the government. The proposal under this bill is for that to be done with the pre&amp;hyphen;election report. That is fine, but members of the opposition raised the issue—and I believe it to be true—that other reports such as the budget ought to be done in the same way. It ought to be done on a regular basis.

          If this bill is about honesty, then let us have that honesty out in the open. Let it not only be honest but be seen to be honest by having reports like that signed off. I will leave my comments there. I commend the report to the House and I wish the bill a speedy passage in the Senate.

          I think the bill is an important step forward for the public management of Australia by government and as far as the transparency and accountability of the operations of government are concerned, particularly with the pre-election reports.

          —There has been an agreement to bring the AIDC Sale Bill on at this time because we in the opposition have been pushing for a provision to be made to allow for grievances and 90-second statements today. There was a reluctance on the part of the government to embrace that and I know it is not listed on the

           allow 90 or so minutes for grievances and 90-second statements.

         I mention that not only to reflect the agreement and our intent but to indicate that at some stage the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) or a representative may need to move a motion to enable us to get into grievances and 90-second statements. We on this side respect the importance of those debates for backbenchers, and they should not be crowded out by government business.

         But turning to this bill. The bill was introduced into the parliament on 27 February. It makes legislative amendments to enable the sale of the Australian Industry Development Corporation—the AIDC as it is known. It was established in 1970 as an investment bank to finance Australian industry. Its role when established was essentially to fill a gap that was not then adequately covered by the banking sector and other financial lenders. It essentially was established to cover cases where the development would not otherwise take place or would have only been possible in circumstances, unless local finance was available, that involved ownership and control going to foreign investors.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Over the years the AIDC has pioneered infrastructure financing, and it has a unique capability of turning public policy into reality through reacting as a policy lever for national development. It developed widely recognised project, resource and infrastructure financing expertise.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Some of the many significant examples and developments which occurred with AIDC financing include the Woodside North West Shelf gas project, which involved $US1.6 billion of financing, and the Argyle Diamond project, where the AIDC was the only Australian financier. There would have been no Australian equity in it but for the AIDC.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I also mention the Eraring Power Station project, which was financed through AIDC, and the nucleus telectronics pacemaker, which AIDC underwrote the initial financing of. In addition to all of those very worthwhile and significant infrastructure investments, the AIDC has contributed some $130 million in dividend payments to the Commonwealth since 1983.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          The AIDC did undergo some substantial losses several years ago. As a consequence, it restructured its operations and it has subsequently recovered well, with annual after tax earnings forecast to be around $60 million this year.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We recognise it was the coalition election policy to privatise the AIDC. They confirmed this in last year's budget. It is against that background that, overall, Labor will not be opposing the bill. However, we do have some concerns about the legislation and the way the sale is to be conducted. Many of these concerns are reflected in our second reading amendment as well as the amendment we will move in the detail of the bill.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Overall, the AIDC has performed well. It did make a loss in 1991, but most banks reported major losses in that period. But it did not, through its difficult period, need to draw on the government guarantee. The loss occurred largely because in the mid&amp;hyphen; to late&amp;hyphen;1980s the AIDC had moved away from its core business of infrastructure and resources. We, as a Labor Party, believe there is still a need for activity in this area.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It moved away from those core businesses—infrastructure and resources—towards a far greater emphasis on fee based merchant banking and business. Following its restructure, it did make pre&amp;hyphen;tax profits of $175 million over the last four years. As I have already indicated, it expects to make a pre-tax profit of some $60 million this year.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The AIDC currently employs some 200 people. The Labor Party does not want to see overly generous golden handshakes—or, in the case of some, golden handcuffs—going to AIDC senior management. But, apart from that group, we are concerned that the ordinary workers in the organisation are not disadvantaged by the sale. I note that concerns were expressed about this during the Senate committee hearings earlier this week. Labor is pleased that assurances have now been given that the existing terms and conditions of employment for these workers will be maintained.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The AIDC is one of two Australian controlled and independent investment houses. There is a real chance that, through this sale,
          <break page="2550" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           it could be purchased by overseas interests, particularly as there are no special provisions in the bill to deal with foreign ownership. Labor notes the assurances of the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) in the Senate earlier this week that, if the buyer is overseas owned, AIDC's 48&amp;half; per cent holding in the Australian Submarine Corporation could be excluded from the sale. We welcome that assurance but believe we need to legislate to ensure that assurance. That is the purpose of the amendment that we will be moving when we consider the detail of this bill.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We will be essentially moving at that stage that the Australian Submarine Corporation component be removed from AIDC Ltd and located within the corporation which is to stay in place under this legislative arrangement to manage the borrowings and loan portfolio and to manage such national interest assets as the Commonwealth's Australian Submarine Corporation shareholding. Essentially, the AIDC will remain in existence. It needs to manage certain activities. We are saying that this is where the Australian Submarine Corporation shareholding should be parked to ensure the guarantee, the assurance, that was given by Senator Kemp in another place. It will also ensure that the ASC does not become foreign controlled.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          AIDC has also been a significant investor in Australian infrastructure development. I mentioned some very significant examples a little earlier. Approximately half of its activity in the infrastructure development field has been in regional Australia. The sale of AIDC, without a genuine effort to replace it, will be seen as part of the government's continued assault on regional Australia.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There are many reasons why regional Australia feels, rightly, that they have been betrayed by this government. The first act of the Howard government in relation to regional development was to cut $150 million in regional infrastructure projects, despite the fact that they promised during the election campaign that they would not do it.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          When the announcement was made by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp)—he still calls himself the regional development minister but, as his first
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           act, abolished his own department—the statement justifying this breach of election promise was that `there is no clear rationale or constitutional basis for Commonwealth involvement in regional development'.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask you this: this comes from a National Party member in this House, a person who is touted as a future leader of the National Party, but if the National Party does not stand for regional development what does it stand for? Yet he has come into the House and justified the abolition of $150 million of the regional infrastructure fund saying that there is no constitutional role for the Commonwealth in regional development.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Labor believes there is a Commonwealth role in regional development. We believe that there is a role for all governments in regional development. We are sick to death of this buck&amp;hyphen;passing between levels of government when the issues become too hard for the government.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The simple fact of the matter is that what is good for regional Australia is good for the nation. It therefore requires, if we are to support regional Australia, all levels of government to get behind that work. Instead, what do we see from the present government and from the minister for so-called regional development? They are washing their hands as a government of involvement in regional development.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          But it got worse. The first budget brought down by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), on behalf of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), confirmed the approach of a massive betrayal of regional Australia. Those who rely on regional roads and infrastructure are the big losers. Higher education funding has been slashed, with the cuts falling disproportionately on the regional campuses. Assistance to the unemployed has been cut by over $1 billion, again falling heavily on regional Australia. ABC funding has been cut. There has been a massive attack on regional welfare and service delivery, with cuts in areas such as dental services. We are seeing closures of regional CES, Tax and Medicare offices.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There is no doubt that there is an enormous sense of bewilderment and betrayal wide
          <break page="2551" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
           spread among regional Australians resulting from the cuts throughout regional Australia—a part of the nation that voted overwhelmingly for this government and expected better of it. But it has been dudded. It has been betrayed.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As to the cuts to regional infrastructure alone, first we saw in July last year this $150 million regional infrastructure fund totally abolished. I have mentioned the pretext used—there is no role for the Commonwealth in regional development, which are the words of the minister. Second, there was the axing of the infrastructure bond program with only the vague promise of a replacement program to be brought forward in the budget.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Labor indicated at the time that we would support any measure to remove unintended consequences from tax concessions. However, what we are saying is that the failure to announce a replacement program has put at risk billions of dollars of regional development.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Just understand the lethargy and lack of ideas resulting from this government. This issue of infrastructure bonds has been around now for over 12 months in this government's term of office. They indicated that they wanted to stop excessive use and excessive claims under the scheme. But what was the decision of the government after 12 months? It was to freeze the fund, to not allow any projects to go forward. After 12 months, having frozen 72 regional infrastructure projects, all around the country, the best that they could say is, `We'll freeze them—not that we have an alternative, not that we have really thought through a policy change; the best we can come up with after 12 months of looking at this issue is to freeze the funds, to stop further regional development occurring in this nation.'
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          So we have the scrapping of the $150 million infrastructure fund. We have the freeze now on infrastructure bonds with no alternative having been put in place. There are 72 projects sitting out there all waiting for approval—all necessary to regional development and all prepared to be financed by a combination of the private sector and government authorities. But, no, this government
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           will not allow them to go ahead. No wonder regional Australia feels you have betrayed them.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is not as if these are pie in the sky projects. These are essential projects to the regions of this country—road funding, infrastructure such as gas pipelines, and water supply. Yet we have a double whammy from this government: not only have they scrapped the fund that assist in getting some of these projects going but also they have scrapped the infrastructure bond program and have put nothing in place. On top of all of that, they are now coming along with the sale of the AIDC, again without any alternative being put in place.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The sale has been announced. But there is no hint of the government's plans to do anything to address the future need for private sector investment in our national infrastructure, except perhaps the institutional investor information service, which was announced with some understated fanfare by the Minister for Regional Development. He said it was a world first, but all he did was copy the original scheme of Brian Howe, who announced it back in 1995.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The only statement made in this chamber by the minister for so-called regional development after more than a year of activity and which gives any sort of hope is something that copies Labor's plan. They have broken promises all over the place. They have told regional Australia that they would support the infrastructure funds. They have told them that they would back them in regional infrastructure. All they have done is cut the very programs that give that support, and the best they can do is copy a scheme from Labor.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We thank you for copying Labor's scheme, but why do you not copy more of them? Why do you not reinstitute the regional development fund? Why do you not put a replacement up for the infrastructure bonds that enable these projects to go ahead? And why do you not put in place a replacement body for the AIDC to support the financing of infrastructure in important parts of this country?
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The AIDC, it must be said, was involved in some significant infrastructure bond projects.
          <break page="2552" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           For example, the Wyuna water project, with two water treatment plants in New South Wales, was funded and backed by the AIDC. Yet it is now frozen because of the government's decision on infrastructure bonds. There is also the Oakey power station in Queensland—a 270 megawatt gas&amp;hyphen;fired power station, essential if you are about supplying energy source to regions to enable them to value add. This, too, was frozen out by Treasurer Costello's announcement on the infrastructure bonds. The Redbank power project in the Hunter Valley—a $300 million project which uses coal tailings as fuel—is frozen. I know that the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) has serious concerns about this particular project being put on ice.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          What do we have from the Treasurer on this? We have an assertion that he has frozen the scheme because it was being rorted. None of these projects was a rort. I challenge the Treasurer to come into this House and identify where the rorts have been occurring. This was the same excuse he used when he wound up the syndication of research and development in this country. This is the classic dupe that Treasury and Finance always put forward. Wherever a worthwhile project overruns as to revenue forgone implications, Treasury says, `Minister, we have a submission for you. There is an overrun. Call it a rort.' Any time there is a project that is worthwhile and should be persisted with but Treasury does not like it, they get the minister all wound up and say, `Call it a rort.'
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          That is what the Treasurer has done in terms of R&amp;D syndication. He has also said it in terms of infrastructure bonds, but he has not had the decency to come into this chamber on any occasion and identify and spell out those rorts.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I remember a debate that we were having in this House towards the end of last year on the scrapping of the research and development syndication. He had to sit in the same chair as the duty minister at the table is sitting in for some six hours of debate, squirming away—signing Christmas cards, as I remember, to try to avoid attention—because we gave him the opportunity, time and time again, to get up and list the rorts. He would
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           not do it. He cringed because he knew, if he tried to do it, that he could be guilty of misleading the House. I challenge him again to come in and tell us where the rorts are in terms of the infrastructure bonds. In particular, I ask him why those three projects that I have just outlined cannot go ahead—the Wyuna water project, the Oakey power station in Queensland and the Redbank power project in the Hunter Valley. Let him explain why his mismanagement, his blinkered approach, is preventing these important aspects of regional infrastructure from proceeding to fruition.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We believe that government does have a role in renewing our regional infrastructure. We believe it does have a role in working with industry to build exports, smart research and jobs. There is still a need for the type of service that the AIDC was originally designed to provide. Although the details have changed to some extent, the need is still there, particularly because investors have a reluctance to put money into regional Australia. The AIDC moved away from that role. Unfortunately, its focus became directed to fee based merchant banking, which could just as easily be met by the private sector.

           Financial Review
          </emphasis>
          today on page 32, we have the AIDC entering vendor finance. The simple fact of the matter is that we do not need a body to enter fees and interest charges. We do not need another body to get into vendor financing, but we do need a body that supports regional infrastructure, a body that is prepared to back these significant projects where they matter to the development of our regions, getting value&amp;hyphen;added up, making sure we do not rely on commodities as our sole basis for exports, supporting the huge surge in manufacturing which we have seen over the last decade. These things only happen because governments are prepared to play a role. We think that there is still a role for a body to be established to perform what was originally intended and commenced by the AIDC.

            —The reality is, the government is doing nothing to fill this gap because it does not believe that it has a role in this area. Worse, it is cutting away all of the existing support mechanisms—the R&amp;D tax concessions, the bounties, the DIFF scheme, the export market development grants scheme, Austrade, AusIndustry—with a total of $3.9 billion cut out of the last budget. This year the axe looks set to fall further on the motor vehicle industry. We could see its demise if the government adopts the majority recommendations of the Productivity Commission. Textiles, clothing and footwear, pharmaceuticals, information technology and, once again, the research and development concession are all under, not a microscope, but this huge laser beam that the Treasurer wants to zap into industry because he does not believe

           I hope he is right, but it does sound a little bit like pre&amp;hyphen;empting the budget process. We will find out when he returns to this parliament whether he has been successful in that regard. I hope he is more successful than in his discussion the other night at Canberra's most exclusive club with the Treasurer. There they were at the Commonwealth Club, finished dinner, and over port and cigars the Treasurer of the country and the industry minister were discussing the future of the car industry. The Treasurer said, `Minister, my vision for the car industry in this country is to wipe out Mitsubishi.' That was his plan, his secret vision for the car industry, to wipe out one of the manufacturers. This is the person who is running your government and it is about time people on the back bench stood up to him.

           Labor recognises that, to some extent, the AIDC has moved from its original charter and that the need for patient capital and private sector investment in major infrastructure projects, while just as significant, does now need to be addressed in different ways. The AIDC itself has confirmed that there is no function that it now performs which cannot be carried out equally as well by the private sector. But there still remains a significant gap in the market. The AIDC is no longer specifically focused towards filling that gap.

         For the record, AIDC Ltd is now an investment house that provides infrastructure, resources and corporate advice and financing in Australia and Asia. It is a specialist in equity investment and funds management and financial markets and securitisation. The AIDC Sale Bill, which was introduced by the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey), puts in place the commitment of the coalition government in the March 1996 election campaign to privatise AIDC Ltd.

         The Australian Industry Development Corporation was set up in 1970 as a statutory corporation. Its mission was to facilitate and encourage the establishment, development and advancement of Australian industries. It is fair to say that the AIDC has had some great successes—for example, the North West Shelf gas project financing for Woodside Petroleum Ltd; the project financing for the massive Eraring power station in New South Wales; and, an issue that is very dear to the heart and mind of the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), the establishment of a consortium of institutional investors in Optus Communications.

         AIDC's business activities have expanded to fee based merchant banking activities. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, AIDC experienced some substantial losses. In 1988, the AIDC went through a colourful period, including a recognised capital shortage by the

         For some years, and particularly during the Labor years obviously, the government talked of selling off the remaining interest in AIDC Ltd. As a result, there was great uncertainty regarding the future of the company. It is fair to say that this does have a damaging impact on the morale of staff and management and also of the board and that that may have contributed to some of the less than profitable years towards the end of the 1980s and the early 1990s.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am prepared to recognise that, particularly when in the 1992-93 budget the Labor government announced its intention to sell down, to 51 per cent, the government's share in AIDC Ltd. It was in August 1992 that the government recognised that this was going to prove very difficult and withdrew the sale. In 1993-94, we saw the Labor government do a backflip yet again on another issue when it said that it was going to pursue the sale. But then in April 1994 the Labor Party said that it may change its mind in relation to the sale process.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In 1995, the former Labor government announced that they were going to go into the market and buy back from private investors the remaining 19 per cent of AIDC Ltd, the minority shareholding. They suggested that this was going to take place so they could properly prepare AIDC Ltd for a full sale at a later date. The takeover offer closed in January 1996 and AIDC was delisted one month before the election last year.

         The federal government wants to sell AIDC because it is a good idea. It experienced losses in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It had a profit turnaround in 1993 and significant before tax profits in each of the years since. In 1995-96, AIDC Ltd had a record $50.3 million profit, which I will talk about a little later. It is, however, not in the public interest to retain public ownership of a merchant banking operation. There are, of course, many other investment banking
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          operations in the Australian financial marketplace, but the government should not be involved in an operating business on a commercial basis in a competitive environment, especially where that competitive environment is related to the issuance of capital and the use of capital for profit purposes. This is entirely consistent with the recommendations of the National Commission of Audit.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Further, it is fair to say that Australia enjoys very sophisticated financial markets and there is no public benefit for the Commonwealth in continuing to have an extensive involvement in the financial marketplace. For example, AIDC can enter into swaps agreements, foreign exchange agreements, forward rate agreements, option agreements, futures agreements and hedge agreements, all of which start to become complicated financial instruments once you start getting involved in derivatives of each of those and exotic agreements. These businesses have no place in the public sector other than to hedge the overall risk of the Commonwealth.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The government is pursuing the competitive neutrality principle. There is an existing funding advantage for the Commonwealth, and the AIDC has enjoyed access to the Commonwealth's AAA domestic guarantee, which means that it should be an even more profitable enterprise than it is at the moment. I understand that the AIDC does not pay any guarantee fees to the Commonwealth for the benefit of enjoying the AAA status domestically and AA status on S&amp;P rating in international markets. The termination of access to the government guarantee facility will place the AIDC business where it belongs—on exactly the same footing as the rest of the financial services industry.

         There is an issue that has been brought to my attention over the last few weeks as I have been researching the sale process for AIDC Ltd. It is a matter of grave concern not just to this parliament but to all Australians, who in fact have a stake in the future of AIDC Ltd. It comes down to the fact that the AIDC management has taken a regressive approach to the sale process. AIDC management has served only its own interest during the
         <break page="2556" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          sale process and there is a good reason for that, which I would like to elaborate on.

         As of the figures of 31 December 1996, a contingent liability for employee termination is in the accounts amounting to around $32 million. This $32 million—most of which benefits around 50 of the total of 200 employees, which would be a rule of thumb application—would suggest that management has set for itself amongst the most lucrative employment contracts in the financial services industry in Australia. The company has net assets of around $246 million. So up to 15 per cent of the net asset figure would have to be allocated to the termination of employees and, particularly, senior management. That is an extraordinary figure. But it goes further.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         According to the 1996 annual report, the executive remuneration in AIDC Ltd has reached preposterous levels. As I referred to a little earlier, profits have improved. In 1994, the profit for AIDC Ltd was $47.3 million. In 1995, the profit was $25 million. In 1995, with a profit of $25 million, there were more than 10 executives in AIDC Ltd receiving over $700,000. More than 10 executives were receiving over $700,000 per annum in an organisation that has a total of 200 employees. That is an extraordinary figure.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is even more extraordinary, if you take the levels a little bit further, that 16 people received more than $250,000, and that was on a profit figure of $25 million. On a 1996 profit figure of $50.3 million, 18 executives received more than $250,000. Some would say—and it is fair, and I agree with it—that it is only appropriate that executives should receive benefits on the basis of the profit projections. But my concern is the fact that the 1995-96 so-called profit is primarily made up of a write back of asset values and loans. So, essentially, what the management has done, or is seen to have done, is revalue everything upwards to create a profit result in 1995-96 of $50.3 million, which seems to be almost a 100 per cent improvement on the previous year.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would not deny—nor would anyone, or very few, in this House—the right of senior management or talented people on the staff to have very generous salary packages based on
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          the level of profit in the organisation. It is only appropriate in the financial services sector and particularly in the markets, where there are extraordinary pressures on individuals and there is extraordinary risk associated with decisions made less than every minute of every hour of every day. There are only too many examples where imprudent financial management has caused grave harm to organisations such as Barings, more recently Natwest in the United Kingdom, and a few other organisations. I think it was Nomura that was the unfortunate recipient of a billion dollar mistake.

         But when salary levels are pitched at such a high point and the underlying profit of an organisation does not indicate that they should be, then what they are doing is ripping off the shareholder. And that is exactly what the AIDC management have done. They have ripped off the shareholder by taking such excessive salaries and putting in place extraordinary termination agreements.

         In 1996, $25.9 million was the total salary package for AIDC Ltd—this puts it in perspective—and yet their termination agreements and the contingent liability in the accounts is $32 million, which would indicate that every employee in AIDC Ltd is guaranteed more than an entire year's salary for termination.

         And even now we need to ask the question: what is the motivation of the management and the board in impeding the smooth process to due diligence during the sale process? I will tell you what it is. It is an underlying arrogance. Professor Jeremy Davis was quoted in the

         Professor Davis is showing an extraordinary arrogance and a lack of understanding of the most basic sale principles for any financial institution.

The State Bank of South Australia was never sold to Advance Bank—they never went through any due diligence process. Bankwest was never sold to the Bank of Scotland—they never went through any due diligence process. The Commonwealth Bank was never sold to the markets—they never went through any due diligence process.

         And it goes on. State Bank was never sold to Colonial—there was no due diligence process. Metway was never sold into the Bank of Queensland and the Queensland government—there was no due diligence process. And it goes on and on and on. And the Chairman of AIDC Ltd has the absolute hide to come into this parliament and tell the Senate committee that the due diligence process might unveil confidential information about customers. He either does not understand the most basic  processes of due diligence or he is guilty of the most heinous crime of obstructing the obvious will of the shareholders—the people of Australia.

         If Professor Davis is not going to comply with the demands of this parliament and the demands of the shareholder, then he should resign and take his entire board with him.

         As I have indicated, AIDC's profit result last year was not that good.

         On behalf of the people in my electorate and on behalf of the people in this House, I urge AIDC management to make a contribution to the sale process. The only message I am hearing—and I am standing on the sidelines—is that AIDC management are impeding at every point the smooth sale process. You know why? Because they have set up for themselves the most cosy executive remuneration contracts anywhere in the markets. They like their cosy little arrangement—their AAA guarantee, their wonderful termination payments, their wonderful remuneration payments. They do not even have to rely on substantial underlying profits to deliver them good remuneration. It is greedy and it is grubby! The sooner AIDC is sold into the market, the sooner it will be accustomed to real market pressures, the sooner the executives of AIDC will realise that the gravy train cannot continue, especially at the expense of the people of Australia.

If they are going to have that sort of attitude in this process, they are going to find it very hard to survive either the sale process or any process after that.

         We have a problem with an organisation. It is not performing the function for which it was originally created, so what do we say? `Okay, that's the reason to get rid of the organisation.' On top of that, we then say, `There is no reason for any organisation to perform that function.' We do not agree with that philosophically, politically and in terms of the economic development of this nation because the fundamental issue facing this nation at the moment is employment and unemployment. In order to effectively deal with that issue, we have to deal with the question of industry development. Industry policy is the crucial issue facing this House. It is a shame that it is so poorly addressed at the moment, with the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) not having a clue, not having any ideas and not having any suggestions.

         The AIDC was established in 1970 . . . the initiative of the Rt Hon. J. McEwen, then Minister for Trade and Industry, who saw the need to counter Australia's growing dependence on foreign capital to support its enterprises and industries. The AIDC is an investment bank which finances Australian industries and which also participates in enterprises and projects. McEwen was not opposed to foreign investment

         and, in fact, he acknowledged the importance of the availability of such capital in Australia. The AIDC was created to assist Australian residents match the share of capital required to create or maintain enterprises so as to avoid too often becoming the minor partner in an enterprise which was the target of foreign investment or takeover. At that time, the Australian motor industry was nearly 90% foreign controlled. The industrial and heavy chemicals industry, and the pharmaceuticals industries were over 80% foreign controlled. Overseas ownership of the electrical and electronic industries was around 50%.

         The AIDC was created to fill a gap not then adequately covered by the banking and other financial lenders.

         A piece of history, Mr Deputy Speaker. We believe those general underlying principles of the AIDC are still relevant.

It does not address that.

It was very instructive to see what can be done because in the Republic of Ireland they have converted from an agriculturally based economy 20 years ago—20 years ago only—into an economy based on high technology industries.

         It is interesting that, when it was set up back in 1970, it was proposed as a mechanism for countering Australia's dependence on foreign capital to support its enterprises and its industry. That was a very worthwhile thing in 1970 and I make the point that it has remained as relevant in the 1980s and 1990s as it was in the 1970s.

          It is ironic that we are supporting a measure to effectively privatise something owned by the Commonwealth. But, like a number of organisations, this institution, regrettably, has long departed from the original vision and aims that were had for it. That is a matter of regret, but it is the reality. So, in selling off AIDC, we are not selling something that is countering Australia's growing dependence on foreign capital to support enterprise and industry.

          One of the things the AIDC can rightly claim some credit for is the fact that it funded the Nucleus Techtronics pacemaker. We need an Australian institution that is prepared to fund breakthroughs—the pacemaker, the cochlear ear implant or whatever the next generation of exciting products developed by our scientists and researchers may be. We do not have that institution. It is a great tragedy that, in a country so relatively small in size, we are and always have been capable of doing good research and providing breakthroughs but we have not been good at product development and getting things onto the market. In particular, all too often we have not been good at keeping things in Australian hands. People are getting more and more upset about this, as they understand that when these things go overseas or are bought out by foreigners, the jobs and the benefits go with them in the majority of cases.

            As I say, it was a huge decision to build the submarine in Australia. I think the Submarine Corporation have done brilliantly. But my one area of criticism is the fact that they have failed to get into exports. I may even be as ungenerous to suggest that somehow Swedish options from Sweden seem to be more vigorously pushed in our region than were Australian Submarine Corporation options. What was the reason for that? We really never had tight enough control.

            The most amazing thing about this bill to sell off the AIDC is that Kockums still has pre-emptive rights to buy out the AIDC shareholding. So, in other words, if you want to privatise the AIDC, including its shareholding in the Submarine Corporation, you actually have to give Kockums the first right of refusal. I would have thought that that was a difficult process. I do not really think that the government has thought through well how it is going to warehouse it. It may be a matter of, `We can put it here—Finance; we can put it in industry and science—DIST; or we can warehouse it some other way.' I would have thought that in relation to Australian taxpayer funds the people of Australia would expect the government of the day to more seriously consider the implications of this move and to have a very clearly thought out approach to this problem.

          —There has been a role for the AIDC. As other speakers pointed out, it was originally established to meet real needs in this community, particularly the reluctance of investors to put their money into regional Australia. Many of us would think that there is still a need for the type of service that the AIDC was originally established to provide. But, as other speakers have also pointed out, it has moved away from that role and its focus on fee based merchant banking can just as readily be met by private sector banks. Therefore, the case for it remaining in the public sector diminishes accordingly.

         I also want to say that I think AIDC has lost its way in the last two or three years because of the focus of its own management on looking after themselves rather than looking after the purposes for which AIDC was established. Back in October 1995 there was considerable public comment and public concern expressed at the salary increases awarded by senior executives of AIDC to themselves of more than 200 per cent in a single year. The Managing Director of AIDC at the time, Mr Gerry van der Merwe, according to the Sunday

As I understand it, his salary was in fact $1.8 million, but he received $400,000 in options as well, which took him over the $2 million mark and made him the highest paid executive in the country.

          salary had been boosted from $320,000 to $1.8 million in a period when the bank's profits fell from $46 million to $28 million. It is little wonder that Senator Peter Cook said at the time that he was astonished at the level of wage increases awarded to him.

         It was not just the managing director who was being paid these extraordinary salaries. By the end of 1995, the 10 highest paid executives at AIDC were earning between $700,000 and $1.8 million each. Their pay packets corresponded to 36 per cent of AIDC's after tax profits—a truly extraordinary amount when the company was only earning those small profits and only earning those small profits when it was the beneficiary of a government guarantee. This was at a time when the senior executives had sought and gained what were referred to as golden handcuff payments. They said they had to be paid these additional amounts of money because there was uncertainty surrounding the merchant bank's future. But it seems to me, looking at the AIDC figures, that the huge percentage which was ripped off for those top salaries meant that the company was in a considerably worse position than if they had left the company. In any event, Mr van der Merwe received two retention payments—the second of which was $400,000—and he resigned one week after receiving that second retention payment.

         AIDC's profits were $28 million in 1994, $43 million in 1993 and $46 million in 1992 against a background where they had a preferential interest rate as a AAA rated beneficiary of the federal guarantee. So all they had to do was take money and lend it on to the National Bank, making use of the guarantee in order to make a return. The management in place at that time failed to generate new income streams and lived off the diminishing returns of the old AIDC income and that income was based on a continuously falling asset base. In my view, this amounted to a straight rip&amp;hyphen;off of the taxpayer and amounted to conduct like kids in a candy shop.

It is certainly my understanding that bonuses being paid to AIDC executives related to asset sales.

Based on the retention payments that occurred in the past, it is quite possible that we would have arrangements in place whereby management gets golden handshakes of such a size that they would tend to diminish the price for AIDC. In my view these are important questions, and I would like to hear responses from the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) before this debate is concluded.

It really was a situation which encouraged kids in the candy store behaviour.

There is agreement from both sides of this place that the AIDC has shifted away significantly from the original function that it performed.

The result of this is that many projects get under way only because of foreign investment, if at all.

         When one looks at some of the infrastructure projects that the AIDC has been involved in, such as the two water treatment plants in New South Wales, one sees that in many
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          cases they are projects of national significance. The government must ensure that a mechanism exists which allows such vitally important projects to be funded, and invested in, when they otherwise might not. One of the functions that the AIDC has under section 8A allowed the minister to provide the funds for investment in special projects deemed to be in the national interest. The sale of the AIDC will lose a vehicle that the minister had at hand to ensure that that could be so. It definitely would be in the national interest to have this function transferred to another body or taken up directly by the government itself.

         As I said at the outset, I support the second reading amendment moved by the honourable member for Hotham on the basis that it reaffirms the commitment of this House to the principles underpinning AIDC's creation and, further, condemns the government for not putting in place a structure which will address the failure of the capital markets to provide the sort of funding that the AIDC historically had provided.

         It is now time that the government, through whichever minister wishes to take the reins—perhaps members in this debate are fast losing faith in the industry minister to provide adequate leadership—ensures that Australian industries continue to be able to not only maintain their market shares internationally but also grow, and ensures that we will not see further losses of Australian jobs offshore in important industrial sectors like pharmaceuticals and TCF.

        <para first-indent="16">
         For instance, I was told, from a briefing given to the opposition yesterday, that if the TCF tariffs are to go to zero levels early in the next century it would lead to a loss of 700 jobs in one of the municipalities in my electorate. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in my electorate we cannot afford to lose one job. There are thousands of people who are ready, willing and able to take up worthwhile employment. The government has to recognise that there are many regions, such as the electorate that I represent, that need the assistance and intervention from government to ensure that Australian industry prospers.

          <break page="2569" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           debate today and appreciate that there is a universal view that the subject of the AIDC Sale Bill, AIDC Ltd, is pursuing business activities which make it no longer appropriate to be maintained by government ownership. Whatever the benefit of this particular organisation when it was established—a number of speakers in the course of this debate have referred to various projects that were of benefit to the community generally in an infrastructure sense—it has long past being useful. It has lost its way somewhat simply because of the fact that there has been a deregulation of banking and there are other facilities available for the type of infrastructure that AIDC once supported.

         The judgment that this business is not appropriate for government is one that has been held by both sides of the House—by the current government and by is predecessors—for a number of years. Sale measures had been initiated previously, but had not met with much success. The lessons from those previous actions have been learned and led to the legislation currently before the House which will enable this government to bring the sale of AIDC Ltd and its associated business activities to a successful conclusion.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government will be opposing the opposition's amendments relating to the Australian Submarine Corporation holding. I made it clear during the second reading speech that the ASC holding would be quarantined from the sale. Therefore, this amendment is unnecessary.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This legislation was necessary because the existing legislative framework governing the operations of the Australian Industry Development Corporation did not provide the flexibility that is necessary to conclude a sale on satisfactory terms and conditions. In addition, despite the successful takeover proposal conducted by the corporation for the shares it did not own in AIDC Ltd, minority shareholdings in the company continued to exist for technical reasons. With the passage of this bill, it will be possible to deal with those holdings in an expeditious manner without in any way compromising the fair and equitable treatment of those shareholders. The bill clearly makes provision to protect the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          interests of those parties, consistent with the obligations set out in the constitution for the compulsory acquisition of property.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another fundamental issue dealt with by the bill is that it provides the appropriate legal environment for the substantial financial interests of the Commonwealth to be managed both during and after the sale process.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A significant characteristic of the business activities of AIDC Ltd has been the added protection afforded its borrowings through the use of the Commonwealth guarantee. With the sale of the company, or its assets, the Commonwealth will continue to stand behind the guarantees that it has already provided, but in so doing it is necessary to ensure that the Australian Industry Development Corporation is provided with the appropriate legislative base to continue that task. The bill provides that base.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Concern has been expressed by the board of AIDC Ltd in relation to the power provided by this bill for the minister to require the provision of information to assist in the sale process. The concern was expressed on the basis that that may impact on the company's client relationship. I can assure the House that this power will not be used lightly by the government. The Commonwealth will be mindful of the need to protect commercially sensitive material and will ensure that commercial interests are not prejudiced during the sale process.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill makes provision for the protection of information obtained under this arrangement. However, it is also important to ensure that the Commonwealth's actions, as the beneficial owner of AIDC Ltd, are not unnecessarily constrained and ensure that an effective power of veto is not provided to third party interests.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In progressing this asset sale, in common with other recent asset sales, it is important for the Commonwealth to protect its financial interest and ensure that it receives full value from the sale. For this reason, the bill makes the necessary provisions to protect the sale from the imposition of stamp duty and cancels any residual franking credits that may exist in the company at the time of the sale. The approach to these provisions is consistent with
         <break page="2570" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          provisions in other sale legislation which this House has previously passed. Similarly—and I note a number of speakers on the other side commented on this—employee interests have been protected by the provisions relating to long service leave and occupational health and safety. In other words, all the benefits that have currently accrued to the employees of AIDC Ltd will be protected through this legislation and will be passed on in appropriate circumstances to those employees.

         With a maturing financial and merchant banking industry in Australia, it is important that the government progress this sale and thereby remove itself from this area of business activity. I commend the bill to the House.

         We foreshadowed these amendments in the second reading debate because of our specific concern about what happens to the Australian Submarine Corporation shares. We believe that the Submarine Corporation and the arrangements that the Labor government developed in relation to it—its strategic partnership with Kockums, its involvement and establishment in Adelaide and the huge
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          growth in industry development that occurred consequent upon that—are a shining example of what can sensibly be done if the leverage of government policy together with the financing that backed it from the AIDC can be brought together.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We believe there is still some potential future to build off the success of the Submarine Corporation. It is for that reason that we would obviously be reluctant to see the Submarine Corporation sold off as part of the arrangement that will sell off AIDC, the share package that the AIDC holds in the Submarine Corporation. That being said, we note that it is the intention of the government, in abolishing AIDC Ltd by the legislation, to still keep the corporation within AIDC ostensibly to manage the loans.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We are saying that, in addition to the management of the loans, the corporation should hold the Submarine Corporation shares. We think it is important not just for the strategic national interest that Australia control its own defence capability but that there be future opportunities for the development of a defence based industry in this country, and the ability to develop that clearly is going to be significantly limited if the government still is not in the game. Our approach is to keep the government in the game, not by taking the shares back but by recognising where they are held and by parking the management of those within the AIDC.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It also would require there to be some bipartisan discussion as to what the government's future intentions may be in relation to the shareholding of Submarine Corporation. We believe we can inject some sensible input and hope that the government might be prepared to embrace us in that approach in trying to develop a strengthened industry off our defence capability, off our shipbuilding industry, off our heavy engineering capacity, but really moving more into the strategic development, the high-tech industries, associated with defence and sense tracking, and recognising the significance that that has, quite frankly, for the manufacturing industry.
        </para>
        <break page="2572" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          When you think of the manufacturing industry generally, it is the software packages and the engineering dimensions that are important. It is not just a question of the physical infrastructure; it is the processes by which that technology is run. It is the systems running; it is the information technology. If Australia is to continue its growth in manufacturing exports, and that growth has already been significant, we need to use strategic inputs and strategic placements and the government needs to be in there as a partner with industry in securing a future direction for this nation.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We therefore think that this amendment ought to be supported by the government. It is still saying that it can look to deal with it as it would like but that there would be a requirement to have wider discussions as to what its intentions might be. We accept the assurance of the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) that it is not intended to sell the Submarine Corporation into foreign interests, but we are seeking to secure the base in this country for the Submarine Corporation and that which flows from it.

          —I also support these amendments to the AIDC Sale Bill. In my speech in the second reading debate I made a couple of comments about what had happened in terms of answers to questions in the Senate. In the answers I quoted from the Senate committee hearing, the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp), who was representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), made it perfectly clear after questions from Senator Ray that it was not the intention of the government to sell the Australian Submarine Corporation to foreign interests. But, after a series of questions, it came out that the government and the minister have not put forward any proposal as to how that is to be avoided when the AIDC is sold. We do not know what is going to happen. I hope the minister is going to tell us.

          —The Australian Submarine Corporation is particularly important to the Australian government and to the Australian people—both because of its importance to Australian defence and because of its importance to Australian industry. The government's significant holding in the Submarine Corporation via the AIDC is not something that should be allowed to go through with the passage of this bill without clear views being expressed by the parliament on that important matter.

          It is appropriate that the parliament place some restrictions upon the sale of the AIDC to ensure that the Submarine Corporation remains for the time being with a government stakeholding in it. The relevant amendment moved by the Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), clearly provides a mechanism through which that can occur to ensure that the Submarine Corporation's government shareholding is kept in the AIDC.

          That opens up a number of opportunities further down the track as part of the development of Australian defence industry policy, and indeed, more broadly, industry policy for other sectors, because defence industry so often is at the cutting edge of technology developments and where defence industry goes so too does the broader industry sector.

          Can I quickly say a couple of words about the Submarine Corporation and its importance to defence. The Submarine Corporation has now managed to construct three submarines as part of an order of six, which are without doubt amongst the best in the world and regarded by many as being the most significant non&amp;hyphen;nuclear submarines anywhere in the world.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          That is a capability that is important to Australia's defence. It is a capability that the opposition take very seriously. Indeed, it is a capability that was established during the period in which Labor was in office, when Kim Beazley and later Robert Ray as ministers for defence strongly supported the acquisition of those submarines and supported the Australian government's involvement in that project to ensure that it came to fruition and to ensure that there was a substantial Australian participation in the management of the organisation. I am not sure that that is a commitment that is shared by both sides of the parliament, and I would invite the minister at the table, the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey), to take the opportunity in this debate to make that clear.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is worth noting that in terms of the commitment on this side of the parliament to the Submarine Corporation and the defence importance of that program, we have made it plain that were we in government we would
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           commit to the additional two submarines, 7 and 8. I invite the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan), who is in the chamber, to address that issue to see whether or not the government is serious about maintaining a significant defence capability in submarine development, maintenance and construction. It is important to the Labor Party. It was important to us in government and it remains important to us in opposition.

          In relation to the defence industry implications of the Submarine Corporation, it is not just that the Submarine Corporation has produced an absolute world leader in submarine warfare; it is the long line of domestic companies who supply to the Submarine Corporation who have also benefited. The downstream suppliers to the Submarine Corporation number in their thousands. Many of those are local firms who have been pulled along by the submarine program into high&amp;hyphen;tech areas and, as a result of that, are now competing successfully in world markets for the various components provision.
         </para>

          That is an important consideration in the long&amp;hyphen;term sustainability, not just of the Collins class submarine but in terms of the development of new classes of warships and other platforms. That is a capability we should not see let go. It is important that in dealing with the sale of the AIDC the parliament places these strictures on the sale. The parliament should ensure through this particular amendment that the shareholding in the Submarine Corporation remains for the time being with the government, that it is parked in the AIDC. It is a very sensible and worthwhile amendment, and I do hope the government accepts it.

          many restrictions as is possible on what future flexibility there may be for government in dealing with a 48.5 per cent shareholding in the Australian Submarine Corporation.

         In that we have indicated there is no intention to dispose of that shareholding with the sale of AIDC Ltd, the government reserves its flexibility and the legislation provides for where it puts that shareholding in the foreseeable future. By this amendment it is suggested that it should be put in the corporation. The Labor Party is saying that the government must place this shareholding in AIDC Ltd.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Well, the government could place that shareholding in the defence portfolio, and I wonder what the objections to that might be from the members opposite. It could place it in the industry portfolio because, from the contributions of the members opposite, the debate centres around the industry that is associated with the Australian Submarine Corporation. It could place the ASC in an Australian company—a company approved by the Department of Defence and approved by Kockums who has a shareholding in the Australian Submarine Corporation as well. Or it could place the ASC in that most appropriate department for protecting the assets of government—the Department of Finance. It could be placed in any of those portfolios to the point where the shareholding continues in government ownership.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But what we really have to look at here is not restricting it. We have to look at the fact that this Submarine Corporation is involved in the construction of submarines. In July of last year, the first Collins class submarine was launched. There are five more that are being constructed under contract over the next several years, and that is not going to change. That is going to be there for the defence capability of Australia. As each one comes off, gets into the water and becomes operational, that enhances the defence capability of Australia. That is not at risk in terms of the shareholding by AIDC Ltd in the Australian Submarine Corporation.

That advice will be forthcoming as and when there is a need to do something further with it. The shareholding will not be sold. That undertaken is given. Legislation is not required.

         Let me also respond to the assertion that, somehow or other, this government will leave the Australian Submarine Corporation open to foreign takeovers. Well, it won't. But, secondly, it is worth while remembering that the shareholder agreement and the articles of association effectively give protection to either the AIDC shareholding in ASC or Kockums, the Swedes. The agreement and the articles of association give them pre-emptive rights to make sure that nobody comes in as a shareholder they do not approve of. We have no problem with the Swedes; they have done a very good job; but they are a foreigner.

We have been able, by dint of cooperation between both sides, to achieve sufficient time to ensure that we can allow grievance debate today. It is usually on a Monday. We did not sit on Monday. We endeavour to have it, therefore, on the Thursday. We do always, as the previous government did, reserve the right to order the business of the House to ensure that the program is met.

          —I rise in this grievance debate to express my concerns about the needs of older people in our community with disabilities and their older carers. My remarks will be based on a study carried out on behalf of the Mullauna Retirement Village at Blacktown run by the Uniting Church. I propose to quote at length from this report as the findings must surely be mirrored across Australia.

         Mullauna is seeking to extend its services to older people with disabilities and older people caring for people with disabilities both in the provision of accommodation and in home support. The Mullauna group believe they should be extending their services based on community needs in the following areas: both residential and in&amp;hyphen;home; as part of a continuum of care; with consideration for affordability; with adequately skilled respite carers; with consideration for the needs of older non&amp;hyphen;English speaking people and Aboriginal people; in more innovative forms, for example, accommodation for both carers and the person receiving care; and to develop its expertise to cater for older people with sensory disabilities and dementia.

         The results of the report I am using today would surely apply equally to many other parts of Australia. The Blacktown local government area could be described as a financially constrained area based on the evidence of the relatively high proportion of people living in public housing. This group represents 14.9 per cent of the Blacktown population, which is well above the state average of 5.6 per cent. There is also a relatively high proportion of older people on very low income support. This low income support would be an impeding factor in obtaining assistance from community and privately based services for domestic and personal care support. The report says:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Blacktown has a relatively high proportion of residents (33.6%), 65 years and over, who were born in a non&amp;hyphen;English speaking country (NESC). Blacktown is the 4th highest LGA in the state regarding residents, 65 years and over from NES countries.

         In Blacktown there are seven retirement villages comprising self&amp;hyphen;care and hostel units. There are 10 nursing homes. In total there are 17 establishments which have either self-care, hostel or nursing home places or a combination of these forms of accommodation. The Department of Community Services manages four group homes for people with intellectual disabilities and funds a further 13 homes managed by community or church organisations.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This group home accommodation mainly caters for a younger population. In total there are fewer than 10 people over 60 in these homes. A coordinator of a number of these group homes stated that these older residents often suffer from early forms of dementia. As a result they are not able to manage in the group homes because of staffing numbers. The report went on to say:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The extent of community outreach services by retirement villages in Blacktown was not investigated, except to note that Mullauna manages 30 community aged care packages. It is known that some of the community and church managed group homes provide support to assist people with intellectual disability living alone or with carers in the Blacktown area.

        <para style="Para">
         Accommodation is sought in mainstream hostels and nursing homes. Service providers say that it is very difficult to find such hostels or nursing home placements. They are often forced to seek placements out of Blacktown.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is a strong demand for respite accommodation. The resultant waiting list for planned respite means that there is little opportunity for emergency residential care. Also, people with disabilities often have complex care needs that cannot be met in available respite facilities, thereby increasing the concerns of carers of these people. This very important report I am quoting from went on to say:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         While nursing homes and hostels may be inappropriate forms of accommodation for people under 65 years with disabilities, they have often been the only forms of respite for carers of people with disabilities.

         Carers support groups report that in recent times even these `inappropriate' forms of respite are becoming less available, even though there have not been any changes to legislation or departmental policy in this regard.

         This report indicates that there is still a significant number of older people with disabilities or handicaps in Blacktown who are managing to assist each other or are being assisted by some family member without any outside help.

         The older Aboriginal people's needs in this area have never been addressed; they are unique because the elders are much revered. Supply the hostel with the appropriate skilled staff and the families will do the rest. They also have a significantly shorter life span than other groups.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Non&amp;hyphen;English speaking older persons have special needs with dementia in any form that sets in. The first, of course, is language. Therefore the need for hostel and nursing home care in their mother tongue is absolutely essential.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Stroke victims are also there in very high proportions, another horror for the victim and the carers. Stroke debilitates different sections of the brain. Persons who lose the power of speech can be locked into a world we dare not envisage. Then others lose use of limbs and cannot feed themselves or control their bodily functions. Carers are usually the partner until either the carer burns out or ceases physically to be able to perform the needs of the victim.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The conclusion in the report is that there is considerable scope to extend services to support older people with disabilities, especially older carers. The report says:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The potential for expansion of residential services in Blacktown is virtually non-existent. It seems very unlikely that the Commonwealth government (which administers and funds hostel, nursing homes and community aged care package programs) will extend these forms of care in Blacktown.

         Finally, the Mullauna report indicates that more than 50 per cent of the older population of Blacktown with its multicultural character has some disability. Service providers in Blacktown indicate that there are some urgent unmet needs for older people with disabilities and older carers in the area.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         By far the greatest need was for more respite services both in residential care and in-home respite. The demand for respite is constantly increasing, leading to long waiting lists and diminishing opportunities for emergency respite. Further needs include more flexible and more extensive community transport, the alleviation of housebound social isolation and the development of better networking of residential and community based services.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I hope that this report on the needs of older people with disabilities and older carers will lead to improved services for those most deserving people, and I compliment the Mullauna village on their important work.

          —I rise in this grievance debate today to speak to the House about one of the most tragic and distressing problems facing our community; that is, the abuse and neglect of children. We are all aware of the extensive media coverage recently of the sexual abuse of children by paedophiles. This is obviously a serious problem in our society. However, today I want to speak about the abuse and neglect of children by their families, because the most common child abuse offenders—both sexual and non&amp;hyphen; sexual—are family members.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Indeed, a national study by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare showed that natural parents were responsible in more than two-thirds of abuse and neglect cases. Yet the fact that abusive and neglectful behaviour towards children most often occurs at the hands of family members, usually in the home, by no means makes it a private matter. Rather, the abuse and neglect of our children is very much a public issue—one that has tremendous social and economic consequences for our society.
        </para>
        <break page="2579" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          The magnitude of this problem is impossible to illustrate with hard statistics; thus the real incidence of child abuse and neglect is unknown. However, in 1995, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reported that, based on substantiated cases, the annual rate of child abuse in Australia is 5.7 per 1,000 children. The national committee on violence has reported that the age group at greatest risk of violent death in Australia is infants up to 12 months of age. In addition, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare study showed that, based on substantiated cases, the age group with the greatest incidence of abuse and neglect were 13&amp;hyphen; and 14&amp;hyphen;year olds. Furthermore, although female children represent three&amp;hyphen;quarters of substantiated sex abuse cases, both sexes are equally at risk of abuse and neglect. No-one knows for sure whether the incidence of child abuse and neglect is growing, but many law enforcement officials, social workers and members of the clergy who deal with this problem on a daily basis are of the opinion that it is.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          What sort of factors put a child at risk of abuse or neglect?  While it is true that child abuse affects individuals representing all socioeconomic levels, most research suggests that it is the stresses caused by poverty, unemployment, under&amp;hyphen;employment and social isolation. A child is also at risk if his or her parents suffered abuse or neglect as children.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The abuse and neglect of our children entail tremendous social, personal and economic costs in our community. The long-term impact on abused children is grave. These children grow up to have poor self-esteem. They grow up unable to trust others. They often grow up not knowing how to deal with conflict other than through aggressive means, thus setting up a cycle of chronic abuse. Indeed, it is an unfortunate fact that in the area of child abuse violence begets violence.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Although the majority of abused and neglected children do not become delinquent, criminal or violent, studies have shown that being abused or neglected as a child significantly increases that child's risk for delinquency, adult criminal behaviour and violent criminal behaviour. Research based on large surveys overseas suggests that severely abused
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           children are two to three times more likely to have higher rates of academic and disciplinary problems in school, physically violent behaviour at home and outside the home and, of course, substance abuse. Victims of severe child abuse are four times more likely to be arrested.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The tremendous economic costs to federal, state and local governments associated with the abuse and neglect of children include costs of medical treatment, family law services, social security, education and law enforcement. Furthermore, overseas research suggests that arrest and imprisonment by law enforcement officials often does little to deter offenders, particularly amongst those groups that are already highly marginalised in our society.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Given these distressing and costly consequences of child abuse, I have a major concern that the way in which we are dealing with this problem is seriously flawed. What I mean to say is that way too often we depend on social workers, police officers, lawyers, judges and health care workers to pick up the pieces after irreparable damage has been done. Surely we have an obligation to do all that we can to facilitate the prevention of and early intervention into the abuse and neglect of our children.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In this regard, we could learn from some of the community service groups in Australia who are preventing child abuse and neglect by offering supportive services to at risk families. In New South Wales, the real pioneer group in this area is the Child Abuse Prevention Service, known as CAPS. CAPS commenced operating its 24-hour crisis and support line in 1973, three year before the New South Wales Department of Community Services introduced its crisis telephone service. Since that time, CAPS trained counsellors—the majority of whom work without pay—have provided this service 24 hours a day, 365 days year. Remarkably, CAPS has not been off the air, so to speak, since its inception.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In addition to its hotline service, CAPS has six drop-in facilities—at Wyong, Orange, Ashfield, Liverpool, Umina and Tuggerah—for stressed parents, primarily mothers. Ser
          <break page="2580" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
           vices provided at these facilities are aimed at the management of stress, resolving conflict in non-violent ways and promoting attitudes and behaviours which nurture and support children through, among other things, discussion groups, nutrition classes and workshops aimed at boosting self-esteem. CAPS trained counsellors also frequently make home visits to at risk families.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is not an overstatement to say that CAPS has saved the lives of countless children in New South Wales since it commenced operations in 1973. What is truly remarkable is the degree to which CAPS provides these services in spite of
          <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
           extremely limited funds. Other than around a $100,000 annual grant from the Commonwealth government, CAPS relies totally on private donations and the efforts of numerous unpaid staff. CAPS receives not one cent from the New South Wales state government.

          CAPS and similar community sector organisations play a crucial role in the prevention of child abuse and neglect. At this time, I want to acknowledge the contributions of the Children at Risk Committee, which has since 1980 provided a significant community education program in my electorate. We cannot, however, depend too heavily on these organisations. CAPS, the Children at Risk Committee and similar organisations are seriously underfunded by governments at local, state and federal levels.

          I believe we all have a responsibility and a moral obligation to do more to prevent child abuse and neglect. As law&amp;hyphen;makers in this House, we must ensure that a deaf ear is no longer turned towards the cries and screams of Australia's generations of abused and neglected children. Apart from the existing support for child abuse services, we must be mindful that our policies should bring families together. After all, a safe, loving and stable family unit is the best environment for the nurturing of Australia's greatest and most precious asset—its children.

           Grayndler and Lowe. It is something I raised in the House two days ago, but as yet we still have not seen a response from the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) or the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) or in fact from anyone on the other side of the House.

         The situation on 15 October 1996 where an Evergreen Airlines flight left Mascot airport at approximately 12.59 p.m. and sprayed raw avgas over the residents of Grayndler and Lowe—in fact, from the end of the runway right up to Russell Lea, which is near Drummoyne, a distance of 10 kilometres—required, indeed demanded, an immediate response from the minister to show that the residents of the inner western suburbs of Sydney could be confident that some action would be taken to ensure that this did not happen again.

         I raised the issue yesterday in a meeting of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform with the head of Airservices Australia. I was assured by Airservices Australia that they will get back to me with a plan to ensure that these occurrences do not happen again. I would have also thought that we needed an urgent political response from the government to ensure that this does not happen again, because the response I received from the minister to question on notice No. 927, I think, is clearly inadequate. It is clearly inadequate to simply say:

         That someone will pick up the phone and ask the operator to explain their actions is appalling and is really a tickle and slap approach to a very real problem which has the potential to be a health and environmental catastrophe. So today in this House I am raising again the fact that we do not really have a response from the minister on this, and I call upon the government to implement a program of real action.

         There has been massive concern since I raised this issue in parliament. I spoke yesterday on radio 2BL, 2GB, Today FM and Triple M. Residents throughout Sydney were calling talkback radio yesterday, telling their stories about oil and petrol fumes being dumped on their schools, their homes, their children, their parks and their clothes and about the black filter of soot they have to wipe off their cars in the morning at places such as Sydenham and Marrickville in my electorate. Unfortunately, we still have not seen a government response.

         If it is the case that Evergreen Airlines have committed these serious offences—four times at least over a 12-month period—then I think there is a case to say that Australia does not want them. The Australian aviation industry deserves better than to put up with shonky US airlines. US registered airlines have an appalling record on safety and on their mechanical administrative operations.

         It is now up to the government to say, `Enough is enough: repeat offenders will be told they are not welcome in Australia.' For any offence, as a minimum there should be action to bring in very severe penalties which will ensure that there is action on the lackadaisical attitude of these airlines—in this case where five broken fuel valves were spraying fuel all over residents of my electorate and the electorate of Lowe.

         I have been very disappointed with the lack of response from the government on this issue. We see a lack of response on the fuel dumping. We see residents of my electorate in weatherboard houses which cannot be insulated who are still waiting for a response as to what will happen to their homes—

          whether they will be voluntarily acquired or what the government will do now that it has acknowledged that those houses cannot be insulated properly. In just the same way, the people in small businesses in Sydenham who have had to shut up shop and have had their livelihoods taken away are still waiting for a response from the government. Whether that response is positive or negative, it is not good enough to leave them hanging for months and years before there is action. When it is an issue of the millionaire aviator mates of the government, such as Dick Smith, then we see action. But when it is an issue of the health and safety of residents in inner western Sydney we see nothing. We do not see trials of weatherboard housing insulation or of fuel dumping or any of these issues in the ministerial entrance such as we saw with the PAD system. I am very disappointed.

         I am pleased that the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) is in the chamber, because I hope that he will respond with his concern about fuel being dumped on his residents. As yet the member for Lowe has not participated in the aviation debate, because he had a function—and I understand that—for the member for Braddon (Mr Miles), the leader of the ultraconservative Lyons Forum, who is obviously a very important colleague to him. But, frankly, I would have thought last night when the member for Lowe attempted to attack me and the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) in an adjournment speech—it was a bit like being hit with a wet lettuce and we are still waiting for any issue of substance to be raised—he might have mentioned the fact that aviation fuel was dumped on his residents for about four kilometres.

Not only should action and penalties—and if needs be the banning of airlines—be brought in but there should be regular reporting to the Sydney Airport Community Forum of these incidents. Whenever this occurs, you should not have to put a question on notice and wait five months to get details about it. Nor should you have to get a response which just says, `Three similar alleged incidents have occurred,' with no details whatsoever. The residents around Sydney airport have a right to know when carcinogens are being dumped on their heads. They have a right to know, and they have a right to be informed by the minister.

          —Today I want to draw members' attention to a very unrepresented section of the community, the self&amp;hyphen;funded retirees. This group of elderly Australians amounts to about six to seven per cent of the population. They are about a million people, so I am not talking about a small group but a significant one, living not only in my electorate but all over Australia.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The growth in the number of Australians in the over&amp;hyphen;65 bracket dictates that some drastic measures have to be taken if the Commonwealth aged pension is to be retained as a safety net for those unable to provide for their own retirement. With living conditions in Australia some of the best in the world, with excellent nutrition and with skilled medical facilities, elderly people's life expectancy is getting longer. People in good health can function quite efficiently into their mid&amp;hyphen;80s, and a fair proportion will live to be 90 plus. This means that, with a conventional retiring age of 65, people will live in retirement for an average of 20 years. This is a quite significant lifespan at a time when you are no longer getting regular earnings from work.

        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          From talking to groups of self&amp;hyphen;funded retirees in my electorate, it is painfully obvious that these people feel overlooked and neglected by successive governments. I submit that the time has come to take positive action to attend to these people's needs. I again draw members' attention to the fact that over six per cent of the voting public can easily change a government and one million discontented elderly Australians can be ignored at our peril.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Self&amp;hyphen;funded retirees are a special group. They are independent and self&amp;hyphen;sufficient. They do not participate in the welfare system, they are not a burden on the public purse and they are a group of people who have always paid their taxes, abided by the law, conformed to government regulations and generally contributed in their working lifetime to the good of society. In many cases, I am sure they have given much of their personal time—and maybe even their money—to their local community, welfare and political organisations. I believe they should be given a fair go.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Consider some other aspects of this group of a million elderly Australians. In America they are known as the `grey lobby'—an apt and evocative title. Their investments represent a major proportion of national savings. These investments are a major source of funds for national development and, I would like to emphasise again, save the taxpayer many millions of dollars because their investors do not take DSS payments.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In addition, you may find that self&amp;hyphen;funded retirees have helped their families during times of major unemployment. They often assist with education of grandchildren. They support the Treasury in the payment of their taxes. They do much voluntary work for senior citizens' groups and community groups, such as Meals on Wheels. Also, most have retained private health insurance and, therefore, relieve the strain on the public hospital service.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I was approached recently by a branch in my electorate of the Association of Independent Retirees and had the privilege of addressing a meeting at which more than 70 people attended. I have since had the opportunity of discussing with the president, Mr Bob
          <break page="2583" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           Sedgewick, and the vice&amp;hyphen;president, Mr Bill Turner, a number of their concerns of which I seek to inform the House.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The crux of the self-funded retirees' problem lies in the fact that governments in the past have not granted this group any status. There is no classification for self&amp;hyphen;funded retirees in the government's census form. Can you imagine that we actually have today, in the last stages of the 20th century, a million elderly Australians without classification, unrecognised in law and unprotected in attempting to maintain the lifestyle they have worked so hard to achieve? The first thing we must do for this group is put them on the next and subsequent census.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          These Australians see themselves as a great asset to our nation. They ask for recognition of the following basic objectives: tax relief for pharmaceutical expenses, inflation protection for investments, such as tax&amp;hyphen;free bonds; tax deductibility for private health insurance; simplification of criteria for the seniors card and for the card to be made national so that it is accepted by all states.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I now would also draw the attention of the House to a risk factor involved for self-funded retirees. Unlike those who live off the state, who receive a regular fortnightly payment which is indexed for inflation, self-funded retirees have no mechanism open to them but to invest in income producing marketable securities. Fixed interest securities are subject to variable interest rates and ordinary shares are subject to market movements, the profitability of the company and the generosity of the directors. Self-funded retirees do not have the security of a defined income or of cost of living adjustments.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In the taxation area these people are taxed as if they are still working. Only those with incomes under $20,000 have recently received a tax rebate equivalent to that available to pensioners. Furthermore, they have concerns that the current policy is gradually destroying one of our greatest resources—it is not encouraging current wage earners to save for their retirement. The follow&amp;hyphen;on from this is the attitude of the younger generation to saving. They are often heard to say, `What's
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           the use of saving? We will be better off on the pension.'
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is painfully obvious that these one million elderly Australians need attention. They need a member of the government through whom their requests and suggestions can be funnelled. I suggest to the House that a minister be appointed to look after the interests of self-funded retirees. Obviously, with such a large group of people, their problems will spill over to many departments. Therefore, the appointment of a minister to intervene for them, to coordinate all their needs and requests is warranted. Furthermore, an appointment of a minister would be recognition of their status in the community.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As I said earlier in this speech, the self-funded retirees have nowhere to go, no-one to represent their cause or interests. Mr Deputy Speaker, consider the Aboriginal people who number around 300,000 and have a full-time minister, consider the pensioners who have the Minister for Social Security; but self-funded retirees, who number one million, have no minister, no representative, no-one to talk to and nowhere to go.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This group of elderly Australians have never had recognition, yet they are deserving of as much recognition as pensioners, veterans, Aboriginals, migrants, sportsmen, sportswomen, small business, defence personnel, and families, all of whom are recognised and have ministerial representation. These Australians are not a burden to the community; they are not a burden on the welfare system; they are not wealthy—and the longer they live the poorer they get.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I shall end by drawing the attention of the House to the fact that one million voters can easily swing an election, and it would be calamitous if they were turned into an electoral burden. Action to help self-funded retirees in a meaningful, ongoing way should be taken and should be taken now.

A United States drugs company revealed that an anti-influenza pill, which was described as `the drug that could be the most profitable in history' was in its final stages of testing. It was also noted that this wonder drug was the product of years of research by a team of Australian scientists at the Australian National University.

But that is only part of the problem.

          It has been argued that Australia wants stability in an increasingly chaotic world. As a result venture capital, a key ingredient of the success of American research and development, is missing in Australia. Australian governments and capital markets have been reluctant to take the necessary gamble when it comes to most R&amp;D projects. In those cases where the risk has been taken and the research successfully marketed, insufficient property rights have seen Australian firms lose their patents to aggressive overseas players.

          The key to success for technology firms is the getting of, and the marketing of, information speedily. But the protection of intellectual property is equally as important. Without the protection of property rights, companies do not have the time to reap the rewards of their research and development before the patent term lapses.

          Why would any Australian business be interested in funding R&amp;D in Australia under those terms? The earlier mentioned examples of companies researching cures for cancer and the flu show that they do not. They merely move offshore. The current government has to start looking at the bigger picture. It must review its policies towards research and development and patents immediately, otherwise it is probable that Australia will feature even more poorly in this year's world competitiveness year book.

         If Australia's car manufacturers drew up Christmas wish lists last year, those lists certainly would not have included the majority draft report of the Industry Commission on the automotive industry. The majority report recommended an annual reduction in tariffs of 2.5 per cent after the 15 per cent level is achieved in the year 2000, thereby reducing them to 5 per cent in 2005. The dissenting opinion written by associate commissioner Ian

         Of the two conflicting recommendations, the latter is eminently the more palatable choice for my state of South Australia and also for Victoria which are home to the bulk of the car assembly and ancillary industries. In 1988 the tariff on imported vehicles was 45 per cent. It is now down to 22.5 per cent and by the turn of the century it will have been reduced to 15 per cent. The local industry has responded by becoming more efficient and more export oriented and directly employs over 45,000 people, representing 4 per cent of the nation's manufacturing work force and 17 per cent of South Australia's. In the broader sense, 3.5 per cent of the Australian work force relies on the automotive industry for employment.

         In accepting the Button plan, car manufacturers were promised micro and macro economic reform as an offset to the tariff reductions. In the area of tax reform, the performance of federal and state governments has been disappointing, to say the least. For a number of years, business, labour, welfare organisations and politicians of all stripes have been calling on governments to alter the crippling tax structure and I cannot remember a state government coming to power without promising some form of tax reform. Yet all too often the reforms have not been forthcoming and the federal government gets the blame because it will not promise to deliver the shortfall to states' coffers. The time for buck-passing is long gone.

         The federal government should realise that one of the most costly business inputs for car makers is tax. If the automotive industry is expected to compete in a less protected world, then it is up to the government to dramatically ease that adjustment by changing the current tax system. Without tax reform, lowering of tariffs will not be a means to an end, but become an end in itself. Taxes alone are not the only problem. Reforms are needed in many areas and I am pleased to see that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) has set his sights on the wharves after achieving significant change in the labour market. Reforming the waterfront will certainly assist with exports, but a vibrant domestic market is the key prerequisite for a continued and expanded investment and presence of car manufacturers in Australia.

          The South Australian Centre for Economic Studies believes the Industry Commission erred badly in underestimating the importance of the car industry to South Australia. Contrary to the Industry Commission, the centre found that South Australia actually loses from tariff reductions. If tariffs are cut to 5 per cent, the centre calculates that there would be a reduction in my state's GSP of 0.18 percent. It might sound minuscule, but that translates to around $60 million and about 2,500 jobs. That is only the minimum case scenario. Incidentally, the centre is not recommending a halt to tariff cuts either, but merely pointing out the need for accompanying measures to adequately compensate for the tighter regime.

          —In May last year the new government within weeks of taking office announced that, rather than proceed with the development of a second airport for Sydney at Badgerys Creek, it would also examine the possible location of the airport at Holsworthy. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) indicated that this was simply as a means of insurance because of the EIS process that was going ahead with respect to Badgerys Creek and that, in order to ensure that there would be a location for the new airport for Sydney, there needed to be a fall-back option.

         Consequently the government decided to hold an EIS into the Holsworthy option as well. We were told time and time again by the minister and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that nothing sinister had occurred. The government was simply making sure that it did not have all its eggs in one basket and that there was another option available to it with respect to the location of the airport.

        <para first-indent="16">
         At the time the opposition indicated that its view was that the government's decision indicated very clearly that it intended to build Sydney's second airport at Holsworthy for a number of reasons: primarily because it would be cheaper, because the land involved was already Commonwealth owned whereas there was substantial land acquisition already occurring at Badgerys Creek; and because it was closer to existing substantial road and rail infrastructure. The fact that there are one or two marginal Liberal held seats around Badgerys Creek did not escape the opposition's notice either.

The fact that there is a vast amount of unexploded ordnance throughout the Holsworthy area as a result of its having been used as an army bombing range for a very long time was well known. The fact that much of terrain, particularly in the southern area, is full of very deep ravines that will make any form of construction of an airport extremely difficult was already well known. Then other facts began to emerge: the existence of many Aboriginal sacred sites in the area; a number of rare fauna species, endangered species and other things like a very substantial koala colony that would be threatened by the airport development; the existence of the Woronora Dam and catchment area immediately adjacent to the proposed airport site; the presence of the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor nearby; the fact that the proposed Olympic Games shooting range was at one end of where the airport would be located; the obvious presence of Defence facilities that would have to be relocated; the fact that Bankstown airport, the busiest airport in Australia, would almost certainly have to close down because of flight path complications; and other issues such as the fact that one of the world's premier hang gliding locations at Stanwell Tops would have to close because of flight path complications if the southern option for the Holsworthy airport was adopted. Of course, on top of all of these issues there is the very obvious impact on people living in the southern suburbs of Sydney immediately adjacent to the Holsworthy area.

         Throughout this fiasco Labor consistently stated its strong opposition to any airport being located at Holsworthy.

It is clear absolutely deceit. Secondly, people were buying land from the Defence Housing Authority within days of the government's announcement and asking the Defence Housing Authority and various other authorities, `Is there any truth in the rumour that an airport is going to be built here?' They were being told, `No', but when they then proceeded with their contracts they got the shock of their lives to discover that yes, the government was contemplating building an airport at Holsworthy. They were then told when they complained, `Sorry, we could not tell the Defence Housing Authority because that would have given it a commercial advantage against people it competes with in the housing market. Sorry, bad luck. The fact  that you have bought a piece of land that is going to be substantially devalued as a result of what we are doing is just by the by.'

         Over the weekend, an even more outrageous piece of deceit—and the final illustration of what this government has been on about—was uncovered.

         According to this document there is a financial pay&amp;hyphen;off and a political pay&amp;hyphen;off.

What it failed to point out—and it is well known, particularly to people who live there—is that there is a substantial amount of residential housing within a couple of kilometres of the runway locations proposed for Holsworthy, so the deceit and the hypocrisy is absolutely naked.

         The memo tells us precisely how deceitful and duplicitous this government has been on the second Sydney airport issue. Holsworthy has been its real option all along.

The senior adviser to the minister for transport is on the record within the processes of the government, in a document which has been accepted as authentic by a fellow minister, stating that Badgerys Creek is dead—and that was within weeks of the Holsworthy proposal being announced. And yet, to this day, the chimera is maintained.

         The minister has a lot of explaining to do, not only to the House but also particularly to the people of Holsworthy and the suburbs in the southern area of Sydney.

         He has to explain, in particular, his outrageous and duplicitous behaviour, both in the House and outside it, in maintaining that an airport is going to built at Badgerys Creek, and that only if the EIS process is unsuccessful there will Holsworthy be considered, when this document makes it abundantly clear that from day one the real agenda of this government was to build an airport at Holsworthy.

The more I look at it, the more I wonder why it was even on the short&amp;hyphen;list of 10 that was considered by the former government 10 or 12 years ago, let alone the primary target for an airport. This government should stop trying to deceive the people of Sydney. It should stop its outrageous, duplicitous behaviour, come clean on precisely what it intends to do, and take proper account of the communities, through consultation with local residents and associated groups, and work through the issues. It should deal honestly with the issue of a second airport for Sydney.

          —I would like to grieve for the oyster industry in New South Wales and, particularly, for the Wallis Lake oyster industry in my electorate, which is based on Wallis Lake at Forster&amp;hyphen;Tuncurry. Unfortunately, the industry has been hit by disaster in recent times with the outbreak of

         The worst thing about trying to address the problem has been the unbelievable comments made along the way by the Minister for the Environment in New South Wales, Ms Pam Allan. To date she has not been prepared to admit that she was wrong in some of the statements she made, nor has she apologised to the people of the Great Lakes area, based in Forster&amp;hyphen;Tuncurry, for the damage that some of her comments have caused during a very difficult time.

         Those people have been trying to manage, along with the local council, the local member, the New South Wales Department of Health and the EPA. While preparing for the grievance debate this afternoon, we were listening to the news in the office, and we heard that, only this morning, the Premier of New South Wales announced a package of measures to assist in the crisis in the Wallis Lake area. Those measures include an oyster quality assurance program, a financial assistance package, and criteria that will be used for future oyster harvesting, through which the health department will make the final determination on the basis of present scientific evidence.

         On a number of recent occasions, contrary to the comments made by the environment minister in New South Wales, the health department has said that there is no suggestion that the risk associated with swimming in Wallis Lake is greater than anywhere else.

         She has not apologised to the people in the area for the comments she has made, and now the Premier of New South Wales has had to rectify the situation on behalf of his government, albeit a little late when you look at the time frame. On 14 February, the hepatitis outbreak was announced. On 24 February, a man died from the virus, allegedly from contaminated oysters taken from Wallis Lake. In New South Wales, 300 cases of hepatitis

         On 25 February, Pam Allan attacked the council.

         I welcome the announcement by the Premier of New South Wales to assist the community and the industry in resolving the problem that has unfortunately arisen at Wallis Lake. There are two issues here. There is the issue of the alleged contamination of the oysters and what that cost is: the Wallis Lake oyster industry is worth $13 million. There is that element. There is the health element: some 300 people across Australia have been affected by the outbreak of hepatitis A; and there has been one fatality—and that is extremely sad.

         It is incumbent upon the media in this country to make it abundantly clear to the general population that that is the view of the New South Wales health department as far as Wallis Lake is concerned.

         A survey of 100 seafood retailers in New South Wales was undertaken by the Master Fish Merchants Association. Following this disaster in Wallis Lake there is evidence of a 30 per cent drop in seafood sales and an 85 per cent drop in oyster sales, which may have resulted in a loss through the restaurant trade of $15 million to $20 million. This is all within New South Wales. Thankfully, the Premier has recognised it.

         The allegations are that the contamination has come from effluent treatment plants. In the 1980s I was involved in the Greater Taree City Council, and in the mid&amp;hyphen;1980s the Labor Party was in government in New South Wales. When we tried to augment sewage treatment schemes by implementing dry land disposal, the engineers with the Department of Public Works in New South Wales and the Department of Public Works itself—and this was when Bob Carr was the Minister for the Environment—would not allow local government to take that effluent out of the rivers, the tributaries and estuaries, and dispose of it on dry land, because they were philosophically opposed to it. They would not consider any option other than dumping that effluent into the tributaries.

         In fact, may I recommend that those recently retired teachers in the 50 to 60 age bracket be engaged to lend their considerable years of experience and expertise to this very exercise of assisting current teachers in literacy and numeracy skill development. These recently retired teachers have a vast range of teaching strategies that were successful in the classroom and they overcame many difficulties and learning disabilities associated with teaching children to read and understand the written word.

         Over recent years, with changing emphasises within the whole school environment, most teachers have been taken away from their primary role of learning facilitator to deal with a wide range of non-teaching duties. These extra duties take time away from their very real job. What many current teachers would like to return to is quality teaching time in the classroom with as few interruptions to the major task of concentrated learning experience as possible.

          In relation to that, I want to make an observation. The Liberal Party in Western Australia, as the member for Swan (Mr Randall) would know, is having an awful time trying to preselect a replacement for Senator Panizza. On 16 March, at state council which was a very critical meeting in relation to that preselection choice, the member for Forrest, who is the Prime Minister's personal representative in the Western Australian organisation, did not even turn up. Also on 20 May 1995, when there was a similar sort of kafuffle going on at state council in relation to other preselections, he left early before all the hard decisions were to be made.

          —The federal government's handling of the Holsworthy airport issue has been deceitful and disgraceful. On 21 May 1996 the government announced a new EIS process for Sydney's second international airport which included Holsworthy as a possible site in addition to the long identified Badgerys Creek option. On that day, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) said that, despite Holsworthy being included, the government's first priority was Badgerys Creek.

The memorandum, which was a written to the minister just a few weeks after Mr Sharp's statement that Badgerys Creek was the government's first option, discloses that one of Minister Sharp's senior advisers was telling other government staffers that Badgerys Creek was `dead as a viable option for the airport'.

Second, given the growing problem with mercenaries worldwide—as instanced by today's reports of horrific atrocities in Zaire—will the government take up our proposal for Australia to sponsor a UN resolution calling on the international community to condemn all use of mercenaries and strengthen global efforts to eliminate the use of these forces?

We think that is fair and reasonable.

We were able to trace these. I find it disturbing that tampons manufactured in October 1993 are being sold in North Queensland in January 1997. That clearly reflects bad stock turnover and stock control. I would not want to suggest that these tampons are in any way dangerous.

          —I thank the member for Wide Bay for his interest in the veteran community. Accidents—particularly as the member for Wide Bay highlighted—burns and falls, poor nutrition and medication misuse do cause pain and suffering to our veteran community and our war widows in this nation. They can often lead to a lengthy stay in hospital. Anecdotal evidence suggests that preventative care visits to the home of the elderly, incorporating education, advice and referral to health professionals, often lead to an improvement in the health, wellbeing and independence of the veterans and the elderly in our community. That is, of course, an absolute priority of this government.

         This government, and my portfolio in particular, will have an Australian first in this area. Incorporating research with the University of Newcastle, it will trial home based preventative care visits to the homes of veterans and war widows in metropolitan Australia and rural Australia in Queensland and New South Wales. The trial will involve approximately 1,500 veterans and war widows. I can advise the member for Wide Bay that these visits and trials are likely to include veterans and war widows in the cities of Maryborough and Hervey Bay, and in that lovely rural town, Gayndah, in his electorate.

         The trials, I must stress, are voluntary. That is extremely important because we will also be selecting nurses from within the community who are specially trained to visit the homes of veterans and war widows. This is extremely important because they will be able to identify, where necessary, where some of the ills which befall our veteran community are
         <break page="2602" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          able to be prevented. It is much better to prevent an accident by taking preventative action rather than waiting for it to happen.

         This will create a stronger link between the doctor, the veteran and the community nurse.

I will keep the House informed as to the results and the progress of the trials.

Recent evidence has shown that it was not only stolen Jewish gold that was misappropriated with the connivance of Swiss banks but also large amounts of money deposited in Swiss banks by the allies for prisoners of war was misappropriated by the Japanese and used in fact for their war effort. This money was deposited in the Swiss National Bank and with the connivance of the Yokohama Species Bank, now the Tokyo Mitsubishi Bank, was diverted to Japanese forces. Since it is likely that Australian money was involved in the ally deposits, does your government intend to pursue this matter and seek to recover this money? If not, why not?

The government is streamlining arrangements for apprenticeships and traineeships, and one of the most important initiatives in this regard has been the establishment of one&amp;hyphen;stop apprenticeship and traineeship shops. Agreement has been reached by the government with all the states and territories to establish 18 demonstration projects which will combine Commonwealth and state entry level training functions.

         There will be four such shops in New South Wales, four in Victoria, three in Queensland, two in Western Australia, two in South Australia, two in Tasmania and one in the Australian Capital Territory. These shops are part of a very substantial simplification of the training system which the government is putting in place.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This has been necessary because of the extremely complex and bureaucratic nature of the system under the Labor Party. What we tragically saw under the previous government was an emphasis on short&amp;hyphen;term training programs which did not lead on to real jobs and the lowest number of apprentices and trainees as a proportion of the work force for three decades. This government is determined to revive the apprenticeship system, to produce quality training for young Australians, and this initiative is a very important step in this direction.

          —The question before the House today goes to one of the most important issues that Australia as a nation has to come to terms with at the moment, and that is the question of unemployment—a question that is worrying both metropolitan and regional Australia. As has become the case with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) when questioned about these matters during question time, he now seeks, rather than to answer the questions going to the deteriorating employment situation in Australia, to deliver little homilies from the dispatch box.

          House on 10 October last year. It went to the deterioration in the employment situation. It was last October that the Prime Minister yet again gave me one of his little homilies. In essence, he effectively told me to sit down because he does not like to be questioned about the issue of jobs. He told me that I shouldn't dare ask him a question about the most important issue facing Australia today: jobs and the rising job queues.

It is not just the Australian Labor Party raising these concerns any more: it is the people in the outfield, the people in metropolitan Australia, the people in regional Australia. The mob that he likes to refer to from time to time: the people who go to the cricket games, the people who go to the netball, the people who go to the football. Unfortunately, people in every suburb of Australia today know someone who is unemployed. People who are part of families in Australia today unfortunately know of a family member who is unemployed. That is the mob, that the Prime Minister likes to refer from time to time, which is concerned at the moment.

The Howard government has had 12 long months—one&amp;hyphen;third of a normal parliamentary term—to start achieving on the jobs front, to do something about the critical issue of creating real jobs in Australia. But the problem for the Howard government and the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training is that the ledger shows no results at all.

          I think the Australian community has a right to expect some results. I'll tell you why the Australian community has a right to expect some results. The Prime Minister, just 12 months ago, went all around Australia.

          The Prime Minister was, in essence, elected on the promise of creating real jobs. That is what his promise was to the Australian community. He said to all those who would listen, `I will create real jobs.' He talked about the question of job security and promised to resolve the issue of youth unemployment. He told Australians at large that was what he was concerned about. He said he was going to find jobs for our young people. He was going to find jobs for the people in remote and regional Australia. He was going to find jobs for one of the real problems on the unemployment front at the moment—middle&amp;hyphen;aged men. He was going to find jobs for all sections of Australian society.

           The Australian community, 12 months into the life of this parliament, expects some results. That is why the Australian community is saying today in very harsh terms to the Prime Minister that time is up. What is the score? Have you got any runs on the cricket board? Out there in ordinary voter land, out there amongst the battlers, the young and the families, the score looks pretty bad and it is looking worse month by month as we go into the life of this parliament.

           This government is pretty good about chasing the headlines. But when it comes to issues of substance, actually trying to put in place practical programs that are going to produce results and assist in creating opportunities in industry, attract investment and get Australians back to work, it is an abysmal failure.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           As an alternative, we are not talking about real jobs in the parliament this afternoon. In a range of questions put to the Prime Minister today, we had an opportunity to see what his real program is to create real jobs in Australia. What did he talk about? I'll tell you what: he is pretty good on the headlines but awful on the issue of substance. All he could refer to was a pilot work for the dole project or, more recently, what we had floated in the newspapers of Monday last week—boot camps. That is what we have resorted to—boot camps.

          <para first-indent="16">
           Even the Australian military forces, which have been known to be pretty supportive of governments in the past and to be disciplined with respect to public comment, were forced to say in fairly stark terms to the Prime Minister, `We are pretty tolerant of your action on a lot of activities, but, I'll tell you what, we can't wear boot camps.' They rejected it out of hand. When you consider the results, you have to come to some conclusions.

           Let us take the issue of youth unemployment. The truth of the matter is—the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training knows this—that the youth figures have not moved down one iota in 12 months. In reality, more importantly, they are slipping up and up—they have now reached 28 per cent.

           Then we go to the question of long-term unemployment. We slashed labour market expenditure with respect to these desperate cases. We are no longer concerned as a nation in investing public resources in getting those people back to employment. What is the scoreboard on the long-term unemployment front, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) reminded the Prime Minister today? Long-term unemployment is at a 17&amp;hyphen;month high. That is the result that the Prime Minister thinks his government ought to be proud of. There are an incredible 14,200 more people on the long-term unemployment queue as a result of one month's performance—the last month's performance of the Howard government.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The Howard government slashed what I thought was a pretty good investment. It was about Australia as a nation saying to all of us, `If you are unfortunate enough to lose a job, then we are prepared to invest in your future because we are not prepared to tolerate a situation by which there are some Australians who have got jobs, and a significant group of other Australians who do not have that second opportunity, that hope for the future—the long-term unemployed.' They slashed labour market expenditure last May. I know they like to doctor the figures about the performance of Working Nation, but the facts speak for themselves on that front—especially the facts that came out of the mouth of the minister for education at the Senate estimates hearings in recent times. More than 40,000 people have joined the long-term unemployment queue since last May.

          <para first-indent="16">
           Then we go to the issue of regional Australia. This is where they have really achieved—in regional Australia! Youth unemployment has gone up. Long-term unemployment has gone up by 40,000 in less than 12 months. What is the story in regional Australia? I know they are not interested in regional Australia. We no longer have a minister for regional Australia. We have got a minister for unemployment, who is sitting in the House today, but we do not have a minister for regional Australia. What are the results?

            Sixteen per cent of those on the New South Wales north coast are jobless. That figure was 11.8 per cent when we lost government. We found a job up there recently for one of their mates, Doug Anthony, but we cannot find jobs for the unemployed on the north coast of New South Wales.

            Let's go to Bendigo and Ballarat. There is a big black hole in Bendigo, where they promised an art gallery that would have assisted in creating jobs. The member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) is absent from the chamber at the moment, as is the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson). Perhaps they are out looking for the black hole. In the Bendigo area unemployment is at 10.4 per cent. In the Ballarat area it has jumped not by half a per cent in a month but from 8.3 per cent to 10.3 per cent. If I were either the member for Ballarat or the member for Bendigo, I would be looking for that black hole very quickly. There is a stark reminder in the city of Bendigo about the importance of job creation and Working Nation. There is a stark reminder in the city of Ballarat about the importance of industry policy and making sure that we protect decent industries that create real jobs, such as the textile clothing and footwear industry and the vehicle industry.

           <para first-indent="16">
            Then we go to South Australia—another state that depends on a decent industry policy. In regional South Australia in just one month we lost 1,000 jobs. In the New South Wales central west 4,600 were thrown onto the jobless queues. I could go on but, unfortunately, time does not permit me to do so this afternoon.

           <para first-indent="16">
            That takes me to the real solutions offered by the Howard government. What do we get? Work for the dole, with discounted wages on the training wage proposal that was producing the results. It was the member for Goldstein himself—the minister responsible—who admitted in the House yesterday afternoon that it was not going to produce a real job, that it really would not seriously assist in reducing youth unemployment in Australia. I suppose he is now going to suggest that it is not even a labour market program. Unfortunately, the Australian community might see it as being fairly popular at the moment, but

            The Australian public are now starting to see what is really behind this proposal. Before the election they did not support work for the dole. A couple of weeks ago when we had to hide Senator Woods the government announced it, and it was just for young people. As we questioned them in question time it went from being for 20&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds to being for 25&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds, and now we have ended up with an open ended scheme. I suppose that is what happens when you are more concerned about creating jobs for Senator Short or Doug Anthony, or even Peter Nixon. What is Peter Nixon's real job? It is investigating the economic situation in Tasmania and how they might create jobs. Unemployment in Tasmania is pretty bad, so that is why we have got to try to create an impression that we are creating real jobs, full-time jobs. So what do we see in the media today? We are going to redefine full&amp;hyphen;time work.

           <para first-indent="16">
            I think we did pretty good as a Labor government. We have got a terrific record on employment, with the creation of real part&amp;hyphen;time jobs and real full-time jobs. Importantly, that created great opportunities for women, but now we are going to try to distort the situation by the redefinition of part-time and full&amp;hyphen;time work. The facts will speak for themselves.

           <para first-indent="16">
            This government has failed. The Australian community does not feel secure as a result of the election of the Howard government. They are tense and scared. They are tense and scared as unemployment numbers go up and their jobs are placed at risk. I suggest to the Howard government that the time has come to change its budget strategies for the sake of all Australians. Promises were made and promises are being broken. Do not let Australia down on the most important issue at the moment. All Australians are entitled to a real job. It does not matter whether it is a part-time or a full&amp;hyphen;time job. Do not seek to create a hoax by now redefining the issue of part-time as against full-time jobs. Invest in Australia, invest in labour market programs and invest in industry policy.

          —Mr Deputy Speaker, unemployment is certainly one of Australia's greatest social problems. It is probably the single most damaging legacy of the previous government. The previous government showed itself absolutely unable to address the problem and to provide Australians with real jobs. It spent taxpayers' money, money earned by the hard work of the working families of this country, and it spent that money like water in an attempt to solve the problem through government schemes, mickey mouse training schemes and by churning the long&amp;hyphen;term unemployed through these schemes to redefine them as short&amp;hyphen;term unemployed. It tried every stratagem in the book but it was unable to make any significant progress whatever.

         In the last six years of the Labor government's administration, the net additional full&amp;hyphen;time jobs that it created numbered 7,100. And the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) has the effrontery to get up in this House, after 13 years of atrocious policy failure, to criticise this government for not solving, in 12 months, the problem that they left. At no stage throughout those 13 years did the Labor government attempt to address the fundamental reasons for unemployment in this country. I will go through those fundamental reasons one by one and look at Labor's failure on each one. They were full of rhetoric then; they are full of rhetoric now.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The fact is that there has been job creation since the last election. In fact, employment in Australia now is the highest it has ever been. There are more people in jobs now in this country than there have ever been at any previous time in Australia's history. We do not claim that that is good enough. We do not go around the country trumpeting that fact and pretending that somehow or other that solves the unemployment problem; we know that there are fundamental issues that need to be addressed, that are being addressed by this government, that were not addressed for 13 years.

          Firstly, policies need to be put in place that will encourage Australians to save and invest in job creation. No government in Australia's history did more to destroy savings than the Labor government. Over the last six years they accumulated something like $70 billion worth of deficits: $70 billion they did not have, they spent. And did that produce jobs? Did that produce a prosperous economy? Did that revive small business? Did it bump up investment?
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          No, of course it did not. It destroyed jobs because it pushed up interest rates to some of the highest real interest rates in the world. They drove small business bankruptcies to record levels. They imposed on small business industrial relations laws which absolutely bound and tied the enterprises of this country so they could not invest and have confidence in employing people. They put in place an unfair dismissals law that discouraged small businesses from taking on full&amp;hyphen;time employees. They thought they could solve unemployment by spending, but they could not.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In that respect, of course, they were being absolutely true to Labor Party tradition, because that is exactly what Labor has always done. It is what they did under Whitlam; it is what they did under Hawke; it is what they did under Keating, and it is what they still want to do because they will not face up to the fact that, unless you create an environment in which small business is willing to create jobs, you will not solve the unemployment problem.

           Here are his successors—not one, but two of them—the two big spenders, the believers in deficit financing, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and the member for Batman. The member for Hotham is the person who probably spent more money on labour market programs than anyone—churning the unemployed through, trying to redefine them as short&amp;hyphen;term unemployed and not offering them any real jobs.

The member for Batman has plans to spend even more money. He has plans to ensure that there will be absolutely unlimited access to the labour market services provided by government. That is why he criticises this government—because we are not planning to provide unlimited access to these services. The Labor Party in government—not even under the member for Hotham—did not provide unlimited access, but the member for Batman thinks that there should be unlimited access. He is prepared to spend not merely $2 billion but maybe $4 billion or $6 billion, and all of that money will come out of Australian small business. He is not going to get it all through the tax system but, to the extent that he does, it will come out of the pockets of battling families.

There was one very clear message that was given by the hundreds of young people at that conference and that was, `Stop putting us through Simon Crean's short&amp;hyphen;term training programs.

In December 1993 the discussion paper `Restoring Full Employment', commissioned and published by the Keating government, said that job sharing may, in some cases, increase employment in the short term but leads to a poorer long-term employment result, primarily because it lowers overall productivity levels and, therefore, per capita incomes.

          —Well, well, well. We have two ex-members of the ACTU standing up and trying to tell us how to run the government. The Labor Party—which embraced privatisation, embraced enterprise bargaining, embraced union power in the accord and sold out on tariffs—now expects their party faithful to come running back to them all of a sudden as new Labor. Well, they did not six months after the 3 March by&amp;hyphen;election in Lindsay. Now, 12 months after the by-election, I am sure we would get another five per cent increase in our vote.

         Labor is going absolutely nowhere. It has gone nowhere since the 1990 recession where we had 11.2 per cent of Australians unemployed, and the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) professes concern. Oh, he is terribly worried. His heart is breaking for

          the battlers—for the people at the football. What about the battlers of Lindsay? What about the guys who had to sit there as Labor doled out a 40 per cent increase on sales tax, as they were strangled by the regulation that the Labor Party put on small business, as they suffered tax hike after tax hike, as they suffered ridiculously high interest rates and as the Labor government destroyed Commonwealth savings?

         In 1992 the Labor government spent $11&amp;half; billion more than they collected. In 1992&amp;hyphen;93 the budget figures show that they spent $17 billion more than they collected; in 1993-94, another $17 billion more than they collected; in 1994&amp;hyphen;95, another $13.2 billion more than they collected. Evidence that they were still on the same track—if the Liberal Party had not returned to government—is Beazley's black hole. The 1995-96 figures came up with a $10.3 billion deficit.

        <para first-indent="16">
         How did the Labor Party pay for this—the party that stood for government enterprise, the party that stood for non&amp;hyphen;privatisation? They sold off Qantas, they sold off the uranium stockpile, they sold off ASTA, the sold off the FAC, CBA and ANL. There is not really much left for us to sell when it comes to fund the $5.6 billion deficit we are facing this year.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The deficit is slowly coming down. We are slowly getting Commonwealth savings back into government in Australia. This government will slowly get money in the bank so that, if we do suffer a hiccup such as a recession, we do not have 11.2 per cent unemployed as we did in 1992. We will have savings. We can spend our way out of a recession. That is why Labor could do nothing about the deteriorating labour figures.

         Despite an economic upturn from December 1995 until March 1996, unemployment went from 8.1 per cent to 8.5 per cent. Australia was in a mess, and the country knew it. The numbers in parliament are proof of this. Those very same ex&amp;hyphen;ACTU members and ex&amp;hyphen;union bosses, who sit there with their fancy deals and sell their members' interests out to big business to keep themselves a nice cushy job through the union movement into parliament, stand here today and betray the very people they were sent to represent. What

         Instead of coming up with a solution, Labor came up with NWOS, new work opportunity schemes. They cost $10,000 a head. They had a 21 per cent success rate, and the rest of it was wasted money. Do you know what the beautiful thing about that is? Those people did not count in the unemployment figures. Those people were counted as training, so they were not unemployed. At the end of their LEAP project, new wave project or any of those other government sponsored programs, they went back into the short&amp;hyphen;term unemployed.

         Talk about fiddling the figures. If you are worried about how statistics lie, let us have a look at what Labor were doing to the unemployed: they were not counting these figures in the unemployment statistics. They make wild allegations that our minister had anything to do with those figures in 1978. He was not even there.

         If you work for one hour a week, even if it is in a family business, then on the ABS statistics you come up as not unemployed. The distinction between employed and unemployed has not changed. The facts and figures we are talking about here are exactly the same, and the changes in the definition of part&amp;hyphen;time and full&amp;hyphen;time work have only occurred for administrative reasons in the employment placement enterprises. They will receive government sponsorship for their money, if the person they have placed has entered full&amp;hyphen;time employment—defined as more than 20 hours a week for six months. I do not know why the ACTU is making such a big thing about this. It stands to reason that, if this enterprise has got these people into a job—and let us define job—they should get paid for it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But the facts and figures that the ABS uses to come up with full&amp;hyphen;time and part&amp;hyphen;time statistics have not changed. There has been no diddling of the unemployment figures. We have crystallised the unemployment figures. We have not hidden them in programs; we
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          have crystallised unemployment. If you are on the dole now, we know you are. We have a work for the dole scheme, you can join the army, you can do a whole bunch of things, but we recognise that you are unemployed.

         And we recognise that another of Labor's solutions—`give them a government job'—is not a solution. Under Labor, one out of every five jobs was in the state government, local council or Commonwealth public services. Again, the people in the other four jobs had their hands heavily in their pockets to pay for the person in the fifth job. We have recognised that those are not real jobs. You cannot hide unemployment figures and stack the books that way. In the end, we have to pay for our public servants and, if there is no money, there is no money to do that.

         The other solution the opposition has come up with is job sharing. Let us share a job—you beauty! `Wow, I can have a full&amp;hyphen;time job and bring things home for my kids and my family and my spouse, and we can go away on weekends, or I can have a part&amp;hyphen;time job.' What do you think workers want? They want full&amp;hyphen;time jobs. In the last 12 months we have crystallised unemployment and we have set some very strategic groundbreaking measures in place to get out of the rut and off the track to disaster that we were on on 3 March 1996.

         It has not been easy. It has been a long haul. We have not had much help from the opposition in the Senate. We have not been able to act quickly. Even so, we have balanced the budget. We are heading towards a target in 2000 where we will have government savings to help kick&amp;hyphen;start us out of recession. With that has come a certain amount of offshore confidence which has lowered interest rates. Do not underestimate what impact that has had—the flow&amp;hyphen;on effects are just coming now.

         We now have low inflation and we have flexible workplace relations, which only came in January. Given time, both of those will see an increase in jobs. We have also got individually tailored assistance for the unemployed: they can get the skills that they need and they are still recognised as unemployed and counted in the unemployment statistics. We are not fudging things here. This is a very

They are entitled to be treated as adults and not as patronised children—as the opposition used to treat them prior to 3 March 1996. We have also spent an enormous amount of time reinvigorating small business and reducing red tape. We have a task force report coming in next week. We have got reduced provisional tax, the capital gains rollover relief and relief in sight for FBT.

         A lot of the difficult decisions that we on this side have had to make since coming to government have to be put in the context of the fiscal situation as we found it at that time. Of course, it would have been much easier to come to government with a clean slate and with the opportunity to not only do things which needed to be done but also continue those many programs which had some merit and were introduced by the previous government, which spent with impunity on so many programs for so long, and we are now bearing the cost of that. You could name lots of programs which had considerable merit, such as the Commonwealth Dental Service.

         We came into government with the enormous task of turning this country's finances around. That was a difficult task and it affected every portfolio area. I notice that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) is in the House at the moment. His portfolio was particularly affected. But all areas were affected because of the need to get the fiscal position in order.

          In that context, we have been looking to raise revenue. I take it that the main thrust of this measure is to achieve that objective. I think there are some other arguments for it. Some of my colleagues—I note that not many will be speaking on this bill—will probably make some of those points. The measure is intended to raise something in the order of $450 million. From the government's budgetary point of view, it is a very important measure.

          I notice that the opposition is not intending to oppose the measure outright, although it has moved an amendment.

          We did make that commitment and by and large we have maintained it in very difficult circumstances. We can deal with the semantics of this issue as to whether it is a surcharge or whether it is a tax, but in the end I do not think it is terribly productive to do that. In the context of the fiscal difficulties we faced when we came to government, it is understandable that we had to take some steps. We could not do it with our hands entirely tied behind our backs. So this is one important measure which is intended to raise $450 million.

          The amendment makes the suggestion—again, it reflects the shadow Treasurer's garrulity—that the government is `deliberately inflicting on the superannuation industry an impossibly cumbersome, inefficient and expensive collection method'. That may be so. Certainly, it has been a concern raised not only by the industry but by others. They have suggested that the administrative complexities will be enormous and pointed out that the costs will be directly or indirectly borne by all members of funds and their employers. They are saying that there is going to be an administrative expense involved—I have heard a figure of perhaps as much as $30 million—in collecting it.

          Perhaps there are other ways of collecting the surcharge but, on balance, in the discussions that we have had with the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on this matter, this appears to be the best way to collect the levy. Any other way of collecting it would place a burden on a larger number of either individual taxpayers or small businesses. In the end, it comes down to what the most effective way of collecting it is, and this appears to be the answer to that. Part (d) of their amendment restates that point, using a number of other adjectives and adverbs, and, as I say, in the shadow Treasurer's best style, and (e) and (f) do not contribute much to it. The important point is that the opposition recognises that this is an important revenue raising measure and ultimately, I think, recognises, as I understood what the shadow Treasurer was saying, that it had the merit of largely being imposed on high income earners.

In a sense, we are all signing a blank cheque here. I do not say that lightly but the complexity, which I concede is a factor, is making it very difficult for us to get an accurate determination of what the actual impact might be on members of parliament.

Over 13 years of the former government there were numerous changes and prior to the last election we had got to the point where people, if they had not lost confidence in superannuation, were fairly close to losing confidence in it and giving up on it simply because, even if it was a good investment—and it was and is, despite the surcharge, I believe—there is nevertheless an element of complexity about it and, dare I say, an element of a lack of trust, that it is seen as a milch cow and an easy target for governments of any complexion to seek to raise revenue from it.

          Since the 1970s, there has been a revolution in superannuation in Australia. Up until that time, superannuation was the province of a limited number of executives, mainly men I would say, and I suppose public servants, but from the early 1980s, when the extent of Australia's ageing population problem became apparent, superannuation has been encouraged as the principal means of saving for retirement. Many people have had the opportunity to do that.

         <para first-indent="16">
          In the context of our ageing population, it needs to be pointed out that the prediction of the Bureau of Statistics is that our population of over 65s will increase from 2.1 million in 1993 to 5.1 million in the year 2035. That makes the point very clearly that not only is the Australian population ageing but it is ageing at an increasing rate, in fact, at a great rate. It accentuates the importance of making people aware of the fact that they will have to save for their own retirement.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The other point in this context that needs to be understood is that people can expect to spend up to one&amp;hyphen;third of their lives in retirement and, very clearly, because of that long period in retirement—25 or even more years—it is a lot of years in which they will not be working when they will not be able to depend on the government to provide for that retirement. So once again, it accentuates the importance of people understanding that they will have to save for their own retirement and that superannuation has been and will continue to be the main avenue for that particular saving.

If you do the maths of it—and I have not done that, but I can guess—there will just not be enough people in the work force able to pay enough tax to provide for the 5.1 million people by 2035 who will be

          People must be encouraged to save. In saying that I mean that they must be encouraged to invest for their retirement and to use those savings for that purpose. That is a radical change. It is a change that has only dawned on us in the last five or 10 years. I think it was a change that the former government brought about. It brought us to that point although it was controversial and difficult. I notice the former Treasurer, the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), is in the House at the moment. Obviously he realised, as the government of the day did, that we had to get people to a point where they understood that they had to save for their retirement and be prepared to use those savings to support themselves in retirement.

          We have also learnt to understand—the former government went well down that track and we are moving further down that track—that middle class welfare is no longer an option.

          We now find ourselves in a situation where people are not just encouraged to have superannuation, but it is mandated. Whilst that was a controversial decision at the time—and I think in opposition there were a lot of aspects of that compulsion which a number of us in the coalition had some difficulty with—we now accept that it is a fact of life. I believe we are committed to the ongoing success that that system should have in getting people to contribute, although we recognised at the time that it was a very long-term project. Once we get to the year 2030—when I say `we' I suppose I mean those who are still around—this will probably be looked at as the right thing to have done at the time. As the level of employer support grows from five per cent to I think it will be nine per cent in the year 2001 that system should really start to kick in and begin to be seen to be working.

          —I rise to support the second reading amendment to this superannuation contributions surcharge legislation moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). The professed aim of the bills now before the House is to improve the equity of the tax system in relation to superannuation. The source of the alleged inequity in the present system is that we have a system which essentially taxes at a flat rate and gives greater benefits to people on higher incomes. The bill proposes to redress that by proposing a surcharge or an additional tax, to give it its proper title, on people on higher incomes in respect of their superannuation.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let me say firstly that we do not oppose increasing the equity of the superannuation system. Clearly Labor in government demonstrated that amply because the system we inherited from the previous government when the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was the Treasurer was one which had virtually no tax on superannuation at all. The only tax on superannuation was the five per cent tax on the superannuation lump sum and you paid that at marginal tax rates. At 60c in the dollar, which was the top marginal tax rate in those days, you paid three per cent tax. That was John Howard's tax regime for superannuation—three per cent.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We changed that in many respects. It was also, I must say, a system which was there mainly for higher income earners, because low income earners did not have superannuation. It was not something that was available to them, except for those who worked for governments. But for the ordinary, run&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;mill private sector employee, there was no such superannuation available—40 per cent of the population had superannuation, and most of them were higher income earners.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So we did two things. We made superannuation generally available, which improved
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          the equity because then everyone was entitled to superannuation. We did that through awards, the super guarantee system—the legislative approach—and then, of course, by changing the tax regime. The tax regime was eventually changed so that we had a 15 per cent tax on the contributions and a 15 per cent tax on the earnings on the fund. For lump sums, they were free of tax up to what is now $86&amp;half; thousand and then 15 per cent tax on the rest.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For pensions, they were taxed at the marginal tax rate minus 15 per cent, reflecting the 15 per cent that had been paid at the contributions and earning stage. So the tax rate, if you took a lump sum, was between 15 per cent and 30 per cent compared to the three per cent under the now Prime Minister when he was Treasurer. For a pension, there was simply no concession. You paid tax effectively at your marginal tax rate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In relation to unfunded schemes, tax was only on the end benefits. For lump sums, it was 15 per cent on the front $86&amp;half; thousand and then 30 per cent. For pensions, tax was at the marginal tax rate. So, again, the total tax rate was between 15 per cent and 30 per cent for the lump sums and no concessions on pensions. That is the system on which all of this is being added.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In addition, we sought to limit the extent to which people could utilise the concessionality that was in the system through the introduction of RBLs—reasonable benefits limits—which set limits on how much you could take as a lump sum and how much you could take in terms of the total package, including pensions. So it was not there for complete exploitation with people with very high incomes being able to milk this for all it was worth.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So they were major steps towards improving the equity of the superannuation system, enormous steps compared to what was there before. Now everyone benefited from superannuation and the tax regime was far fairer. So we have very good credentials in that respect, but also we proposed to build on that through another system which was to provide for compulsory employee contributions, up to three per cent, from July 1999 and a matching
         <break page="2626" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          means tested government co&amp;hyphen;contribution of up to three per cent of average weekly ordinary time earnings for employees' contributions. This also applied to the self-employed in respect of their undeducted contributions.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So we had the second leg of the tax cuts being converted into a payment, a matching co&amp;hyphen;contribution, into superannuation payable only to low and middle income earners. The top income earners were not going to get a penny out of that, not a cent out of the second leg of the tax cuts because they had been means tested out of it. It was all going into private sector savings, through superannuation, matching contributions to low and middle income earners.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So we were certainly going to add to the equity of the system in a very big way by that approach, an approach which I think has effectively now been abandoned. Of course, that would have boosted savings. Treasury estimated it would increase savings by one per cent of GDP by the year 2005 and 1.7 per cent by the year 2020, and of course it also considerably improved the equity of the system.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Now we have a government adopting a different approach. I must say, we see considerable problems with the way the government proposes to increase equity in the legislation now before the House. Firstly, there is the suggestion of unconstitutionality by certainly an eminent person—Dennis Rose, the former Chief General Counsel to the Attorney-General. Whether he is right or not, I do not know. All I know is that there is certainly a substantial chance that there could be some unconstitutionality involved in the approach taken here. There is also, obviously, the problem with the states. I do not want to go into that in any further detail because it has been well covered by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We also see considerable problems with the way the government proposes to increase equity, and some of them are directly related to the way the government has designed this measure to try to avoid the tax label. It is petrified of labelling the thing as a tax because it promised not to introduce any new
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          taxes—and clearly this is a new tax, along with various other new taxes. It is trying desperately to dress it up as something other than a tax.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is a tax, quite clearly, and Dennis Rose said it clearly was. Although this tax is supposedly levied only on higher income earners, one of the really bad effects of this approach is that many lower income earners will be forced to pay the tax because, if they do not supply their tax file number to the super fund, which is to be reported to the tax office, they will pay the 15 per cent tax.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is highly likely that many low and middle income earners will not supply their tax file number to the fund. They will not do it because they do not understand the consequences of not doing so, or because they are lost members. Lost members can be as high as 20 per cent of members—that is, people that the fund has lost touch with. So they cannot notify them to say, `If you don't give us the tax file number, we can't pass it on and you'll be liable to the tax.' They cannot even tell them that, and many of those they do tell are not really going to understand the implications.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There will also, of course, be people who will have supplied the tax file number to their employer and think that that is adequate. So they have already given it to someone and think, `Why can't the employer pass it on,' or think he is going to but, in fact, he cannot because of the privacy provisions around the tax file number. So, for various reasons, you are not going to get the tax file number passed on by many low and middle income earners who will, therefore, be subject to this tax.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If only 10 per cent of them did not put in their tax file number, you would be looking at something like three&amp;hyphen;quarters of a million people who would be involved. The industry estimates about a million. Of course, they have some experience in this. They have been trying to get people to give them their tax file number. There has been a situation where there has not been the added incentive of a tax if you do not, but they have had very poor results—up to about 20 per cent at best, five per cent to 20 per cent of returns. So they are
         <break page="2627" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          not getting the kind of return from their members that gives them any confidence at all that they will get everyone providing the tax file number. This is terribly important because this whole thing is supposed to be about equity but, if there are vast numbers of low income earners paying this tax, it is going to have very inequitable effects.

         All employees at whatever income level will be adversely affected by the cost of administration that this measure will foist on the super funds. Estimates of these costs are around $100 million in the first year and $30 million ongoing. It is a tremendously high administrative cost to raise around $500 million, which is the supposed revenue from the tax. And that does not include the ATO's admin costs, which are also going to be very high.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Why are these costs so high? It is because the super funds have to gather and pass information to the tax office in respect of over 16 million accounts, just so that 355,000 higher income earners can be subjected to the surcharge. What an incredibly crazy administrative approach. Sixteen million accounts have to be processed in order to tax 355,000 people. It is just absurd. And this is from a government which parades itself as being here to cut the costs of red tape for small business.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The fact is that many small businesses wear the costs of their superannuation schemes and they cover those administrative costs themselves directly rather than putting them om the fund. And they will wear these costs and they are going to scream. They are going to say, `How does this fit with your promise about cutting red tape by 50 per cent?'
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Through lack of time, I will not go through all of the ways in which the super funds bear these costs. But they are considerable administrative costs and they are going to have this ridiculous impact on the funds because what they do is reduce returns, therefore the fees are going to have to be higher. They are going to have to cover those higher costs by increased fees or reduced returns to members, and so you have an outcome where all members of superannuation funds, even if they all supply their tax file number, are going to be
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          adversely affected, because they will wear those higher charges.

         Also, eligible termination payments—that is, golden handshakes, retirement bonuses, redundancy payments—will all be caught up in this tax net. Of course, with redundancy payments there is an allowance for the tax free area which is, I think, $4,348 plus $2,174 per year. But anything over that gets caught up in this net. Many employees who have been sacked and then get a redundancy pay are going to find that that additional redundancy pay takes them into the bracket of high income earners. Therefore, they will be subject to the surcharge; therefore, just at the time that they get sacked they get hit with an additional tax, and then of course they are facing unemployment. And then the government says, `Hang on. Before you can claim any unemployment benefits, we are going to take your super benefits into account as well.' It is like a triple whammy—you got sacked, you got hit with extra tax and then you got means tested on your superannuation. It seems as though there is a vendetta against these sorts of people. This is surely incredibly inequitable.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is also the fact that the transitional arrangements for golden handshakes last only five years, till 2001. After that, any golden handshake you get, which might be in respect of service that goes back 20 or 30 years before this legislation came into effect, gets taxed in full. It is real retrospective taxation. It is an outrage.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Furthermore, the way in which this legislation proposes to deal with unfunded defined benefit schemes is absolutely bizarre. An unfunded scheme of course has no annual employer contribution to tax, so what this legislation proposes is that  such funds should for each member maintain a surchargable debt account, which will be calculated each year by use of a notional surcharge contribution rate obtained from tables currently being prepared by the Institute of Actuaries and agreed by the Australian Government Actuary and the Australian Taxation Office.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So the funds will be keeping these notional accounts—only notional accounts because there is no contribution while the person is
         <break page="2628" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          actually in the fund—so they have the administrative expense of keeping that each year and putting an interest rate on it as well. And then they will inevitably find at the end of the day that it is not the right amount because the right amount can be determined only by the circumstances of the person when they retire. Whether it is voluntary or involuntary retirement, how long they have been in the system and so on will change the type of benefit they take. So just why there is a need to keep these notional accounts is beyond me.

         Furthermore, these actuarial tables have not been prepared yet. So no&amp;hyphen;one in such a fund, which includes many public servants and members of parliament, knows what the impact of this legislation will be, as the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) said. And most importantly, the government does not know, but it is bringing legislation into this House, saying, `We are going to impose a tax and we don't know what the impact is.' They cannot even tell us what the impact is on us—let alone tell anybody else outside in respect of these unfunded schemes. They simply do not know. So this is a bizarre state of affairs. What an incredibly poor legislative approach it is to bring in legislation when you have no idea what the impact is on those whom it is going to affect.

         In respect of the parliamentary super scheme, the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) is saying. `Well, this might have an impact of around 13 per cent, we think. But we don't really know.' But there are calculations being made in the industry which say that this impact could be more of the order of over 50 per cent reduction in the end benefit. That is before normal taxation cuts in. So those calculations are out there, and what is the government saying about that? What is it saying to the public servants about their unfunded scheme?

         This tax will also have the perverse effect of discouraging many people from putting their money into superannuation, as the member for McPherson acknowledged, because they will see very little tax advantage. Indeed, there will be no tax advantage if they take a pension. That is because those subject to this new tax will be taxed at rates higher than the top marginal tax rate.

         For those with funded schemes, the contribution rate will now be 30 per cent, there will be an earnings tax rate of 15 per cent and a pension tax rate of the marginal tax rate minus 15 per cent. So if you are on 48&amp;half; per cent, minus 15 means you are on 33&amp;half; per cent, but you have already paid 30 per cent on the contribution rate and then you are paying 15 per cent on the earnings. So what was actually in the fund is taxed somewhere between 15 and 30 per cent but closer to 30 per cent, then you have 33 per cent on your pension, and you are paying something up towards a 63 per cent tax rate. That is the effective tax rate that is going to apply in these circumstances—way over 48&amp;half; per cent, the top marginal tax rate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For those with unfunded schemes, pensions will be reduced by this tax on retirement by the application of the 15 per cent surcharge and will then be subject to full marginal tax rate. Although the pension itself will be reduced at the outset by a process that I do not have time to go into, it will then be subject to the full marginal tax rate. But the full effect of that is that it is being taxed at way over the top marginal tax rate, at around 63 per cent. If you are going to be taxed above the marginal tax rate, where is the concessionality? Who in their right mind will take a pension? If you are going to get taxed at 63 per cent, why would you take a pension if you can avoid it?

        <para first-indent="16">
         As for lump sums—those in funded schemes—there will be 30 per cent tax rate on the contribution, 15 per cent on the earnings, a tax-free lump sum of up to $83,000 plus 15 per cent thereafter, which means that the tax will be at 45 per cent for amounts over $83,000. That is close to the top margin
         <break page="2629" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
          al tax rate—still some concessionality but not much. So people, after they get over the $83,000, will not see much value in staying in these schemes. For pensions, people will not see any value because they are going to be taxed at the full marginal rate. So why bother being in them?

         We now have a situation where we have great incentives to get out of superannuation. We are seeing such articles as `Get out of super'. The message that the Institute of Chartered Accountants is having its member accountants tell their clients is that they should choose other investments over superannuation in the near future. I expect that will be a very wide reaction—which, of course, raises the question about the revenue. If they do get the money, it is much more likely that the money will come not from the high income earners it is proposed to tax but from the people who are the unintended consequences of the surcharge—the collaterally damaged lower&amp;hyphen;middle income earners who are going to have to wear the impact through not supplying their tax file numbers.

         Of course, the better approach to have taken would have been to pursue what the Labor government had announced in its 1995 budget, and that was to greatly improve the equity of the tax system in the way that I mentioned earlier. That would have certainly meant that we would have had an administratively simple scheme. The government, of course, could say right now that it is going to pursue that scheme. It certainly said at the election that it would, except that it maintained the right to vary the mechanism. But in fact the government has destroyed the whole way in which that scheme could have worked by taking superannuation out of awards. So the whole process of requiring employees to make contributions cannot be maintained now because superannuation will not be an award condition in a couple of years time.

         Clearly, the government has in mind, in any case, using the second leg of the tax cuts not as matching co-contributions for employee contributions but by setting up some medium&amp;hyphen;term savings vehicle which is not going to be superannuation at all. That will be less equitable, because it will be utilised mainly by

All I will say to that is that members of the opposition and all members of the government through their connections with the community at all levels should be ensuring that that information is got out. It is an affront for the member for Gellibrand to infer that they will not get around to it and that it is going to be a problem.

         I also doubt if enough people realise that, for a PAYE taxpayer, this surcharge is only payable on the tax deductible component. Let's tell all the facts. Whose is the tax deductible component? If it had been prior to 13 years ago, it would have also included the employee's contribution. But the Labor Party got rid of that. Now it is on the employer's contribution, not the employee's contribution. This is the amount that the employer contributes. For the self&amp;hyphen;employed the surcharge is

But what the financial advisers and fund managers are not pointing out is that the surcharge will be collected in the same manner as that already in place for collecting their existing 15 per cent tax on superannuation funds.

Let's take someone at 50 years of age who draws from his business $30,000 a year. I will ask anybody to deny in this place that the majority of people who are in their own business, and who operate a self&amp;hyphen;funded system, draw much more than that—and we all know that—because they minimise legitimately and correctly what they have to pay in taxation.

If you add that $38,000 to the $30,000, you come up with $68,000. That is $2,000 under the threshold of $70,000. Where are they going to pay their one per cent up to 15 per cent on that?

These advisers have let us know in no uncertain terms that they will discourage their members to continue with current superannuation and will encourage them to find alternative means of investment and tax minimisation. The member for Gellibrand made that comment. This comes as no surprise, and it should not come as any surprise. That is the business of the fund managers and the accountants.

I am concerned about the impact the additional impost may have on national savings. I am equally concerned that the tax could adversely affect people not originally intended to be caught in its web. It is questionable whether this proposed impost passes the three criteria of a good tax, that is, a tax delivering equity, efficiency and simplicity.

          Australians are not good savers, and many tax experts fear that the additional tax on superannuation will further erode our alarmingly low level of national savings. Home ownership is still the preferred savings option of most Australians, and experts agree that superannuation will not be used more than necessary unless people are confident that governments will keep their fingers out of a very tempting cookie jar. It is likely that many Australians will be swayed to divert part of their moneys into higher risk investments as a result of this impost. The introduction of the surcharge will almost certainly see a movement of moneys away from super funds and into equities and negative gearing—this at a time when they should be encouraged to provide for themselves in their twilight years.

Mr David Brown, the superannuation spokesman for the Institute of Chartered Accountants, ICA, signalled that as many as 60,000 people would be advised to consider shares, equities or negatively geared property as an alternative to superannuation.

          As I suggested earlier, the new impost fails all three tests of a `good', or at least a palatable, tax. Some may argue in favour of the additional tax on the grounds of equity, claiming that those who will be hit by the tax are those who can afford to pay it. This was the argument presented by the then Assistant Treasurer, Senator Short, in an article in the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Australian Financial Review
          </emphasis>
          on 25 September 1996. He said then that in introducing the surcharge the government was acknowledging that concessional superannuation arrangements benefited higher income earners to a much great extent than lower income earners. However, the Taxation Institute of Australia, the TIA, makes the point in its submission on the super tax that the cost of collecting the impost from high income earners will be spread across all members of funds. Fund members could therefore be forgiven for feeling duped by the government, given the former Assistant Treasurer's commitment in October last year that with the introduction of the impost `there will be certainly no imposition on fund contributors'.

          One tax expert likened this tax slug to the introduction of the fringe benefits tax in 1986 by the then Labor government. While the FBT was sold to the Australian people as a cost to employers, it is in reality a cost on employees. In this case, the cost of the new super tax will almost certainly impact on pretty well all fund members even though it is aimed at fund managers. While the proposed tax may only apply to those with an income above prescribed levels, the cost of its collection will be borne in part by those members of a fund who are not paying and who may never be likely to pay the surcharge. There is also the potential for serious inequities between protected and private super funds under the current legislation. To date, no&amp;hyphen;one on the government benches has explained how the government proposes to levy the super charge against a constitutionally protected fund. As the law currently stands it cannot.

It has been estimated that there are billions of dollars swanning around unaccounted for in the slush funds of these superannuation funds. No one is making a claim on them. What happens to those funds and the interest on them? What are these fund managers doing? It is almost a genuine requirement that we say, `Collect tax file numbers. It is better for you if you collect everyone's tax file number because, the next time that tax file number comes through, that person can be found, and you will not have lost 20 per cent of your members.'

          There is also a terrific incentive now for people to give their tax file numbers to superannuation funds. If they do not, and they earn over $85,000, their employer contributions are going to be taxed at 15 per cent. They will be anyway, but if they earn less than that and do not give their tax file number over, they are going to be taxed at that rate. So there is a terrific incentive there for people who are forward thinking.

          —Last week the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) claimed credit for improvements under his government in the conduct of question time. He claimed, with complete justification, that question time was no longer the farce that it undoubtedly became under his predecessor. Although debatable, the Prime Minister also seemed to imply that what now prevails in this place is the epitome of parliamentary reform. In returning to a time honoured approach to question time prior to the aberration created by Mr Keating, I put it to the House that it hardly constitutes reform.

The wide&amp;hyphen;ranging changes promised to achieve that end have yet to materialise. In some ways, the influence of this House on the executive has diminished. Ministers responsible for legislation rarely attend second reading debates.

          —Withstanding the test of time, going back to the early 1980s, Rutherford residents within my electorate of Paterson may soon see green rather than amber or red over the need for safer local roads. Last month, I publicly announced my commitment to seek funding from the federal Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr John Sharp, to deliver on the long&amp;hyphen;mooted requests by local Rutherford residents for urgent attention to be given to the intersection at Arthur Street and the New England Highway, and calling for the construction of pedestrian traffic lights. A similar traffic hazard also confronts residents and motorists at nearby Alexandra Street.

          These intersections and general traffic conditions around the Rutherford area pose a stark reminder that words and more words, traffic study upon traffic study, and further community consultation can drag on for years and years, without a hole being dug or a RTA surveyor in sight.

         <para first-indent="16">
          This reminder is etched in the memories of both long&amp;hyphen;term Rutherford residents and local business people within the burgeoning Rutherford shopping precinct. The commitment and drive of Mr and Mrs Lloyd Gregory has been something to behold. They have lobbied up hill and down dale for a better and safer deal for local pedestrians and motorists for many years now. I hope to make their efforts seem worth while in the months ahead.

          To my way of thinking, Rutherford shopping centre now has the unfair distinction of being one of the largest shopping areas of its kind not to have a working set of traffic signals to help regulate traffic and better pedestrian access to shoppers. That has got to change. The situation is even more disturbing when the very popular Maitland City Bowling Club, and parents and young children and teenagers utilising the nearby neighbourhood centre and child&amp;hyphen;care centre in Arthur Street, as well as Rutherford High School, are putting more and more pressure on the intersection.

          In fact, upon the public statement last month over my commitment to concentrate on lobbying for federal funding, this pressing road issue has again been raised to the prominence it has long deserved.

          The federal government is now awaiting the outcome of a joint Maitland City Council and state RTA study of traffic management needs of the New England Highway at Rutherford for consideration of whether additional highway upgrading could occur. Stage 1 of the traffic management plan for the New England Highway between Regent Street and Dunkley Street has been completed, but more work was considered necessary on traffic solutions for the stretch between Dunkley Street and Wollombi Road, including pedestrian lights at Arthur Street.

          My fight for safer traffic conditions along the New England Highway, be it for Rutherford, Metford or East Maitland residents, will continue. My full support for a major upgrade of the Arthur Street intersection at Rutherford is part and parcel of that. A shopping precinct of this size, which underwent further expansion in 1995, needs a set of traffic signals to regulate pedestrian and vehicle traffic. That is an issue which my transport minister will be made well aware of.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I believe there is real scope for work to take place to install a set of traffic lights, and I will be urging the minister to examine council's position and the state RTA's position on the matter. Unlike the years and years that have passed by without the former federal government or the former Labor representatives representing Rutherford residents addressing the issue or coming to any solution, I am downright determined to do the opposite and actually deliver. I have taken the case for Rutherford residents right up to the minister, and I have an inkling that he is listening to their concerns.

         What sort of government is so mean spirited and absurd that they cannot write back in proper terms to Mr Hammond giving him a sensible response. Instead of having Costello-omics, we have got chaos theory in the economics of government policy, we have the domino theory—that one person's small taxation concession on building materials will send the country broke—we have Mr Hammond sneezing and the nation catching colds and we have him being told that if he builds his house one day the IMF and the World Bank will knock on his door the next and say that he has sent the country broke.

         This is a government that is mean spirited across the board. It cannot even come up with legitimate, sound reasons to justify that set of attitudes. It has to go into the absurd. If this is the best that the Assistant Treasurer and his office can do, then they will be headed the way of Senator Short not too long from now and off overseas where they belong.

I want to raise once again an issue not only as the member for Groom but also as the patron of a local community support group for those affected by myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome, a potentially disabling and chronic condition affecting the immune and central nervous systems. There is no known single cause, although for many it may be a viral trigger. Some patients may have a sudden onset whilst for others it may be a slow and gradual process with no easily identifiable trigger. It can vary greatly in severity and duration. There is no specific diagnostic test. It is a complex illness and the list of symptoms can be extensive and profound in the more severe cases.

          —I rise tonight in the adjournment debate to speak about the reconciliation process leading up to the Australian Reconciliation Convention, which is to be held from 26 to 28 May 1997 at the World Congress Centre in Melbourne. It is significant that this is being held some 30 years after the referendum which actually made our indigenous people proper and full citizens of this country and which addressed the outrageous racist history of this nation, which some would like to paper over.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I would like to commend the reconciliation process tonight to all parliamentarians and, indeed, to all Australians because it is an issue which is important for all of us as a nation. It has never been more important, particularly given the climate of intolerance which has been fostered since 2 March 1996. In particular, we all sit in this chamber with the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), who has stated that she would not represent Aboriginal Australians. That is an outrageous comment and one which I do not think would have been tolerated had she mentioned any other group other than our most oppressed group, indigenous people.

         The chairperson of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, Patrick Dodson, has stated that `to effect deep and lasting change in this country, reconciliation has to be a people's movement'. To this end, Australians for Reconciliation have worked hard all around

          the country with community groups and individuals at the local level. Their activities have been very much in the social justice tradition of thinking globally but acting locally. Reconciliation is a global issue. Its anti-racism message is one that must be taken seriously if we are to combat the narrow, red-necked views of the outspoken minority because it is still the case that indigenous Australians suffer from a great level of discrimination.

         I am pleased that the Labor Party has put as our representative on the council the member for Banks (Mr Melham), the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs. I think that it is unfortunate that the government does not have the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) on the council. The representative of the government, the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), is no doubt someone who is committed to the improvement of the lot of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. It is no reflection on him whatsoever, as I am sure there are many on the other side of the House who are committed to the reconciliation process and I congratulate them for that. But, nonetheless, it sends a very bad message that the minister is not represented on the council.

         Also, when I heard the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on radio this morning, it struck me once again that he is a very good performer on radio and knows how to address his audience, but there were two sorts of addresses to the audience. When he spoke about native title, he said, `I want to address a message directly to the farmers, and I say to you that I will represent your interests.' He spoke to them directly, but when he spoke about indigenous people, it was indirect. He was not speaking to them. There was no, `And I say to Aboriginal Australians, I actually think that I am going to uphold your rights as well.' The fact that you have a campaign from some people in this parliament to extinguish native title is an outrageous attack on all of us, and I wish those in the government who have a more progressive and enlightened view on these issues the best of luck in combating it.

          In terms of the racism issue, as well tonight I wish to draw people's attention towards an ongoing community campaign against racism against indigenous Australians and, indeed, against racism wherever it exists. On 12 April there will be yet another rally in Sydney in Hyde Park against racism. It is being organised by community groups, by churches, by people who are concerned about the increasing level of intolerance. That, as part of the process of the lead-up to the reconciliation convention in May, is something that all of us should participate in in our local communities and all of us should encourage.

Yes, it was a good story, because with Anna's parents and friends, the Telegraph tried to educate people on the dangers of MDMA.

          —I am very pleased to have the opportunity of joining in the debate on the Trade Practices Amendment (Industry Access Codes) Bill 1997. This bill amends the access regime for the so&amp;hyphen;called essential facilities. The amendments will seek to streamline the process for access undertaken by service providers, and are specifically directed towards the electricity industry. That is a point that was entirely missed by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) when he spoke yesterday.

         This bill will promote competition in infrastructure sectors by providing very substantial benefits to consumers, businesses and the overall economy. This bill is about responsible micro&amp;hyphen;economic reform. It is about making the Australian economy more efficient and more effective, so that it delivers even greater benefits to the Australian community.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill improves on the access provisions contained in the Competition Policy Reform Act of 1995, and demonstrates our ongoing commitment to the national competition policy and our ongoing commitment, without apology, to micro&amp;hyphen;economic reform. The bill underlines our determination to continue to cut unnecessary red tape and administrative duplication through simplifying and streamlining the procedures for improving access arrangements to essential infrastructure services in network industries.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Honourable members will be well aware of the election commitment given by this government to cut red tape with respect to small business.

         This bill will help establish a national, competitive electricity market. That is very important.

         The honourable member for Werriwa referred to some last gasp amendments moved by the Labor Party in the Senate. The simple fact of the matter is that those amendments were to require petrol companies to allow access to terminals, but it is fairly clear that the amendments
         <break page="2648" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          moved in the Senate and foreshadowed by the honourable member for Werriwa are nothing to do with this particular bill.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill, as I said a moment ago, is specifically directed towards the electricity industry. This government has a determination to improve competition in the petrol industry, and I will point out what the government proposes in relation to the petrol industry. Perhaps the honourable member for Werriwa and his colleagues missed the joint media release issued by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) on 11 December last year when the new approach by this government to the petrol industry was outlined.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The amendments which the Labor Party will seek to move to this bill, the amendments which they sought to move in the other place, are amendments which are nothing to do with this particular bill. It is simply using this forum, using the parliament, as an opportunity for point scoring. It is a cynical attempt to criticise this government's approach to petroleum industry reforms.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         After 13 years of Labor government, the Labor Party has nothing much to be proud of in this area. The Labor Party did nothing much in relation to the petroleum industry or, for that matter, the electricity industry. So it really was a case of crying crocodile tears for the honourable member for Werriwa to come into the Main Committee yesterday and tell us that he is going to move amendments to this bill—amendments which are nothing to do with this bill at all. It is obvious that the 13 years of Labor neglect with respect to the petroleum industry have adversely impacted on the situation in rural and regional Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As a very effective regional and rural member yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be well aware of the need for the government's policies and changes with respect to the petroleum industry to be implemented as soon as possible. But we find that it is very much as though the Labor Party these days has had a latter&amp;hyphen;day conversion on the road to Damascus, and that its members have gone from being tariff slashers in the former government to now being, in this parliament, proponents of tariff maintenance. The Labor Party has no policy consistency, I suppose one could say.

          —Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you very much for highlighting the point that I have been making. The only reason I was referring to the petroleum industry was that just about the whole of the speech of the honourable member for Werriwa referred to proposed amendments which he will be moving to the bill, in effect to extend the terms of the bill beyond the electricity industry and, indeed, to the petroleum industry. So I am sure that in those circumstances I am in order in referring to the speech by the honourable member for Werriwa, because he is saying that he is going to be moving petroleum industry amendments to the bill currently before the committee.

          —They were, I understand, moved as last&amp;hyphen;gasp amendments in the Senate. But certainly in this place, Mr Deputy Speaker, you are entirely right. They have not yet been moved, but the honourable member for Werriwa has foreshadowed his intention to do so. In doing so, though, he is suggesting that the Howard government is not interested in petroleum industry reform. He is suggesting that the Howard government is somehow welshing on its responsibility to bring about equity in the petroleum industry. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. I mentioned a few minutes ago the joint media release issued by the Treasurer and by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism on 11 December 1996, when it was pointed out that the government would:
         </para>
        </talk.start>

         . . . implement new measures in 1997 to promote increased competition and benefits to consumers in the petrol industry.

         The joint statement went on:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In responding to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Petroleum Products Declaration report, the Government announced that petroleum products would be removed from prices surveillance in 1997, once the Treasurer is satisfied of pro&amp;hyphen;competitive developments in the market. One of the measures required to put this in place will be commitments from the oil majors to allow open terminal access and price transparency for the purchase of petrol by distributors and retailers.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         The amendments which are going to be moved by the honourable member for Werriwa in fact refer to access to petroleum terminals. So I suggest that the honourable member for Werriwa should go off and have a cold shower. He should realise that the government has reform of the petrol industry firmly in its sights. We have a statement made by two of our most senior ministers confirming that we are committed to delivering major reforms in the petroleum sector, consistent with our election commitment. The ministers have also pointed out that progress has been made towards this end, and that the government moves to implement deregulation `will promote greater competition which will lower prices over time.' So, after 13 years of inactivity, we find that, belatedly, the Labor Party has moved amendments in the Senate and will, in this place, move amendments to this bill, amendments which are entirely irrelevant, amendments which miss the point.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill is about improving access to essential facilities such as electricity grids. It is a reaffirmation of our determination to have responsible micro&amp;hyphen;economic reform in Australia. The bill will promote competition and we make no apology for that. It is interesting that the Labor Party is not actually opposing this bill but what it intends to do is to seek to expand the ambit of the bill beyond the electricity industry, to which it is specifically addressed, so that the petroleum industry can be included.

          It would be more orderly for the Labor Party to wait for the reforms of the government to be implemented. The government's proposed reforms to the petroleum industry have received widespread support in the Australian community and I think it will be much better for the Labor Party to defer its comments on the petroleum industry until such time as the government continues to proceed with its reforms concerning that industry. I commend the bill to the committee.

          —The Trade Practices Amendment (Industry Access Codes) Bill 1997 is designed to streamline the formal procedures for granting access to third parties to infrastructure facilities and networks of national significance by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The bill proposes to amend the Trade Practices Act 1974 to incorporate a general industry access code approval process as a basis for access undertakings in network industries.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Under the current legislation, the ACCC has to conduct both a public consultation process for the industry code and separate public consultation for each access undertaking made by a service provider. It is considered that that is an unnecessary duplication of effort for the ACCC and for relevant stakeholders and could lead to difficulties for the ACCC in assessing whether separate access undertakings will achieve single coherent industry wide access arrangements.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This legislation incorporates legislation which was considered by Labor in government and I think accepted by Labor in government but was not announced. The proposals improve the efficiency of the access regime approval process, we believe, without diminishing consumer or service provider protection. On that basis, it is supported by the opposition. It ought to be able to simplify and streamline the procedures for approving access arrangements to infrastructure services in network industries and build on the access regime established by the former government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Under these arrangements, third parties can seek access to services provided by essential infrastructure facilities of national significance. In network industries, such as electricity, the emerging pattern is for an industry code to be developed governing access arrangements which form the basis of undertakings to the ACCC by individual service providers.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This morning, I want to call for this industry access code to go further and cover the petroleum industry. The reason I do so is that the petroleum and electricity industries in Australia have been remarkably similar in their structure and performance—that is, an homogenous product within a vertically integrated industry with natural oligopoly features at the point of production. Their only substantial difference has been that we had public ownership of electricity and private ownership of petroleum products.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         At a time when, under the banner of Hilmer and competition policy, state governments are vertically separating their electricity operations—generation, distribution and retail—why should petrol be any different? At a time when houses with solar energy units can join the national electricity grid, why should service stations not be able to buy their product from the most competitive source? Why should the Hilmer principles governing vertical industry separation and open access regimes not be applied to Australia's petroleum industry?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         My colleague the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has set out how this could happen. He said that a starting point would be to declare petrol refineries and terminals as an essential facility under the access regime. The terms and conditions of access would then be administered by the ACCC. The parliament has delegated authority for these declarations to
         <break page="2651" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          the relevant minister, now the Treasurer (Mr Costello), following a process of third party applications and National Competition Council assessment.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the case of petrol, it would not be inappropriate for the parliament to make its own declaration, just as in the 1995 Competition Policy Reform Act it determined to exempt coal rail transport for a period of five years. Declaration under the access regime would represent the first and most significant step towards the vertical separation of Australia's petroleum industry. It should ensure open access to terminals on reasonable terms and conditions. Other aspects of vertical separation should logically follow, based on the competition principle that an access regime should involve more than a company simply providing downstream access to one of its own subsidiaries.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Importantly, I would argue that petrol meets the three criteria set out for declaration in the ACCC's access regime guidelines in November 1995. They are:

         Each of the oil majors argues that the petrol industry in Australia is overcapitalised at both the wholesale and retail level. In its submission to the ACCC, for instance, Ampol argued that the industry should down&amp;hyphen;scale. It talked about 30 per cent fewer service stations, no more than 300 depots nationally, no more than three or four refineries, greater use of pipelines to distribute petrol between capital cities and major centres, and one shared seaboard terminal in each out port. If you look at that situation, it would seem to me that this strengthens the case for it being covered by the kind of industry access code to which we are referring this morning.

         I want to point out to the parliament that the Shell National Action Group has expressed concern about the direction in which petroleum retailing is going. It has written to Professor Fels as Chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and referred to a transcript of a radio interview between Professor Fels and Neil Robins on 24 February when Professor Fels was asked whether he thought that elimination of what are referred to as the `Sites Act' and the `Franchise Act' would strengthen the oil companies' position to control retail and wholesale prices. In the transcript, Professor Fels said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         We have doubts whether the two bits of legislation you're talking about—the sites act and the franchise act—are really doing that much good at the moment.

        <para font-size="-=2">
         We think this is a bit of regulation that hasn't really served a useful purpose. That doesn't mean we aren't concerned about Shell's move to have multi&amp;hyphen;site franchising, but I do think it's unlikely that oil companies would try to take over and run every service station in town if the sites act left.

          The letter then goes on to say:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          The true fix for this industry is not in repealing those Acts but in allowing all franchisees to play on a level playing field. If we could all have the ability to purchase fuel under the same conditions as Woolworths, that is up to 9 cents per litre cheaper than they are forced to purchase from our franchisors locked high prices. . .
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          Indeed, it is my concern that if the view taken by Professor Fels were to be followed then in many towns and cities there would be a Coles at one end, a Woolworths at the other and nothing in between—no newsagent, no service stations, no local baker, no pharmacist, no banks, no post office, and no motor mechanic. There would be just a Coles at one end and a Woolworths at the other.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We have a situation where downstream access is essential to fair competition in this area. We have Woolworths presently establishing itself as another vertically integrated major with access to cheap wholesale petrol and it is establishing horizontal alliances with other majors. Unless branded and franchised stations can also access cheaper petrol then they face closure at the hands of Woolworths. By making competitive petrol access a legal right, small petrol retailers would not need the resources enjoyed by Woolworths, rather, existing service stations in country towns, for example, would have the same terminal access rights as any new competitor.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This is not just an issue for consumers, the other part of this issue is the treatment of franchisees. I have had quite a lot of correspondence about Shell's treatment of franchisees. For example, one letter I had referred to Shell's `corporate thuggery towards its single site franchisees'. Another letter pointed out that under the multi&amp;hyphen;site franchise system, any individual dealer who wanted to become part of this system with, for example, `between 15 and 35 sites would need capital of between $450,000 to $1,050,000 just to pay for each site's franchise fee'.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          If you look at store stock levels—a realistic average of, say, $35,000 per site—then they would need another half a million dollars for 15 sites and a further million dollars for 35 sites. Fuel stock would be another $900,000 to $2 million. So for a 15&amp;hyphen;site franchise, a person in that situation would need to raise over $1.8 million, and for 35 sites the figure explodes to over $4 million.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          So, in those circumstances, it seems impossible to imagine that a multi&amp;hyphen;site operator could function without Shell's active participation through a bank guarantee, and the only conclusion that the authors of this letter draw is that there is a strong relationship between the multi&amp;hyphen;site franchisees and Shell and that, furthermore, 80 per cent of Shell's revenue and sales is controlled by a small number of dealers.

          I have had information supplied to me by Charles Power of Holding Redlich concerning the operation of the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act which does provide certain basic protection of tenure for lessee service station operators and requires disclosure of relevant information by oil companies to prospective franchisees. But it does not apply to commission agents or distributors, nor to resellers who occupy their own premises, and oil companies typically require service station dealers to operate as commission agents in respect of sale of fuel and, thereby, put such franchisees outside the protections of the Petroleum Retail
          <break page="2654" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           Marketing Franchise Act. So, the end result of this is that franchisees are greatly disadvantaged.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          For example, here is a case that was brought to my attention. Back in 1980, Mario and Robyn Suprano accepted Shell's offer to operate Shell Wallsend in the Newcastle area as a self&amp;hyphen;serve commission agency in return for which Shell would upgrade the site. In mid&amp;hyphen;1989, the Supranos who were dissatisfied with waiting for Shell to upgrade the site, said that unless Shell gave assurances that Shell Wallsend would be refurbished in the near future, they would pull out of the site.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In October 1989, Shell showed them plans to refurbish the site. They were to become Shell Force franchisees and were promised 10&amp;hyphen;year tenure in two five&amp;hyphen;year terms. So, they stayed there. But Shell departed from its representations regarding 10 years tenure some three years into its term of franchise. In September of 1990, four weeks before the re&amp;hyphen;opening of the refurbished Shell Wallsend, the Supranos were told by Shell that they would be commission agents, not dealer franchisees, putting them outside the protection of the franchisees act. They still signed an agreement which gave them 10 years tenure in three terms of three, three and four years. Shell said that they would only refuse to renew the agreement if the Supranos were consistently in breach of it, which they had never been.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In July 1993, Mr Suprano sought to renew the agreement for the second term, more than two months before his first term was up. But Shell did not respond until nearly 18 months later when they informed the Supranos that they were not prepared to renew because they had not provided written notice of their desire for a further term. Absolutely extraordinary! The Supranos ended up being forced to sign, agreeing to a 12&amp;hyphen;month extension of the agreement and only in line with Shell's current policy. That is to say, there was no guaranteed tenure because their livelihood depended entirely on their being allowed to continue to trade at Wallsend. Furthermore, in March of 1993, Shell reduced the commission paid for sales downwards. These commission and royalty payment arrangements are extraordinary. An increase in litres sold, as a result of franchisees' efforts can, in fact, put franchisees in a worse financial position than those achieving lesser sales.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Other franchisees have also experienced similar treatment. Charlie Qasabian and Simon Totonjian have a Shell service station at Doyalson and the Greta Roadhouse on the New England Highway. After getting a letter confirming 10 years at the Greta site, they entered into a $90,000 loan to purchase the business from Shell. They spent $250,000 endeavouring to turn the site into a profitable business, but Shell refused to renew the lease after its expiry on 30 June 1996 and offered them far less than appropriate compensation.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          So what we have are situations highlighting the inequality of bargaining power between service station operators and petrol companies. If there is any dispute the petrol companies simply cut off supply. As a result, there is a need for better legislation to protect both consumers and franchisees. That is why I support the remarks made by the member for Werriwa concerning the need to expand this area of the Trade Practices Act and the operation of industry access codes.

         Most Australians are familiar with the benefits of competition in the sporting field. As Australia is a great sporting nation, it is appropriate that the Australian economy should be based on the principle that all sectors are exposed to the rigours of competing with each other and with the world's best.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The sporting analogy helps us to understand the nature of competition—the way the competition encourages improvement, the way fair competition helps us to understand and respect the verdict of the umpire, and the way competition encourages cooperation between team members. The two concepts are not in conflict, as some people would claim. Nothing could be more removed from the Australian psyche than a desire to escape or avoid healthy competition. The most significant reform for the Australian economy over the past 15 years has been those reforms which injected greater competition.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Two fundamental reforms stand out: the lowering of protection which exposed Australian firms to greater international competition—I note that the member for Werriwa has been supportive of the general move by the former Labor government to a lower protection regime—and the injection of competition into a number of the sectors of the domestic economy.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Examples of this include the ending of the two&amp;hyphen;airline policy—all members would be aware of the improvement under the newer regime—the entrance of competition in the international, STD and mobile phone markets through Optus and Vodafone, the reduction in Australia Post's monopoly position, and state government moves to open up the electricity market to greater competition.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I have had personal exposure to Australia Post's operation, and I say that they have become very competitive, both on an Australian market position and in comparison with other nations. I think that is because they have been open to genuine competition in some sectors of their markets whilst they do maintain a monopoly of the standard letter rate.

         This bill is part of a next step to a policy reform process. The Hilmer competition reforms are also known as the national competition policy and it dates back to the special Premiers conference in 1991. Until then the focus of micro&amp;hyphen;economic reform was on individual industries, for instance, the aviation industry, the automobile industry—which is now a focus
         <break page="2656" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          in the current debate—the textiles, clothing and footwear industry, postal services, which have been the subject of a number of government inquiries, Telecom and higher education.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The national competition policy, flowing from the Hilmer report, is by contrast a national cross&amp;hyphen;industry initiative. Broadly, the policy requires governments to undertake the following initiatives: structural reform of their public monopolies; ensuring competitive neutrality—a level playing field is a term that a lot of people like to use—between the public and private sectors where they compete; conducting a review of all legislation which may limit competition; and ensuring access to essential infrastructure services for third parties. It is this final element which is dealt with by this bill.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Under the Hilmer reforms, governments are required to look at the public businesses which have been traditionally regarded as natural monopolies. These industries, such as rail, electricity, postal and telephone services, have been traditionally regarded as services which only the government can provide. There can only be one rail network, one set of electricity wires and one set of telegraph poles. However, in the last few years we have come to question whether all these services really need to be monopolies and whether government really needs to be the provider.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Under the competition policy, governments are asked to look at the possibility of separating aspects of these businesses which are natural monopolies and those which are potentially competitive. For example, railways have traditionally been regarded as being the domain of governments because of their natural monopoly characteristics. In other words, it is uneconomic to duplicate rail networks, and thus competition between rail tracks would be wasteful and costly. However, rolling stock, passenger and freight services are potentially competitive. Just as private cars, trucks and buses drive on public roads, there is no reason why private operators cannot use public rail tracks and compete vigorously with one another.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         By doing this, the natural monopolies—the roads, rail tracks, telephone wires or electricity poles—stay in government hands, but the private sector is allowed to offer services in the area where competition is possible. The greater the competition, the greater the incentive to raise quality, lower prices and give consumers choice. Competition between the STD telephone companies Telstra and Optus has had this result. Optus makes use of the Telstra network, just as different truck operators make use of the Hume Highway. This is the nature of what is called third&amp;hyphen;party access under the national competition policy. The bill before the House helps to streamline the mechanisms by which access can be negotiated and the terms and conditions of access to essential infrastructure like telephone networks, rail tracks and gas pipelines might be determined.

         It is pleasing to bring to the committee's attention that the electorate of Corangamite has been among the pioneers of private sector access to public rail facilities. In my electorate, West Coast Rail is among the first ever private passenger rail operator in Australia's recent history. The company negotiated access to the track between Melbourne and Warrnambool and runs a private service which was once run by the government owned V&amp;hyphen;Line.

         West Coast Rail now provides the only service from Warrnambool to Geelong, with three trains per day each way, and competes directly with V&amp;hyphen;Line on the Geelong to Melbourne route. We have a situation where this privatised service has integrated into the V&amp;hyphen;Line network throughout Victoria. So on the one hand we see the public monopoly position operating, but with the new West Coast Rail service providing a service efficiently and effectively, and saving the government some $5 million.

Now West Coast Rail has provided the service to the electorates of Corangamite and Warrnambool and provided a new concept of the way in which a private operator, owning its own rolling stock, might operate on the publicly owned track. We also see that TNT and the Specialised Container Transport Company are competing with National Rail on the standard gauge between Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth, which incidentally runs through the electorate of Corangamite.

          foreshadowed the possibility of the stevedoring firm Patrick's also becoming involved in rail freight operations on this route, which I commend as a desirable possibility. The Commonwealth's share of National Rail is set to be privatised, along with the passenger service of Australian National and its freight arms in Tasmania and South Australia. But the standard gauge rail itself will stay in government hands and will be run by Track Australia, a specialist track management agency. This is a clear example of the separation of the functions which is possible, even under the traditional natural monopolies, under the Hilmer competition reforms.

          This bill deals with the rules about determining the terms and conditions of access to essential services, such as, the rail networks, electricity grids and gas pipelines where access is now being seen as an important prerequisite for real competition and, ultimately, lower prices. Under Part 3A of the Trade Practices Act, the relevant minister may declare certain essential infrastructure. This would require the infrastructure to be offered to those third&amp;hyphen;party users, potential competitors, under certain terms and conditions. Alternatively, the owners of this infrastructure, usually the government agencies, may offer access undertaking which would set out the terms and conditions under which it would offer infrastructure access to new players. The undertaking would set out all the terms and conditions that any new player would need to meet to be granted access. This undertaking would be submitted to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The ACCC would advertise the offer, take submissions from interested parties, and undertake public consultations on the process.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Of course, there would be industries where the access undertakings would be best done on a national scale. Instead of negotiating a series of different, independent access undertakings each with its own period of public consultations and submissions, it would be possible to have a national overall industry access code. This bill will facilitate that administrative change. The ACCC will be able to conduct public inquiries and take submissions on a national industry access code without going through the wasteful process of conducting a number of individual inquiries, consultations, and submissions from the public.

          The glaring example of where this approach is required is in the electricity market.

          If there is to be a national electricity market then access to electricity grids in each state should be determined by a national industry access code, not a series of individual access agreements as submitted to the ACCC. The latter would be an excessively cumbersome approach. Thus, this bill will be of vital importance in setting the arrangements for the national

          Once again, Victoria has led the way in this reform by splitting up the old SEC into an electricity grid which remains in public hands. There are six electricity distributors, all now operating as private companies, such as Powercor, United Energy, Solaris, and Citipower. There are also a number of separate and largely privately owned electricity generators, such as Yallourn, Loy Yang A and Loy Yang B, all of which can compete to supply electricity along the government&amp;hyphen;owned grid.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Of course, if the private sector operators are to compete with the public sector on public&amp;hyphen;owned infrastructure, then we need a competitive neutrality. Competitive neutrality really means a level playing field between the public and private sectors. Often, government business enterprises enjoy some unnatural advantages over their private sector competitors. Many have traditionally been exempt from sales tax and other government charges. Others have had the benefit of government guarantees over their borrowings. State and federal governments are now being asked to neutralise these advantages so that public and private sectors can compete on an equal footing. The Victorian government has moved to impose debt guarantee charges on major government enterprises to remove any advantage they may have from the government guarantee over their debts.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Another aspect of the competition policy is the requirement of conducting a legislative review. State and federal governments are supposed to look at any rules and regulations on the statute books which restrict competition. The governments must identify anti&amp;hyphen;competitive laws and determine whether those laws can be justified in the public interest. The public interest should include a broad range of factors, such as, the social welfare, ecologically sustainable development, regional development and occupational health and safety. Thus, even the Hilmer reforms recognise that unfettered competition may not always maximise the broad community welfare in all cases, although there is concern that governments are exempting certain industries from the Hilmer reforms even before they conduct the relevant reviews of the legislation.

          The National Competition Council, set up to advise the government on the progress of the competition policy, has already expressed doubts about decisions made by some governments. It has questioned the New South Wales government's decision to retain the existing arrangements for rice marketing. The honourable member for Werriwa and I would have some concerns about the monopoly position of that particular organisation; I have challenged it in the past. It has also questioned the ACT's shopping hour restrictions. These restrictions are the complete opposite of the Victorian government's decision to allow 24&amp;hyphen;hour trading, thus liberalising the market and removing several anomalies under prior restrictions.

          At the Commonwealth level, there are a number of industries which have also been exempted. The Wheat Board's single desk export monopoly is something that there is a considerable amount of debate on, on our side of politics, but in the broad thrust of discussions I think that, over the next 20 years, that monopoly position will certainly be questioned. The regional monopoly of local newsagents and the restrictions of home delivery of newspapers may be exempted from the scrutiny of the Trade Practices Act. Again, that is another quite interesting argument as to the monopoly of the newsagents that has been maintained after a considerable amount of debate on both sides of the parliament.

           So the government needs to be vigilant about encouraging competition in all aspects. I notice that the honourable member for Werriwa is very keen on encouraging genuine competition between the oil companies and making sure that there is a fair and level playing field between the big majors and another couple of new entrants. I share some of those sentiments with him.

          <para first-indent="16">
           I conclude by referring again to West Coast Rail. That concept of running a privatised rail in Victoria is leading the way and other state governments might follow the example and integrate, in a sensible and practical way, the operation of a private company using rail track—either government owned rolling stock or their own rolling stock—and develop an integrated service within the total passenger service of the states or the Commonwealth. Then, over time, we can move away from this so&amp;hyphen;called natural monopoly of railways which has been the mind&amp;hyphen;set of governments and, I think, of the Australian people since Federation. So I commend West Coast Rail on its very good performance over the last three years in providing a service and, more importantly, providing an idea and a concept that the Commonwealth can follow.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           I recognise the one&amp;hyphen;track initiative of the previous Labor government in standardising the gauge throughout Australia and putting forward the concept that access to the standard gauge would then be available to private sector operators. It was a step in the right direction. I am very confident that the new Howard government will follow on and make more accessible the whole idea of using the national standard gauge, like the national highway system, for access by private operators. In that way, the rail systems in Australia will become more competitive, more efficient and provide better transport for very heavy agricultural goods to the seaports.

          The Tax Law Improvement Bill 1996 reflects the second tranche of the complete rewrite of the income tax legislation embarked upon by Labor through the tax law improvement project in 1994. On Monday, I am pleased to note, the Senate passed the first package of three bills that commence the rewrite. Labor supports this legislation as it is essential that the large and complex income tax legislation laws must be simplified, hopefully to reduce compliance costs for both taxpayers and the tax office, and to take the opportunity to improve certainty in cases where there is currently a great deal of tax law uncertainty.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This whole process is necessary because the old legislation, the 1936 parent act, has been amended and expanded so often that it has lost an overall coherent structure. Because of the sheer enormity of the task, the rewrite has to occur in tranches. This ongoing rewrite process, piece by piece, provides its own challenges as it is not possible to repeal the entirety of the 1936 act and replace it in total. Labor does not criticise this process. Naturally enough, we understand it is the only realistic option.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          However, this process has produced some disquiet in some sections of the industry. There is a variety of opinions. Some believe that there should be absolutely no policy changes at all in the rewrite. For example, Price Waterhouse, as reported in the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Financial Review
          </emphasis>
          in October last year, argues that the resources of the tax law improvement program should be redirected towards a tax reform task force—that is, change policy first and then rewrite the legislation.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Clearly, Labor favours the current process which we instigated when in government. The Assistant Treasurer has the authority to make some small limited changes, especially to clarify the tax laws. However, this process should not be used to significantly alter policy more or less through the backdoor. Labor initially understood that the government agreed with this policy neutral project. However, this legislation, as introduced to the parliament, goes beyond a simple and neutral rewrite role.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This particular tranche is being rewritten to address matters concerning assessable and exempt income, deductions, trading stock, depreciation and gifts. The more specialised areas include entertainment expenses and primary production. As with earlier bills, this bill was sent to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts for consideration. The committee's report on the legislation, No. 348, was tabled in the House on 6 March. I am pleased to see in the chamber the chair of that committee, Mr Somlyay. I pay tribute to the work of his committee in the rewrite project because, in the parliamentary scrutiny, the rewrite brings forth a whole range of very complex and detailed matters in our taxation laws. To have a joint committee that so capably gets across all the detail and complexity, and provides due parliamentary scrutiny to the project, is absolutely critical.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          From time to time, there is too little public appreciation of the active role of committees such as the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in that parliamentary scrutiny. It is a very good thing that we have a committee that is well&amp;hyphen;led, well-resourced, and very active in making sure that the work of the tax officials in the rewrite project, and the involvement of the private sector, receives due parliamentary scrutiny. I pay tribute to the work and the report of the joint committee in that regard.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I also endorse the way in which the committee appreciates that the best type of rewrite is a policy neutral rewrite. I note its concerns about the significant policy changes proposed within the bill. In particular, a concern arises about the proposed alteration of the depreciation provisions concerning hire purchase transactions, and the proposed alterations to the trading
          <break page="2661" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           stock provisions where assets change their character from normal business assets into trading stock, and vice versa.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There is also a large number of minor technical amendments to ensure that the bill accurately reflects the existing law. Accordingly, the government has circulated numerous amendments; 83 in total. The opposition will not oppose any of these amendments. However, while being supportive of the project, we are concerned about the volume of amendments being presented to the parliament, and I am sure that that concern is supported by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and its chairperson. Perhaps part of the problem relates to the resourcing of the tax law improvement program. A vacancy has existed in one of the two private sector positions within the program since December 1995, 18 months ago—a vacancy for private sector resources to the program—and I note that the joint parliamentary committee has expressed concern about this delay.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The joint committee has also suggested that additional resources be made available for the hiring, on a short&amp;hyphen;term basis, of private sector experts in particular areas to supplement the general program team. Labor supports this recommendation wholeheartedly. I note with concern, however, the cost to the public interest of the inadequate resourcing of a core government function—that of the major revenue authority, the Tax Office—and of private sector resources being harnessed for this particular program. I urge the government to take corrective action as soon as possible.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is an important point that too often in the public commentary, and too often under this government's budget management, it is assumed that every single budget cut and every single reduction in public resourcing is a good thing. But, clearly, the private sector can suffer much greater costs than the small public costs that are being saved. The cost to the private sector—to the accountancy and tax law industries and the small business sector, in particular—of delaying this tax improvement project is immense.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          For the government not to have filled a vacancy for some 18 months in the private sector resources that can be harnessed for the project really is an opportunity cost of folly. It is far better to resource this program fully, get the rewrite happening as fast as possible, have it approved by the parliament under the scrutiny of the joint committee, and allow certainty and simplicity to take hold in the tax law industry around Australia and in the understanding of those laws by private citizens and the private sector, particularly small businesses. The government needs to act on the recommendations of the joint committee to give this rewrite process full and adequate public sector resourcing. Other than making those comments, I will say that Labor will be supporting this bill and the circulated amendments, and we look forward to the further success of the rewrite program.

I have spoken to accountants about the income tax act, and they all say the same thing: it has become so heavy to lift that some of the staff are looking at putting in claims for back problems.

We chose not to put in my tax return and to say that we have taken the deductions. If the ATO disagrees, they should advise us accordingly. We have decided that the best thing we can do is to ask for a clarification of the matters and then we will put in an amended return. It has now been close enough to six months and we still have not had a response from the Australian Taxation Office. I can understand the difficulty of the complexity in which they find themselves, trying to interpret something that should have been cleared up a long time ago. I fully support the bill.

          —There is nothing new about calls for a substantial overhaul of our surfeit of tax legislation. What is different is that this message is now being driven, not only by industry and employer groups which have long championed tax reform, but also by social welfare groups, including the Australian Council of Social Service.

         The government finds itself in a position a little like Aladdin, inasmuch as the tax reform genie has been released from the bottle and simply will not go away. While the government has chosen to continue to grant two wishes, that is the rewriting and renumbering of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the clarification of ambiguities, it has, as its predecessor in government did, baulked at the third and unarguably most critical wish, and that is an overhaul of our byzantine tax policy. We are left, Mr Deputy Speaker, to tiptoe through the TLIPs, without even a suggestion of falsetto help from Tiny Tim.

         My support for the efforts being made by the tax law improvement project team is qualified.

         The progress to date by the project team is not really significant. It is a start, but nothing more. There should be absolutely no easing of pressure on this parliament to implement substantive changes to tax legislation. It is very clear that this country needs a bipartisan commitment to total tax reform if it is to remain competitive in an increasingly globalised economy. Moreover, the commitment must be to rapid but thoughtful change.

         If the current rate of progress by the tax law improvement project is anything to go by, it will be something like 25 to 30 years before the rewrite is complete, given that there is no major rewrite or change to policy in the meantime. That is plainly unacceptable.

         One of the criticisms being levelled against the current rewrite of corporations legislation is the length of time involved. Mr Richard Humphry, Managing Director of the Stock Exchange, recently commented that the simplification of the existing laws was not solving the problem because the corporations legislation needed to be rewritten from scratch. He suggested that `Corporations Law would not stand up to any form of competitive analysis against international law.'

         An improved structure, simpler language and a better numbering system are certainly a step in the right direction in terms of tax reform. But this is at best a partial solution.

         Soon after the election of the coalition government, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) went on record as saying that those on the right side of the House recognised that small business was the engine room of the Australian economy. He said that the coalition would make things `a darn sight better' for small business than did his Labor Party predecessor. The centrepiece of this commitment was the establishment of the small business deregulation task force. In December last, the task force released 62 recommendations on how the government should reduce the compliance burden on the small business sector. Many of these proposals were reliant on an overhaul of the fringe benefits and wholesale sales tax systems.

         It is worth noting that the TLIP senior management team includes two positions for private sector practitioners. One of these positions has been vacant for approximately 15 months. The whole point of having these two positions is to ensure that TLIP considers as wide a range of perspectives as possible when considering the simplification of our tax legislation. The positions exist to ensure that the business community has an opportunity to contribute to this essential process. The JCPA report recommended that the government fill this position `as a matter of urgency.' I also understand that the TLIP team has written to the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) requesting that this second private sector position be filled immediately. To date the government seems to have ignored that request. So much for the coalition's commitment to the private sector; so much for the government's promise to consult widely in an effort to stay in touch with industry's needs.

Tax experts have variously dubbed the income tax act as a super nova—a star bloated and about to implode—or as a gothic mansion to which new additions are constantly made without consideration as to whether the foundations can support them.

          —In rising to speak on the Tax Law Improvement Project Bill, I say that there is a fairly hackneyed phrase that there is nothing more certain in life than death and taxes. What should be tacked onto that phrase is that nothing has been more certain in recent years than continuous additions to the Income Tax Assessment Act. The phrases that have been used expansively and colourfully over a number of years are certainly very appropriate. I am indebted to the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) for some remarks that he has made. In general, I agree with what he says. He did speak about the need for bipartisan support for tax reform. I endorse that sentiment wholeheartedly. Indeed,

         But always lurking in any initiative of that kind are the opportunistic in the community, particularly on the other side of politics, but it is not necessarily confined to the other side either if a situation arises. However, in recent times the opportunistic approach has been confined exclusively to the other side. The Leader of the Opposition exemplified that during the Western Australian election campaign when he suggested, in a somewhat contorted fashion, that the Western Australian government was trying to implement some sort of GST. Yet again, the initiatives that need to be taken are constantly being mired by opportunistic politicians, particularly in the opposition.

         The comments by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) about treating the symptoms rather than effecting a cure are very appropriate. The failure of fundamental reform has spawned the burgeoning act. The burgeoning act did not come about because of technical problems; it came about because of the underlying problems. In fact, the feet on the act have never really been properly addressed. It is the top-heavy nature of the act that is constantly being played with: it is rickety, it is rumbling and it is falling. Consequently, although this piece of legislation does go some way in the right direction to try and redress some of the problems, the underlying problems are the ones that ultimately must be addressed because they form the base upon which the act is erected.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The comments by the honourable member for Curtin are relevant to consider in relation to the need for professional assistance and I will do that shortly. Not only is there the need for professional accountancy assistance to about 70 per cent of the population but frequently taxpayers have to seek counsel's advice, in addition to their accountant's advice, because the accountants cannot provide the sort of advice necessary in some areas because of the complexity of the act. So that tacks on an additional cost.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The act, as has been said in the parliamentary secretary's second reading speech, is on the verge of collapsing under the weight of constant piecemeal amendment. It is true that the rewrite will make the act more user&amp;hyphen;friendly, more understandable, hopefully shorter, clearer and less burdensome. The amendments include the rewrite of assessable and exempt income, deductions, trading stock, depreciation and gifts. Other rules included in the bill are entertainment expenses, primary production deductions, the recoupment of deductible expenses and the sale of leased cars.

        <para first-indent="16">
         There are about 30 minor policy changes.

The proposed change in the use of trading stock taken for personal use will result in a gain to the revenue of about $30 million in 1998&amp;hyphen;99 and $25 million in each subsequent year.

         When I was studying taxation law in 1980 I can remember carrying around a CCH version of the act but I needed a reasonably strong wrist to do so, and the paper was not much thicker than rice paper at that time. Having observed a very strong table on which my accountant's Income Tax Assessment Act sits, and being reminded that he needs to take weight lifting
         <break page="2668" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          lessons to carry it around, one can see and feel the enormity of the problem. I would hate to be a law student trying to wield that act between lecture theatres. I am told by a law student that in 1994 at the QUT the sections of the act that the students used—it was just too heavy to carry around—were about the same size of the act that I was using. That was not the complete act—the relevant sections that they were focusing on in their studies were a microcosm of the act itself. If only those sections were relevant to a law course, it makes me ask the question as to what use the other sections were to the public, but that is probably another manifestation of the great debate about the Income Tax Assessment Act.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It is interesting that the complexity of the act is causing more and more members of the public with taxation problems which, on the face of it, are relatively easy, to resort to the assistance of an accountant. Yet again you can see an anachronism in that sort of approach. People have to go to their accountant, they are in effect taxed again—they have to pay a fee to do that, so that is a form of tax out of their money—and then they get a deduction for doing so. So the revenue is depleted by that very complexity. Then you see the seeds of the problem.

         Why are we not looking at a situation where the tax rate is dropped and there are no deductions? Would that not make it easier for everybody? We would probably drop half the act in the process and we would drop the necessity for all of this resort to advice and professional assistance. Maybe it is too simple, but it seems an obvious way of addressing the problem: take out the deductions and drop the tax. In the process, we would eliminate much heartache and anguish, the problems that go with that, the resentment that is felt by the community and the resorting to tax avoidance.

         Sure, we are always going to have people who will try to avoid tax. But when you are looking at compliance costs, when you are looking at the keeping of records and so forth, you realise that all of that impacts on the Australian community. All of that hurts small business. All of that, in my view, is grinding our economy in a negative direction when we should be looking at turning it in a positive direction. We need to do that by the simplification of our tax laws. I say again that this is a step in the right direction but we certainly need to go much further.

          —The Tax Law Improvement Bill 1996 is one of the bread&amp;hyphen;and&amp;hyphen;butter, non&amp;hyphen;controversial, machinery of government type bills, which this parliament is properly occupied with. I note that the first instalment, the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996, was passed through the Senate earlier in the week without opposition. I rise to support the bill. It is a commonsense reform. It reflects government's continuing obligation to make its legislation easier to understand, and easier to enforce and comply with.
         </para>

        <para first-indent="16">
         It is the result, in part, of a response from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts led by my colleague, the member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay). He has got that particular cast of mind which is rich in commonsense and practical insight. Pretty much whatever goes through his jurisdiction or purview, such as the recent amendments to the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General Bill, reflects his capacity to recognise the anomaly and introduce commonsense where previously it had not existed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The practical amendments to this bill, we should acknowledge, did not originate on this side of the House but originated under the previous government in its tax law improvement project in July 1994, with the goals of restructuring, re&amp;hyphen;numbering and rewriting in plain language the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. As previous speakers have mentioned, it is a herculean task. Before we came to government, that particular act expanded in size in those 13 years from 1,328 pages, which we thought was already a pretty enormous act, to 3,792 pages. The word around town is that tax accountants now measure the act not by the page numbers but by the kilogram.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         All of us today have got up and basically applauded the work of the bill in relation to assessable and exempt income, deductions, trading stock, depreciation and gifts. It is a helpful change. It communicates to small business and others that the government is working to reduce the compliance burden which they face.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) raised the question of the number of amendments being proposed. The advice to me from the minister is that the large number of amendments proposed reflects the procedural requirement for each textual change to be dealt with separately. For example, the minister says that 23 amendments are needed to implement the single JCPA recommendation to omit the provisions allowing hire purchasers to depreciate plant.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The fact that 23 amendments are required to introduce one change reflects the deeper underlying issue that we have touched on this morning. The member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) appealed for the terms of reference for this exercise to be extended into the realms of substantive policy. We accept that, to date, it has been essentially policy neutral and essentially revenue neutral. The member called upon the parliament and the government to expand the terms of reference and get into the real areas of difficulty in the tax act, which I think most of us would accept.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The great difficulty we have here is trying to make simple what is an inherently complex set of concepts. It is not surprising that the complexity of the underlying concepts revolves
         <break page="2670" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          around the fact that our system of taxation is weighted so heavily in favour of the taxation of income. And income is a complex beast which is difficult to wrestle to the ground.

         If we look, for example, at the recommendations of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force—they made 60 recommendations which are currently before the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and we expect a response from his office perhaps next week—the first 11 of those 60 were all tax related, in terms of how the government can reduce the impact of compliance on small business. That reflects the sense of urgency which the small business community, in particular, feels about these issues.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         All the studies which have come back from small business say essentially the same thing: they do not resent having to pay tax but they resent the volume of regulation and legislation governing tax. They resent the complexity of the rule structure of tax and the frequency of changes to that rule structure. Those three messages consistently come back from the small business community. It is true that the complexity of the current regime impacts in a kind of discriminating way against small business, because these are the businesses which have not reached that critical mass where they can appoint someone as a full&amp;hyphen;time compliance accountant. Larger businesses have that luxury. All the time spent in complying with the government's tax requirements is time that cannot be spent in marketing, selling product, building relationships, networking, R&amp;D and all of those other productive areas of the economy.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We then get back to this question: should we then be making a much bolder, broader sweeping response to the problem? Let me put it on the record that I, like every other member who has stood, support this bill as far as it goes. I believe that it is an appropriate reference that has been undertaken by the tax law improvement project, but the bill inevitably raises this broader question of whether we ought to be approaching this in a more robust way.

         There are moments in history when we sense that there was a critical decision that had to be taken by a nation and a community, and the decision taken will have a very long&amp;hyphen;standing impact on the quality of life of a very large number of citizens. As I look back over this century, the Treaty of Versailles at the conclusion of the First World War is one about which I feel a great sense of sadness. I think that there was a situation where we had started the century off on a bad foot, if you like. We had had a civil war in Europe with millions killed, and then the statesmen, the elders of the nations, came together to hammer out the peace.

         It was one of the few occasions in his life when I would agree with John Maynard Keynes. He was arguing for a much more gracious peace, if you like, and for a rebuilding of the German economy. But the leaders of the victorious states did not have that broad&amp;hyphen;mindedness, that grace, that sense of statesmanship and they imposed a peace which most of us in retrospect would say was unjust.

         Their lack of leadership at that moment, in my view, was one of the principal causes of the subsequent conflict in the Second World War. It sowed the seeds of resentment and the rest of this century, in effect, has been very much a result of that. Like the pebble in the pond, the waves have continued to flow out, largely due to the failure of leadership at that moment.

         When I look at our own country's history over the past 50 years or so, I feel a sense of sorrow at the McEwanist high tariff policies in the 1950s and 1960s; at our failure to really latch onto and develop the technology when the CSIRO developed the first computer, and the sense that we drifted along as a primary producer without really value adding or really getting onto the front end of the technology wave.

          —Before the division, I was talking about those moments in history at which we define ourselves. To me, the 1993 election was one of those moments. So often people are cynical about politicians and believe that we are motivated by base motives, that we are unwilling to take the long&amp;hyphen;term view, that we are not concerned about matters of principle. Here we had an Australian politician who said, `I am not cynical about the electorate. I am going to put a very high level of trust and faith in the electorate. I am going to go to the Australian people with this comprehensive package of reform. I am going to give them that package a year out from the election and I am going to let them go over it with a fine toothcomb. I am going to totally expose myself to public scrutiny. I am not going to pull something out of the bag when we get into government; I am going to have faith and confidence in the good judgment and good sense of the Australian people.'

         I get a little bit irritated when I hear all the murmurings and rumblings about introducing a GST and how we have no stomach for it. When we went to the Australian people and offered them that deal, they did not have the stomach for it. I have a certain impatience with all of those accountants and experts and people who are now coming out and calling for this reform. They watched us get mowed down when we came out of the trenches carrying the GST, and they sat silently back in their comfortable bunkers and said, `We will derive the benefits of this reform once it goes through, but we will not share any of the risks.'

         Even in the business community they were coming out and saying, `No, we do not want it. It is too hard and too complex. We do not want to have to collect it.' And then you had Keating—the absolute duplicity of the man—who, having fought tooth and nail in cabinet for this fundamental change and having lost, in a completely cynical electoral exercise turned that election into a referendum on the GST, knowing that in all of Australia's history since Federation we had never passed a referendum except with bipartisan support. Clearly, we are in the same position today. So there was that moment in time when we had this great opportunity as a culture for decision, and we failed.

         A GST is not the be&amp;hyphen;all and end&amp;hyphen;all.

That is what we need as a nation. It has got to be one of our top priorities.

So I am saying to the Australian people: if you want a consumption tax, if you want fundamental reform of tax, I urge you to lobby the Australian Labor Party to a point where we know we can move forward with a bipartisan commitment, in the same way that we have had for this bill, for which I applaud the opposition.

          —I will not take up a lot of the time of the Main Committee on the Tax Law Improvement Bill 1996, but it is important to make a few comments. I certainly concur with a lot of what the previous speaker, the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron), has said. This bill had its genesis way back in 1992&amp;hyphen;93 when the Joint Committee of Public Accounts of the 36th Parliament and, subsequently, the 37th Parliament put together a report on the inquiry that it held. It was report No. 326, called
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           An assessment of tax
          </emphasis>
          . A lot of people will recall some of the public hearings and the evidence that was received by the JCPA in putting that report together.

        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I was fortunate enough to have been on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts at the tail end of that inquiry, in the 37th Parliament, and I also participated in the drafting of the recommendations. Among the recommendations with regard to the legislative framework that came out of that report No. 326, recommendation 22 said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">

         Recommendation 23 was:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">

        <para style="Para">
         It should be noted that there was also a minority report, as part of report 326, and what I feel was a fairly important recommendation came out of the minority report with regard to rulings. That minority report, in recommendation 3, said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         That the relevant Commonwealth Tax Acts be amended to provide that general—

        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         As everybody would know, that recommendation in the minority report was not picked up, but it certainly is an area that way back then was of concern and, from my understanding of the private sector, at this stage is still of major concern. The existence of the ruling system and how it is applied and enforced is one of the areas of concern to the private sector and private practitioners. Obviously, the other area relates to the perception, following report 326, that the rewrite of the tax act would be addressing policy issues as well as the simplification of what is a very, very complicated bill. To a large extent that has not happened.

         The TLIP process started under the former government in the 37th Parliament and it has continued under the current government in the 38th Parliament. It was interesting to note the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), in which he said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The first instalment of the new law, the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996, was passed by the House with bipartisan support and is presently waiting consideration by the Senate. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts reviewed that bill in detail, concluding that the bill was a significant improvement over the current law being widely regarded as far easier to read and understand.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         That is quite correct, but it certainly did not address any issues of policy. I know that this is one issue that has been raised in the debate so far on this bill. In the second reading speech, the parliamentary secretary went on to say:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The rewritten rules include 30 minor policy changes which will make the law simpler, clearer and less burdensome for taxpayers. They will do this by:

        <para style="Para">
         I believe the crux of what the previous speaker was talking about was addressing policy issues in taxation, trying to drag the Income Tax Assessment Act at least into the 1990s and push it forward so that it is a forward looking piece of legislation to take into the next century. Unfortunately, at this stage in this process, that is not entirely happening. In fact, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, in its report 348 on this bill, stated in recommendation 2:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Government should expand the mandate of the Tax Law Improvement Project to allow it to consider a wider range of tax policy simplification issues than the mandate currently allows. Such a mandate should be applied to TLIP for all future tranches of rewritten legislation.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         And that is the most recent report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on the whole TLIP process that has been taking place over the last couple of years. I support the process. I support the bill that is before the House. I believe that we should be going a little further, flexing the margins out a little further and having a look at addressing some of those policy areas.

         <para first-indent="16">
          As an aside to that, quite apart from this process I note that the Australian Tax Office is having a look at some policy changes and flexing the margins in another area, which is also partly covered by this bill. In division 70, I think it is, the bill deals with trading stock and there are a few references in the EM and descriptions of natural increase of livestock as trading stock and how the Australian Tax Office will deal with those.

          Just recently I had the opportunity of spending the day with a number of oyster farmers on the Hawkesbury River, and some of them were from Wallis Lake. The Wallis Lake farmers currently have an additional disadvantage which can be added to those that they are already burdened with emanating from the state government of New South Wales. Anyhow, I spent the day on the Hawkesbury River with a group of oyster farmers from there and from Wallis Lake and also with two officers from the Australian Taxation Office.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The Australian Taxation Office at the moment has a discussion paper out on how it can draw into the tax system a declaration of trading stock by oyster farmers. That is going to be an extremely difficult thing. I am just using this is an example. I am not criticising the ATO, but I am saying that the ATO is able to push things out at the margins in this regard yet the mandate given in the rewriting and the simplification of the tax act in the TLIP process has been fairly clearly defined.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Going back to the discussion paper and the assessment of how the ATO wants to deal with oyster farmers, it is a very difficult industry to operate in. It is very sensitive to climate changes—more so than a lot of other primary production—and it is going to be very difficult for the ATO to identify a point at which oysters actually become trading stock. The oysters are caught in the wild. It is the same as asking a deep-sea professional fisherman, `How are you going to assess your trading stock?'
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I spent the day with the oyster farmers. We looked at the different processes of oyster farming from actually catching spats that are free and wild in the rivers, to putting them onto sticks, to growing them out, and how they take them from there to fattening paddocks.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The most salient point that was made by the oyster farmers—and I take this opportunity to put it on the record—was that only last year they lost millions of dollars worth of stock in a matter of one hour in one day. They had a lot of their oysters on beds in what they call fattening paddocks. It was extremely hot weather in the middle of summer. There was a low tide at the wrong time of the day and those oysters were exposed to extreme heat for an hour too long. As a result, the industry lost millions of dollars worth of oysters.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          They are exposed to those sorts of things and now they are being faced with the dilemma of how they are going to deal with what may be imposed as far as the Australian Taxation Office is concerned in a declaration of open trading stock. At what point in the process of catching a wild animal on stakes—and the vagaries of that—going through to the process to fattening and marketing an oyster should they be declaring the level and value of their trading stock?
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The point is that in this bill it is fairly clear and it makes it easy to enunciate the natural increase of livestock as trading stock, their value and how to go about it. It is all prescribed in here, but it is going to be a far more difficult exercise with the different operators in the oyster industry in Australia. I just flag to the officers from the ATO who are here today that it is an issue that those of us who represent areas with a major oyster farming industry are going to take a great deal of interest in.

           To their credit, the oyster farmers accepted the offer from the ATO to look at how they operate their businesses and to discuss some of the issues that revolve around the businesses. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would know about that because you also have an oyster industry of sorts in Tasmania. It is not Sydney rock oysters but it is an oyster industry of sorts.

           It is an important element and it has wider ramifications in so far as how people who are heading off into different ventures in agriculture are treated in the system. Every reasonable, thinking person in Australia expects that if you make a profit, you pay tax. That is our contribution to running this country. It is another question as to whether you agree how different governments from time to time spend that money, but any reasonable person will expect to pay tax.

           I concur with the previous speaker with regard to the development of a tax minimisation industry in Australia. However, the reason it exists is because the tax law is so complicated. The average layman just cannot understand the majority of the tax act. That is why the industry has grown to the extent that it has.

           There should be no reason why it should not be a very simple process. I also believe that, as we move towards the turn of the century, there is going to be an increasing demand from different sections of the community—not just from industry, the taxation industry, big business and small business, but from individuals, the PAYE taxpayers—for an overhaul of the tax system in this country. Sadly, it is going to get to the stage where that becomes a very loud cry before it is addressed.

           I say that because, sadly, on a couple of occasions—one very public and one probably internal in government in this country—there was an opportunity presented in 1993 and previous to that in the mid&amp;hyphen;1980s, to have a full and reasonable review of the tax system but on both occasions that was rejected because of a perception of it being too difficult. At some stage in the future, the general taxpaying public will demand that that take place. As I say, sadly we will have to wait till then before there will be a response.

           I support the bill. I would like to see greater focus given to the possibility of policy changes. In a legislative manner, we seem to be bound to just rewriting and simplifying the tax act through what we are doing in TLIP. But the ATO still has the capability to look at those other areas of tax collection, as I highlighted with regard to the oyster industry. It is a dynamic system that we run. Let us be open-minded and look at the possibilities of looking at that issue in future projects. As has been set out in a recommendation in report 348 from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, let us have a look at addressing some policy issues in the future.

          —On behalf of the minister, I say thank you to all the speakers who participated in this debate. It is always interesting to hear people representing their electorates very well. Indeed, as my colleague spoke about the oyster industry, he highlighted some of the difficulties of having a very fair tax system in this nation. I could not help but remember that I like oysters; let us not kill off an oyster industry in Australia. So I thank those from both sides of the House who have contributed to this debate.

         The government believes that the Tax Law Improvement Bill 1996 will be of significant benefit to the entire Australian community. The bill is the second instalment of legislation to replace progressively the Income Tax Assessment Act of 1936. It comes on the heels of the first stage of the new tax act that was endorsed by the Senate on Monday. That event is an
         <break page="2676" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          important milestone because it means that the benefits of the tax law improvement project will begin to flow to the Australian community for the 1997&amp;hyphen;98 income year. It is a major step forward in the progress of giving the taxation laws of this country back to the community in understandable language.

         I would particularly like to acknowledge the extremely valuable work of the JCPA in its watching brief on the project, and especially of its chairman, the member for Fairfax, Mr Somlyay.

         The 1936 act was in desperate need of a comprehensive overhaul. It is long and almost impossible to understand for anyone but tax specialists—sometimes I doubt if they were really clear on what it might have meant. Even then, it takes years of specialisation before a professional can offer confident advice. This bill will be of major benefit to the community and, together with the earlier bill, it makes an enormous improvement on existing law. The tax law improvement project has restructured, renumbered and rewritten the law so that it is easily understandable and can be followed completely.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Because the law can be more easily understood, compliance with it will improve and, very importantly, business costs of complying with it will also reduce. People will be able, for the first time in decades, to have a sense of confidence that they understand their rights and obligations and what actions they are required to take. There have been suggestions about the lack of readiness among the professions and the community for the 1 July 1997 start&amp;hyphen;up date for the bill. The government believes that the community and the professions are now, or are at least becoming, well prepared for the start&amp;hyphen;up date of 1 July this year.

         I am aware that the commercial publishers are ready to go with material, including detailed commentaries on electronic databases, which will support the tax profession and the community. I am also aware that the rewritten law in this, and the earlier bills, is already being taught in many of the tax courses in our universities and other tertiary institutions. So the process is certainly well on the way: that extension of knowledge and understanding of this bill. Text books have been, or are being, written or updated to take account of those changes. The Australian Taxation Office is developing training material to support the implementation of the law. This material will be made publicly available in good time.

         The extensive public consultation has meant that this bill has been exhaustively examined in order to identify any possible detriment to taxpayers.

These amendments will remove references to hire purchase in the depreciation provisions. The bill had sought to provide legislative backing for the longstanding practice of allowing persons who hold property under a hire purchase agreement to depreciate it. However, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts thought it inappropriate for the bill to deal with hire purchase in isolation from other kinds of broadly similar finance arrangements. The government accepts that recommendation. Hirers under hire purchase agreements will continue to attract depreciation deductions under the long&amp;hyphen;established administrative arrangements.

          —The Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997 amends the Excise Tariff Act to ensure the continuing excisability of all beverages containing distilled alcohol, including spirits, regardless of their alcohol content. It is a bill which the opposition supports. It closes a loophole that was created by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ruling that, for example, Carlton United's Sub Zero alcoholic soda, which has an alcohol content of about 5&amp;half; per cent, could not be described as `spirituous' and therefore was not excisable as a spirituous beverage. This is bad news for drinkers of Sub Zero, but the closure is about protecting the revenue base and applying some consistency to the description of alcoholic beverages.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It also applies to a range of other packaged mixed drinks, so it is not just the trendies with the Sub Zero who will be affected, but people who are into mixed spirit drinks, such as the United Distiller brands of rum and cola, gin and tonics and all those sorts of things. I think all of those people who have tried these recognise they contain spirits, especially if they have a lot of them. If sold separately, those spirits would be excisable, but the AAT ruled that the mix, to use their terminology, contained less alcohol than the community definition of spirit.
         <break page="2682" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          At least 37 per cent alcohol by volume is the community definition. It was therefore not subject to excise.

         The mechanism which has been used to close the loophole is to redefine the rate of duty in the schedule of the act from an amount per litre of alcohol to an amount per litre of distilled alcohol. There are further applications for similar rulings before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and the Commonwealth has lodged an appeal in the Federal Court against the CUB Sub Zero ruling. None of these is yet concluded.

         The legislation acts retrospectively from 3 February to effectively quash all claims currently before either the AAT or the Federal Court.

         The financial impact of this bill is that it reduces revenue by $290,000 for an, at this stage, still unexplained change to the excise on brandy based beverages, presumably to bring them into line with other spirituous beverages.

         Further clarification is being sought from the minister but a response has not been received. I would simply ask in this debate that we get that clarification. It is an important one, because it involves reduction in revenue. But other than that, the bill avoids a contingent liability of $12.6 million from the AAT and the Federal Court actions.

          —I am pleased to join this debate on the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No.1) 1997 and I note that the shadow minister, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) has indicated that the opposition will be supporting the amendments to the bill.

         The purpose of the bill is to amend the schedule to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to ensure the continuing excisability of all beverages containing distilled alcohol, including spirits, regardless of their alcoholic content. The important thing here is that this is a bit of housekeeping legislation and the intention is quite simply to close off a loophole.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The financial impact of this bill is virtually zero; there is no financial impact. The amendments proposed in the act only clarify the law as outlined and involve no change to the excise treatment of beverages containing distilled alcohol. As I said earlier, it will have no financial impact. However, conversely it could mean that, unless there is retrospective amendment to the act, the government will have a contingent liability of some $12.6 million. When I first saw the bill, there was a degree of retrospectivity about it. As someone who strongly voices concerns when the word `retrospectivity' comes into play, I must say that was a warning signal for me to have a look in more detail as to what it really means with respect to retrospectivity.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I believe in this instance that the amendments are justifiable on the grounds that they are backdated to 3 February 1996 because this will remove the technical loophole in the tariff act which was uncovered by the decision of the court to make the request by the company seeking the removal of the tariff acceptable. There is no reason to doubt that the court has acted in the best interests of the parliament in bringing down the decision that it has. This will not require the retrospective recovery of any excise duty from the manufacturers of the alcoholic beverages as the excise duty has continued to be paid by the manufacturers under deposit. This will protect the government under any claims for recovery of this duty. As I said earlier on, the bill is more in the nature of a housekeeping bill, and I strongly support the amendments.

          —I thank the members who have spoken to this bill. As my colleague the honourable member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) mentioned, the amendments that we are proposing here have been made necessary because of a challenge brought on by Carlton and United Breweries with regard to the product known as Sub Zero. But I would like to reiterate for the record—I did note that my colleague, the honourable member for Lowe, mentioned this—that the purpose of this bill is to amend the Customs Tariff Act 1921 to ensure the continuing excisability of all beverages which contain distilled alcohol, including spirits, regardless of their alcohol content. It was the alcohol content that was the problem with regard to the Sub Zero case. This is really to make what we are aiming to do in legislation crystal clear.

        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Under item 2 of the schedule of the Tariff Act, spirituous beverages are subject to duties of excise which are calculated at a dollar amount per litre of alcohol in each of the beverages. In November 1994, Carlton and United Breweries, CUB, commenced the manufacture of a product known as Sub Zero alcoholic soda which had an alcoholic content of approximately 5.5 per cent. The Australian Customs Service considered SubZ ero an excisable product. Carlton and United Breweries appealed against the decision of the Australian Customs Service to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and the AAT determined that the product Sub Zero, with such a low alcoholic content by volume, could not be described as spirituous and was therefore not excisable. The Australian Customs Service is appealing against that decision in the Federal Court.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Since the AAT decision, Carlton and United Breweries has ceased the manufacture of Sub Zero using alcohol derived by distillation. However, there are several other manufacturers of beverages of low alcohol content, and the Customs Service has continued to impose excise duty on these beverages. In order to ensure the continuing excisability of all beverages containing distilled alcohol, I have brought this bill forward to amend the act. The combination of these amendments will remove any connotation as to the strength that an alcoholic beverage must be before it is excisable.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is proposed that the amendments will take effect on and from 3 February 1996. The effect of the retrospective commencement date of the amendments will be to extinguish all rights of appeal to the AAT in relation to the excisability of low alcohol beverages and all rights to refunds of excise duty in respect of such beverages. The commencement date of the amendments on 3 February 1996 would not require the retrospective recovery of any excise duty from the manufacturers of the alcoholic beverages. The excise duty has continued to be paid by the manufacturers under deposit, and the 3 February 1996 commencement date will protect the government against all claims for recovery of this duty.

          —I propose to speak only briefly in relation to this bill. The International Transfer of Prisoners Bill 1996 provides mechanisms through which Australians imprisoned abroad may be returned to Australia to serve out their sentences. The bill also provides for foreign nationals imprisoned in Australia to be returned to their home countries, also to complete their sentences.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill makes this provision both in relation to prisoners convicted of war crimes and also prisoners convicted of general offences. In the case of prisoners convicted of war crimes, the bill complements Australia's commitment to prosecuting international war criminals. Australia has vigorously assisted the international efforts in this regard through our participation pursuant to the International War Crimes Tribunal Act 1995 in the tribunals established to deal with war crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia and in Rwanda. That legislation was moved by the former Labor government and received bipartisan support.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Some concerns were expressed at the hearings of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs into this bill. The concerns were that the bill might undermine the effort to fight serious crime, particularly drug related crime. These arguments seem to rest on the erroneous assumptions that the transfer of these prisoners will result in prisoners receiving less severe sentences. This is clearly not the effect of the bill. Whilst it is true that in being closer to home, family and friends prisoners are more likely to be held in more culturally sensitive conditions, these conditions are hardly likely to promote criminal activity. It would be a rather strange individual who decided that they were prepared to commit a serious criminal offence where previously they were not, simply because they knew that pursuant to this bill they might ultimately be returned home. Rather, this bill recognises that despite the serious wrongdoing these prisoners have committed, wrongdoings that are deserving of the gravest censure and punishment, those prisoners have rights to humanitarian treatment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It also recognises that the best way to rehabilitate these prisoners is to return them to culturally appropriate and supportive environments, and as far as the general community is concerned surely this is one of the prime considerations we should be concerned about to minimise the prospect that criminals will offend again and that other innocent people will suffer from their actions. Punishment is an important part of the criminal process; however, punishment that increases the prospect of recidivism is not in the interests of society nor the prisoner concerned.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs provided an advisory report to the parliament on this bill and I think it is worthwhile reading onto the record page 5 of that report. I think that summarises the consideration in favour of international transfer of prisoners and really encapsulates my view of the situation. It says at paragraph 1.15:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The principal argument in favour of the international transfer of prisoners is humanitarian. The deprivation of liberty can be more harsh for prisoners imprisoned in foreign countries because of absence of contact with, and support from, relatives and friends, language barriers, differences in diet and health care, alienation from local culture, intolerance of religious practices, ineffective vocational training and general prejudice against foreigners. A prisoner can be adversely affected both psychologically and physically, and his or her rehabilitation might be impaired.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         The international transfer of prisoners is said to enhance the prospects of rehabilitation of prisoners and their re&amp;hyphen;integration into the community, as rehabilitation is thought to depend on the prisoner having the benefit of family or community support. This support is more likely where prisoners are in the same country as their families.
         <break page="2685" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         </break>
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         Those paragraphs out of the report encapsulate my view of the matter perfectly, and that is one of the reasons why we on this side of the House support this bill.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill also facilitates greater cooperation between Australia and foreign law enforcement and custodial agencies. This increased confidence and support of international law enforcement and custodial agencies will ultimately increase our combined ability to tackle the ever growing rate of international crime. This will help ensure that more criminals are brought to justice and help make the world, including Australia, a safer place.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The aspects of this bill relating to the transfer of prisoners convicted of non&amp;hyphen;war crimes related offences will ultimately rely for their success on the cooperation of the states and territories. The state and territory attorneys&amp;hyphen;general have given in principle agreement to the operation of the legislation. I urge all attorneys concerned to conclude the final agreements with the necessary legislative support as soon as possible.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, I note that the government's proposed amendment to the bill clarifies the wording of clause 24 in accordance with recommendation seven of the unanimous advisory report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The Australian Labor Party welcomes this amendment, just as we welcome this bill. I commend the bill to the House.

        (2) The Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories and the NSW Department of Urban Affairs and Planning cooperated, over the period of 1995 and 1996, in an assessment of the values of the Sydney Opera House in its Harbour Setting and the preparation of a World Heritage nomination. Preparation of the draft nomination was the responsibility of the then New South Wales Department of Urban Affairs and Planning. The Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories was represented on a steering committee of officials which oversaw the work. The Commonwealth Government has not lodged that nomination with the World Heritage Committee.

        Uncertainties are raised by the New South Wales nomination of the building in its harbour setting, particularly the difficulty of establishing satisfactory management arrangements in a dynamic urban setting which includes a working harbour. Accordingly, the Commonwealth has decided that its limited resources for World Heritage matters are best devoted to the nominations we have in progress (notably the Subantarctic Islands), the assessments we have under way and the proper management of the eleven properties already on the World Heritage List.
