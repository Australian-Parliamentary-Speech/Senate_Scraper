         This bill responds to the High Court's decision in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v. Teoh (1995) 183 CLR 273, which was handed down on 7 April 1995. In that decision, the court found that, by entering into a treaty, the Australian government creates a `legitimate expectation' in administrative law that the executive government and its agencies will act in accordance with the terms of the treaty, even where those terms have not been incorporated into Australian law.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The court also said that, where a decision maker intends to act inconsistently with a treaty, procedural fairness required that the person affected by the decision be given notice and an adequate opportunity to put arguments on the point. If not, the decision could be set aside on the grounds of unfairness. The High Court made it clear that such an expectation cannot arise where there is either a statutory or executive indication to the contrary.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The High Court's decision gave treaties an effect in Australian law which they did not previously have. The government is firmly of the view that this development is not consistent with the proper role of parliament in implementing treaties in Australian law.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is a longstanding principle that the provisions of a treaty to which Australia is a party do not form part of Australian law unless
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          those provisions have been validly incorporated. Under the Australian Constitution, the executive government has the power to make Australia a party to a treaty. It is for Australian parliaments, however, to change Australian law to implement treaty obligations.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For these reasons, on 25 February 1997 the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and I made a joint statement which set aside legitimate expectations arising out of entry into treaties. This was a clear expression by the executive government of the Commonwealth of a contrary intention referred to by the majority of the High Court in the Teoh case. The joint statement of 25 February 1997 replaced a joint statement which was made by the previous government on 10 May 1995. However, the 10 May 1995 joint statement continues to apply to decisions made between the date of that statement and 25 February 1997.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         On 25 February, we also announced that legislation would be introduced into the parliament to displace the legitimate expectation in administrative law which would otherwise arise out of the entry into treaties. This bill fulfils that undertaking. It is a clear statutory indication to the contrary as discussed by the High Court in the Teoh case. It gives this parliament a role in restoring the effect of treaties in Australian law to that they had prior to the High Court's decision in the Teoh case.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In passing this legislation, the parliament also will be reasserting its proper role in changing Australian law to implement treaties. Indeed, the bill complements the treaty reforms this government initiated on coming into office. One of the principal aims of those reforms was to enhance the role of parliament in scrutinising treaty action by the executive government. Those reforms included the tabling of treaties in parliament prior to the government taking action to fully become a party to a treaty, the preparation and tabling of national interest analyses for each treaty to which it is proposed Australia become a party and the establishment of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties to examine treaties.

         These measures giving the parliament a proper role in the treaty making process could

          have been introduced by the previous government. However, it was too intent on keeping parliament in the dark about treaties. This veil of secrecy now has been lifted.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I turn now to the terms of the bill itself. The bill will restore the situation which existed before the Teoh case. That is, if there are to be changes to procedural or substantive rights in Australian law resulting from adherence to a treaty, they will result from parliamentary and not executive action. Indeed, this proper role of Commonwealth, state and territory legislatures is emphasised in the sixth paragraph of the preamble to the bill.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Clause 5 of the bill gives effect to the statement by the majority of the High Court that a legitimate expectation arising out of entry into a treaty by Australia can be displaced by executive or legislative action. Clause 5 provides that no legitimate expectation providing a basis at law for challenging an administrative decision can arise out of the fact that Australia is bound by an international instrument or the fact that an enactment produces or refers to such an instrument.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The term `international instrument' is defined in clause 4 and covers, amongst other types of instruments, treaties and conventions. To fall within the definition, the instrument must be binding at international law. The definition also covers parts of such instruments.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The terms `administrative decision' and `enactment' are also defined in clause 4. The act will apply to administrative decisions made after it enters into force. However, the term `administrative decision' extends to an administrative decision reviewing or determining an appeal in respect of a decision made before the commencement of the legislation. The 25 February 1997 joint statement will continue to apply to decisions made between 25 February 1997 and the date of entry into force of this bill.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is unclear from the decision of the High Court in Teoh's case whether state and territory administrative decisions may be the subject of legitimate expectations arising out of treaties. This uncertainty could not be allowed to remain. Therefore, the bill is
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          expressed to extend to state and territory decisions.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Since ratification of a treaty is a Commonwealth executive action, it is entirely appropriate for the Commonwealth to legislate to control the effect of that action in Australian domestic law generally. The states and territories all support Commonwealth legislation on this issue. However, they differ in their views on whether the Commonwealth legislation should be applied to state and territory decisions. Therefore, clause 6 of the bill contains a roll-back provision. This excludes the operation of the bill in relation to state or territory administrative decisions where the relevant state or territory legislature passes, or has passed, legislation having the same or similar effect as this bill.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This means that it will be open to a state or territory to have its own legislation of similar effect. South Australia enacted such legislation in 1995. Therefore, the bill will have no application to state administrative decisions in South Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Nor does the bill prevent any state which wishes to do so from passing a law or taking its own executive actions in relation to treaties accepted by Australia which might themselves create a legitimate expectation. In that case, the legitimate expectation would flow from state law and not the Commonwealth executive act of ratification.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Clause 7 puts it beyond doubt that parliament is not affecting the way in which treaties may otherwise have relevance in Australian law. Let me mention a number of existing uses covered by clause 7.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Firstly, this bill will not affect the operation of treaty provisions which have been incorporated into Australian law. For example, it does not affect the provisions of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations which are given the force of law by the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act 1967.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Secondly, the bill will not affect the operation of an act which provides for the redress of grievances in respect of alleged breaches of international instruments to which Australia is a party. For example, the bill does not affect the operation of procedures available
         <break page="5547" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Thirdly, the bill does not affect the operation of legislation which provides that compliance with an international instrument is a relevant consideration in making an administrative decision. For example, under the air navigation regulations, compliance with Australia's bilateral air services agreements is a relevant consideration in making various decisions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Fourthly, the bill does not make compliance with an international instrument an irrelevant consideration in making an administrative decision where that would otherwise be consistent with the scope and object of the particular statutory provision. Fifthly, the bill will not affect the use by courts of international law in the form of treaties in the interpretation of statutes.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Finally, it will not affect their use of international law as a source of guidance for the development of the common law. This use of treaties as one source for the development of the common law is to be distinguished from the High Court's finding that treaties gave rise to legitimate expectations in administrative law. It is the legitimate expectation aspect of the Teoh decision with which this government and the previous government disagreed. That is the aspect addressed by this bill.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         On 25 February 1997, I stated that I looked forward to continuation of bipartisan support on this issue. The strength of feeling which the opposition, when in government, demonstrated on this issue was no more evident than in the speech given by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) to the Mason and Beyond conference in September 1995. He stated:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         My lack of enthusiasm for Teoh is not especially a function of my lack of appreciation of how it has narrowed the gap between international and domestic law: rather it is a function of my belief that Teoh creates a decision-making environment that is unworkable in practice, and that it goes further than the court was compelled to go by any legal principle, or should have gone, in upsetting the present balance between Executive, Legislature and Judiciary. The pre-Teoh balance was a delicate one, to be sure, but nonetheless one perfectly attractive in theory and workable in practice.

        <para style="Para">
         There can be no doubt that those words are his own. They encapsulate the reasons why this legislation is necessary in order to restore the proper role of this parliament in the implementation of treaties. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.

         The coalition went into the 1996 election with a strong policy commitment to bring about an up&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;date and workable copyright law, and specifically to legislate to recognise properly the moral rights of authors and artists. The comprehensive protection of moral rights of authors and artists is something for which Australia's creators have been agitating during the last few years. Provision for this is the single most important reform in the bill.
        </para>

         The bill will also reform the law of ownership of copyright in the works of employed journalists and the law governing importation of goods with copyright labelling or packaging, and introduce much needed streamlining or modernising of the operation of some areas of the act.

         Personal honour and reputation are already protected by the laws of defamation. The law of passing off enables professional authors and artists to prevent another person representing himself or herself as the creator of their business output, including copyright works. The provisions in the Trade Practices Act against misleading or deceptive conduct could also be invoked by authors and artists. Some provisions in the Copyright Act already protect specific aspects of moral rights—for example, the duty to refrain from falsely attributing a work.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, this fragmentary and incomplete coverage by Australian law of the Berne convention moral rights obligations has been increasingly criticised. Among other common law countries that had a similar approach to moral rights protections, the United Kingdom and Canada introduced improved moral rights legislation in 1988, and New Zealand largely adopted the UK model in 1994.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill that I am now presenting honours this government's 1996 election policy commitment to the introduction of comprehensive moral rights and does so by reference to the international standards set by the Berne convention. It is not just fulfilling international obligations; it is also acknowledging the great importance of ensuring respect for the integrity of creative endeavour.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The right of attribution will be an important advance for authors, artists and film producers and directors, because they have no comprehensive right beyond any relevant contract to require attribution. The right to take action against false attribution is essentially a consolidation of existing provisions in the act.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The right of integrity will provide a more certain and uniform level of protection than the laws of defamation, which vary from state to state or territory, and will, consistently with the Berne convention, last as long as copyright in the work; that is, life of the creator

         The government recognises the concerns of users of copyright—such as broadcasters, advertising agencies, filmmakers and newspaper publishers—that these rights will unduly hamper their existing practices. It is understandable that they fear use of moral rights by creators as an additional form of leverage to extract higher returns for the use of creators' works.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, if a user of a work respects the rights of the creator—that is, acknowledges, where reasonable, the authorship of the work and, where reasonable, avoids treatment that is prejudicial to the reputation of the author—then the user does not owe the author anything and does not need the author's permission in making the intended use of the work. In contrast, a user of one of the copyright economic rights—such as, the right to copy, to publish, to broadcast—must always have the copyright owner's permission, express or implied, unless the use comes within a statutory exception.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In determining whether non&amp;hyphen;attribution of authorship of a work is an infringement of moral rights, a court will have to consider whether the omission was reasonable in the circumstances. Reasonableness will depend on a number of relevant factors that must be taken into account; notably, the nature of the work, industry practice and whether the creator was an employee. Whether alteration of or dealing with a work infringes the right of integrity will also be subject to a similar test of reasonableness based on relevant criteria. Further, there will be no infringement of moral rights by a particular act or omission if it was consented to by the creator or if it was covered by a waiver by the creator of one or more of their rights for the work.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Finally, it should be emphasised that the introduction of moral rights, in particular the right of integrity, is not intended to impede or adversely affect the time&amp;hyphen;honoured practices of parody and burlesque. The moral right of integrity is not intended to stifle satire, spoof or lampoon any more than does the existing law of defamation.

        <break page="5549" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          Experience in other countries suggests—and the government envisages—that enforcement of moral rights through the courts will be an exceptional occurrence. The main impact of the new legislation will, it is hoped, be to build upon good existing industry practice and, where necessary, to raise awareness in an educative way of the need to respect the creativity of authors and artists. In those exceptional cases in which a creator feels forced to take action, courts will have the discretion to order a range of remedies, including damages, injunctions, publication of apology or reversing infringing treatment of a work.

          Journalists' copyright
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          A general rule under the Copyright Act is that copyright in works created in the course of employment belongs to the employer, who has engaged and paid the employees to create the works. However, there has long been an exception in the case of employed newspaper journalists in regard to use of their works other than for the purpose for which they have been employed; that is, newspaper publication. Thus, those journalists have copyright for the purpose of book publication and photocopying of their articles, pictures or cartoons.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          With the impact of new technology, the way that the act divides copyright between the publishers and employed journalists has become out of date. In regard to electronic uses of the employees' works—for example, selling of on&amp;hyphen;line access to the public—the government accepts that the publishers' copyright in their employees' creations should now extend to electronic rights, and the bill provides for this.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          However, the book rights now held by employed journalists in their articles and pictures will stay with them. The existing right of the employed journalists to authorise photocopying of their articles, most notably in press cuttings services, will also remain with them. While the publishers have indicated that they do not oppose this, they have been concerned at the possibility that photocopying could impact on the circulation of their publications.

         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          <para first-indent="16">
           The government is not satisfied that photocopying by press cuttings services up to now has had such an impact. Nevertheless, the government sees justification in giving publishers a right of objection to the making of photocopies of more than 15 per cent of a newspaper or magazine other than those pages containing full&amp;hyphen;page advertisements. Where the copies are being made for several or many clients, as is done by press cuttings services, the right to object in the bill will operate in respect of any one client, not all clients in aggregate.

         This bill introduces a statutory exemption for the Austudy and Abstudy schemes from the operation of the marital status discrimination provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         At present, the Austudy and Abstudy schemes discriminate on the basis of marital status in two key ways. Firstly, there are differences in the way legally married students are treated as compared with students in de facto relationships. Secondly, there are differences in the way legally married students are treated in comparison with single students.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A number of these differences go to the broader issue of the assumptions of dependency which underpin Commonwealth allowances generally. Rates of allowance and the income and assets tests, including those applied to receipt of rent assistance, are based on the assumptions which also underpin other Commonwealth allowances that a person with a partner has access to the financial means of their partner to meet their combined costs, and a single person who is independent of parental assistance does not have the opportunity to share costs for accommodation and other living expenses.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In addition to these broader issues, a number of the problems which Austudy and Abstudy have in relation to the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 are specific to the schemes. Unlike the social security situation, the recognition of de facto relationships in the Austudy context would generally result in increased eligibility for benefits. In the social security context, beneficiaries actually have a financial
         <break page="5551" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          disincentive for establishing de facto relationships as their combined eligibility is reduced as a result.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In Austudy, a person who is married is considered to be independent for purposes of the scheme, and is eligible for a higher rate of Austudy than the rate payable to a student who is considered to be dependent. If de facto relationships are treated the same as marriage—that is, as a ground for independent status—there would be a financial incentive for establishing the existence of a de facto relationship so that the student is eligible for a higher rate of Austudy. This would make it difficult for the scheme administrators to verify the legitimacy of de facto relationships. Abstudy experiences similar problems under the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 in relation to living allowances, income testing and eligibility for rent assistance.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Austudy and Abstudy schemes initially had a legislative exemption from the operation of those provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 proscribing discrimination on the ground of marital status. The Austudy and Abstudy schemes currently have an administrative exemption from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in relation to the marital status provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. The administrative exemption expires, however, on 31 December 1997.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Non&amp;hyphen;legislative options for dealing with this issue have been explored, however, these would have serious social or financial repercussions. Failure to take the action proposed would mean that complaints could be made under the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 once the existing administrative exemption has expired. It is therefore necessary that this amending legislation be in place by 1 January 1998. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.

         The bill provides for this government's commitment to two initiatives. The first is its commitment to lift the requirement for at least 10 per cent of enrolled students to be indigenous before a non&amp;hyphen;government non&amp;hyphen;systemic preschool, school or vocational education and training institution can be funded under the indigenous education strategic initiatives program.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The amendment leaves in place the requirement for there to be a minimum of 20 students in a non&amp;hyphen;government non&amp;hyphen;systemic school and a non&amp;hyphen;government non&amp;hyphen;systemic VET institution and for there to be a minimum of five students in a non&amp;hyphen;government non&amp;hyphen;systemic preschool. These limits will avoid the administrative expense of providing small amounts of money to small numbers of scattered students. It will also avoid the situation where there will be little or no benefit to individual students from the provision of small grants.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This amendment will enable institutions where there are significant numbers of Indigenous students, but these students represent less than 10 per cent of total enrolments, to qualify for funding under the act. Experience has shown that the 10 per cent requirement has excluded some institutions from receiving supplementary funding in respect of their indigenous students.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second amendment will permit the adjustment of grants under the indigenous education strategic initiatives program in line with cost increases for the period up to 30 June 2000. The appropriations for these years are in subsections 13b(4), (5), (6) and (7) in the principal act. Inclusion of a cost supplementation provision in the principal act will bring the program into line with other education programs.

         This bill contains several important amendments to five existing acts, the Air Navigation Act 1920, the Airports Act 1996, the Air Services Act 1995, the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959 and the International Air Services Commission Act 1992.

         Air Navigation Act 1920 Amendments
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These amendments concern the security screening of passengers boarding large commercial aircraft within Australia. The amendments represent a minor change to Australia's aviation security regulatory framework based on operational reasons.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Currently, arrangements under the Air Navigation Act 1920 make individual aircraft operators responsible for passenger screening for certain domestic and international aircraft operations. The responsibility for segregating passengers who have been screened from those who have not also currently rests with the airlines.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In larger airport terminals around the country the favoured method for segregating screened persons before they board an aircraft is to screen into sterile areas. Sterile areas offer savings in security costs by minimising the required level of screening staff and equipment compared to screening passengers at individual gate lounges.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         With the increasingly commercial approach being taken by airport terminal operators to non&amp;hyphen;aeronautical revenue raising, more and more commercial activities, such as retail outlets, are being located within sterile areas, where the departing passengers tend to congregate. These activities are controlled by the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          operators of the passenger terminal buildings through the terminal operator leases and not by the airlines. The operation of these commercial activities, particularly the need to restock out of hours, and some of the delivery practices for goods and services do have an impact on the security of the sterile area.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As a result, the government proposes to centralise the responsibility for sterile area access control and passenger screening into the one organisation. This will be achieved by making terminal operators primarily responsible for passenger screening at sterile areas.

         Along with this massive increase in capacity available for Australian and overseas carriers to service the Australian market, there has been a rapid increase in the sophistication with which Australian carriers have approached their operations overseas.

         As the structural complexity of international air services increases and Australian carriers become more sophisticated in the way in which they apply allocations of capacity to particular markets, the commission will increasingly be called upon to consider the

         This bill also makes some technical amendments, including the removal of definitions of new and shelf capacity which are now redundant, the inclusion of a provision to allow the commission to revoke a determination at the request of an Australian carrier to whom that determination relates and a new provision to ensure that the proposed amendments do not affect current operations between points outside Australia by Australian carriers. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.

         The purpose of this bill is to implement a package of enhancements to Australia's marine cargo liability regime. The Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1991, which is often referred to as the COGSA, deals with liability for loss or damage to sea cargoes. The package is the result of extensive negotiations with, and agreement by, all affected interests—shippers, cargo owners, carriers, shipowners, marine insurers and maritime lawyers.

          The bill I have introduced to amend the COGSA deals directly with two of the seven items in the industry package—the Hamburg Rules trigger now contained in the COGSA, and arbitration in Australia.

          The Hamburg Rules, although a more recent convention than the amended Hague Rules, have attracted very little support from major trading nations, including Australia's major trading partners. The Hamburg Rules trigger was first due to operate on 1 November 1994. Prior to that date there had been vigorous debate between shipper interests proposing the implementation of the Hamburg Rules and carrier interests opposing this. In October 1994, both houses of parliament passed resolutions to defer consideration of the question of acceptance or repeal of the Hamburg Rules for another three years.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Following this resolution an industry working group developed a compromise solution in which carriers conceded significant extensions in the protection offered to shippers in return for the removal of the automatic trigger for the Hamburg Rules. I would like to congratulate the industry interests concerned on the spirit in which this process was conducted. This bill implements that compromise solution developed by industry.

           At present, the automatic trigger provision will operate again on 20 October 1997 to bring the Hamburg Rules into force in the COGSA, and action is therefore needed to prevent this. This bill will remove that trigger and the requirement for a resolution of both houses of parliament. In its place, provisions are inserted for the minister to conduct a review from time to time of the desirability of bringing the Hamburg Rules into force in Australia.

           These changes will extend the protection which the COGSA offers to Australian shippers, particularly exporters. The concepts behind these changes can be simply expressed. However, given the nature of international conventions, the modifications to the amended Hague Rules to make these changes are technically complex and lengthy. Given the need not to overburden parliament's business agenda and recognising that the resources of
           <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

           Accordingly, the bill includes a very precise regulation making power which will enable the subsequent drafting and making of regulations to implement these changes. This might be regarded as a `Henry VIII clause', which is a clause that permits the making of regulations which have the effect of amending the operation of an act. However, such clauses are used in Commonwealth laws regularly, and enable the expeditious passage of legislation. The regulations are, of course, subject to disallowance, and will be required by the act to be made only after consultation with relevant industry stakeholders.

         The bill seeks to make an amendment to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 to ensure the effectiveness of subsection 50(2D) of the act which prevents land claims over stock routes and stock reserves. The background to this matter is that the previous government entered into a memorandum of agreement in 1989 with the Northern Territory concerning the granting of community living areas to Aboriginal people
         <break page="5556" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          in pastoral districts in the Northern Territory. As part of the agreement, the Commonwealth undertook to proclaim a 1987 amendment to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 preventing the making of land claims over stock routes and reserves. This amendment was made because it was never intended that stock routes and reserves should be available for claim.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The amendment was proclaimed in 1990. However, it appears that it may be technically deficient. The effect of the amendment as drafted is that, while the claims cannot be heard by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner as a result of subsection 50(2D), they remain registered. This means that there is some doubt about whether the Northern Territory government can deal with the land.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In 1995, the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory governments reached an arrangement that an effective amendment be made in exchange for the Northern Territory accepting Commonwealth proposals for amendments to the Northern Territory's Pastoral Land Act 1992. The aim of these amendments is to expedite the granting of community living areas to Aboriginal people, particularly those being dealt with by the Community Living Areas Tribunal.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill, once agreed to by parliament, will conclusively eliminate stock route and stock reserve claims by removing any doubt about the effectiveness of subsection 50(2D) of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. The amendments contained in this bill before the House will commence on proclamation, with a 12&amp;hyphen;month limit on the time within which the proclamation is to be made. The intended proclamation period has been provided so that, in accordance with the 1995 agreement with the Northern Territory, the amendment can commence the same time as the Northern Territory's amendments to its Pastoral Land Act 1992. There are no financial implications arising from this bill. I commend the amended bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.

          —The Australian National Railways Commission Sale Bill 1997 is one of the more outrageous pieces of legislation that has been put before this parliament in recent times, not merely because it seeks, contrary to the election commitment of the new government, to privatise Australian National and, incidentally, subsequently privatise the government's holding in the National Rail Corporation, not merely because it threatens large numbers of jobs and significant rail services, not merely because it is based on a gross exaggeration of the financial problems from which Australian National is currently suffering and not merely because it surrounds itself with an entirely fictitious $2 billion reform package which is almost totally comprised of existing obligations on the part of the federal government.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What is particularly most outrageous about this legislation is the content of the legislation itself because in effect it empowers the two ministers named—the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Transport—to do whatever they like with respect to the future of the rail industry in this country. The bill empowers the two ministers to sell, by their own decision, any assets of Australian National, to set up companies that can be used as halfway houses to transfer assets to private owners, to transfer the Australian National debt to the Commonwealth, to amend or repeal any acts of this parliament or the transfer agreements between the two states involved and this parliament and to wind up the Australian National Railways Commission.

         In effect, the parliament is being asked to hand over all of its powers with respect to the legislation surrounding the Australian national railway system to the two ministers. It is being asked to completely abrogate any responsibility that it has for making decisions with respect to the future of the rail system without being told what the two ministers are
         <break page="5557" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          going to do with these powers. The two ministers, and the government with them, are saying, `Trust us. Give us the power. We intend to flog off Australian National. We may sell it in bits. We may sell it as a single unit. We cannot give you any guarantees about services. We cannot give any guarantees about jobs. We have some general propositions in place.' That is all the parliament is being told and it is now being asked to simply give carte blanche to the two ministers to do whatever they like.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The opposition has a number of objections to the legislation, which I will get to later, that are contained in the second reading amendment that I will move at the end of my contribution. We also intend to move a set of amendments in the consideration in detail stage relating to the question of the future of the proposed track authority. I will deal first with the background to the situation that faces the parliament with respect to Australian National. In April last year the Chairman of Australian National, Jack Smorgon, wrote to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) indicating that the anticipated loss of Australian National for the 1995-96 year of $26 million was now anticipated to be over $100 million. Naturally, the minister sought to blame the former government and commissioned Mr John Brew to conduct an inquiry into the cause of this financial difficulty.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The minister sought to make cheap political points about the number of job losses and line closures that had occurred in Australian National in the preceding 13 years—naturally failing to point out that equivalent things had occurred throughout the state systems over that period largely relating to the changes in demand, changes in the freight task and, particularly, changes in technology and productivity. In my own state of Victoria, for example, we have seen very substantial reductions in employment similar to what has occurred in the equivalent systems in places like South Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The losses that were anticipated were not unusual in Australian National history. If we go back to the last couple of years of the former conservative government, we see that
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          in 1982&amp;hyphen;83 Australian National recorded a loss of $106 million. In today's dollars that is roughly $192 million. In 1981&amp;hyphen;82, there was a loss of $73 million and in today's dollars that is roughly $146 million. We have seen a pattern over a number of years where there has been a substantial subsidy from the Commonwealth to the operations of Australian National. It has varied from time to time, but it has generally been fairly substantial, albeit often nowhere near as substantial as rail is subsidised in other parts of the Commonwealth by the state systems and in other parts of the world.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Generally speaking, direct government subsidisation to rail is the norm throughout most of the world. The effective community subsidisation that goes to roads through the direct construction of roads and the financing of roads and also through indirect costs associated with road trauma, pollution and the like is very difficult to compare to the direct subsidisation that goes to rail.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If we look at the more recent figures for Australian National, we see that in 1992-93 it had a bad year because of the recession, 1993-94 was one of its best years for a long time and 1994-95 was not such a good year but not much worse than 1993-94 and certainly better than some of the years in the early 1990s. So, for the last full financial year figures that the former government had available to it, Australian National was basically doing reasonable well relative to its history.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In December 1995, the chairman spoke to the former Minister for Transport, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), who was told not that the organisation was in financial trouble but rather that there were questions with respect to the current CEO and that the board wished to deal with those matters, which could potentially include dismissal. The then transport minister indicated quite properly that the government was almost in caretaker mode, an election was pending and it would be more appropriate for such matters to be dealt with under the auspices of the incoming transport minister and transport administration.
        </para>
        <break page="5558" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          In the wake of that, the government then instigated the Brew inquiry which was essentially a very narrow accounting exercise that looked only at the balance sheets for each of Australian National's businesses. It anticipated that the loss for the 1995-96 financial year would be somewhere between $130 million and $148 million. It identified the creation of National Rail in 1991-92 as the key reason for the decline in Australian National's fortunes which, I hasten to point out—a fact that the minister does not ever mention in the House—was ultimately forced on the Labor government by the states.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The former government wanted to have National Rail's functions essentially as part of Australian National, but the states refused to do that. In order to create an integrated interstate rail system, which achieved massive improvements in the public sector deficit with respect to rail freight, the former government separated National Rail from Australian National. That then had an adverse consequence for the operations of Australian National because the bulk of its profitable activities were now part of an another organisation.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The Brew inquiry recommended wholesale closures and sell-offs and made a range of fairly harsh recommendations based on very narrow consultations and a very narrow perspective on the overall operation of Australian National and the rail industry.

          No serious analysis was made of the performance of management, something which particularly sticks in the craw of many AN workers. No analysis was made of the merits of separating out all of the various components of AN's operations and setting them up as separate businesses, following a very popular management fad which we can see throughout most of the private sector in recent

          As a result of Labor's return to order motion in the Senate, the Brew inquiry report was forced to be made public, albeit a slightly doctored version. In the debate that followed the minister first claimed that the Labor Party in government did nothing about Australian National's problems. Then a day later, when the report had been released and Australian National had issued a press release calling for expressions of interest for the sale of a substantial part of AN's businesses, the minister then sought to blame this on the former government.

          In other words, on the one hand, the former government did nothing to address AN's financial crises but, on the other hand, when it became clear that AN was already moving to sell off substantial parts of its operations this was blamed on the former government. Of course it soon became very clear when a letter leaked from the minister to the Chairman of Australian National, dated 15 August, that the actions Australian National were taking had been taken specifically at the request and instruction of the minister.

          The final blow to the credibility of the Brew report came in September of last year when it emerged that Mr Brew had, shortly after submitting the report, engaged himself in discussions with one of the front runners, the Great Southern Railway Corporation based on Macquarie Bank, to buy parts of Australian National with respect to possibilities that he may become a consultant. In fact, the discussions had reached a stage where Macquarie Bank and the Great Southern Railway Corporation felt it was appropriate that they could advertise their prospective running of Australian National in the future, mentioning the fact that they would have the unique expertise of John Brew on board as a consultant.

           Clearly, although no agreement was finalised, Mr Brew obviously had it in his mind when conducting his inquiry that at the conclusion of that inquiry there would be some substantial opportunities for people with rail expertise to make a dollar out of the dismembering of Australian National. As far as the opposition is concerned, that tainted the whole inquiry, and the inquiry really does not amount to a great deal in the overall perspective that we need to develop with respect to the future of the rail industry.

           Then we saw in November the reform package, as it has been dubbed in Orwellian language, from the minister in which the minister announced the total privatisation of Australian National with respect to the main line interstate track. It was originally all of the mainland track, but it is now the main line interstate track on the mainland. This could occur either as a totality or in pieces. The government's ownership of its share of National Rail would also be included, even though that was not recommended by John Brew and was a good illustration of the government's hypocrisy on this issue. Australian National was being sold, we are told, simply because its finances were in difficulty and it needed private ownership to get it back on an even keel and the government needed to get out of a potentially spiralling deficit with respect to rail.

          <para first-indent="16">
           Yet, on the other hand, the government's share of National Rail was also going to be sold even though National Rail was doing quite well, was roughly on target to achieve its five&amp;hyphen;year objective to a commercial break&amp;hyphen;even point, albeit with one or two problems on the way but nonetheless doing quite well, and had, in the words of the minister's own department, improved the interstate rail transport freight deficit from $350 million in the early 1990s to $50 million in 1995-96. So the contradiction in the government's position was very strongly exposed by what it was actually doing. It was seeking to sell both, even though the NRC sale was not proposed by Brew and even though the justification for selling AN was completely irrelevant and not applicable with respect to NRC.

            The package that was put forward was almost totally fictitious. It included, for example, $580&amp;hyphen;odd million relating to superannuation. What did that reflect? When you actually went into it, what it reflected was that for many years Australian National has been fully funding its superannuation but paying its obligations into consolidated revenue with the Commonwealth meeting its obligations from time to time. In other words, that $580 million was simply an existing obligation that the Commonwealth always had and always would have. Similarly, with respect to the debt, $790-odd million worth of debt was already a Commonwealth liability.

In most cases, the contamination that this relates to is the sort of standard common&amp;hyphen;or&amp;hyphen;garden contamination you will get with any form of industrial or transport activity with land—things like diesel spills and the like.

The $20 million that was specified for regional assistance was described by the Chief Executive Officer of the Spencer Regions Development Association, Mr Rod Nettle, who I understand is a former National Party candidate for Grey, as `a Laurel and Hardy show' and `3,000 new beach barbecue sets' as being the net impact that would have, particularly in places like the Iron Triangle and Port Augusta.

It is reasonable to suppose that, if you have a situation where there is an operating deficit of a certain level based on current revenue and current expenditure, that will continue in the future unless something is done to change the situation, whereas an asset revaluation is a one-off exercise that will not reappear in the deficit in the following year and the year after that.

Certainly, there were issues with AN that needed to be addressed, but these have been grossly exaggerated by the minister in order to justify simply getting the Commonwealth out of rail, removing the subsidies that have been there for a long time under governments of both persuasions and simply abdicating any responsibility for the future of rail transport in this country.

            Since then, we have had the expressions of interest process. A number of organisations, both Australian and foreign, have expressed some form of interest in buying parts of Australian National. We have had various statements of general intention on the part of the government but very little serious detail. I would suggest that the House take one step back on this issue for a minute to consider an interesting contrast. The most recent major total privatisation that we have dealt with, certainly in the transport area, has been the airport sales legislation.

We have a very small bill, a bill that in effect says that the parliament empowers the ministers to do what they like. That amounts to an outrageous abrogation of parliamentary sovereignty, something that the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop), who is at the table, would have loved to have spoken about in opposition.

            Labor's specific objections to the legislation, more particularly to what it does not deal with and what it does not address, are as follows. Firstly, there is no reference at all to the establishment of the long awaited Track Authority—it has had various names; it was going to be Track Australia under the former government—and, effectively, the legislation empowers the two ministers to establish this authority without further reference to the parliament.
           </para>

            <para first-indent="16">
             If this legislation gets through in its current form—we will be moving amendments in consideration in detail to prevent this later on today—the proposed National Rail Infrastructure Authority, which will manage the track and which will be retained in Commonwealth ownership, will be able to be established by this government with no further reference to the parliament. Decisions about the types of access regimes that apply with respect to the use of the track, how it will be maintained, what sort of labour will be used and the types of funding arrangements will be taken out of the jurisdiction of this parliament with no further potential for the parliament—for people who represent constituencies in the parliament—to deal with those issues.
            </para>
            <para first-indent="16">
             It is more particularly significant that there is no reference to this proposal when we consider the recent budgetary estimates that have been applied with respect to the Track Authority. In 1995, under the then Minister for Transport, the honourable member for Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith, the Labor government committed itself to $370 million over five years for the Track Authority. This was reduced to about $240-odd million in the budget of last year. Again this year it has been reduced to $185 million, although the minister seems to be a bit confused because he put out a press release saying it was $175 million.
            </para>
            <para first-indent="16">
             In an extraordinary example of how little there was for transport in this year's budget, he actually sought to make a virtue out of a vice and put out a press release proclaiming how wonderful it was that the government was going to set up a track authority—something that the government had previously announced, something that the previous government had previously announced and something on which he was now proposing to spend less than half what the former government was going to spend. But he had so little to say and so little good news that he had to turn bad news into good news. I do not think too many people were fooled by it.

            <para first-indent="16">
             The second issue on which there is great concern on the part of the opposition, and I suspect other parties in this parliament, is that there are no details in this legislation with
             <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
              respect to the regulatory arrangements that will apply with respect to the operations of the rail system. Clearly, there is a substantial difference, as there is in the airline industry. When you remove dominant public sector operation and replace it with private operation you have to have a different regulatory regime. There are questions of train control, operation, safety, access and all sorts of things that need to be dealt with. Again the parliament is being told, `Don't you worry about that. Leave that up to the ministers. We'll sort all that out. You don't have any entitlement to a say.'

             The third issue the opposition is concerned about is that there is no guarantee with respect to services. People in western New South Wales, for example, are worried—and with good reason—about the future of the

              Indian Pacific

             and, of course, things like the grain lines in South Australia, the freight lines in Tasmania, and so it goes on. We are not being told anything. No guarantees have been given about the future of these operations or the future of community service obligations.
            </para>
            <para first-indent="16">
             The opposition is particularly concerned also about a number of issues that apply with respect to the work force of Australian National. There is no labour adjustment program. Undoubtedly, if privatisation proceeds, some workers will get jobs with future private operators, but many will not. If those workers are in places like Port Augusta, their ability to access training to ensure they have some chance of getting future employment in alternative areas is very limited and very costly without there being a labour adjustment program, such as the program the former government put in place with respect to workers who had been retrenched from Australian National but which this government cut and now refuses to replace.
            </para>
            <para first-indent="16">
             There is no specific provision being made for most apprentices currently employed by Australian National, particularly people who are roughly in the middle of their apprentice
             <break page="5562" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
              ship; suddenly, they are going to be left high and dry. No guarantees have been given about their future. No guarantees have been given that they will be able to complete their apprenticeship, the learning of the skills in their acquisition of the trade for which they were taken on by Australian National.

            </para>
            <para first-indent="16">
             There is no detail about the future shape of the industry, the future role that the industry will play with respect to the overall transport picture in the economic arrangements of Australia. There is no guarantee that predatory asset stripping will not occur, particularly with things like the workshops, where there are many private competitors and a significant oversupply of workshop capacity. One of the risks that this government should be guarding against, and the parliament should be concerned about, is the proposition that another owner may buy one of those workshops, strip it of its saleable or useable assets and close it down.
            </para>
            <para first-indent="16">
             Also, in recent weeks two issues with respect to the entitlements of workers have emerged with which the government has failed to deal and which are of considerable concern. Superannuation is one. The Australian National principal scheme, which was established seven years ago, does not have full vesting entitlements for workers who are deemed to have resigned. In fact, I think it takes 15 years before you get full vesting rights to the employer contributions.
            </para>
            <para first-indent="16">
             That means that it is impossible for workers who are in that scheme to get their full superannuation entitlements. But they are not resigning, even though they are deemed under the scheme to be resigning; they are being retrenched—they are being compulsorily retrenched in effect. They are being denied their full superannuation entitlements, yet an amount of $4&amp;half; million in surplus is anticipated to be in the fund once all of these arrangements are completed.
            </para>
            <para first-indent="16">
             So we will be seeing somewhere in the vicinity of a third of the workers in Australian National being denied their full superannuation entitlements and, at the same time, the government—because it is the government who controls the decisions—effectively reaping $4&amp;half; million out of their money. That
             <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
              is, money that has been put aside by their employer for them, for their superannuation, will be taken by the government. That is outrageous. It is something that the government has known about for some time and has refused to deal with.
             </break>
            </para>
            <para first-indent="16">
             The final issue, the full detail about which I am still endeavouring to find out, relates to a small number of people who have resigned on ill-health workers compensation. After having been told that they would not get a redundancy, Australian National then apparently changed its mind and said, `Yes, people in that situation will be included in the redundancies, but not retrospectively.' It would appear that there may be some people who, since the minister's announcement, have resigned and who are now in a position where they are being told they will not get the redundancy but that those who are in the same situation who have not yet resigned will get the redundancy.
            </para>
            <para first-indent="16">
             In effect, the government is saying, `Trust us, give us carte blanche, give the two ministers the capacity to do what they like and—don't you worry about that—they'll make the decisions about the future of the industry.' It is abundantly clear that they have no vision, no strategy, no plan for the future of rail in this country; no sense of how rail can play a substantial, continuing role in our overall transport arrangements.

          Some of the comments made by the shadow minister are not too difficult to rebut. Towards the end of his speech he said  that there were problems with superannuation. The government has already committed $112 million to refund redundancy payouts as well as $580 million to cover superannuation and an extra $90 million to cover unfunded contributions such as leave.

          Labor, as we have heard from the shadow minister this morning, would not have us believe any of that. They are delaying the $20 million rail reform transition program and the benefits it will bring to rural South Australia and the metropolitan and north&amp;hyphen;western suburbs of Adelaide. That $20 million is for the creation of long&amp;hyphen;term, sustainable jobs. It is not for programs in which somebody goes in and comes out at the other end after six months and still does not have a real job. They are programs that will lead to long&amp;hyphen;term, sustainable jobs. I have been chairing some consultative meetings on this issue. I am a member of the state committee looking at the matter. I know about the quality of many of the submissions that have been put forward.

          Most of the first round of $10 million goes to the Port Augusta region, but $1.5 million will be available for the north&amp;hyphen;western suburbs, some of which are in my electorate, and people there will benefit from that. But it will be held up; those programs will not go ahead. They will not stand a chance. That first round of $10 million will not be available until after this sale legislation is passed. So if Labor, Democrat and Independent senators wish to do something for South Australia and Tasmania, they know what course of action they can take when this legislation reaches the Senate.

          The Senate had a committee inquiry into the matter. It was interesting to note some of the things that were said during that inquiry. Senator Collins, as I have already mentioned, was quoted in regard to what had happened to Australian National when National Rail
          <break page="5568" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           was set up. The colourful Mayor of Port Augusta, Joy Baluch, who stands up for her city, had things to say as well. She could not believe that any senator would be dumb enough—I think those were the words she used—to block the sale. Senator Collins asked her how many senators she knew. Her reply was, `Well, I know you, dear.' So from the city of Port Augusta there were strong words of support. Many letters, faxes and editorials in the media have been written in support of the sale, and many workers want AN sold. From the workshops at Islington, from the workers and unions, who obviously speak to me more frankly and more frequently than they communicate with the Labor Party—that party which is meant to be supporting them—there has been strong support for the sale of Australian National.

          I would have thought that after Labor's record during its 13 years in government they would join us in doing something about this. If the problems are not solved, there will not be a viable industry. Rail is important. As my colleague the member for Grey has told the chamber, rail has a proud history. It helped to open up this country. As I said, I have met workers whose fathers and grandfathers worked on the rail. They must be given a chance. We must look at ways of doing things differently. If there have been failures in the past, there is no point in going on in the same old way and having one failure after another. I call on all parties to get together on this, to do the decent thing and support the sale of Australian National.

          —The history of Liberal and National Party governments in respect of rail services in this country is a very shabby history. If the honourable member for Adelaide wants to refer, as her opening gambit, to losses incurred by AN, let me remind her that when we came to government in 1983 the loss incurred in the previous year by the Australian National Railways Commission—which at that time embraced all of its services, from Kalgoorlie across to Broken Hill and from Alice Springs down to Adelaide and all the country rail services in South Australia—in today's terms was $192 million. The AN which she is now referring to is the remnants left after the main&amp;hyphen;line operations were taken out to be absorbed into the National Rail Corporation.

        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So what we are looking at is the result of the formation of the National Rail Corporation, which was strongly supported by those opposite when in opposition. They cannot have it both ways. If you are going to make comparisons, please make comparisons on a like basis, not a selective basis.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The member for Adelaide referred to the performance of the government railway systems, as did the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) in his second reading speech. He opened with these words:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Australian National's operations, in common with many other government owned railways, are characterised by a large and increasing debt and a declining market share. The performance of rail stands in stark contrast to the road transport sector, which has been very successful in addressing customer needs and therefore increasing its market share.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         That is cynical. It is dishonest. It does not present the picture. Whoever drafted those words knew when they drafted those words that they did not present to this parliament an accurate picture of what constituted AN or the problems with AN—the segments that were left following the formation of the National Rail Corporation. AN's operations were those sectors and those assets that were left. That had been drafted by a person who knew full well that the National Rail Corporation and revenue earning sections which had been taken out and placed into the National Rail
         <break page="5569" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Corporation had been removed. He should not demean all railway people and the performance of the decisions made by this parliament and by the people who manage those organisations.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In the case of AN, certainly the staff at AN, like all other railway people, are proud people. In the railway industry, where there are generations upon generations of people—starting in the last century—working in the rail system, they have good right to be proud. They were the people who developed much of this nation, albeit, they destroyed the horse-drawn transport industry and the river boat industry and, in many ways, the coastal shipping industry. But they were the state&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;art transport system in their time. That generation upon generation of service is a very proud service.

         I have sat in the dust and talked to the people in Port Pirie and in Port Augusta and in Peterborough and in Whyalla on numerous occasions in the past. I very much understand and feel for those people. But what we are seeing in this situation, which is being quite cynically exploited by this government, is that you have people who have had disappointment upon disappointment, who see no future with this government for a publicly owned rail system. They see the sale, getting out and taking a redundancy package, as their only hope of some way out and some way into the future. That has been very carefully exploited by the previous speaker and by this government in the contributions that have been made by the minister.

         If you look back to when Australian National was formed, it followed on from the 1975 legislation and then from National Party ministers from 1975 through to 1983 who were responsible for the administration of the Australian National Railways Commission. Their record was a very shabby record but, if you turn to the role that was played by that rail system, to put things in their proper perspective, you will see the posters of the Trans Australia line advertising their travel. They read something like `Trans Australia—see Australia in comfort', `Save days—travel Trans Australia'. We have gone from that to where it now takes 3&amp;half; days to get to the west

         What is wrong with this legislation? There are two fundamental things wrong with the legislation. The first is the power—were this legislation to pass through the Senate—it would give to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development and the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) to virtually do as they will in respect of assets of the organisation and the formation of the national track authority. The second is there is no national strategy. It is not good transport planning to be considering the formation or disintegration of a rail system to the exclusion of all other forms of transport. There is no better source to go to than the recent report of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee on the Brew report. Their recommendation on page 60 states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee therefore recommends that before proceeding with the sale process, the Government should develop a coherent land transport policy framework, taking into account financial, economic, social and environmental goals and recommending mid and long term investment programs for road and rail in all major corridors.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         That is a current recommendation, avoided completely in this parliament by this government. Let me go to the report from the national transport planning task force of 1994. Recommendation 2, page viii, states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Road, rail, port and airport infrastructure investments and their funding arrangements should be considered within a framework that allows intermodal, network and corridor considerations to be evaluated transparently.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         There is the best report that has been done on transport needs and the establishment of a proper transport strategy in this nation's history. It is current. It is right across the three forms of transport. It is not being picked up in this legislation. There is no regard had to its recommendations or to its content.

         So this is really from this government the blind leading the blind. There is a bit of a stunt. They see an opportunity to exploit. In respect of AN, they have misrepresented the situation to talk about AN's losses and the fabricated figures and the selective use of information by the minister and by those documents that have been circulated, particularly by Brew. Brew had a vested interest, which was what was disclosed, and he is happy to withdraw. His report, in my view, was not a report of integrity, was not a report of impartiality and was not a report designed to present the most accurate position and the position of the best interest of this nation and of this parliament.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When you look at all these things you can see that the government is going for a quick fix here. It is opportunistic. Let us look at it again from the broader view of what is best for Australia and what should be happening in this situation. The national transport planning task force report shows that in 1988&amp;hyphen;89—these are the latest figures which were available—on a weight basis rail carried 23 per cent of the transport task in this country, road 74 per cent and sea three per cent, out of a total task of 1,337 million tonnes of goods or freight transported in that year. But, looking at it on a weight&amp;hyphen;distance basis, rail's share rises from 23 per cent to 32 per cent, road's share drops to 33 per cent—most of road is short haul; it is metropolitan, intra&amp;hyphen;
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          urban, intra&amp;hyphen;region—and sea's share rises from three per cent on a weight basis to 35 per cent on a weight&amp;hyphen;distance or tonne&amp;hyphen;kilometre basis, on a total task of 257 billion net tonne&amp;hyphen;kilometres.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If you look at value it all changes again. Seventy three per cent of the expenditure on transport in the years 1988&amp;hyphen;89 went on road, 19 per cent on rail, six per cent on sea and two per cent on air. That is the analysis of the foundation of transport in this nation. This legislation ought to give us the best set of integrated transport arrangements for this country; it should not just opportunistically pluck out information to deal with the situation on a budgetary basis to the exclusion of what is best for Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other thing that greatly worries me about all this is this government's ideology. We saw this ideology in the minister's second reading speech when he referred to AN's losses by saying:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         To a large extent this situation reflects the fundamental problems arising from government owning and operating businesses that are more efficiently conducted by the private sector.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         That is bunkum. It is total misrepresentation. I am sure it was not written within the department. Those words came straight out of the minister's office. Ownership is not the problem—that is straight ideology; the problem is the nature of the system and the remnants of what was the Australian National Railways Commission and its interstate operations. This government's ideology is to sell it off: whatever it is, sell it. That is the policy of this government. If you can get a buyer, sell it. Based on that ideology, any business that is government owned and operated would be more efficiently conducted by the private sector. Ask some of the Bond shareholders. Ask some of the Alan Bond companies about that bit of ideology. Run through the stock exchange. Ask some of the shareholders in some of the other companies on the stock exchange. Have a look at all ideology about private versus public.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is another thing that concerns me about the nature of the transport task around the world. In the United States—the Mecca of free enterprise—there are two main rail
         <break page="5571" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          operators in the west and two main rail operators in the east. With rail transport there is a growing tendency toward the provision of point&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;point services, door&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;door services. The European Commission is following the same line so that there is an integrated service: transport from one place in one nation to another place in the same nation or from one place in one nation to another place in another nation. A seamless transport system is being provided. It is all linked together. The two largest markets are looking at the integration of rail systems to get economies of scale, efficiencies of management and reliability of service. As I said, efficiency of service and reliability are so important.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In this country rail is being fragmented. It is a mickey mouse system in comparison with the systems in the United States and Europe and it seems this government is determined to make it a minnie mouse system by fragmenting it into smaller and smaller bits. Sure as night follows day, later on there will be a reconsolidation of rail systems in this country. The system will go back to being a larger system, because that is where efficiency and reliability of service come from. I have a great fear about the direction being followed by this government—it is simply ideological.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Turning to what should happening, I have explained my concerns about having a series of micro&amp;hyphen;systems when the world is moving to larger and more efficient systems. But the situation in this country will be further exacerbated because this government has a policy of opening up Australian coastal shipping to foreign shipping. The effect is that the cargoes which are being lost to foreign ships operating between Australian ports are not so much cargoes from Australian flag ships; they are cargoes from the National Rail Corporation. Rail and land transport cargoes are being lost to foreign shipowners and Third World seafarers.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This government does not have a transport strategy. It is operating in isolation on this issue. It is not taking into account other forms of domestic transport or the prospect of integration. The government has another policy which for several years has damaged the Australian railway industry. The target of
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          the Third World seafarers and the foreign shipowners is not so much the Australian coastal shipping scene; the target is to hit the National Rail Corporation.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Mr Deputy Speaker, I know you understand this: effectively, Australian railway workers are being replaced by Third World seafarers. An analysis of the cargoes being carried under single voyage permits has been carried out—288 such permits have already been granted in the first half of 1996 and we are looking at a figure well in excess of 500 for 1996&amp;hyphen;97. The analysis shows that the cargoes that are being carried are essentially cargoes from east to west and that they are containerised break bulk cargoes, not cargoes that are carried by Australian coastal vessels, which are mostly bulk cargoes.

        <para first-indent="16">
         So here is the government's own shipping policy flying in the face of what purports to be its rail policy. That is why I support the amendment that has been put forward by the shadow minister, the member for Melbourne, which says:

        <para font-size="-=2">

         Remember that in Tasmania the rail system is a fundamental part of their land transport system. I will come back to the amendment in a moment, but it underlines the fact that this government does not have a transport strategy. It has something that it wants to do in rail—in this case, in this legislation, that is based on an ideology—and it has something it wants to do, again based on ideology, in shipping, because it hates the membership of the Maritime Union of Australia. It cannot remove its blinkers to see that all of the wiser countries in the Western world are looking to expand their shipping industry because they recognise the value in jobs and financial turnover that comes from all the shore based industries that are associated with your own flag shipping industry.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Hopefully, the legislation will be amended in the Senate to make sure that those people are properly dealt with and that they do get a fair go. The other thing that is of great concern is that, in the event of these powers being passed on to the ministers by this legislation, they will not be accountable to the parliament and they will have a power that I think is unprecedented.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I recommend to members that they look at the report of the national transport planning task force, because it considers what is the best system of transport services for Australia the nation, and it points to the need to improve the efficiency and the linkages between road, rail and sea. It also points out that nothing much has changed. Rail has a natural advantage in about 40 per cent of cargoes; road has a natural advantage in about 40 per cent of cargoes; and there is about 20 per cent that is left to compete in the middle. Overall, we want to see a system that is integrated as a whole.

         One of the comments that I think should be corrected is this notion that this is driven by ideology; he said that we are selling everything. It is interesting that some of the greatest asset sales happened under the previous government—whether it was Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank—having promised the workers of which on numerous occasions that they would not sell—or whether it is the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories.

         The honourable member talks about the reforms on the waterfront. An enormous amount of money was spent on waterfront reforms and today our container rate of shifting is still low. Indeed, the government strategy of a more efficient rail system will lead to greater efficiencies and it will lead to greater tonnage coming off roads onto rail and from ships to rail.

         This package is part of a $2 billion package. The AN sale is the beginning, and it will then move on to National Rail. The problems with AN today have been created by the previous government when they took out most of the valuable freight assets and put them into National Rail. That is why we have a situation today that we have to address.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is interesting that, as previous coalition speakers have mentioned, the unions support the package, the locals support it, the papers support it and the communities support it. Indeed it just highlights that the ALP are very much out of touch.

        <para first-indent="16">
         This $2 billion package comprises: $325 million to the AN restructuring; $50 million to environment work to clean up potential sites; $800 million in retiring debts so that the future buyer of AN—whether it is as a whole or components of it—will be unencumbered; a large proportion, $580 million, to superannuation; and $90 million unfunded, which is very different from what the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) has been saying in this parliament. There is also a further investment of $175 million in track access. The whole purpose is to develop a system that gives greater competition, greater flexibility and long&amp;hyphen;term job security, and gets the

         The facts are that it was the ALP and the member for Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton)—who, I am delighted to say, is in the chamber—who left AN in the trouble it is in at the moment. This sale is concentrating on the assets of AN in South Australia and of course Tasrail. As has been mentioned before, in the Brew report—and, I might add, Brew did not have a vested interest, which aspersion was cast by the member for Shortland—when NR was established, all of the profitable routes were taken out of AN and it was left with unprofitable routes, enormous debt and an uncompetitive passenger service. As even Senator Collins said, it was doomed from the very day the plan was cooked up. He should know, as a senator from the Northern Territory which has been trying to connect that line from Alice Springs to Darwin.

         It is interesting to look back at the history of AN and these crocodile tears that are coming from the opposition and to consider that 7,000 jobs were lost in 13 years under Labor. The financial loss of $150 million in 1995&amp;hyphen;96 would continue if nothing was done. In South Australia, AN has $1 billion worth of debt. Indeed, passenger services have diminished and many lines have been closed—whether to Mt Gambier, Port Augusta, Whyalla or Broken Hill. And of course there is the far less frequent service of the

         Unless we do something now it will be a basket case and there will be no hope for those people in South Australia and regional areas. The sale of AN is an integral part of the future rail reform of Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         At the moment AN has debt of $30,000 per annum per employee. On current forecasts that would move to $220,000 per annum in the next couple of years, if we did nothing. It would be irresponsible of this government not to make the hard decisions that it has made. Even more irresponsible is the opposition's blatant and opportunistic blocking of legislation when even their own workers want it.

         As I mentioned before, if you look back at the history of AN, it was left in this deplorable state because all the valuable assets were ripped out of it and put into NR. And the member for Shortland stands up here and says that NR is a great success. It is carrying less freight today than it was a year ago. If you talk to the private operators who use it, whether it is SCT, TNT or Patrick, they will tell you it has got worse. At the end of next year when the agreement unwinds—let us hope that the New South Wales government, which has been dragging the chain on this, comes to the party—it will be unwound and it will be sold. The deal you put together for National Rail is one in which the Commonwealth has 73 per cent of the equity but only 49 per cent of the voting rights. We never had a chance from day one.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Let us look back at the history of rail. Five states have been rail players. When you go back to Federation, part of the problem is that we had three different networks—the narrow gauge, which is predominantly in Queensland, the standard gauge in New South Wales and WA, and broad gauge in Victoria. As we built the steel highway, this created problems for this country which have been naturally superseded in many areas by road, air or sea freight. The trans&amp;hyphen;Australian railway, which linked Perth to Adelaide and which opened up the west, was completed in 1917. That was one of the carrots that got Western Australia into the federation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It was the Labor government in the 1970s under Whitlam that tried to buy back the rail systems into a Commonwealth system. Only South Australia and Tasmania came to the party. That is why we are trying to sort out that problem now. If all the players had come together, maybe it would have been different.

         AN is the smallest of the rail operations in Australia. It has a track of about 6,151 kilometres capitalised at around $1.5 billion. VLine has 5,670 kilometres of track in Victoria
         <break page="5574" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          and moves a smaller amount of freight. Westrail has 5,411 kilometres of track and is capitalised at $6.2 billion. In New South Wales, the old State Rail Authority, which has now been split up, has 8,000 kilometres of track and is capitalised at $15 billion. The big one is in Queensland—10,000 kilometres of track and capitalised at $26.5 billion—a vertically integrated railway organisation.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This government is trying to build an integrated transport policy, particularly with rail. The beginning of this is the sale of AN so we can get greater competition, greater flexibility, better services, lower costs and a more viable operation that does not cost the taxpayer an enormous amount of money and gives hope to communities, particularly in South Australia and Tasmania.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There were some salient points made by the previous speaker. Out of capital city areas, rail still accounts for 56 per cent of the non&amp;hyphen;urban land freight. It is still the king of freight outside capital cities relative to trucks, which have 44 per cent of land freight. The trucking industry is seamless and reliable. It has about 20,000 operators, which is good for short haul. Like the trucking industry, there has to be greater competition put in for rail, just as has happened overseas in a number of other countries, particularly New Zealand.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the success stories is West Coast Rail, which is now running on a private line in Victoria. They have increased services to Warrnambool and a number of other regional communities. They still have difficulties, particularly the interstate operators who are in a partnership—some of them with National Rail, some of them not. They still have to go through 13 different authorities to move goods from the Port of Fremantle or from Perth through to Adelaide and Melbourne. It is inefficient. To think that the previous speaker was standing up here espousing the efficiencies and the claims of National Rail is quite frightening considering that he was a previous minister for transport in an earlier period of this country's history.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The ALP's position, particularly with One Nation, was that they directed an enormous amount of money, perhaps with the best of reasons, into rail. They built crossing loops.
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          Unfortunately, the crossing loops they built are too small now for the superfreighters coming from Brisbane to Sydney. They did not address the problems of congestion, particularly with freight trains in Sydney, where the rail links all hub into that area. They did do some positive things, I will hand them that. The standard gauge that went from Melbourne through to Adelaide was a positive move. But when they created this beast called National Rail, they saw it as their salvation and it just has not stacked up. This government has to clean that up and build so as to have not only some viable private operators but also a national track access regime, and that is what we are building towards.

         It is interesting to look at the United Kingdom. For 120 years prior to 1948 all the railway systems, which were built after the Industrial Revolution, were actually privately owned, and they worked well. Of course, straight after the war when the Labour Party was put back into office it nationalised them all. That has been the case until recently when it was privatised, and that has worked well. The key elements are safety, reliability, lower cost and frequency of service; and this is where rail has not been able to compete, principally in freight but also in passenger services, in this country.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         New Zealand had a government owned railway until recently. It has been privatised. Transrail, as it is now called, has a large equity holder called Wisconsin, a major US operator, which came into it. The usual fears were voiced, but there has been a 15 per cent increase in passenger numbers. Instead of making enormous losses, Transrail is making good profits. It is actually building more track, expanding its services and more trains are running on time. That is what privatisation has done for rail in New Zealand. Indeed, the same is the case in the United States where most private operators are moving huge amounts of freight, where there are intermodal ports and where there is road and rail access. The system is seamless and it does not matter how it is transported from A to B as long as it gets there on time. That is where they have been successful.

          That is exactly the vision that we want in Australia with rail. That is why the sale of AN is critical. If we do nothing, as has been demonstrated by previous speakers, the losses will accumulate and the services will be cut back even further. AN never had a chance after the main interstate freight assets were taken out of it and transferred to National Rail. It has to be sold. We need to get private operators into those short intrastate lines, those workshops and those icons, the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Ghan
          </emphasis>
          or the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Indian Pacific
          </emphasis>
          . They are losing money hand over fist; a private operator is needed in there who can use the services as a torch to attract not only domestic tourists but also foreign tourists. It will be done with government getting out of it. That is exactly the policy that the previous government was advocating when it privatised Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank and, no doubt, would have done with Telstra if the now Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, had had his way.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          So the vision, from the sale of AN, is to give a private operator access into this area and then to move on with the sale of National Rail to link up all the rail links—it is a bit hard in Queensland because of the different gauges but you can get to Brisbane—and to have private operators running on those lines with equal access for people. We will have a national rail infrastructure entity through which the Commonwealth will still retain control of those main interstate lines and tracks. Even with the sale of AN and the sale of those particular intrastate lines, the Commonwealth will still retain an interest in the actual land that they are built on, and that goes for the state governments as well. That is exactly what the workers want: to be given these opportunities.

          As we look into the future, we will have a viable east-west link where ships will dock in Perth, as they do now—and the member for Shortland was quite deceptive in what he was saying because ships are doing that now: they are coming into those ports like Perth and they want to—and their cargoes sent across the Nullarbor. They want to do it with Brisbane and Acacia Ridge, with the rail line put through to Fisherman's Island. Ships want to
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           dock there, put their cargoes on a train and get them straight through to Brisbane or through to Melbourne, which would be faster than sending a ship around the coast to the Port of Melbourne. Foreign carriers want to do that now. I might add that I got the impression that Australian National Line was held as a shining light in a previous speech today. That has made horrendous losses. It could not be sold.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          So the vision is that there will be intermodal ports that will be seamless; that cargo can come into this country, can get off a ship, can get on to a train, can get to an intermodal port and on to a truck or into those particular locations. The vision is the completion of the line from Alice Springs to Darwin, an integration of the rail infrastructure—which should have been done not just by the previous government but by other governments back through our history—and a viable transport system from north to south and from east to west.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There have been 50 expressions of interest for AN. This is just the beginning. If this is done right—and it should be bipartisan because it is ALP supporters who will be the beneficiaries—there will be new opportunities and new jobs. It is disappointing to hear the shadow minister for transport, the member for Melbourne, say that the only holes that he can put in this legislation concern the way the process has been conducted, not the spirit and the intent of it. I think the shadow minister should take his guide from Tommy the Tank Engine and go back home because he is not making a valuable contribution in this House.

          This is a good package. The government needs the sale of AN. It needs to rebuild, revive and rejuvenate rail not for nostalgic reasons, not for the romance of rail, but to get greater efficiencies, to get cargo off the roads and back on to rail and to get cargo to locations quicker. The way to do that is to sell AN and to give it to private operators. I do not believe, though, that we should have a monopoly situation; we do need to have adequate entrants coming into the market. The next step is track infrastructure and also
          <break page="5576" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

          With all of the pitfalls in this bill, all the bits of half&amp;hyphen;thought&amp;hyphen;out material that the government is peddling, the question has to be asked: what is the government attempting to do? John Howard continues to fiddle around while the Treasurer slashes and burns our national railways. He lets his minister for transport run around at the edges, with no idea of how to develop a coherent plan. But is this just incompetence or is it something more sinister?

          This bill places our fragile regional economy at risk in places like Port Augusta, where workshops and infrastructure facilities are under severe threat of closure. Closure of workshops at Islington will further reduce the already declining heavy engineering industry in Adelaide, not that this appears to worry the government.

          Railways are commonly in public ownership throughout the world and for good reason. For Australia to sell off its railways in the general economic rationalist agenda that this government is running just does not work, and there will be plenty of people out of work as a consequence. This economic rationalist agenda has failed to provide Australia with a coherent national rail policy. In fact, the economic rationalist agenda underlying this bill reduces any capability we may have of the national rail plan that we in this country need for our future.

Why else would John Sharp appoint John Brew, who was proposing to act as a consultant to the Great Southern Railway Corporation, formed by the Macquarie Bank to buy and operate AN business, to conduct an inquiry into AN?

One is that the government develop a coherent policy for the Australian railway industry. What is wrong with the government developing a coherent policy for the rail industry? Clearly, it is something which is well overdue. A lot has been made by members opposite about difficulties in  performance in rail in Australia. It is well known and documented that rail in Australia has been starved of funds. Certainly, a lack of infrastructure development commitment over many decades by Australian governments of successive orders has meant that it is problematic for rail in Australia to compete in perhaps the way that it might like to and in a way that would be in the national interest.

          A government that is seeking to privatise something, if it can muster the argument, needs to be questioned about why it would want to abrogate the parliament's responsibility and regulation for this sector.

In my view, increased urbanisation will continue not only unabated but hell for leather. People will continue to leave regional centres and the bush in general for the cities at a greater rate of knots when jobs disappear. Jobs will disappear when enterprise in regional Australia—business in the bush—goes bust because of the increase in cost of transporting products to cities and, ultimately, overseas.

          —The Australian National Railways Commission Sale Bill 1997 is a very important piece of legislation that the House is debating today. The debate, which I have been listening to this morning, has been wide ranging. I think it is important that we focus on some of the key elements.

         Firstly, the name Australian National belies what it does. Australian National does not operate rail nationally around Australia. The previous speaker, the member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel), said that it services all of regional Australia. It does not. It does not service my part of Australia in the state of New South Wales or Queensland. The previous speaker's comments about the operation of rail in Australia, particularly the subsidies and cross&amp;hyphen;subsidies within the passenger systems, should have been directed to some of his colleagues in the New South Wales government because of the way the rail operation is running in that state.

         The purpose of the bill is to allow the sale of the non-interstate main line track rail assets of Australian National.

          passenger trains. It is interesting to note a bit of the history—what is happening and how the government arrived at the decision to sell Australian National, which has put this bill before the House. The history of government ownership of railways in Australia has seen declining work forces, declining market share and spiralling debts. That is not just a comment limited to this debate and to this particular rail operation. It is across the board. Government ownership has resulted in political intervention in the rail industry to the detriment of its long-term viability. It has allowed government owned rail operations to behave as monopolistic providers of services, inflexible in their practice and unresponsive to the needs of the customer. Again, I note that the state Labor government in New South Wales is grappling with this same problem with its state rail operation and the costs. The rail industry needs 10&amp;hyphen;, 20&amp;hyphen; or 30&amp;hyphen;year planning horizons, and this has not been achieved where short&amp;hyphen;term political ends have dictated investment decisions, rail operations and reform.

         The coalition was elected to government with a commitment to reform not only the rail industry as part of the transport sector but also the overall transport sector. I think the National Commission of Audit identified to the Commonwealth government that reform in the transport sector of the economy could produce a massive improvement in real terms to the GDP of this nation—road, rail, sea and air, all those elements of transport. This government is about reviewing and reforming all those elements of the transport network in Australia.

         The proposition that is before the House today is a result of some of the decisions of the previous government and of the review undertaken—the Brew report to government, particularly about AN. The Labor Party's history of ownership of AN is not very good at all. It is a history of job losses, line closures, lost freight and spiralling debt. The Labor Party told the AN work force that all was well and that they would all have jobs for the future in AN. Yet the Labor Party secretly signed off on hundreds of rail jobs and approved business plans that would see further

As a country, we are getting into the same situation with this particular government business enterprise.

         We have to be realistic. Opposition speakers this morning have spoken about the jobs that are there and the jobs in regional Australia. What this government is trying to do is secure those jobs before they are all gone and beyond redemption—absolutely beyond redemption. Sadly, that is about where ANL is today: beyond redemption. At great taxpayer expense, we had the appointment of special consultants to try to salvage ANL—but it just did not happen.

         The previous government now know that they should have acted sooner—and so they should have. The previous government probably reckon that they did fairly well, considering the different elements of their political party, in getting away with some of the privatisation exercises that they undertook whilst in office. In this and other debates in this place, we have listened to speaker after speaker commenting on track records and speaking with shock&amp;hyphen;horror about the economic rationalist view of privatisation and what it will do and saying that, under the coalition government, it will just be a scorched earth policy of privatisation.

         Yesterday in this chamber during a division, it flashed up to me that it was interesting to note the argy-bargy that occurred between both sides of politics about the division and who should be crossing the floor, who should be sitting wherever and the control being exercised by different political parties in this place. I remembered—as you will remember, Mr Deputy Speaker—the division that took

         However, a division did occur because two members who used to sit here in these seats, the then member for Wills and the then member for North Sydney, called a division to highlight—and particularly the former member for Wills—to the people of Australia the bleeding hearts in the left wing of the Labor party who were all voting to sell the Commonwealth Bank. They were voting to sell the Commonwealth Bank; and they had voted to sell Qantas, they had voted to sell Australian Airlines, they had voted to sell CSL and they had voted to sell our share in the Snowy Mountains scheme and a whole raft of government enterprise businesses.

         Yet it is amazing how short that road to Damascus is and how quick the conversion takes place when flicked back onto the other side of the House. All of a sudden they are anti-privatisation—it is the dogma of the economic rationalists; it has nothing to do with good management. It was all to do with good management when the Labor Party were in government, but it has nothing to do with good management of government business enterprises today. That is the Labor Party that is opposing this bill today.

         The one thing that the coalition has always been consistent about—and this has included 13 years of opposition whilst the Labor Party was running this country, and running a similar agenda as far as the management of government business enterprises was concerned—has been the privatisation of government business enterprises and assets that were not seen as a core responsibility or activity of government. In this, we consistently supported that government then. We had some credibility on this issue in opposition.

As for the members of the left wing of the Labor Party, where were they? They were over there. They did not even go outside of the doors.

What the Brew report did identify was that there was no do nothing option. There was no `do nothing' option, which is being proposed in the amendment that has been put forward by the shadow minister—a do nothing option.

         The truth about Australian National is that it was probably the best run railway in Australia, certainly up until the time that Julian Grill became the Minister for Transport in Western Australia and reformed the Western Australian railways, which would now arguably be the most efficient railway system in Australia.

         The Chairman of Australian National was a Don Williams, who was a brilliant, dynamic engineer. He had visions for rail transport across Australia and he wanted Australian National to take over that rail transport. But apart from being a brilliant engineer, Don Williams was also a bit on the arrogant side and certainly did not tolerate fools gladly. It was for this reason that he was totally unacceptable to the railway system of Victoria, which was hopeless, and New South Wales, which, while being very large, was also moribund.

         It was quite clear that those states were never going to countenance an amalgamation or a takeover by Australian National, so the government of the day was forced into another alternative and set up the National Rail Corporation. The problem was that, having set up the National Rail Corporation, it then took from Australian National a lot of its equipment and all of its business, leaving Australian National with all its debts. Australian National had no way of servicing its commitments and it had no option other than to go broke and become a big burden on the Australian taxpayer.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It must be made very clear that the failure of Australian National had nothing to do with the workers. The workers of Australian National were, in my view, long&amp;hyphen;suffering and

         There are no job guarantees, contrary to what the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), who spoke before me, said. The act says that all staff will be made redundant and must reapply for their jobs with whoever purchases Australian National, or parts of Australian National. I believe it will be sold in parts because I cannot see anyone wanting to take up the whole lot. But still, it is a much better option than no jobs at all, which is the only other option I can see.

        <para first-indent="16">
         You simply cannot maintain a permanent way unless you have rolling stock. Right now, service development is being impeded on the trans line because Australian National do not have the wherewithal to carry their requirements for maintenance.

         This could be done if they were to use the services offered by Aries Engineering in Perth, who have developed a high rail system where they use a truck—in this case, a Kenworth truck—which can move on and off the rail in two minutes and is capable of hauling up to 1,000 tonnes. It recently did shunt tests in Kalgoorlie where it successfully shunted very large loads.

        <para first-indent="16">
         This system would be ideal for Australian National, and they want it. They have their rest centres set in place along the trans line and they could use this assembly in the same way that they used their sugar train in the past, which was called `the bomber going the other way'—a slow goods train used for stopping at the various sidings to service those sidings and to also carry the equipment needed for maintenance.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I would urge the minister to not listen to the vested interests that want to keep this at a distance and would encourage Australian National to acquire this equipment available from Aries Engineering in Perth. There is one problem at the moment. To test this equipment, the company is required by some law to have $100 million of public indemnity insurance and a second policy of $20 million which appears to me to be for the same thing. This might be all right to impose on a rail system hauling large trains continually but, for someone running test operations, it is obviously a nonsense. It is a fiction which could easily be overcome if they agreed to have this operating under the existing insurance of Australian National or if they were to apply the same sort of insurance that this assembly would need to have it worked on the roads, where the risk is much greater. To have that in there is either incompetence on the part of the bureaucracy or a clear attempt by the bureaucracy to stop this very worthwhile development happening.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Apart from enabling access to the permanent way for maintenance purposes, there is also a local service commitment. I was involved in the opening up of the Nullarbor for pastoral industry—the last great pastoral development that will ever take place in Australia. When those stations were started, there was a clear guarantee that they would be serviced by Australian National.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Subsequent decisions, taken mainly at government level, made it simply uneconomical for Australian National to want to service the intrastate positions. If Australian National were to reinstate this truck&amp;hyphen;powered tea and sugar train or bomber train, it would also be able to service those sidings once more. I looked at the figures recently. On the Nullarbor, where pastoralists have an urgent need to de&amp;hyphen;stock some of their properties which have excess stock, it is simply uneconomical at the moment to ship them to the only market, in Peterborough in South Australia. This could be accomplished by a vehicle powered by the Aries concept much more efficiently and cheaply than the railways could possibly do it in their present set&amp;hyphen;up. It would serve a very useful purpose in terms of land care on

         <para first-indent="16">
          Another matter that concerns me is this: we are told that Australian National will be the custodian of the permanent way and people will be allowed access to the permanent way. I think this is a good idea. But what we see happening already—and I cannot get answers from the minister's office—is that people are saying, `Yes, we want to use the permanent way for haulage.' One company in Kalgoorlie wishes to haul limestone into Kalgoorlie for the mining industry. Some of this would be made into lime and some would simply be crushed and used as an alkaline reagent in some of the processes. The company has already put in an order for railway equipment. It has already put in an order for a loco which it is seeking to buy from a state rail system. It is being hampered in getting access to the railway system. I suspect this is because of vested interests. If it is not, the only other explanation can be bureaucratic obfuscation.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I believe the minister has an absolute responsibility to consider this application now and let these people get on with what looks to me to be a very viable and worthwhile operation—an operation which will cost the government nothing. They will pay for access to the railway. That access must involve reasonable fees. It certainly must be no more than the large companies pay. But it will help to support the gold industry, which is very important to Australia. It will help to support employment and it will help to keep the railways viable. I simply need to know why it is not happening.

          Another thing that must be done immediately is that we must stop the destruction of existing carriages. I know there are tenders now being put out for the acquisition of stock carrying carriages which were probably destined to be scrapped. I believe this must be stopped until we assess the need for these carriages. Refurbishment would obviously be a much better option than building new equipment. It would be scandalous if we allowed these carriages to be scrapped by any railway system in Australia until there was a clear
          <break page="5586" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           understanding of the need for this equipment. So many times in the past we have scrapped perfectly good equipment and then put out tenders to buy new stuff. I certainly hope that does not happen on this occasion.

          Australian National is very important to Australia. It links east and west. It is the link that is capable of taking traffic off the Great Eastern Highway. The Great Eastern Highway, from Kalgoorlie to Perth, is already overcrowded. We now have B&amp;hyphen;doubles and road trains operating beyond Northam. I believe there will be a serious accident there. I have driven along that road and I felt intimidated by some of these convoys of vehicles. It is much better to have them on the rail. It is also much safer.

         <para first-indent="16">
          We must look at railways. The government says it has an absolute commitment to rail. Rail is triumphant over long distances, particularly on flat terrain. That is the nature of Australia. Australia, more than any other country, is made for rail. I refer particularly to east&amp;hyphen;west routes. It must be remembered that east&amp;hyphen;west rail routes in Australia have generally been profitable. The massive losses have been on north&amp;hyphen;south routes. The reason is that for the last 70 years governments have not bothered to keep up the infrastructure on those lines.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We hear from the government how efficient road transport is compared with rail transport. Road transport has a clear advantage because the government charges an excise on fuel. It charges that partly for the construction of roads, so heavy trucks using roads get some benefit from the excise. All the reports have shown that it is large trucks that do the damage to bitumen roads, not motor cars. So the motorists subsidise the trucking industry on the road; the truck industry gets a benefit from the excise, some of which does go into roads. But railways pay that excise, too, and railways do not get anything like the benefit. The railway has to pay for every centimetre of its permanent way; it has to pay the full cost. Quite clearly, this needs to be looked at if we are going to have a truly level playing field.

          It is unfortunate that this legislation needed to be brought before the House. However,
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           quite clearly, it was needed. I say to the minister that there must be some competition. I believe Australian National could provide that competition with the National Rail Corporation. I believe Australian National can provide the intrastate services to which the government should have an absolute commitment. I believe it has a duty to provide those services.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Passenger trains could expand their services enormously if there were some intelligent promotion of tourism. Passenger trains would benefit from having two classes of travel—first&amp;hyphen;class, which would be very good, and the price would need to go up, and a real steerage class which could provide competitive rates for backpackers to cross Australia. In my view, that class of travel would need to be quite basic in order to keep the cost down.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In conclusion, I do urge the minister's office to take heed of what I have said. There are enormous achievements and developments that can take place. They will not take place if it is left to rail, because rail is totally stultified at the moment. They are frightened to do anything. The people of Australian National have actually told me that. They simply dare not make decisions.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I think the minister's office has to show that leadership, give access to people who will not access the permanent way and certainly amend the legislation to allow Australian National to keep some locomotive power of its own so that it can be self-sufficient in providing for the maintenance of the permanent way. After all, if that job is not kept up or it is forced into using expensive contract services, it will not be long before we are back in this House bemoaning once more the problems of Australian National and seeking even more privatisation.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I believe that for railways like this the permanent way should at least be in the hands of the government, and I think the maintenance of it is obviously better provided for in the main by employees employed by Australian National rather than contract teams.

         It is very interesting that in the AN annual report of 1995-96 there is a deliberate act by the Labor government to defer all of this to post-March 1996, post the election.

         As a representative of a federal electorate my responsibility is to the people of that electorate. It is well known that the seat of Grey has been a Labor seat for many decades, up until 1993. The city of Port Augusta was known as a traditional Labor city. When I was first elected, I did not receive a particular swing in that city, and I would not have expected to. The traditional party lines were drawn, and it is much the status quo. But, as I became familiar with my role as a representative, I became far too familiar with the neglect of rail by the Labor Party. I could not believe that something could have been left to stagnate in the way that Australian National was. Brew makes the comment that `the decisions that Labor made with the Australian National Railway and the National Rail Corporation meant, in effect, death by a thousand cuts' for Australian National.

         The coalition government, confronted with those realities, had no choice but to act. In November 1996 it introduced a $2 billion package to revive the rail industry in Australia. That package, as has been said by previous speakers, comprises: redundancies, $112 million; superannuation, $580 million; outstanding contracts and liabilities, $125.7 million; assumption of the AN debt, $779.4 million; regional systems package, $50 million; environment clean&amp;hyphen;up, $50 million; establishment of the National Track Authority, $161 million; AN subsidy, $30 million; unfunded provisions, leave and workers comp, $90 million; and other costs—that is, managing the sale—$8 million. The business of cleaning up after Labor and putting rail onto a new path was no easy matter.

          —It is somewhat ironic that we are discussing the Australian National Railways Commission Sale Bill here today because 142 years ago in September 1855 the first rail journey occurred in Australia between Sydney and Parramatta. The railway was then owned by the government. It was only because the private consortium called the Sydney Railway Co. had gone bankrupt that the government had to step in and take it over. Today we are debating doing the reverse because the government has gone bankrupt. We are going to hand it back to private enterprise.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill provides a flexible framework to sell all of Australian National's assets, except the interstate main line track. AN, as previous speakers have said, operates the interstate rail passenger services as well as the South Australian freight within South Australia and Tasrail freight within Tasmania. National Rail, which handles the interstate freight, commenced operations in February 1993. It was hived off by the previous government, which set up AN as it exists today to fail.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But we are going to hand AN over to a new rail operator completely free of debt. It is interesting to look at the Brew report that was set up by the present Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) after we came to government. The present minister has done a magnificent job in this area. The Brew report revealed that a scandal had taken place in this country that had been covered

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The story of AN is a history of mismanagement by the previous minister, as he has mismanaged the aviation industry in this country in the past and also ANL, our shipping line. We have had to start to sort out those areas as well. It just goes to show that the previous government could not handle money and could not run a business.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Department of Transport and Regional Development had advised the previous minister in 1992 and 1995 to do something and he did nothing. On coming to government we were landed with debts in excess of $1,000 million—an outrageous situation! He told us that for the last year—that is, 1995-96—AN would lose probably $25 million. What did we find when the figures came in? Debt for that year alone of about $250 million. This is for an organisation that runs only three trains for heaven's sake—the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Brew report showed that the average debt per employee was about $30,000 per year. If things were left running as they were, that debt would have amounted to about $220,000 per employee by the year 2000—incredible! Already the accumulated losses per employee is of the order of $415,000.

         The workshops were overstaffed by about tenfold. We have 500 people in some workshops with work for only 50. They had 230 carriages when they needed about 140.

Today it is about a third of that, about 3,500 people.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is a shocking situation all round. We have a declining work force, a declining market share and spiralling debt. If we go back a few years to 1971-72 and look at the figures for market share, the Sydney&amp;hyphen;Melbourne run had 48 per cent of the freight. Today it is about 22 per cent.

          On top of all that we have had a series of inappropriate government interventions which led to decisions being taken for short-term political ends rather than a long-term vision.

          The solution to all that is to get the government out of both the passenger side as well as the freight side, which will come later, and get private enterprise in.

          In those other areas, private operators have taken over moribund rail operations, reopened old lines and constructed new lines. Freight tonnages are up. There has been a focus on customer service and new jobs have been created. It has been done in New Zealand and it has been done elsewhere and we are going to do it in Australia.

          The previous government was in power for 13 years. In that time 7,000 jobs went and it created a $1 billion debt. There was no way to service the debt. Also, 50 per cent of the South Australian rail network was ripped up or closed down. It closed quite a number of passenger rail services. One of them ran in my electorate between Adelaide and Broken Hill. The

           We found when we took over AN that it was a bit like the Labor Party after 13 years: bankrupt and moribund—an incredible legacy. We have decided to pay off the debt, to bring in private enterprise, to create a single entity to control and manage access in a non-discriminatory way to the line and virtually to operate interstate passenger and, later on, freight services similar to the way the roads are run now.

We have had to find a total of over $1,900 million over and above the black hole figure that was in the budget to get the federal rail system in this country up and in a respectable state to be handed over.

           If we can get private operators involved, it will be the lifeblood of the rail system in this country—particularly AN, which we are debating here today.

           If private operators come in, we will see a surge of confidence in rail. We are already seeing it to some extent in freight now. We have got SCT and TNT operating between Melbourne and Perth. We have got Patrick who have not long started up between Melbourne and Adelaide. Only the other day I had the great privilege and honour of opening facilities of the FCL organisation, who are going to operate freight services between Parkes and Perth. On that line between Sydney and Parkes and Broken Hill and Crystal Brook, north of Adelaide, through to Perth, the closest point to Sydney where you can double&amp;hyphen;stack containers—because of tunnels and bridges, et cetera—is Parkes. FCL have come in there on the conjunction of the east&amp;hyphen;west rail line and the north&amp;hyphen;south road line—the Newell Highway between Brisbane and Melbourne. It is an ideal point to start this operation. They are going to double&amp;hyphen;stack containers—containers up to 48 feet long. We saw the first loaded to go to Perth.

           That will be a service running five days a week over and back. You put a container on the rail in Parkes and 60 hours later it is being unloaded in Perth. I pay tribute to the managing director of FCL, Bill Gibbins, who started that company in 1974. He borrowed about $3,000 from the State Bank of Victoria and I think he was one of the few who paid his debt back! FCL has grown into one of the biggest container freight services today. It is a great tribute to the traditional history of some very colourful transport operators that we have had in this country.

            see that it is being used in this manner. The thing that tipped the success in favour of FCL using this operation was that they finally won the Email contract to shift whitegoods.

           I might add that the Newell Highway, which cuts north&amp;hyphen;south through Parkes, is 1,682 kilometres in length between Brisbane and Melbourne. In the future I think we will see a lot of containers coming down by road into Parkes to be loaded on rail to go west to Perth. There is tremendous potential there. We have only had 600&amp;hyphen;metre length trains in New South Wales in the past. They are stepping up in length now. A 900&amp;hyphen;metre train is equivalent to 45 semitrailers or 24 B&amp;hyphen;doubles and 1,500&amp;hyphen;metre freight trains are equivalent to 75 semitrailers or 40 B&amp;hyphen;doubles.

          —It is a pleasure to be able to sum up today the debate on the Australian National Railways Commission Sale Bill. I thank all members who have participated and I will refer to them during my speech. I think it is probably fair to say that, in the last two hours, we have seen the candle of political convalescence snuffed out. A new Labor has flickered and, indeed, failed, and it is quite obvious that the Labor Party simply has not learnt the lessons of March 1996. They are not listening and they have their heads absolutely buried in the ground.
         </para>

        <para first-indent="16">
         I would like to thank, in particular, the members for Adelaide (Ms Worth) and Grey (Mr Wakelin), who are actively involved in this matter. The member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) has just spoken and I thank him for his contribution.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          But I just want to go through some of the contributions from the other side and I will talk about the shadow minister shortly. I want to speak about the member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel). On what authority the member for Fraser is talking about matters in
          <break page="5594" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           the regions is absolutely beyond me, but I suppose we should not be surprised given that, after the Canberra by&amp;hyphen;election, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said that this is a clear message from regional Australia. You might be interested to know that the Electoral Commission actually describes the electorate of Fraser as being inner metropolitan. These are the Labor Party regional members talking about it when they are coming from seats that are described as being inner metropolitan. That is utter hypocrisy.

         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I thought the other interesting comment from the member for Fraser concerned the need for a rail vision—for a rail policy. This government has been in power now for some 14 or 15 months. We, indeed, have a rail policy; it is in this legislation. I do not know where the member for Fraser was over the past 13 years of his government, but they had no policy. That is why we are in this diabolical mess that we are now in which is affecting a very special group of Australians—the workers involved in AN; the workers who were, effectively, over 13 years, tossed onto the scrap heap by this government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We then heard from the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), who is probably better known as the cabotage kid. How you can get that into a speech about rail is absolutely beyond me, but I suppose I should not be surprised because I am sure he goes to bed muttering `cabotage' before he goes off to sleep. He talked about the US rail system and what was being done, and how successful it was. The US rail system is now predominantly run by the private sector. They have turned around a moribund rail system and made it successful, and that is exactly what this legislation is designed to do—to turn around a moribund situation. I am glad that he raised it, but he should hang his head in shame for not getting his facts right about who was doing what and where. I suppose you could say that there are none so blind as those who will not see.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I would now like to turn to the shadow minister, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). In the 7&amp;half; years I have been here I have never heard, and I very
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          much doubt whether other members who have been here for longer would have heard, a speech about a matter of such importance in this country which lacked so much passion. The member for Melbourne simply did not have his heart in this debate. I rather suspect that that is because the troglodyte quads have got to him—Beazley, Evans, Crean and Ferguson; the ones who have destroyed the young braves—and he is very much in that category. He put his head up with something which he thought was appropriate for new Labor and they knocked him down. They knocked him down with great passion. Of course, when you have a Leader of the Opposition who is intent on muzzling young MPs and knocking on the head those who pretend to have a bit of vision, you can see why this flame has flickered and gone out.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The alternative is that the member for Melbourne did not believe the things he put in his paper, `Populism and rationalism'. If he did not, he should say so; if he did, then the troglodyte quads should apologise to someone who is trying to do something constructive.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The most disappointing aspect of the speech from the member for Melbourne was his lack of vision about the rail sector and his blatant attempt to blame every single person involved in this except the ones who are truly guilty—the party that he represents. I will talk only about that today because that was all that the member for Melbourne wanted to do—apportion blame to everyone else. The classic was to attack the author of the report, Mr Brew himself. In my view, that was a disgraceful attack. It was a grubby attack on someone who did no more than tell the facts of life about what the former government had done in relation to AN.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I will just go through the Brew report again, Mr Deputy Speaker, because I think the House should be aware of it. I know other members have made some reference to it. Seven thousand rail jobs were lost in 13 years. Fifty per cent of the South Australian rail network was closed and ripped up. There was a $1 billion dollar debt—a one thousand million dollar debt—with absolutely no way of servicing it. Passenger rail services to Mt Gambier, Burra, Peterborough, Port Augusta,
         <break page="5595" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Whyalla and Broken Hill were all closed. In South Australia alone 16 lines—1,300 kilometres of track—were ripped up.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Brew report went on to talk about the level of liability and the subsidy by the Australian taxpayer which currently stands at about $30,000 per annum but which would increase to about $220,000 if nothing was done. Business levels were decreasing and there was no way known that AN could cover its costs; it was technically bankrupt. The report also revealed a very interesting fact: that it was the way that the Labor Party had set up NR that caused AN's problems. NR was given all the best assets and the revenue generating infrastructure; AN was left with the debt and no possible way of repaying it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Someone was quoted as saying that AN was doomed from the day NR began. Was that the minister for transport? Was it me? Was it John Brew? Was it one of the AN rail workers? Was it? Do you want to know who it was? It was, in fact, Senator Collins. Senator Collins is reported as saying in the Senate References Committee hearings in Adelaide and Port Augusta that AN was doomed the day NR began.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We have announced a $2 billion reform program to fix the problem. That is just part of our rail policy. A part of any policy must be to fix the problems before you head into the future. Ah, the shadow minister has arrived.

I cannot believe that they have got their heads so badly buried in the sand that they can put themselves so far out on a limb from everyone else. They have put themselves out on a limb from industry, from AN workers, from users, from the South Australian Farmers Federation and the list goes on—you name them, I have got pages of messages from them.

          I do not for one minute think that the member for Melbourne is not concerned about families, but he needs to be acutely aware that, by being rolled on this issue by the troglodyte quads, he has left the very people that he should be supporting in an incredible lurch. It is those people—not the multimillion dollar industry people, not those with vested interests—the workers themselves, who have pleaded with him to do something about it and let the sale go on.

I think it is interesting to refer to an interview from Radio 5CK; it is Lou Hendriks interviewing Len Scharenberg from the AWU—not industry, the AWU, the representative of the workers.

I did not think you would want me to speak about this, but if you want me to, I am happy to. The shadow minister very generously conceded that it was indicated to him in advance that the majority of the workers were of the view that the sale should now proceed. But he went on to say:

           Obviously Port Augusta is only one work site out of a substantial number of AN work sites, so there are differing views amongst workers across the network.

           There certainly weren't differing views at Islington. They certainly have not been differing views at Port Pirie and across the board. So I am interested to hear from him where he thinks these differing views are. The only difference of view in this—about the workers towards the Labor Party—is whether they are really bad or absolutely appalling. That is the only difference in view between the workers in AN.

He is bragging about visiting all these work sites, but he seems to have come out with a totally different message. I have another quote:

           It is disappointing that there was no acknowledgment at all from the shadow minister today about some of the other matters in his amendment with regard to what the future holds. He is acutely aware of the fact that not only did his party not have a policy, not only did they rip 7,000 jobs out of this, not only were they responsible for the demise of AN,  but also they still do not have a vision for rail. It was the most incredible 28&amp;hyphen;odd minutes of excuses. The workers in AN, who were bitterly disappointed with the Labor Party at the start of this process, will be bitterly disappointed with the Labor Party at the end of it.

         These amendments relate to one particular issue, and that is the future track authority that is proposed by this government, which was also proposed by the previous government. The net effect of this legislation before the parliament today is to allow the government to constitute that track authority to make decisions with respect to its operations, its functions, its activities and how it will be financed without any further reference to the parliament. This, in effect, means that a major Commonwealth statutory authority will be established with a new set of functions without any reference to this parliament. The purpose of these amendments is to extract from the legislation the specific references in the legislation that would enable this to occur.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Going through the amendments item by item you will see that, in effect, what they do is take out any power with respect to the two ministers named in the legislation to take action either to amend legislation or repeal it insomuch as that may refer to the prospective track authority or any dealings whatsoever in the interstate mainline track assets of Australian National.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I indicated earlier, the opposition believes it is outrageous that the government has come to the parliament with a piece of legislation on such a major issue that simply states that the two ministers concerned, the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Finance, shall, in effect, have complete power to make all decisions with respect to dealing with that organisation, including the power to declare acts of this parliament repealed or amended. It is particularly outrageous that the legislation, as it currently stands, applies to the prospective track authority, the plans for which were put in place by the former government and have been continued by this

         If the government can manage to get itself organised enough to proceed with the future track authority at some future time—hopefully sooner rather than later, and we have seen a fair bit of delay already with the negotiations with the states seeming to have stalled—these amendments will guarantee that this parliament will be able to scrutinise the legislation and will be able to ensure that the very important issues dealing with the future of rail track infrastructure in this country will be dealt with by the parliament, including the Senate and, prospectively, any legislative committee reference in the Senate.

This will be a uniform set of arrangements for all young people. It involves the amalgamation of payments.

        <para first-indent="16">
         This is a matter that has been long called for by a large number of welfare organisations, and I welcome particularly the support of the Brotherhood of St Laurence, who today have said: `We have been asking for better support for this group of young people for many years and finally their needs are starting to be recognised.' They make the further point: `Homeless young people are often forced to drop out of school or training simply because financial pressures are too great. Sixteen&amp;hyphen; and 17&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds who come to our services have to meet the same costs as other young people living independently and the extra $12 a week are much needed.'
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That change, the amalgamation of payments, is something that has been long supported and sought. It was a matter that the former government decided not to address. I do not know the reasons for that. The change will mean that the majority of young people will be unaffected as a result of the change and 137,000 will be better off. The changes remove the disincentive to study which saw the dollars of the unemployed—

This is not about putting the unemployed down; it is about bringing students up. It is designed to encourage the maximum skills possible. The fact is that young people were three times more likely to be unemployed if they left school at the year 10 level than if they left at year 12. So this is about keeping them in education. It is about giving them vocational

It is important for those in rural areas because very often they have to travel away from home to study. It will be very important in assisting them. These are changes that are substantially beneficial to young people and are recognised as such. That is why the Brotherhood of St Laurence, amongst others, is applauding the government for being prepared to undertake these changes.

We are providing 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships next financial year. There are other alternatives there.

         This year there will be an additional 55,000 places in TAFE as a result of the government's policies, and 43,000 of these places will be funded through the Commonwealth.

         How different is this from the short&amp;hyphen;term training programs through which the Labor Party attempted to recycle young people and the program of support for young people on the dole which actually encouraged them to leave school and to stay out of education and training because the financial incentives were all the other way. This government is committed to giving young Australians a positive future. The incentives are being put in place by the common youth allowance, and the reforms we are making to the apprenticeship and training system and to vocational education in schools will provide opportunities which they were denied under the previous government.

Last year we increased the amount to go towards new technology for the Customs Service by some $27 million over three years. That money will go towards purchasing extra equipment such as backscatter X&amp;hyphen;ray and CCTV to enhance Customs role in the war against drugs. Some of the benefits of that new equipment are already feeding through. The member may well be aware that recently a substantial seizure of heroin with a street value of up to $100 million resulted from this new technology.

         There is a combined effort between the enforcement agencies in this area and the commitment that we are giving to the Customs Service. This year's budget also contained measures to increase the Customs marine fleet. That will increase the number of vessels from six to eight and increase the fleet size from 20 metres, which was designed in the days when Customs had control to a 12 nautical mile limit. Customs now operate to the 200 nautical mile EEZ. The new fleet, when it comes on stream, will give Customs the ability to respond with larger and more appropriate vessels that can stay at sea longer.

         The new Coastwatch contract increased the capacity of flight surveillance last year by 190 per cent. We are not taking for granted our commitment in the war against drugs. I note the member's long held interest in this particular area. With the new equipment, Customs, together with the other enforcement agencies, has been very successful to date in trying to stop drugs coming into this country. To date this year, seizures of compressed cannabis amount to some 25 tonnes; cocaine, 66 kilograms; and heroin, 152 kilograms.

As the Acting Prime Minister has already indicated, this government's policies in relation to apprenticeships and traineeships in relation to the Green Corps have been very pro young Australians.

         I want to place this in another economic context. It is this: nothing could be more anti the young people of Australia than the policy of deficit and debt of the Labor Party. The policy of deficit and debt of the Labor Party was a selfish policy. What it essentially said is that the Labor Party would use funds it did not have today to try to buy votes and send the bill to the young Australians of tomorrow. It is the policy of this government to rescue the young Australians of tomorrow from that crushing burden of Labor Party debt.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In five years from 1990, the Labor Party ran up cumulative deficits of $58 billion for a cumulative loss of 50,000 jobs—a cumulative loss of 50,000 jobs over five years on nearly $60 billion of borrowed money. That borrowed money did not just go away. That borrowed money has to be serviced year in year out by the Australians of today and the Australians of tomorrow who will be paying taxes to fund what Mr Beazley, the finance minister who presided over that economic melee, did. As a result of his failure as a finance minister, generations of young Australians are going to be servicing the debts that the Keating Labor Party and the now Labor opposition have visited on them.

         It is the policy of this government, first of all, to get the government living within its means and in the course of the next financial year not to borrow but to repay Commonwealth debt. For the first time in a decade the burden on future generations will be lessened in the forthcoming financial year, as opposed to the Labor Party policy. These are the government's efforts: firstly, to balance the Australian accounts; secondly, to reduce

         Make no mistake: the Labor policy of deficit, debt and high interest rates was an anti-youth policy. It was condemning future generations to a crushing burden of debt and taxation from which they would not have escaped had it not been this government's determination to turn it around. I suppose having created the problem the Labor opposition then sat around and took every step they could to try to prevent the solution to the problem. They came in here. They voted against measure after measure. They were determined to inflict a continuing deficit and debt misery on future Australians. The best that can be said is that they were unsuccessful in their efforts. The Australian economy is back on track. The fiscal accounts will be balanced. Debt will be repaid and young people will be the great beneficiaries of that economic program.

Those young people, if there is education or training available to them, will not receive the dole because the incentive is that they must go back and get the skills they need to get them jobs. If they are not receiving a full allowance or benefit on youth allowance when they have left school, they are not eligible for work for the dole. They do have the opportunity to access the jobsearch assistance that is provided by the government. All young people have that opportunity.

         If they are unable to access education or training because of exceptional circumstances, such as sickness or homelessness, or if there are traumatic job circumstances or if there is no education or training available, they will be able to access the youth allowance but they will be required to undertake activity under an activity agreement.

          —I thank the honourable member for Herbert, who has a real interest in this matter, for his question. He is a constant battler in his quest for a better performance for Australia's meat industry and its exports. I am very pleased to be able to announce that after detailed negotiations with their Chinese counterparts the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service officers in this country have successfully concluded a very important agreement on health conditions for the export of slaughter cattle to China. It is the beginnings of what I think will develop
          <break page="5607" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           into a potentially very, very significant export trade. It effectively opens the door for large numbers of our cattle to enter the Chinese market. It should result in a major boost to trade.

         I am advised that the Chinese plan is to import 60,000 head each year for the first three years of the agreement, after which an expansion to 100,000 head per year is likely. This represents a deal worth potentially hundreds of millions of dollars. Hard&amp;hyphen;pressed beef producers from the southern areas of Australia will particularly benefit, but right across the nation there will be increased support for prices in a sector that at the moment is experiencing real difficulties. As trade builds, it will reinforce Chinese confidence in Australia's health status, potentially open direct opportunities for live cattle exports to other geographical areas as well and is, in general terms, very good news for rural Australia.

         Last night, we signed a memorandum of understanding with China over anthrax designed to avoid disruption to trade in the event of disease outbreaks here. This is very important indeed. People have to have security in our capacity to handle these things. Both agreements demonstrate the government's commitment to opening Asian markets to Australian agricultural products and keeping them open, having opened them in the first place under the Prime Minister's supermarket to Asia plan and reinforced, if I may say so, very ably and in a very committed way not only by the Minister for Trade but also by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

         The point should also be made that these exports are absolutely essential for jobs, especially where we really need jobs and that is out in the regions where unemployment has been very high. The point can also be usefully made that we could, with perhaps just one out of three or four of our farmers, produce enough food or fibre for our domestic markets. All the other farm sectors and industries and the employment in those industries that support the farm sector depend upon export markets for their livelihoods, for their jobs. So the opportunities of the sort that I have just outlined give us a real chance not only to
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          preserve jobs but also to create new jobs in rural and regional Australia, especially for young people, given the very high levels of unemployment amongst young Australians we inherited from the previous administration.

           income tax system. It is true that the Australian taxation system does not equitably share the burden between the various bases that are used to collect tax in Australia. In Australia, by international standards, the indirect tax base is a narrow base and is a declining base. Conversely, the income tax base has borne more than its fair share in relation to the raising of revenue in Australia. Australia's top marginal tax rate of 47 per cent cuts in at about 1&amp;half; times average earnings. The second top marginal tax rate of 43 per cent is also very high and cuts in at a little over average earnings itself. They are the marginal tax rates—notwithstanding the relief given by the coalition to families under the family tax initiative, which of course was vigorously opposed by the Australian Labor Party.

That means that, whilst Australia's top marginal tax rates are quite high by international standards, they cut in at very low multiples of average earnings. Part of the reason is that our indirect tax base is a declining tax base. The Australian indirect tax base is principally focused on goods. In modern economies it is the services sector of those economies that is growing the fastest and taking an increasing share of gross domestic product.

          —The honourable member for Bradfield asked me about those sections of the community carrying the heaviest taxation burden. One of the reasons why the PAYE taxpayer carries such a heavy burden of income tax has been the number of avenues that have been open for high income earners to avoid their fair share. That is one of the reasons why the PAYE taxpayer carries such a heavy burden.

         What were the chief mechanisms for high income earners to avoid their fair share of income taxation? R&amp;D syndicates were a ripper. They made paying income tax quite voluntary. The superannuation surcharge for somebody over $85,000 gave you a 33 per cent tax concession if your salary was sacrificed—and the Labor Party opposed reducing the tax concessionality; the Labor Party opposed it.

         As I said before, Mr Speaker, if you are looking at improving the Australian taxation system, of course it is important to widen the indirect tax base. But it is also important to make sure that the income tax base is wide and is not easily avoidable. That is very much a part of this government's approach to taxation. The only regret we have is that, when we do do it, we cannot rely on the Australian Labor Party for any help whatsoever.

         The vote is not compulsory because, unlike parliamentary elections, it is not about determining governments, and the ballot will not confer any obligations nor any particular powers.

         In developing the system, the government set out to design an election process which was fair and convenient and, importantly, cost effective.

         The system will be similar to the Senate process inasmuch as people will be able to vote above the line for the particular groups or the groups of independents or below the line if they want to go through the full preferential system. Quite frankly, contrary to the assertions of the ALP, the election is going to be open and accessible to all electors regardless of their background and experience. The government remains firmly committed to a voluntary vote for the election of half the delegates to this convention. We want all Australians to vote. We will encourage them to do so, but we are not going to force them to participate.

        There is no more important function performed by this chamber than that it holds ministers accountable. That is absolutely the central feature of this question time process.

That is what the question was about. It dealt with the minister's position as far as his business involvements were concerned in relation to those three shopping centres which he has manifestly—and I would say, too, in breach of the standing orders and the requirements of this place—refused to place or failed to place in his register of interests.

        How can it possibly not be relevant for the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, who is conducting an inquiry into the situation of people with franchises, the situation of people in tenancies and the possibilities of oppressive conduct? He has answered an array of questions in this House; he has referred those matters to a parliamentary committee; he has had a report on those matters and is handling those matters for the government. And, I might say, he responded earlier on to a question about conduct in relation to franchisees.

That is a prohibition not simply against a minister's role as a minister and what his business interests might be.

But in this instance it does go, so it is doubly culpable of the minister that he should confront this issue and that he should be capable of being questioned about it.

         These are issues that ministers have to confront continually. Sometimes the appropriate response of a minister is to absent himself from cabinet if there is a clash, and a clash that is not likely to be regular. Sometimes there is a necessity to hand the responsibility for a particular portfolio's conduct over to another minister on a narrow area of that minister's position. But sometimes it is necessary for a minister to make a choice and to decide that he will either divest himself or put himself at demonstrable arm's length from a particular activity if he is going to be able to handle his affairs appropriately. One thing a minister cannot do under any circumstances at all—at least on a proper reading of these particular circumstances; and this is not a question of standing aside from a particular decision every now and then—is to engage in any professional practice or in the daily work of any business.

This would be, to some extent, mitigating what we believe to be an incorrect ruling, because this government has absolutely no standards when it comes to enforcing its standards. This government has run away from it repeatedly when questioned in this place, and it has to be said that these ministerial standards remain under review 15 months after this government has been appointed. We still do not have them finalised. Nevertheless, the Prime Minister made clear that, while they were going down the road of revising those ministerial standards, these ministerial standards would continue to apply. And so they should.

We have a petrol station and three shopping centres with 80 tenants in those shopping centres described as `Bunbury—various lots.'

         There was enough for the Prime Minister, at the beginning of this week, to take responsibility off him. The Prime Minister certainly now thinks this is relevant.

Unfortunately, not much of it, just that part that deals with the cabinet submission process in cabinet itself.

Perhaps I along with the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) and your good self—not to forget, of course, the member for Flinders (Mr Reith)—would probably be in a better position to know about these sorts of issues because, quite frankly, the question that was put here and the reason we have dissented from your ruling did nothing more than endeavour to elicit questions and answers from the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) about issues which have been the subject of some discussion and concern in this place for a period of time now.

        As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, firstly, at different times during the last parliament something like 14 questions were allowed to the then Prime Minister about his private interests in a piggery. It could well have been suggested then that it had nothing to do with his ministerial responsibilities and ruled out. But the learned Speaker of the time allowed it to pass. I am sure those that are now in government thought it was a great idea at the time. Secondly, we had the example of the honourable member for Fremantle

        So, Mr Speaker, I have to say we find it rather strange that this ruling has been handed down. We do so also for a number of other reasons. The first is that it has been clearly established in this place that the minister for small business has a conflict of interest when it comes to his ownership of property and his responsibility to develop small business policy on behalf of the government.

       <para first-indent="16">
        We have ascertained that that is the case from no other source than the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) removing from the minister's responsibility the response to the retail tenancy issues contained in the fair trading report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and giving that responsibility to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore). We still have not worked out when it happened, because in question time on Monday the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs and the Prime Minister were still saying that the minister for small business had that responsibility. By 3.30 that was still the go. On the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         7.30 Report

        Interestingly—and this is another reason we have taken exception to your ruling on the question that was put—another area of conflict of interest has been exposed in relation to this minister, and that is the question of franchises. Looking again at the recommendations of the fair trading inquiry report, one can see that recommendation 3.1, which deals particularly with franchising, goes directly to the minister's personal interest because in his own shopping centres there are franchisees who occupy positions: Cash Converters, Chicken Treat and Farmer Jack's—

It also goes to the fact of whether you would rule these sorts of questions out of order if we addressed them to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, as the portfolio minister who has now been given some responsibility, the absent Prime Minister or the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), because I am sure he would have an interest in this as well. The simple fact is that, if there were no problems about this minister, his pecuniary interest declarations and the Prime Minister's code of ministerial conduct, we would not have asked these questions and we would not, therefore, be in the position where you have ruled one question asked by this side of the parliament out of order.

        The Leader of the Opposition simply went to some very fundamental and basic points in support of why you should reverse your ruling on this matter. He went to the minister's real estate entry in the register of members' interests which noted, as we have all seen before, `Bunbury—various lots.' If this minister is to be believed, if this minister is to be taken seriously in this place and by retail tenants and retailers in Australia and their associations as being dispassionate, as being an advocate on their behalf, why did he not list in here that he is a landlord? Why is it that, three days after this report was tabled, he went out and said that, in terms of franchising, he does not agree with any of those recommendations and always wanted voluntary codes? Why is it that in last year's budget this minister cut the funding for the Franchising Code Council?

One of his retailers—I had better not identify her because he is her landlord—is reported as saying in the media, `He shouldn't be the federal minister for small business and such a major landlord. We have a number of franchises in our centre'—I have named those—`and I don't know how Geoff can be making decisions about what happens to franchisers either.' Neither do we. That is why we are putting questions that go to this minister's direct responsibilities.

        The other matter links his hands&amp;hyphen;on daily work and his hands&amp;hyphen;on approach to his businesses to his still being a minister of the Crown. The Prime Minister brought down his ministerial guidelines, but quite frankly I think the Prime Minister set the high jump bar so low that they are not worth worrying about. These ministers walk through them as if they do not exist.

The manager of one of his shopping centres, Colin, is reported as having said, `Well, I have to go and have a chat to Geoff occasionally to find out what we should do.'

            House of Representatives Practice
           </emphasis>
           . It says:

          <para font-size="-=2">
           As mentioned in the cases above, it is not in order for the personal conduct or private affairs of a Minister to be criticised by way of a question. A charge of a personal nature can only be raised by way of a direct and substantive motion. This fundamental parliamentary rule was re&amp;hyphen;iterated by Speaker Snedden . . .

          <para first-indent="16">
           There is another clue in this about the tactics. We had a number of questions on this issue yesterday. We sit here on the front bench and we get notes from our colleagues saying, `What is going to happen next? Are they going to do this or are they going to do that?' It was clear at the end of question time yesterday that they did not have enough for a censure motion. So we got no censure motion.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           As for what we have got today, in the tactics meeting they said, `Admission, admission.' There was nothing to run for a censure motion. Today, they pick up the papers, they see the
           <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
            Australian
           </emphasis>
           editorial and they say, `Whoopee, we'll give it another run.' Do they run a censure motion? No. I would say that, in their tactics meeting this morning, the view would have been that it was quite clear that they did not have enough to run on a censure. The opportunity was provided today and an excuse was used. You did not have anything for a censure motion, so what do you do?
           <break page="5621" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            You run an attack on the Speaker on the basis of a ruling that is as clear a ruling within the standing orders as I have ever seen in the whole time that I have been in this parliament.

          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The fact of the matter is that there is no substantive motion. The fact of the matter is that, if you had not been so impatient, you would have been able to ask that question if you had properly worded it. That is the position. What an embarrassment the member for Kalgoorlie has been to you over the years, but what an acute embarrassment he was today when he asked the Speaker a question, basically on a point of order, which said, `If the question had been properly drafted, Mr Speaker, would you have allowed the question to have been asked and therefore required it to be answered?'
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           What did you say, Mr Speaker? Not that I am in any way attempting to involve you in this debate, Mr Speaker; it would be improper to do so. But, Mr Speaker, knowing you well, in your response the sense of accommodation you are prepared to afford the member for Kalgoorlie makes it quite clear that you actually do know what the standing orders mean when it comes to questions of this sort. Mr Speaker, you had no hesitation in ruling the question out of order. You had been considering the issues because the right honourable member for New England had put the issue to you quite squarely in the previous question. You clearly had it in your mind that this was an issue that you might have to address during question time today.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           I thought, with respect, Mr Speaker, without canvassing your views, that it was an option for you, in response to the member for New England, to in fact say, `Part of the question was in order and part of it was out of order.' But, Mr Speaker, you in your wisdom said, `No, the question was fair enough.' We accepted that ruling. Mr Speaker, in the hurly&amp;hyphen;burly of the House, you have a discretion in the handling of these matters. You exercised that discretion in what you believed was a manner fair and consistent with the standing orders and reasonable in all the circumstances for the House to have these matters properly before it. So on that matter, Mr Speaker, we
           <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
            accepted your ruling. I was not up on my feet saying, `The second part is out of order. You want to support the member for New England.' There was none of that nonsense. Why wasn't I on my feet? Because the minister was more than happy to answer the question. He has got nothing to hide. He has complied with the ministerial requirements. He has complied with the requirements of disclosure.
           </break>
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           We have a lot of talk about this disclosure of the ministers which says apparently—I have not even read the thing—`Bunbury various lots'. That is in the minister's own personal name. The other allegation is that he did not list certain properties, but those properties were held by the company and there is no requirement for him to go into the assets of the company of which he is a proprietor. If there was, we would have had the piggery! Every last little piglet would have been on the disclosure form! Was that the requirement then? No, it was not. So old CJO is putting up a new form of pecuniary interest declaration which, of course, he wants now but never wanted when the piglets were in charge.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           So, Mr Speaker, we reject this on a very substantial basis, that is, this is a motion to dissent from your ruling. Mr Speaker, we do not like all of your rulings; we do not like them all and we would be dishonest if we said anything otherwise. But, Mr Speaker, if I could not say that, you would not be an independent Speaker. Mr Speaker, the fact of the matter is you exercise your discretion; you do so in conformity with the standing orders and on an independent basis. You have done so today. As I have shown as a matter of logic, as a matter of precedent, as a matter of common sense and as a matter of consistency, in every possible way the ruling that you gave, Mr Speaker, was entirely a correct order. On that basis, we have no hesitation in rejecting this motion of dissent. And we reject this opposition that has used this motion as a means to attack an excellent minister, a person who has done a first&amp;hyphen;class job, and that is the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs.

          —Yesterday the member for Kalgoorlie asked me a series of questions concerning the recent arrival in the Torres Strait of a vessel with 139 people aboard. I undertook to provide further information when I was in a position to do so. I can now advise the honourable member that the group has told my department that they are from China's Fujian Province and that the steel&amp;hyphen;hulled boat left China on 18 May this year. Departmental records indicate that this is indeed the largest single group of unauthorised arrivals to reach Australia for at least the last 10 years or so. The second largest arrival was a group of 118 Sino&amp;hyphen;Vietnamese from China who arrived in Darwin in November 1994. All of the 139 people have now been flown to the Port Hedland detention centre where the facilities enable that group to be properly dealt with. That transport cost $337, and I do acknowledge that that is very significant amount of money.

          —$337,000—thank you. The initial interviews have been conducted. Their claims and their motives for travelling to Australia and any possible connections are still being investigated. I would add that we have to assess their claims in a bona fide way and ensure that they are heard. We do not prejudge them and regardless of the circumstances of their arrival the law requires proper procedures to be followed and of course this is being done. I will report further to the House when my department's investigations are completed.

          —The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology recently released its fair trading inquiry report. I hoped to copy parts of the report and distribute them among chambers of commerce in my electorate, but when I contacted the committee secretariat for an electronic copy of the document I was advised that my intention, if carried out, would constitute a breach of copyright. Can you seek advice as to whether this hurdle can be overcome so that members in this place can properly disseminate that very important information into their local communities?

          —There are some good things in this youth allowance change that the government announced yesterday. I think it is important to recognise the positive things that are in this youth allowance package. Ross Gittins commented in the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Sydney Morning Herald
          </emphasis>
          today that `Labor has reverted to default setting for oppositions, merely  opposing anything the government does.' That in fact is not the case. We do welcome some things in this package that was announced by the government yesterday.
         </para>

        <para first-indent="16">
         For example, there are increased rates of payment for some people such as 16&amp;hyphen; and 17&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds living away from home, so long as they live away from home for work or study purposes, and for singles with children. We do welcome the increased flexibility, allowing people to combine part-time study and part-time work or looking for work. We also think that it is a very good thing to extend rent assistance to Austudy recipients. But, of course, as with everything this government does, that has a real sting in the tail.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let us remember what happened in last year's budget—something that is going to come into place on 1 July. Last year this government decided to cut rent assistance for people who share private rental accommodation. We know that most students do share their accommodation to cut down on costs. So they are going to face an increase in their rents as a result of this government's miserly approach to rent assistance.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The agreement with the government stops there. There are some very serious problems with what was announced by this government yesterday on the youth allowance. Let us first of all look at those young people aged 16 and
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          17 and their families. It is not just the 16&amp;hyphen; and 17&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds that are going to be the big losers from this package but also their families. For those 16&amp;hyphen; and 17&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds who have not finished school and who are not in full&amp;hyphen;time education elsewhere, we understand that about 30,000 young people in this category will no longer get any assistance. These young people come from families who are, by definition, not wealthy, because there is already a means test on the youth allowance for these young people.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Families with incomes as low as $25,000 will be facing a reduction in their budgets of $145 a fortnight—that is, $145 a fortnight—because their young 16&amp;hyphen; or 17&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old cannot go to school, for whatever reason, and cannot find a job. That is a lot of money for low and middle income families that do not have that sort of money, $145 a fortnight, lying around to give to their young people to pay for food, to pay for travel and to pay for all the things that young people need.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We do agree that it is very important to encourage as many young people as possible to stay at school. Of course we want as many Australians as possible to finish year 12 or to go on to further education. We know that, if they do, their job prospects are much better. But we do think that these young adults should be encouraged to stay at school. They should not have the big stick taken to them, which is the approach of this government. They should be encouraged, not forced against their will because they have no other option. Can you imagine what it will be like for those young people at school who do not want to be there? They will not succeed at school.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Unlike the government, we recognise that staying at school and finishing year 12, or doing some other form of post&amp;hyphen;school education or training, is not an option for every 16&amp;hyphen; or 17&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old. I am sure that everybody in this House knows a 17&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old who just is not going to finish year 12. We will never have 100 per cent of our young people finishing year 12, no matter how nasty this government gets. We know that the best option for those people is, in fact, to get out in the work

         What we will no longer know about those individuals, of course, is what happens to them, because they will not be counted as unemployed any more. As far as this government is concerned, they are just invisible, they do not exist. The government is not going to care about them; they are just going to be written off. That is the attitude of this government.

Looking for a job will not be an option for them unless, of course, their parents are able to afford to support their job search. Of course, those individuals in families that have the money to help them find a job will have a better chance. Families that can pay for their housing, their food and clothing, the phone bill and the bus fares will be okay. But for the families with no money, those unable to afford these things, there will be no help from this government in finding jobs for those young people.

         The life chances of those children belonging to those families will be much diminished. As we discovered in question time from the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), this government will not give them any assistance whatsoever with labour market programs, because these young people are to be written out of the system. They are no longer considered to be unemployed, so they cannot get any help from a labour market program, and neither can they get any assistance from the pathetic work for the dole program.

In fact, what we expect to happen is that there will be only a marginal increase in the number of apprenticeships and traineeships this year—maybe 3,000 places, at most. Under this government, growth in government apprenticeships has

         What do the states think about this? State ministers have said to Minister Kemp that this is a `betrayal of trust over plans to expand the number of tertiary places'—a betrayal of trust. The states do not trust him, and you can be sure that the unemployed people will not trust him. The reason for the states not trusting him is that they know the $4 billion is not one cent extra; they know that it is $72 million less than they otherwise would have got.

         What they also know—and the minister knows this because he has put it on the public record—is that 60,000 people missed out on going to TAFE last year—60,000 people missed out on going.

The only way it thinks youth unemployment can be fixed is by taking the big stick to the young unemployed and saying to them, `Get out of the way. Do not be seen on the unemployment statistics. If you are 18, 19 or 20 years old and you are still counted on the unemployment statistics, we will basically take away your self&amp;hyphen;respect and your ability to stand up and make a contribution to your family.'

         This government is taking the big stick to low and middle income families—not to wealthy families—who cannot afford to lose $60 a fortnight, $120 a fortnight or $210 a fortnight. That is exactly what this government is saying to Australian families. It is giving them no hope. It is just taking out the big stick.

Let me make it very clear: there is no manipulation of the sort that the Labor Party was familiar with when they were in office.

         We are about meaningful change, and what needs to be understood is what this measure has undertaken. This measure ensures that from 1 July we will have a single youth allowance which will provide income support to young people, including students, those who are looking for work and those who are sick. It replaces five different program payments which are in place now: Austudy for 16&amp;hyphen; to 24&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds and certain 15&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds, newstart allowance for 16&amp;hyphen; to 20&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds and certain 15&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds, a new training allowance for 16&amp;hyphen; to 17&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds and certain 15&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds, the sickness allowance for 16&amp;hyphen; to 20&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds and certain 15&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds, and the more than minimum rate family payment for secondary students aged 16 to 18 not obtaining Austudy.

It is important to note that this is not a savings measure. You would think, from the speech of the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), that we were about reducing government expenditure by these changes. What we have done is to introduce a youth allowance in which the government is helping young people by making income support arrangements simpler and more flexible. We have reduced the five payments to one and 13 different rates of payment to five. Customers will no longer be cancelled and have to reclaim different payments for minor changes in circumstances. It will be more effective in responding to the changing labour market by taking into account the full range of training and employment activities available for young people.

         The youth allowance removes the disincentive to study caused by differences in income support arrangements for young people under 21 years of age. For younger students in particular, it creates a real incentive to complete year 12 or the equivalent qualification before they look for work. It reinforces the government's message that families should

If you look at the last budget, our family tax initiative will allow eligible families—including couples and single&amp;hyphen;parent families—to receive a $1,000 additional increase in the tax&amp;hyphen;free threshold for each dependent child aged under 18 years. Families with one child are eligible if their income is up to $70,000. With each extra dependent child under 18, the income limit rises by $3,000.

         The member for Jagajaga seems more worried about the incomes of people in pinball parlours and others who benefit from young directionless people wondering what to do with the money in their pockets and the time on their hands. We are interested in the future of young people and in giving them a structure that they can work with so as to invest in their future. Contrast Labor's headline hunting with the coalition's plans for young people. This government has principles and policies in the programs it is putting in place to give young people more confidence about their future. We are seeking to address the failings of the current system and encourage young people to invest in their future. We are focusing on the causes of problems facing young people, not just the symptoms.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I think the government has clearly demonstrated its highest priority is towards young people, finding them work and giving them an opportunity for a brighter future. The youth allowance is designed to change the incentives that made investing in your future less attractive than being unemployed. Early school leavers who leave secondary education at year 10 are three times more likely to be unemployed than somebody who finishes their secondary education. Just think about that: they are three times more likely to be unemployed. We are saying to people, `Think
         <break page="5635" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          about your futures and send the right signals through the policy structure that we are implementing.'

         The youth allowance is an important social reform. It is tackling the concerns that have been expressed to coalition members and ministers by young people, families and the general community about the inefficiencies and confusing messages the current system sends. It is about income support for young Australians who need that support. It is about those who are investing time in education and training and who, through no fault of their own, have opportunities denied them. We are saying, `Let's reinvest in your future.' I think young people will respond positively to this.

         But this is just part of a comprehensive plan about young people in our country. This is not just one issue; it is another part of a comprehensive plan this government is putting in place for young people in this country. We have got a youth suicide initiative: $31 million has been committed to the national youth suicide prevention strategy. We have got the Green Corps. We have got JPET, the job placement employment and training program that Minister Vanstone launched in my electorate. It tackles some of the most disadvantaged people in our community. Those opposite, including the member for Jagajaga, like to talk about this as if nothing else is going on in the world. What a ridiculous way to approach government!

         The coalition has got a comprehensive program which it is offering to young people. It includes specific programs targeted to the needs of young people whose circumstances make them less able to take advantage of the opportunities available to them. We have the youth homeless pilot, and national youth week is on its way. We are investing in youth culture through the Loud program. We have got the work for the dole initiative. Young offenders have got some support from this government. We have got the family tax initiative. We have invested in family and relationship counselling. The member for Franklin alluded to the causes of breakdowns in relationships and families: we are investing in that as well.

          We have additional money going into schools. And those opposite want to talk about people who are not of a mind to go into education, but they did nothing about them. We have the school to work apprenticeship opportunities. We have opportunities for people to study and get some vocational training. It might be 60 per cent of young people who do not go on to tertiary education, but it is higher than that in my electorate; it is higher in Dunkley. And they really appreciate that we are putting some effort into those young people who are not scholastically minded but who quite rightly believe that the government should be helping them with their start in life.

          I close with one simple message to the young people. I encourage you to think about your future. The government is, Ministers Vanstone, Kemp and Newman are, putting in place programs to help young people. Think carefully about the choices you make, because you carry them with you for the rest of your life. This is a very good part of a comprehensive program.

          —I would like to conclude the remarks I was making prior to question time with respect to this group of amendments. They relate to the fact that as the Australian National Railways Commission Sale Bill stands at the moment the government would be able to proceed with the establishment of the Track Authority with respect to the interstate main line track without further reference to this parliament.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Leaving aside all of the other matters that the opposition has raised on the proposed privatisation of Australian National, it is very clear in our view that the parliament needs to be able to properly consider and establish a legislative base for the proposed Track Authority. It involves the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars of Commonwealth money. At this stage, we do not have any details of the proposed nature of the authority, the framework within which it will operate or the arrangements it will put in place for the access and maintenance of the track, and the way it will conduct its operations.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The opposition has moved four amendments, all of which have the net effect of removing the track from within the purview—
         <break page="5637" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          the ambit—of this particular legislation. So, unlike the other aspects of the bill which, as the bill stands, would ensure that the two  ministers can deal with those parts of Australian National and the various legislative instruments which give effect to them in any way that they think fit, the government is obliged to return to the parliament at the appropriate time with legislation to establish the Track Authority for the maintenance, operation and upgrading of that track.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I reiterate my concern on the broader framework of this legislation: that is, it seeks essentially to delegate all of the parliament's legislative powers to the executive. It raises some interesting questions about the relationship between the executive and the legislature and the separation of powers. It seeks, in effect, to abrogate all of the legislature's involvement in decision making for a major part of Commonwealth power and to hand it all intact to the executive—namely, the two ministers nominated in the bill.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is interesting to speculate about what would occur if this principle were to spread. We could conceivably get to a situation where the attendance of members at this parliament became less than relevant because there was very little business for the parliament to deal with as all the powers to legislate on matters that are commonly dealt with by this parliament had been handed over to ministers. In my view it sets a particularly bad precedent. It stands in stark contrast to the approach taken by the government over the privatisation of Australia's major airports. Very detailed legislation was put in place and a whole range of issues dealt with, including the regulatory framework and arrangements for the future operation of those airports.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is the most specific aspect of the legislation which requires excision. The opposition maintains its opposition to the broad principle of the legislation.

         The states support the entity and discussions with them on the nature of the entity and its establishment are continuing. The transport industry has made representations to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) supporting the urgent need for the establishment of the entity. The bill provides the minister with the powers and flexibility to move quickly to establish an interstate track entity following agreement with the states. He has provided a commitment that he will keep parliament informed of progress in the establishment. The ALP amendments would reduce this flexibility, leading to potential delays until further legislation is introduced and passed by parliament.

          —I indicate at this stage that there are some 38 amendments, which are being circulated, that I will be moving, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, to the Telecommunications (Interception) and Listening Device Amendment Bill. These amendments go to one thing. The bill in its present form seeks to amend the Telecommunications (Interception) and Listening Device Act to allow non&amp;hyphen;judicial officers to issue warrants.

         These amendments are necessary because the eligible judges of the Federal Court have decided that they should no longer perform this function. I understand the judges have expressed a quite proper concern that the workload involved should not interfere with the performance of their judicial duties. In addition, there is a more fundamental issue involved. The High Court has recently indicated that the use of judges as designated officials to perform certain administrative functions may be incompatible with the judicial function, as it can undermine public confidence in the independence and integrity of the judiciary. The High Court has also specifically advised some judges against agreeing to issue interception warrants, because of the risk that the judge may subsequently be involved in a related proceeding.

         What concerns me is that, on the face of it, the Attorney-General seemed to indicate in his second reading speech that this is coming from the judges themselves. The validity of the legislation was decided in the recent High Court case of Bruno Grollo, the applicant, and Michael John Palmer, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, and others, the respondents. A judgment in that case was delivered in the High Court on 21 September 1995. I have the unreported judgment in front of me. That is the judgment I will be quoting from.

         That is important because they are amendments that were introduced and went through the parliament as a result of earlier cases. The judgment reveals that in practice the system of eligible judges has resulted in the conferring of power to issue warrants on 30 of the 35 judges of the Federal Court. Pages 17 to 20 of the joint judgment, which I will quote from extensively because it lays it all out, basically encapsulates all the concerns and puts into perspective why we will move the amendments that we will move and why the situation should remain the same. The joint judgment states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . the argument can be met by the adoption of an appropriate practice. A Judge who has issued a warrant in a particular matter can ensure that he or she does not sit on any case to which the warrant relates. That is the practice followed when a Judge has received information extra&amp;hyphen;curially which might prove embarrassing to the impartial hearing and determination of a case. Of course, the risk of such a situation arising and, in particular, of a Judge discovering late in the day that he or she had issued a warrant on the basis of which evidence is to be tendered, is increased when there are but few Judges appointed to a Court.

          If the issuing of interception warrants were reasonably to be regarded as a judicial participation in criminal investigation, it would be a function which could not be conferred on a Judge without compromising the judiciary's essential separation from the executive government. The judicial method of deciding questions in controversy has no application in exercising the power to issue an interception warrant. Not only is the application for an interception warrant made ex parte; the very issue of a warrant and the identity of the Judge who issued it are not disclosed. Unlike a warrant to enter, search and seize, its execution may go undetected by the person against whom or against whose interests the warrant is executed. Unlike a warrant to enter, search and seize, there is no return made on the execution of the warrant which permits a determination of its lawfulness, a review of its due execution and a disposition of the fruit of the execution. Because of the secrecy necessarily involved in applying for and obtaining the issue of an interception warrant, no records are kept which would permit judicial review of a Judge's decision to issue a warrant. Nor are reasons given for such a decision. The decision to issue a warrant is, for all practical purposes, an unreviewable in camera exercise of executive power to authorise a future clandestine gathering of information. Understandably, a view might be taken that this is no business for a Judge to be involved in, much less the large majority of the Judges of the Federal Court.

In other words, the professional experience and cast of mind of a Judge is a desirable guarantee that the appropriate balance will be kept between the law enforcement agencies on the one hand and criminal suspects or suspected sources of information about crime on the other. It is an eligible Judge's function of deciding independently of the applicant agency whether an interception warrant should issue that separates the eligible Judge from the executive function of law enforcement. It is the recognition of that independent role that preserves public confidence in the judiciary as an institution.

          Alternatively, you do not need extra judges. The way the legislation has been amended and is currently framed you can designate particular judges to perform this duty so that you can have a panel of judges within the Federal Court who consent to do this. That way you will not have a situation where they should be doing the trials in particular instances. But it retains the confidence of the community because of judicial involvement, as the joint majority judgment that I just read out pointed out. It is because of the intrusive nature of this power and the potential for abuse that we are moving the amendments to say, `No, we in the Labor Party will not support a further watering down of this power.

          . . . the Parliament eliminated the indiscriminate conferral of power on all Judges of the Federal Court and thereby sought to overcome a factor which Mason and Deane JJ had regarded as a source of invalidity. The 1987 Amendment also repealed s 20 and inserted in its place a number of provisions which conferred on an "eligible judge" (as defined by s 6D) powers to issue warrants authorising, inter alia, interceptions of communications.

          So let it not be said that the previous Labor government was impervious to criticisms or problems that might arise in this area. What we did was refine the act and bring in amendments—and we say that we improved it. There was also the earlier case of, I think it was, Hilton v. Wells. So this argument about constitutionality was raised squarely in Grollo's case, but the court decided 5:1. As to why the situation should remain the same, I think there is compelling material to be found in the joint judgment.

We have to have a situation where there is a certain level of confidence in the system—and that is where the judiciary come into it. That is why the functions that they have had under the current act and that have been tested were given to them in the first place. What we want is integrity.

          —I rise to support the remarks of the member for Banks (Mr Melham) in relation to the Telecommunications (Interception) and Listening Device Amendment Bill 1997. I support the amendments that he intends to deal with in the consideration in detail stage. This legislation, like most other items of legislation that go to issues of policy in the criminal justice system, deals essentially with extremely complex and difficult balances that
          <break page="5644" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           our criminal justice system needs to strike between competing public interests.

         There is clearly a public interest in the deterrence of crime. There is a public interest in assisting to the maximum our law enforcement organisations with a capacity to detect crime and to obtain convictions. That set of public interests needs to be balanced with the fundamental importance of civil liberties of our citizens to prevent unreasonable intrusions on the rights of citizens and to prevent as much as possible the abuse of powers that can all too frequently arise.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I said, those balances are not easy matters. They are not stuck in concrete for all time. They are balances that need to be reworked, redeveloped and clarified as circumstances emerge. Issues such as community expectations have to be weighed up in these sorts of considerations. A good example of changes in community expectations on these issues was graphically given last year when, on a bipartisan basis, a much more rational system of firearms legislation occurred in this country.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Things develop in terms of technological change. The very rapid advances over recent times in forensic science mean that there is a whole set of additional challenges in terms of striking these balances. These were matters that some of us spoke about in the recent debate on the Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The capacity of criminals changes over time and moves with technological development. That is why this parliament needs to be continually monitoring the way in which the financial transactions report legislation operates and the proceeds of crime legislation operates, for example. However, in keeping in touch with the balances that are required, we also fundamentally need to be confident in the administration of our law enforcement effort. We need to be certain that the intrusions into citizens' lives and the potential for abuse that I referred to before are adequately balanced. That is why the points that were made by the member for Banks are so fundamentally important in this debate.

          As the member for Banks has indicated, the bill deals with a range of matters other than the proposition of allowing persons other than Federal Court judges to issue interception warrants, the proposal being to permit deputy presidents and senior members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to issue those warrants. As he has indicated, there is a range of amendments that support access by the New South Wales Police Integrity Commission to the Financial Transaction Reports Act established database through Austrac. It also gives the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence access to those reportable transactions.

         <para first-indent="16">
          As the member for Banks indicated, I think there are amendments to the Customs Act which will permit the AFP and the NCA to communicate information to agencies that they have obtained by the use of listening devices. There is a range of amendments that relate to the use of intercepted information in bail applications, in relation to proceedings in coronial inquiries and in relation to the operation of the Commonwealth and state proceeds of crime legislation.

         <para first-indent="16">
          By way of a slight diversion, the Proceeds of Crime Act is increasingly giving concern to some of our law enforcement agencies operating at a Commonwealth level. The Commonwealth act requires the conviction of a person, the charging of a person or the imminent laying of charges in respect of an indictable offence before an application for a restraining order can be made. In recent investigations, the National Crime Authority apparently was advised by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions that it was not possible to apply for a restraining order under the Commonwealth act but that they ought to go off and make an application under the New South Wales drug trafficking legislation. That is clearly an absurd situation which this parliament ought to tidy up as early as possible, given that the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams) seems to have a penchant for introducing all sorts of amendments to legislation when he is dealing with this telecommunications interception legislation and other matters.

           The Attorney&amp;hyphen;General ought to put his mind to the importance of some amendments to the proceeds of crime legislation in relation to tidying up the problems that Commonwealth agencies are having at the present time, as I have indicated. The most substantial change that the opposition supports, other than the relatively minor ones that I have already referred to, is the proposal arising out of the royal commission into the New South Wales police service—the Woods royal commission—in relation to the Police Integrity Commission obtaining a capacity to get telephone interception.

          <para first-indent="16">
           I think all sides of the House got a bit of a spray from the royal commissioner in relation  to this matter. In his report he indicates that he was particularly cheesed off with the length of time it has taken for this particular matter to arise. He vents his spleen at the inability to obtain in ways that he regarded as adequate access to interception material in the context of his inquiries.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           One would hope that, as a result of this legislation, those matters have now been put behind us and the capacity of this new commission in New South Wales to address the problems that seem endemic in the New South Wales Police Service with respect to corruption can be assisted by this parliament authorising the capacity of that commission to obtain the advantages associated with telecommunications interception.

           Having said all that in the areas that the opposition supports, I want to come back to the principal themes that the member for Banks referred to. I do not want to go over—as inevitably I would be less elegant than he was—the arguments that relate to why this parliament ought not to confer on people other than Federal Court judges the power to issue interception warrants. I would, however, quote some evidence that was given by Mr Rozenes, the Director of Public Prosecutions, last year to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which was considering the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Bill 1996. Mr Rozenes had the following to say:

There, there is genuine balancing of competing public interest which requires additional involvement. But even that is currently—

           <para style="Para">
            As was indicated by the member for Banks, that issue in the High Court has, in our view, been satisfactorily resolved by a very clear majority judgment in the Grollo case.

           <para first-indent="16">
            Traditionally, telecommunications interception warrants have been issued only by people who are judicial officers. The issuing of the warrants is an exercise of executive power vested in a person who happens to be a judicial officer. A  judicial officer may refuse to exercise the power if he or she so wishes. Traditionally, those officers have been selected because they possess certain skills and have judicial experience—the sort of experience that the member for Banks quoted the High Court judgment as. I cannot quite pick up the reference here. It was somewhat more eloquently presented than I am doing, but examples of the sorts of skills that a judge can be expected to have are neutrality, detachment, disinterestedness and an ability to receive evidence, assess its credibility, evaluate submissions upon it and reach conclusions conformable with the law and which are expressed with efficiency and promptness in a stated conclusion.

             those skills, but it could also be argued that they lack experience in the criminal jurisdiction essential to the performance of those powers. It could also be very strongly argued that they lack the status and the standing in terms of community expectations for the quite significant powers that reside in judges. For those reasons, in getting those balances right that I referred to before, it is singularly important that community expectations and confidence be considered along with this. With the greatest respect, I do not think it is sustainable that the senior members of the AAT carry—at least in the opposition's view—what a judge carries in that respect.

            The Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, in his second reading speech, presented two reasons for the proposal he is making. One of those, which I think was pretty pathetic, was a concern about a lack of  judicial resources. The answer to that issue is clearly to provide resources for the administration of justice if that is required. For the Attorney to be coming into this House to suggest that the standards of justice can be downgraded on those issues is fairly unacceptable.

            An examination of the budget that is being presented to this parliament shows that there is a significant squeeze in the Federal Court. My understanding is that the Federal Court's workload has increased by approximately four per cent and that the Family Court's workload has increased by approximately 10 per cent. Certainly there is pressure on judges, but that does not seem to me to be in any sense an argument for downgrading fundamental balances that are required in our system.

We heard from the Queensland Police Commissioner's representative, representatives from the Western Australian and the South Australian police commissioners, the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, the minister's own adviser and a number of other sources, including Bob Bottom, a well-known commentator on criminal and other matters in Australia.

         What the Victoria Police said in Melbourne last week which was of most concern was that there are now 12- to 14-year-olds selling heroin for $7 a pop in Little Bourke Street. They were talking about going to the extent of checking motor vehicles entering Victoria for illicit drugs, because they claim that the drugs are not produced in Victoria, they are coming in by road, air or other ways into their state. That may be an extreme response on the part of the Victoria Police, but to my way of thinking it goes to demonstrate clearly the seriousness of the drug problem in Australia today.

         We also heard from the Queensland Police Commissioner's representative that, as a consequence of the federal government's cutbacks in Western Australia in relation to the NCA, the AFP and Customs, there is now a conduit of drugs coming in via the Western Australian coast and coming across the country to the eastern states. That is another serious problem. The Western Australian

         We have had a number of heroin deaths in Western Australia way beyond the norm, indicating not only that there is a greater usage of heroin but also that the heroin entering the country now is of such greater purity that you see the sorts of overdoses that we have seen in recent times. Those overdose deaths have occurred in the eastern states as well; they have occurred on the east coast, in South Australia and elsewhere. They are indicative of this serious problem.

         Mr Smeaton, who has been an integral adviser to both the previous federal Labor government and the current government, appeared before the committee. Back in 1994 the federal government undertook a review of Commonwealth law enforcement arrangements. Amongst the things that they discovered as part of continuing and serious problems, in particular in relation to drug trafficking, was the presence of Chinese Triad gangs who were organising the importation of heroin to a very large extent. The ABCI, the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, indicated that they were responsible for the vast majority of the importations.

         Irrespective of the background of the people responsible, that intelligence was known to the federal government some time ago. Why is it still a problem three years later? One of the reasons why is it a more serious problem now and why you can buy heroin for $7 almost completely openly in the street—and, the police told us, with virtually no means for them to do much about it at all—is that there have been substantial cutbacks. I know why the federal government has introduced cutbacks in these areas. It has introduced cutbacks because it had a substantial budget deficit inherited from the previous government. But the problem is that, when you adopt an across&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;board cut, irrespective of the effects, then you have the sorts of secondary effects like this.

         When you hear from the Victoria Police that 12- to 14-year-olds are now trafficking drugs openly in the street at a price less than the price of a packet of cigarettes, then you have to wonder to what extent the drug problem has become in this country. I think the member at the table has commented in the committee hearings that heroin is now apparently the only drug made cheaper by the 1997 federal budget. What an irony that it is now cheaper to buy heroin than a packet of cigarettes. Any government that presides over that—Labor, Liberal or anything else—ought to be thoroughly ashamed of itself, because in the first instance it is the federal government that has the primary responsibility for preserving our frontiers from the incursion of drug trafficking.

In fact, some of them are so unjust in the way in which they administer themselves that one wonders whether they are, in fact, consistent with what we consider to be the principles of the derived version we have of the British justice system, which has become the Australian justice system.

         I certainly am worried about the fact that, in widening the scope of the issue of warrants, we now include people who are not judges.

         A judge sitting in his chamber issuing a warrant is acting as though he is in court. That means the whole process has to employ a very high standard of presentation.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So that means there is an added onus on the officers applying for a warrant to present their case in a way which is consistent with the principles, and I think they are principles all members of parliament would accept, which are the basis for the issuing of intercept warrants. As a former policeman, I think telephone interception is a very critical part of high quality police investigative work, but at the same time, as a person who respects the privacy of citizens, I am loath to see the widening of the scope for the issuing of warrants under these sorts of circumstances. I must say that that is a matter which troubles me.

I know there are going to be some budgetary considerations here and all sorts of other Expenditure Review Committee type issues. However, in this case, in moving to extend the issue of these warrants, we really ought to be looking clearly at extending the number of Federal Court judges to allow them to be able to cope with their constant workload and, of course, the extra workload that is created by the application for and the consideration of warrants for interceptions.

The granting of these warrants or these powers to the Wood royal commission was one of the greatest facilitations by this parliament to the cause of fighting corruption, not only in the police forces but also in the judiciary in recent years because, as we know, one of the greatest tools used in the Wood royal commission was the use of things like pinhole cameras and telephone intercepts. Of course, it was the use of those in such a way that caused what is now colloquially known as the rolling over of witnesses and the compounding of this rolling over to identify and to locate and, hopefully, to prosecute those responsible for the corruption that has tainted the New South Wales police force over a number of years.

I do not think we should have a royal commission. In fact, my view is that, unfortunately, the Wood royal commission left a lot of questions unanswered.

There are elements of allegations and aspects of the corruption allegations within the New South Wales police force that have not been resolved by the Wood royal commission and should have been. A standing commission is something that is necessary to continue the work.

         Policing is a difficult enough job in Australia—it really is. We are now at the stage where literally every police officer undertaking their work, with the exception, perhaps, of some of the more administrative work, is out there investigating offences, responding to complaints, at the scene of a crime and then, of course, dealing with unfortunate and difficult circumstances. Often they are dealing with people who are injured and distressed and in inclement weather. There are situations where they have to secure a crime scene at great speed and speak to witnesses at great speed. There is a necessity to secure evidence

          as quickly as possible. The problem is that a police officer is acting under enormous stresses at the scene of a crime or at the scene of a complaint, and any review of his actions could take months. They are reviewed in the cool, perhaps more sedate atmosphere of the court or perhaps in the judge's chambers when the judge is reflecting on his decision, his ruling, in a particular case. It may be in, for instance, a voir dire when the judge is hearing the case for the inclusion or exclusion of a particular piece of confessional evidence.

         The second serious but less considered implication for security issues in relation to the Internet is the limit that insecure networks place on commercial development. Small business in Australia stands to gain substantially if, and only if, consumers are confident that their credit card and other personal details are secure and are not intercepted and used for wrongful purposes.

        <para first-indent="16">
         This is particularly the case when we see repeated stories of stolen credit and personal details sourced from insecure Net transactions or sites. Many people on the Net will not use their credit card to order services or products because of this problem.

        <para first-indent="16">
         So consumers do not feel confident about using the Net for commerce, and small business suffers. Because Australians have the highest take&amp;hyphen;up rate of new technology per capita in the world, there is a credible argument that says that Australian small business suffers the most. Privacy on the Net, therefore, is not only one of the largest IT issues; it is one of the largest issues for those small  businesses that would like to use emerging technologies to market their respective products.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is a solution to these issues, and it does not actually require much government action or many resources at all. Sophisticated encryption products fix the privacy problem. Good encryption products scramble messages so that  sensitive information about people's personal details and their commercial&amp;hyphen;in&amp;hyphen;confidence information cannot be intercepted by some kid with a modem and a bit of knowledge of UNIX. It keeps that information safe from malicious eyes, because it scrambles it to render that information unintelligible to those without the keys to decipher it.

         Of course, intelligence agencies have become a little concerned that their ability to peruse the personal interactions of citizens will become compromised if they cannot decrypt the contents of e&amp;hyphen;mails and commercial transactions.

         Of course, what agencies can decipher others can too.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The standard adopted by the United States and security agencies elsewhere, not surprisingly, is a poor standard; it has been shown to be unreliable. A number of studies, including those produced by Belcore and the Weisman Institute, have shown that the American encryption export standard is decryptable. Even students from MIT have been able to successfully decrypt within a couple of hours e&amp;hyphen;mails that have been encrypted with that particular standard.

         Put simply, personal or commercially sensitive information that is encrypted using software the Americans approve for export can be intercepted and decrypted by teenagers.

         The argument then becomes how good the encryption product may be. There is an Australian small business, as fortune or, rather, hard work would have it, that has delivered a solution to the problem. A small business in the electorate of Grayndler has come up with an encryption product that is a recognised world leader. With a bit of indulgence, I will just explain why it is a world leader.

Nexus Solutions, which is based in Grayndler, as I have said, has developed its product relying on a 447&amp;hyphen;bit key, resulting in a combination possibility of one billion times 10 to the power 481.

         Nexus landed a very large contract to sell thousands and thousands of site licences to the World Health Organisation.

It acted to prevent the Australian small business from exporting a product to fulfil a contract it had landed with the World Health Organisation. This was despite the frequent and capable representations made on their behalf by the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese).

         The company certainly lost export dollars. Nexus then tried to sell their product to the Australian government itself. To do this they were advised that they would have to get their product approved by the government. The process is that the software has to be tested and `rubber stamped' to go on the list for departments to buy from. The government has outsourced the testing of security software to a foreign company. It is an American company called CSC. That company, surprisingly, also happens to sell encryption software. So here we have a foreign market competitor being asked to test the Australian product. Who pays for the testing? The Australian small business, Nexus. The overall cost imposed by the overseas competitor for rubber stamping the Australian underdog product ends up being around $250,000.

But the government then tells him that they will not be able to get around to it, that they will not have time to have his product tested by this third party overseas. After some time and interaction, the government, through the office of the Defence Signals Directorate, agrees to allow the testing to take place, only if the small business can get a letter from a couple of departments saying that they will buy the product. Of course, the departments cannot provide a letter saying that they are going to buy a product that they cannot find on the list of approved purchases.

         Clearly the conundrum presented in this debate is that, unlike telephone intercepts, the Net provides a framework of communication that does not accept prima facie that people have privacy.

I think it is absolutely fundamentally flawed to make it easier for the bureaucracy to snoop on people. Do you really think that people involved in high scale espionage are going to be bothered by this? I bet the proverbial London to a brick that they have already got this equipment from Nexus Solutions.

          Do you think a government embargo on exports is going to stop that? What it is going to do is create a black market where the stuff will get out, almost certainly be copied and we will lose the technological advantage we have, because in industries like this it is  simply being there first that gives you the big advantage. Of course it will get out. After all, we have just seen an invasion of the country by the Fujian triads. They got caught because their boat ran aground. The trouble was that, although the boat was stacked with the very best electronic equipment, it cannot warn you of sand banks if they are not on the maps.

          But let us think about it. If that one boat ran aground, how many boats did not? Of course it has been happening for some time and it will probably go on happening because our power to intercept is very, very limited.

           This legislation is about the government oppressing the people of Australia even more. I think it is an outrage. I certainly will be supporting the amendments put forward by the opposition, although I do not think they go far enough. I am not going to the trouble of voting against the legislation; I know it will be a futile effort, but I think the opposition's amendments are certainly worth while. Heaven knows, I trust judges in this country little enough and the evidence shows that my judgment is reasonably based. But to give this power to bureaucrats is an absurd nonsense. Does anyone seriously think there will be any real surveillance of this? People who wish to use intercepts will get everything they ask for and it is nonsense to suggest otherwise.

          I note that of the two principal purposes of the legislation really only one has been dealt with in the debate. There seems to be no concern at all on those parts of the bill designed to strengthen arrangements for dealing with police corruption. The only comments have been addressed to those parts of the bill which seek to introduce new arrangements by which agencies are able to obtain warrants authorising the interception of telecommunications for the investigation of serious criminal offences.

          I come to the proposed new arrangements. Settling on the proposed new arrangements was not an easy task. I think the member for Banks would be aware, as others might be, that for my part I am very reluctant to see any change that results in the power to issue warrants being conferred on anybody but judges at the superior court level. The reasoning by which the decision was made in 1979, or whenever it was made, that judges should exercise that power was a right one and it was done for the right reason. But I think the arguments that are being put up to oppose  what is proposed in the bill are, in effect, flying blind. They are not looking at the practical considerations that have arisen since 1979.

          If you start with Grollo's case, the member for Banks certainly referred to it, it should not go unnoticed that Justice McHugh, who is not one of the more implied rights minded judges on the High Court, dissented. In his judgment, the provisions in the legislation under consideration which authorised judges of the Federal Court to issue warrants are unconstitutional and invalid.

           —At page 238 in the Australian Law Report report, the judge said that the reason for the invalidity is that `the exercise of administrative power that is involved in authorising the issue of those warrants is incompatible with the exercise of the judicial functions vested in persons who are judges of a Federal Court'.

          Since the decision in Grollo, the High Court has decided a couple of other cases in which judicial power has been the focus. One case was Wilson and the minister and another case was Cable v. DPP. The trend is, in High Court reasoning, towards an even greater protection of the integrity of judicial power than was evinced in the judgments of the majority in Grollo.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The majority in Grollo were certainly troubled by the judges exercising the power to issue interception warrants. The reasoning is set out in the joint judgment of Chief Justice Brennan and Justices Deane, Dawson and Toohey and the separate judgment of Justice McHugh. Focus in the argument has been on the separation of the judge as a judge from the function under the legislation and, in legal terms, they are referred to as persona designata.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          What the High Court said in effect was that the judges could exercise the power. However, they urged caution having regard to the nature of the exercise of judicial power and the involvement of judges in anything that might undermine the perceived independence of the judges when they are exercising judicial power. Judges have consented in the past,
          <break page="5659" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           both from the Federal Court and the Family Court, to exercise the power, and that consent is still current. But the judges of the Federal Court have decided collegiately that they will not exercise that power in the future. I understand that the judges of the Family Court have done the same.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          When neither are willing to exercise the power at the trial level, you are then left with a situation where there is no federal judicial officer able to exercise that power. It means that you have to look for other authorities. What we have done is search high and low to see whether there are other authorities and we have identified senior officers with legal qualifications and experience in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as the only body we are prepared to recommend. I emphasise that we do it reluctantly.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Let me say that, quite apart from the withdrawal of consent, there is another factor that needs to be taken into account. I was advised about a year ago that 17 of the then 44 judges of the Federal Court were respondents to applications in the Federal Court for judicial review of their own decisions to issue interception warrants. That is just wrong. It is calculated to undermine public confidence in the judiciary when the judiciary has to sit in judgment on their own judgments.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Practical considerations in this situation are absolutely compelling. Contrary to the expressed views of the member for Kalgoorlie, if we are going to win the war against organised crime, we are going to have to use technological skills, machinery, apparatus and equipment in order to catch criminals. Organised crime is just that: it is organised and it is using all the technology that it can. The level  of technology that is employed by international drug running syndicates is alarming. We have to have the best possible means of countering their activities. Telecommunications interception is one of the few ways where we are able to catch them at work.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I do not see anything in the argument put by the opposition that suggests that it is not in support of the use of telecommunications interception or listening devices for the purpose of capturing and charging criminals, at least criminals engaged in serious criminal

           activity. It therefore becomes a practical question of what safeguards will the public have in the use of warrants for appropriate purposes? The judiciary as the traditional protector is no longer available. We have gone to the next best alternative which is not members of a judiciary but members of a quasi&amp;hyphen;judicial  body accustomed to doing the sorts of things that the High Court regard as important.

          The member for Banks read from the joint judgment of the four members dealing with the requirements of a person who is going to exercise the power. It is an intrusive power. It is an important power and it must be exercised with the greatest care, sensitivity and independence. The government believes that the members of the AAT who have the qualifications that are provided for in the bill are the appropriate persons to exercise that power.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          On the question of consent, the member for Banks has made what I can only treat as a glib suggestion that we appoint additional judges who will have the particular function of exercising powers under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act. I do not treat that suggestion seriously. There is a need for judges in a variety of places. They must be available a lot of the day.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          One of the requirements under the act is for an intensive system of reporting. I get delivered to me on a quarterly basis records of all warrants that have been issued, by whom they have been issued, in respect of what and for what period. The records are available to me, if required. I do review those reports. One thing that is plain is that the judges who have exercised the power in the past are in a variety of places, and there is a number of judges at any given time who are exercising the power. There is a need for availability that necessitates having people not only available in the capital cities but available to be dealt with from wherever there is a need for the warrant to be issued.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Having a large number of judges, like the 30-odd of the Federal Court who in the past have consented to act, and Family Court judges, is beneficial. We need a similar
          <break page="5660" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           number in the event that the judges are not to be available. Again, the members of the AAT would be appropriate from that point of view.

         <para first-indent="16">
          From the point of view of the court, the problem is a significant one also in the time that each of them must spend. In order to issue a warrant, a judge does not simply look at a piece of paper, read a very short affidavit, and then act on it. In a normal situation the judge will receive an application and will hear the applicant or someone on whose behalf the application is being made. I am advised that each application on average can take between one and two hours. That is a significant time commitment for judges who are appointed to exercise judicial functions rather than the executive function that this is. On that basis, I think we ought also to have regard to the desirability of finding another source.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I note that no speaker, except the member for Kalgoorlie, has suggested an alternative source of the exercise of the power. The member for Kalgoorlie has suggested employing members of the private sector, by which I assume he means private lawyers. That I do not think would be publicly acceptable.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The public must have the greatest level of confidence that this power will be exercised impartially and for bona fide purposes. On that basis, the person to exercise the power must be publicly visible. I do not think that members of the private legal profession, however much respect might be accorded them individually, would be seen in that category; they would not be members of an identifiable class, the legal profession itself being far too large to be identifiable.

         As I said in my speech on the second reading debate, my amendments are aimed at amending the bill before us, which at the moment allows an extension to the interception act that will permit the minister to nominate  specified members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to issue interception warrants for law enforcement purposes. The bill also contains corresponding amendments to the AFP Act and the Customs Act, which will authorise nominated AAT members to issue listening device warrants to Commonwealth law enforcement agencies.

          As I said in my speech on the second reading debate, the opposition believes that this is not the way to go. I understand the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams) when he says that he is reluctant to see this change. It is the opposition's view that, if this change goes forward and proceeds, it will be a weakening of what is a very intrusive process, which at the moment does have the confidence of the community because it is judicial officers who are exercising those powers.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The former government made a number of amendments to the act as a result of earlier cases. It is significant that in Grollo it was a five to one majority. There was a joint judgment, a very powerful joint judgment, of four judges of the court. The court in that judgment—and I quoted from the unreported version, pages 17 through to 19—gave the history of why it was that it was judges who use these powers.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I understand that some Federal Court judges might not want to exercise these powers. But the fact is that the High Court has said they can, and it is legal under the act at the moment. It is not a flippant suggestion, if there is a problem with the resources—and there is no doubt that the judges are being asked to do more and more with less resources—to say `appoint more judges'.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          You could then have extra judges spreading the workload throughout the Federal Court and have specialised judges who have consented throughout the Commonwealth designated to do this particular work. So you will not have a situation where you find that 17 out of 44 judges are the subject of proceedings. There should be a moderate expansion of the court to allow this important role to be continued by Federal Court judges. To allow the AAT to now do this, in the opposition's view, is to bring the system into disrepute.

          The arguments have all been put. It is disappointing, but it is important to point out that on the government side only the Attorney-General has participated in the debate.

          I commend the amendments to the House. The opposition will be calling for a division on them. We believe that the government has not made out the case. We believe that a proper reading of the Grollo case would lend the government to conclude that they really should be providing further resources rather than having this alternative of weakening what is a current protection in the act for all of us. I commend the amendments to the House.

         The opposition has not really addressed the practical difficulties of the refusal of the judges to consent. The fact that the judges are respondents to judicial review proceedings in respect of their decisions but in their own court has not been in any way critical of the capacity of the members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to do the job. The government opposes these amendments.

          —It appears some in our parliament are confused. National Party Senator Ronald Boswell today launched an absurd attack on me where he tried to associate me with just about everyone except Jack the Ripper. I can understand why Ronald is so hot under the collar, but it has nothing to do with anything he said in his irrelevant tirade of silliness. It is all about the fact that rural and regional voters are deserting the National Party in droves.

        <para first-indent="16">
         What the Nationals should be doing is splitting from the Liberals so they can have their own voice instead of being caught up and dominated by the Liberal agenda. The Liberals have no interest in the constituents of  the Nationals—in fact, many of their left&amp;hyphen;wing members and senators are more comfortable with Labor Party views and see the National Party as their true enemies.

          The National Party should stand on their own two feet and start representing the people who elected them. Rural and regional voters are turning to me for hope. The Nationals can only expect to lose more and more support as they continue to allow themselves to be placed under the Liberal Party's thumb. Perhaps next time Ronald wants to have a go at me, he will say what is really wrong—

         The specific case to which I refer is as follows. Two school teachers, Cheryl Soggee and Colleen Reed, were unfairly dismissed from Culunga school last year. These teachers were members of the Independent Schools  Salaried Officers Association, ISSOA. On the request of and on behalf of these teachers, the ISSOA lodged an appeal of unfair dismissal
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          to the WA Industrial Relations Commission, the WAIRC.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This was done without informing the teachers that they could lodge an appeal under their own names. Culunga school held a reconciliation conference with the WAIRC without the teachers knowledge or presence. Subsequently, the two teachers were informed of the meeting and were told that they should accept the decisions arrived at in their absence.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The two aggrieved teachers elected not to accept the proposed arrangements and preferred to take the matter to trial. At a later meeting with Ivan Sands, Theresa Howe of the association&amp;hyphen;cum&amp;hyphen;union and Cheryl Soggee, the union said they would not proceed to trial because they did not believe the case was winnable. The union also stated that, if they lost, Cheryl would be unemployable. In other words, they were using scare tactics on her.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Cheryl elected to take her chance. Ivan Sands of the union said, `The ISSOA doesn't fight on principles. We will not take the matter to trial. Therefore, take it or leave it.' Cheryl Soggee informed the ISSOA that she would engage a private lawyer at her own expense, to which they replied, `Do what you want.' Mark Diamond, a private lawyer, was given the case of their unfair dismissal appeal and this was subsequently won before the WAIRC on behalf of Cheryl and Colleen.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Cheryl and Colleen are now waiting to appeal—not the decision but the amount of compensation awarded, which was only eight weeks. Ivan Sands, on behalf of the ISSOA has now refused their request to sign a form 7 which again will see this matter handed to the private legal representation that is being retained by Cheryl and Colleen.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Ivan Sands has also refused to return the phone calls of these teachers. Eventually when he returned their calls, he stated his intention not to cooperate with the teachers. He also knew that, by taking so much time, the 21&amp;hyphen;day appeal period had virtually expired. He refused to put his decision in writing and said he was going home early. But when they rang some time later, he was still there. He had not gone home at all.

          Tony Cooke, the so-called representative of the Western Australian Trades and Labour Council, has also refused to return numerous phone calls from these teachers asking for help. This sad case begs a few questions of this unrepresentative union, the ISSOA. Does the ISSOA only represent people whose cases in its opinion it can win? Does it not represent members with difficult cases?
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          If this is the case, I send a general warning to all ISSOA members that their union is unrepresentative and not worth belonging to. Other ISSOA members must ask themselves why they pay union fees like Colleen and Cheryl when the union chooses not to represent them or even let some private systems be used. The ISSOA dishonestly claimed credit in the

         <para first-indent="16">
          Do Ivan Sands and the ISSOA and Tony Cooke and the TCL only represent their noisy union mates, like those from the so-called tent embassy, at the expense of ignoring the other battling and fee paying members like Colleen and Cheryl or is it up to coalition members like me who have to help the little people because their unions will not? I think it is a disgusting situation that these people are not being represented by their union. They need their help to get this appeal through the Industrial Relations Commission of Western Australia, and they have been blocked by the people who purport to represent them.

They have made the trip to Canberra to see the federal parliament in action, to witness first-hand the deliberations of the elected representatives of Australia.

         Recently I visited a group of students at the Meredith school to talk about the parliament, Australia's democracy and the system of government. We conducted a mock parliament and the two sides debated a very important issue. We learned about the procedure of the parliament at the school.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Yesterday the students came here to the parliament to see the parliament in action. Mr Speaker, they saw you in action in your role as the Speaker of this parliament, trying to keep order in the parliament and maintain a sense of decorum, keeping the stridently held views of both sides and keeping a sense of balance.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, they saw the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) given a one-hour suspension because he was not behaving as well as he might have done. The member for Corio once worked for Senator Button and championed lower tariffs and free trade, but he has now become a champion of no tariff cuts. What a change he has undertaken! So the member for Corio was given a little suspension just at the half&amp;hyphen;time break, which is his usual style. He had a friend with him as well, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He also had a suspension.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I commend you, Mr Speaker, for your impartial deliberation on that occasion and again today. I am sorry my students were not here to see you in action again in the impar tial way in which you deliberate here in the parliament.

          Back in Meredith we had a mock parliament, and the Speaker on that occasion was myself, as the member for Corangamite. I had similar difficulties with the students because they showed similar tendencies as members in this parliament in expressing their views, putting them forward strongly. They showed a couple of points of order and had to be pulled into line by the acting speaker on that occasion.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As they saw here earlier in the evening, this parliament is an expression of views throughout the nation and the philosophic differences that people on both sides express and put in a very strong and robust manner. As I often say to the students around my electorate, that is very much better than the armed conflict which takes place in other nations around the world.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          At election time, Australians have a chance to put their point of view in their electorates through the ballot box. At the Meredith school we conducted a ballot so that the students could fully understand the significance of a secret ballot. I must say I am personally supportive of the compulsory voting procedures that Australians have undertaken because it means that everyone participates in the democracy, unlike the situation in American where President Clinton was elected by a little over 25 per cent of the electorate .
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Back in Meredith, Lethbridge, Bannockburn and the other areas represented by the schools here tonight from the electorate of Corangamite, conditions have been very tough. Seasonal conditions have been poor and the local beef producers are suffering poor cattle prices because of the high grain prices in America. Wool growers are recovering, and the wool price has now reached 700c as sheep numbers recover. Hopefully, that industry will be better off in the near future.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Despite the hardship experienced by those two industries in my electorate, the farmers have been working hard under the landcare arrangements to contain the serrated tussock, a noxious weed which could have a devastating impact in the Corio electorate. I concede that the member for Corio has some serrated tussock in some parts of his electorate. That
          <break page="5667" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           is a weed that needs to be removed—maybe like the member for Corio at some future date. Also in the electorate of Corangamite, in the Meredith area, we have a tree planting program. Trees are being planted by farmers and by people in other industries to deal with the problems of salinity and soil degradation. I commend those farmers who have embarked on this new tree planting program.

         </para>

         The accepted analysis is that it is now the case that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) can certainly give an apology on behalf of the nation in this House. Indeed, he could give an apology outside this House, appropriately worded, without it being an admission for the purpose of legal proceedings and damages. I think that in light of these facts that have been given to the government of the day it is a matter of honour. It is incumbent on the

          Essentially, the government has two choices: it can deal with the issue of compensation administratively or it can let the process take place in the courts. There is no doubt—in my view—that this report constitutes a material fact which will overcome any time limitation problems that otherwise may have existed.

          In my view, litigants would have within 12 months of the handing down of this report or becoming aware of its contents to commence proceedings. If proceedings are commenced, as they most certainly will be, without administrative compensation, there is every prospect that damages will far outweigh any administrative remedy. Those damages will go to the select few who have the resources to commence proceedings. In addition to the higher damages burden that the government will suffer in those proceedings, the government will, of course, suffer an additional burden of legal fees, which will be at least 20 per cent of the cost.

          —As we have indicated in other forums, the opposition is comfortable in supporting the progress of the Wool International Amendment Bill 1997 through the parliament. The bill provides for Wool International to dispose of the wool stockpile in the manner which has been envisaged for some years now with the restructure which began under the former government and which is being carried on at the moment. Because of the improved fortunes of the wool market and the management of the stockpile in the past few years, there is even a bit of a bonus over what was anticipated there, because there will apparently be a dividend and we will be seeing the retirement of the debt. The target date remains at December 1998 and we anticipate that Wool International will be wound up in 2001.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The time is now here for us, as politicians and members of parliament who have had a longstanding involvement for many decades in the management of the marketing of the wool industry, to begin asking questions about the future role of government across a whole range of agricultural marketing areas where we have seen so much restructuring in the past 15 years, with many industries now taking complete responsibility for the marketing of their products. In many ways, the government's role is reduced to passing legislation that enforces levies that provide for payments for research and development efforts and for marketing efforts in some areas.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am not sure that I am entirely comfortable with this as a longstanding direction, you might be pleased to hear me say, Mr Deputy Speaker. Right across the Australian economy, I see various industries taking responsibility for these efforts, yet I cannot help but conclude that Australia's research and development effort is still abysmally low by world standards. Our scientific effort, in many ways, is lower than it should be. Of course, I could make the obvious political points that one could make in a forum like this, that the current government's cuts to the budget in these areas send all the wrong signals to the Australian economy.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But the interesting paradox in all this is that—totally because of government involvement in the management of these industries—there is, in agriculture in particular, and emerging in fisheries as well, a very strong commitment to the use of science and research to better advance the product, in order to keep ahead of the trends that we are continually having to battle against in world markets. Maybe that is because this industry has been exposed to the international market for longer than many other industries in Australia have been, or maybe it is because government has had a significant role in the management of industry. They may be the reasons. I do not necessarily say that that has been wrong, but there are some areas of it that we are withdrawing from completely, with a question mark over whether we really ought to be doing so.
        </para>
        <break page="5670" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          What I am signalling here—and it is a luxury that we in opposition have at the moment—is that at our level there is a blank page rethink going on about what is the next step forward. What is the most appropriate structure for the wool industry, or any other industry, particularly one that is bulking up into a large commodity? Is it a single desk structure? At least two industries, the wheat industry and the sugar industry, place great store by that—the sugar industry moving towards it, and the wheat industry protecting it. In many ways, what we now know as Wool International—certainly for the export effort—has been a single desk marketing system. Is that the way to go? Other industries in agriculture that are moving into export development are asking themselves these very questions and we are seeing quite significant arguments among the players about whether they want to be part of a bulked&amp;hyphen;up, single desk type structure, or whether they want to go it alone and have their own marketing strategies for their own particular products.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          For Australia's international interests—and, therefore, our national interest—I think that government has a responsibility to take an overriding role in quality assurance. To perform successfully as an exporting nation Australia must regard quality assurance as being of great significance. I am not just talking about the quality of the product itself, but the quality of the whole performance of the delivery of the Australian product: the way it is produced, marketed, and transported—everything to do with the way we present ourselves in international trade. Whether it is the clearing house model, or whether it is remaining with single desk structures where government must have some kind of supervisory role in the way we present ourselves internationally, or whether we start encouraging some of these bulked&amp;hyphen;up industries, such as wool and wheat, to look at some sort of cooperative structure with the breaking down of the bulk into particular target areas, remains to be seen.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          A couple of weeks ago I addressed the Wool Council of Australia's annual meeting at Geelong—and I thank the Wool Council for having so quickly made an opportunity for me to have my first dialogue with the industry, having recently moved into this portfolio. I was quite fascinated by the address given to that forum by Mr Henry Grunzke, who is president of the International Wool Textile Organisation, and I could not help thinking that what Henry was saying was actually quite consistent with these little reservations or question marks that I have over my own thinking.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          He was, in effect, saying that, albeit the wool price is improving slightly at the moment, it is off the back of some particular trends in marketing cycles, including the running down of stockpiles in some of the purchasing nations. But his overall message was that it is going to get tougher. The competition from other commodities and other textile fabrics is going to get tougher, not easier. It is not as if the world is suddenly moving back to some great re&amp;hyphen;enchantment with wool. Wool itself is going to have to find yet more ways of making itself an easier product to deal with for the world, and a better product for the world to deal with. That means blends with other textiles or synthetics. A very interesting case being talked about widely is the experiment with cotton to produce a new denim fabric. This may hold real opportunities for us.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          But, in the middle of all that presentation, I think Henry Grunzke was really saying that if Australia wants to just produce a bulk commodity and get a bulk commodity price, there is not much real long&amp;hyphen;term joy in that for wool growers. I listened to the debate at the Wool Council about, for instance, preparing wool in environmentally acceptable bales that can be both recycled and re&amp;hyphen;used, and can guarantee the cleanliness of the fibre product in those bales.
          <break page="5671" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           They are more expensive than existing bales. With a recycling life, they would probably work out to be more efficient and more economic for the industry.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Several delegates from the floor immediately asked the question: who is to bear this cost? Is the cost to be borne by the producer who sticks it in the bale or is it going to be in the price that they receive for their end product? The message Mr Grunzke was giving was: `I do not think you can expect the purchaser to pay for it.' That immediately created a response amongst the delegates: `How can you expect the producer to pay for it, when his returns are so low now?' And I thought, `This has got a sense of inevitability about it. If he does not present his product in a bale the way the world wants it, they will just buy it somewhere else.'
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Inevitably, that kind of improved presentation of the product is going to be a cost borne by the producer or by the industry in Australia, if it wants to stay viable, if others are producing or supplying their product in that form. What Mr Grunzke was really saying was that there are two ways to go about this. One of the suggestions was that maybe we are too bulked up; maybe in having all the export effort going into the stockpile, and with all the difficulties of then trying to break it down into particular areas, we are losing a value&amp;hyphen;add margin. Yet at the same time he was saying that, internationally, it is impossible to deal with a few producers, a few growers, who might produce a few hundred or a few thousand bales of a particular fabric or a particular fibre content. He was really saying that they are looking to deal with blocks that can produce year&amp;hyphen;round supply, but maybe of 100,000, 200,000 or 300,000 bales—in other words, some kind of cooperative structure.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In my thinking I have a question mark—as I am signalling—over whether the move to the total free market, hoping that our agricultural producers can get in touch with their end customer much better and hoping that they will get it right, is too much of a risk for Australia. But I am well aware that leaving international marketing bulked up into large single desks that are not responsive, or not responsive enough, to the changes taking place in both the content of material and the blending of synthetics, leaves us exposed to bulk prices at the bottom end. That is not consistent with the value adding theme that this nation has to work with.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Today, and in every forum I speak in, I will continue to place myself directly in opposition to the comments of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, who earlier this year said that he saw Australia's future being in improving our performance in the production and supply of export raw materials. He made the comment that he did not see much future in value adding for this nation.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I saw a comment from the deputy president of Canegrowers in Queensland yesterday that government is now turning the bush into ghost towns. Every instinct I have, every lesson I have learned in my time in this parliament, tells me that the decline in our country towns and country regions, this whole concern nationally about this drift away from country towns, can only be reversed with two trends. One is government reinvesting in the people and community services that government has been pulling out of these towns in recent years. But that will only happen on the back of private sector investment in these areas as well, in what I choose to call value adding as close as possible to the source of production.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In the brief time available to me, I will tell a tale that sums this up. In the last couple of years, a wool tops plant has been built in Melton, in my electorate. Mr Kim from Korea has invested in this fabulous new plant. It has created about 40 or 50 new jobs, which is terrific for my electorate. I had a serious discussion with Mr Kim about why he chose this area.
         </para>
         <break page="5672" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          <para first-indent="16">
           Melton is on the western outskirts of Melbourne, about 40 kilometres from the CBD, right near the new infrastructure that we invested in, such as the standard gauge rail, the waterfront, the airport—the whole box and dice. There was  competition from many areas, as everyone wanted Mr Kim to invest in their area. I asked him why he chose Melton. He gave a number of reasons. He said that it was not far from the product, because the wool stores are all around the west of Melbourne. A very well&amp;hyphen;trained and reliable work force was available. A university campus was right next door, and he wanted that for his children. A golf course was also nearby, so that made it a very attractive work environment for him—a hell of a lot better than he could get in Seoul in Korea.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           However, the telling point was that he said that, if he had come and looked himself seven years earlier—that would have been in about 1986 or 1987—he would have invested then. I asked, `Why didn't you?' He said that it was because the Australian Wool Board, as it was then called, told him not to invest here. It told him that the difficulties of doing business in Australia were a discouragement. It quoted the waterfront, the labour market—the usual stuff the conservatives traipse out—and it urged him to make his investment in Seoul and to continue to import bales of wool.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Now he has had a look for himself instead of relying on that advice, and he has done it. He is rapt in the performance, and so am I. But what are we doing to ourselves by giving that sort of message? The very people who ought to be reversing the drift away from regional Australia are actually saying, `Don't invest here.' That may have been an isolated case. Let us hope it was a very isolated case. Let us hope the image has changed in the last decade. Certainly, I have put an enormous amount of effort into that region around the west and north of Melbourne to try to change that image for exactly that reason.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The parliament must focus on how to reverse this drift. What is the future role of government in this area? Is it fostering a clearing house model, or fostering large single desks, or fostering cooperative models, where the producer can be bulked up enough to meet the task? I am very impressed with what I have seen, for instance, at the Bega Cheese Cooperative. It has managed to survive as a cooperative structure of 100 or so dairy producers in a highly competitive market against multinational organisations which are competing in that industry.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Maybe there is something in that. As we successfully make the transition from the old Wool Board and the old stockpile through to Wool International and the process where growers are now taking total responsibility and government is moving out from under them, this is the time to think about what the role of government should be in ensuring that we get the maximum value added, particularly out of these industries which have become used to marketing in large volumes to export markets that are getting tougher and tougher, with finer and finer margins.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Finally, I want to comment about something that happened yesterday, which I could not help chuckling about. Yesterday in question time I asked the Deputy Prime Minister, the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer), a question. I like Mr Fischer. I have always found him to be a lovely chap and a fellow I enjoy working with. So it quite surprised me when he got up and started off his answer by saying to me that he thought I was having a very difficult time as the new shadow minister for primary industries, and that this had been `demonstrated by his pathetic performance at Geelong at the Wool Council meeting.'
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           We all say these things in politics, I suppose, but I thought, `Gee, Tim, that is a bit out of character for you. You don't normally, certainly not towards me anyway, start off in that frame of mind.' I thought I would place on the record—just to help the Deputy Prime Minister in
           <break page="5673" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            his assessment—a lovely letter that I received yesterday from the Wool Council. It virtually arrived in my office as the Deputy Prime Minister was making his comments. The letter states:

           They go on to talk about the way we might have a strong link between the council, the opposition and ourselves, which is a very sensible strategy for the Wool Council to be maintaining. I understand that fully. I hope that Tim will be a little more gentle with me in his comments in future.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           As I have said, we are very comfortable with this particular piece of legislation and the process which it is unfolding. I have used this opportunity this morning to signal that, certainly in our position in opposition, our role at the moment is not just that of opposing the government. We also see ourselves as a future government. We see ourselves as having to come forward with ideas for the future. I am also signalling this question of the importance of agriculture as a key industry in the Australian economy. It is not an industry that you can go out and say, `Agriculture is special and Australia has got to have answers for agriculture because it is special.'
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Certainly within my party, and within our people, whatever case we make for Australia's need to have a steel industry in the future, whatever case we make about the textile industry or the car industry, it is equally so that this whole issue of rural and regional social infrastructure, and the running down of our country towns, is totally dependent on a strong national investment in agriculture and value adding as close as possible to a source of production. I think the key questions that we will be focusing on in the next 12 months or so, as we prepare what will go to the Australian people in this policy area, will be the extent to which government has not done enough, or has to do more, or has begun opting out, rightly or wrongly. I thank the House for the chance to make those few observations and signal that we will be supporting this legislation.

          —In 1970, I was one of those people advocating the establishment of the Wool Corporation, a single desk seller, for which I have said a thousand mea culpas. However, while the price was set, somewhat below the cost of production, it probably did not do a lot of harm. It was not until the Wool Corporation decided it would become a price setter under David Asimus that the real damage was made visible. There is no doubt in my mind that David Asimus has done enough damage to be given the Order of Australia, like Andrew Peacock.

         I am not a committed free marketeer or a committed single desk seller; I think it depends very much on the commodity. But in respect of wool, the only future for wool growers must lie in a free market. It must lie in a close liaison between wool producers and wool end users—not in making them the enemy, as the wool industry has tried to do in the past.

         I am glad that this bill, the Wool International Amendment Bill 1997, provides for the dissolution of Wool International. It was a hangover from the old Wool Corporation and it is something that should be swept away. Any growers, in my view, who reinvest their money in any entity associated with Wool International deserve what they get. I would urge every one of them to use their market to repatriate debt or to some other useful purpose.

         It has got to be realised that, as we produce it in Australia, greasy wool is an agricultural commodity and agricultural commodities throughout the world are subject to downward pressure in price. What we need to do is to value add. Top making is an industrial product—it
         <break page="5674" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          is an industrial fibre. If all our wool was sold as top making in Australia, wool would be Australia's number one export again. Its size belies its importance and it would be far more important because it would employ a lot of people, and it would employ people in country towns. It would employ far more people, for instance, than the mining industry does.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, I believe our growers should be looking to go beyond top making, at least to the spinning stage. I see no reason why we cannot be competitive in Australia with a single white yarn. If it is so that we are not competitive there—and bear in mind that, up to the spinning stage, wool is capital intensive, not labour intensive—I suggest our growers should look to liaisons with countries that can provide a cheaper source of spinning but retain ownership of that product. I would suggest that India, which has invested heavily in wool technology, might be a place to look. Certainly I think that having an association of growers keeping control of their product to the yarn stage, where they sell directly to knitters and worsted makers, would give a far greater return to growers than it does today. It would also give more stability.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There was very little variation or drop in the price of wool yarn. We saw the price of greasy wool go below the cost of production. In fact, even top making was sold below the cost of production. But it was not so with yarn. I believe it would give a lot more security to our growers and it would also provide them with a great increase in their income.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is a lot of hype about quality control and it is used, in my view, as one way of blaming the victim. It can tell growers that the drop in prices is partly their own problem. I believe it is nonsense. As a regular visitor to China, I have visited Chinese wool mills on many occasions. The Chinese repeatedly told me that they have no problem with the quality of Australian wool. They do, however, have big problems with the quality of wool from elsewhere.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This brings me to a comment that was made by the previous speaker, that wool is facing enormous competition from other fibres. Yes, there is competition from other fibres, but the wool we sell today, the fine merino wool, accounts for about five per cent of the fibre market. The main competition for our wool is other wool; it is not synthetic fibres. While I am all in favour of looking at value adding—at blends and all those innovations—it must be remembered that the main competition for our wool is other wool.

         I can remember that, when I was in the Labor Party, it took me 12 months to get to the caucus a resolution to ban the export of Australian genetic material. It took me three attempts. At last, I succeeded. The next week, the minister, then Collins, marched back into the caucus room and overturned that without any discussion with caucus. The truth was that most people in the caucus did not understand the industry, and certainly Collins never understood the industry. But that was overturned. It appears that people such as the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) had his ear. The member for Corangamite represents that raft of small studs across Australia that see some quick money to be made in selling off our genetic heritage—150 years of our endeavour—for the quick quid overseas.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I might add that in my endeavours to have a ban on the export of Australian genetic material I had the wholehearted support of the big studs and the overwhelming support of Australian farmers. I even went to New Zealand to canvass New Zealand growers and I assured them that, in spite of the closer economic arrangements, if they did not agree to put a ban on the sale of genetic material then we would ban them.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The wool industry in New Zealand said to me, `Look, we only export it because you do. We would stop tomorrow.' I spoke to one of the biggest exporters and he said, `I would love
         <break page="5675" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          to stop because I know the damage it is doing. I only do it because you are doing it in Australia.' I think there is a greater understanding of the problem in New Zealand where they do have a small but very good fine merino wool industry.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, it was not to be. I believe that any government that genuinely has an interest in the Australian wool industry should move quickly to put a total ban on the export of Australian genetic material, and that is about the only area where I want to see any government involvement in the wool industry.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other area that we need to look at is on-farm wool production. One of the main sources of contamination in wool comes from the exhaustive testing we do which tends to punch polypropylene fibres into the wool where they become mixed, and because the fibres do not take dye they show up in the final product. There are things we could do here. We could certainly look at producing a binding twine that takes dye for baled hay, which is one of the other big sources of pollution, and I am sure that we could do something about making a wool pack that would accept dye, or better still, doing away with wool packs in the shearing shed altogether.

         A company called Australian Topmaking Services was set up in Parkes as a custom top maker but the company is now under the control of Elders so I do not know what direction it will take. That top making plant has become the best in the world. It has leapfrogged the French in terms of productivity and it produces a top quality product.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The establishment of that company in Parkes was the brainchild of John Todhunter, a man who was enormously abused by the wool industry in Australia and by the vested interests in the wool industry. He was one of the great lateral thinkers of the wool industry and he made an enormous contribution. He also designed an on&amp;hyphen;farm bulk baler which was very similar to those used in the cotton industry where the whole clip was put into large containers, pressed with a very simple pressing mechanism and then taken directly to the top maker, thereby doing away with the cost of baling.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That was very beneficial. When I finished wool classing, the instructor said to us as we got our certificates, `Every one of you will now go out and overclass the clip,' which every one of us did, `but unless you can increase your market share in the United States, the biggest fibre users in the world, there won't be a wool industry in 25 years.' That was 35 years ago.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There was some substance to what he said. The Wool Corporation spent $2 billion in the United States trying to increase the percentage of wool used in the United States, but with absolutely negligible success. The reason was that while $2 billion is an enormous amount of money to Australian wool producers, it is an infinitesimal amount of money when you spread it across American television. It simply did not go anywhere. The idea should have been to target certain areas and grow an interest in wool out from the areas that were most suitable for its application.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is interesting to contrast the approach of the Australian wool industry in this respect with that of one of the big Italian mills. That mill sent Mr Todhunter to America with a month's pay and said, `After that you are on your own.' He established that firm in the United States and it is now one of the big consumers, and he did it without $2 billion of Australian taxpayers' money. I think it was a great mistake to spend those billions. It was a great cost to the Australian taxpayer. We still have to attract that market, and I believe we can because of the unique qualities of our wool. I look forward to an increase in that market.

          We should also not overlook the importance of Europe for, while China is our biggest single consumer, it is Europe that still sets the style and the standard and so we must maintain our close contact with the wool industry in Europe. It is true that the centre of gravity has probably moved from Bradford to somewhere around northern Italy, France and Germany, but it is Europe still where style is set and it is an area where we must have constant communication.

          There are people in Australia who need some credit for the work they have done. Jim Maple&amp;hyphen;Brown is without peer. He has played an enormous part in trying to put some sense into the Australian wool industry. I believe that, if anyone deserves an Order of Australia, it should be Jim Maple&amp;hyphen;Brown. I believe that the work that Mr Maple&amp;hyphen;Brown is doing will continue to show great benefits for Australia.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I have mentioned Jonathan Todhunter. Other growers, Jim and Susie Clarke from Hamilton, in Victoria, recently had their shed burnt down. At the height of the depression in wool, they have built a shed especially designed with an approach to reduce the handling in the woolshed.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The truth is that, when you are making tops, a top maker can disguise the quality of the wool enormously. One of the problems we have had in some part is unscrupulous top makers that have put a lot of very short fibre into their product. They can twist it up in the middle of the yarn and it will not show until it is knitted up, and it comes out as little balls on woollen clothes. Quality tops are an art as much as a science. I believe that, if we concentrate on quality, we can have an ongoing substantial market in the sale of tops.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Of course, if you are producing tops, freight becomes a much less significant factor. You are not transporting grease or dirt. You are transporting a commodity that will stand airfreight and, for those mills that are operating on a basis of keeping their stockpile down, it is a very good method of getting their fibre.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          You also have to look at other options. The CSIRO in Australia developed a technique for treating wool so that they could give a 1,000&amp;hyphen;year guarantee on its freedom from rot and insect infestation. It then made an ideal product for insulation. I believe that there is a market worldwide for woollen insulation, but it is not for Australian wool. We are not selling wool. Wool is a generic commodity. We are selling merino and we should never lose sight of that.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          If China were to put a lot of the rough wool it produces into the insulation market, this would make a bigger gap in the Chinese market so that they could consume our wool. They are big wool producers. They only want our wool to make their wool saleable. As soon as they have self&amp;hyphen;sufficiency in that area—a self&amp;hyphen;sufficiency which I do not think they will get—they will simply stop buying our wool. No&amp;hyphen;one buys from us because they like us. They buy from us because we have what they want.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I believe that we should be encouraging that technique, even if we buy that cheap wool out of China, which we would get for cash very cheaply. We could process it and sell wool batts. There is not a government in the world today who would put fibreglass wool insulation into its buildings, for fear of later legal ramifications. For an example, Electricite de France in Europe very successfully stopped the development of nuclear energy in Germany by funding the Greens. There was no doubt that this happened. This was admitted to me over a couple of bottles of red wine in France. They were very pleased with their efforts and so they should have been. The Greens were not an entity in France and Electricite de France is now the world's premier producer of nuclear powered electricity, which, of course, puts them in very good stead with all this hocus&amp;hyphen;pocus nonsense about the greenhouse gases that we have allowed ourselves to be subjected to.

           I would just add in passing that that is an idea that has no basis in science whatsoever, an idea that has been promulgated by scientists looking, in many cases, just to get loan grants. There is no evidence at all to suggest there is any correlation between greenhouse gases from industry and world warming. In fact, it is an arrogance of man: if you test ice squalls in the Antarctic you will find levels of CO2 far exceeding anything that we have made with our puny efforts. I might add that volcanic activity and the burning of forests also make the products of industry look pretty puny. Nonetheless, by their advocacy and use of nuclear energy, they have put themselves in a much better position than we have.

           I believe there is a great future for wool. I believe that future will be with wool growers, either individually or in combination, supplying the product direct to the industry to the specifications required by the industry. This may, in fact, require that shearing happens at shorter intervals than 12 months. It may be that the desired length of fibre can be obtained in 10 months. If that is the case, that is what will have to happen. But I believe the future of the industry lies much more in direct and close liaison between wool growers and end users to supply what the customer needs. I do not think wool growers need to be intimidated by a lot of the nonsense that is spoken.

           I say again that I am glad to see the opportunity to sweep away Wool International and I believe that the free market in wool is one area where the free market can be seen to work. That is not the case in every area, and I certainly reserve my judgment in respect to grain, because I do not believe the market is free in grain anyway; it is cartelled. But, in the area of wool, I think we are going in the right direction here. I must say that, following a speech by the now minister at Dubbo, I thought that we would not see this, but it is in the bill that growers can take all their money out. As I say, if they leave any money in any grower organisation involved in world marketing, then they deserve what they get.

           I might add that, when the Garnaut report came out—and the Garnaut report was a very flawed document—I went to Dubbo at the behest of the Labor Party, basically because they had no&amp;hyphen;one else to go. I made a speech to the assembled crowd at Dubbo and said to them that I thought it was a flawed document. After all, this man Garnaut was the one who gave us

           , a book which has attracted the minds of both Liberal and Labor Party members, and a book so important that I thought I must read it. It was a bit like reading the Mabo act; it was like reading porridge. Certainly, in its turgid prose, I did not see the future in the glowing terms that Garnaut saw it, and I believe that history will vindicate me and not Mr Garnaut.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           I think the Garnaut document was very flawed. It was a terrible time for wool producers, and they are not yet out of the maze. I believe that the future is looking brighter and that, if we can get the interplay of free enterprise and initiative of people in enterprise—initiative that was actually stifled under the Wool Corporation—we can see better days ahead.

         In full fairness to the opposition and their role in setting it up, it was a great delight for the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) and I, for example, to be able to carry forward the deal under which we export wool tops and, if you like, expertise to Mexico without tariffs getting in the way. Our wool is value added there into garments for re&amp;hyphen;export, again without tariffs under NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, into that very lucrative North American market. That is a trade which, from humble beginnings, is growing very rapidly and offers real prospects for the future.

         The loss of the Russian outlet for wool, which did so much damage in the late 1980s and early 1990s, is likely to be increasingly offset by the improving prospects for exports to India. Recently the Indian minister for textiles, who is in fact a cabinet minister—we do not have a minister, let alone a cabinet minister, for textiles in this country, but in India the minister for textiles is responsible for activities which provide a livelihood for 60 million Indians—spent a couple of days here. Again, Minister Fischer and I, and many officers from the department and other departments, spent a lot of time with the minister. He was as good as his word: we saw in the last budget announcements of substantial reductions in tariffs pertaining to Australian wool exports to that country. That, too, offers a real prospect that India will become a substitute market, over time, for Russia. They are even more bullish on their estimates of the amount of wool they are likely to be taking over the coming years than our more optimistic forecasters are in this country. So that is good news.

Those things I think are very encouraging.

         In general terms, the government has been very cognisant indeed of the problems confronting the wool industry. I am not a wool grower, but all my forebears have been—I do not know whether I am allowed to talk about my rural activities, in terms of the chances of conflict of interest and so forth, but those are the historical facts of the matter. I know a lot of wool growers. I know how important they are to the economy in general and to their rural communities in particular, and it is of vital importance that we see the industry recover.

         Fifteen months ago I found a somewhat divided and dissolute industry, very disheartened and understandably demoralised. I formed the view very early on that whilst there were many things that we could do in a practical sense to help and to aid and abet recovery—opening up more markets being an obvious one—the maximisation of the potential of the industry would depend very heavily upon establishing a sense of unity, purpose and common direction, and ending the division within the industry. So we went through the process of two ministerial
         <break page="5679" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          round tables here in Canberra where I pulled together the industry's leadership from right across the globe, from its many facets—because it is a many faceted industry—and we worked through some very vexed issues.

         The previous speaker spoke at great length about the Garnaut report and the fixed release schedule. While in opposition I supported the fixed release schedule. In an example of the sort of cooperation that perhaps the honourable members opposite would agree are too infrequently acknowledged in the broader community, the then minister Simon Crean and I were able to work through that whole very difficult period in a constructive way in what I believe was in the best interests of the wool industry. We put in place a rigid fixed release schedule at a time when wool prices, in terms of the eastern market indicator, were below 400c. As I recall, they had been as low as about 380&amp;hyphen;odd and the industry was in a diabolical state, wondering whether it had a future.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It had very little idea of what to do with the enormous stockpile and the debt hanging over it, and there was a sort of siege mentality prevailing at the time. The industry desperately needed some certainty and some guidelines that were new and would hold, and so we moved down that road of setting up Wool International and of establishing a board for it. It was eventually to be corporatised but, in the meantime, it had responsibility for reducing the wool stockpile on a very tight quantity reduction program in place of the previous arrangement which had been a debt reduction program—a very dangerous instrument for industry at that very difficult time of its career.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The reality is that although it became very unpopular, the fixed released schedule gave the industry the certainty and the direction that it needed at a critical time in its history. There is no doubt in my mind—no doubt at all—that it was the right thing to do at the time and I do not resile from that for a moment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The fact is that under that fixed release schedule we really started to wind back in a disciplined, concrete way that the market came to understand and respect, to the point where today the stockpile is greatly reduced and the debt has come down from something like $2.8 billion to something of the order of $700 million.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let me backtrack for a moment. Through the round table process, in conjunction with the government, the industry was able to work through in a constructive way a more sensible regime, given the progress that had been made by then for the handling of the stockpile. In a rational way we opened up the disposal schedule so that only a minimum requirement needs to be met on a quarterly basis, and a great deal more can be sold on a quarterly basis according to the prevailing market at the time. As a result of that, industry has now very appropriately shifted its focus away from management issues relating to the stockpile onto the much more important main game for the future of increasing demand. As I have outlined, I think that progress has been made there in terms of opening up new market opportunities, but we are also able to focus on the very important question of promotion.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Promotion is designed to do two things. It will lock in such premiums as we can extract for wool over other fibres. You simply cannot turn a bob and produce wool at anything like the prices you can for alternative fibres such as cotton. It is an economic impossibility. You need a very real premium for a premium quality product. You have got to lock in such premiums as you are able to secure but then, given that those premiums have been, and remain, inadequate, you have got to seek ways to convince customers that it is worth paying a higher price for a higher quality product with the unique qualities that wool offers.

We know, for example, that five years ago under&amp;hyphen;35s in Western countries had very little understanding of the qualities of wool or the desirability of the product. When asked, they said that they thought of it as a `natural' product, but it was expensive, hard to look after, short&amp;hyphen;lived and not particularly fashionable.

          We now know five years on that under 40&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds have the same perception problem. Of course, if we keep going at that rate, in another five years it will be under 45&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds and in 10 years it will be under 50&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds, and we will all be gone. We have got to turn those perceptions around. We have got to get younger people, particularly for example in Europe, switched onto the desirability of wool as a product.

          Last year I went to Paris. I hasten to add that I do not go there very regularly. I went there exclusively for the wool industry's benefit and I hope we achieved something. They took us to a mid&amp;hyphen;range store where young people buy their clothing. I was intrigued that in Paris—considered the height of fashion—I noticed with some horror that those appalling lime greens and burnt oranges that were around in the 1970s are apparently about to re&amp;hyphen;emerge—or they were in Paris at the end of last year.

          To come back to what is before us, the government has sought to work with the industry against a philosophical commitment to empower the industry to take control of its own destiny again, and to get out of the way where we hinder rather than help. It has been very important to draw the industry into a regime where it is conscious of the need to provide its own leadership, its own direction, post the collapse of the floor price, and post—as we are now increasingly `post'—the massive government involvement that was necessary in the winding back of the stockpile and in the statutory arrangements that pertain to that process.

          In fact, we have had a lot of legislation before the House as we have sought to progress that and, of course, what we are talking about today carries all of that further. It essentially indicates the timetable for the winding up of Wool International—the winding down of the size of the board, starting from the end of this year and, over time, by the year 2001, winding it up altogether.

          Originally the Crean legislation proposed that Wool International could be corporatised on its way to being privatised and handed back to the industry as its own marketing body and so forth. Over time, we have come to the realisation that there are more appropriate ways to proceed. Many members of the coalition have very strong views on that. What we have ended up with is an approach which says that it will be disbanded. The only surviving entity may be an entity that at this stage is loosely known as `Global Wool', a joint venture between Elders, Wesfarmers Dalgety, Wool International or, if you like, an offshoot of Wool International. It would be a trading and marketing company which growers would have the option of investing in, and I stress `option'. There would be no compulsion at all if Global Wool were to proceed; it would be entirely voluntary. Growers would have the option of investing in it if they so choose, or not investing in it if they did not want to be part of that joint venture.

           It needs to be noted that, in contrast to what we thought would be the case in 1993 with a huge debt—as it was then—an enormous stockpile to be digested and very low wool prices, no&amp;hyphen;one held out any real prospect that in the end there would be substantial equity for growers out of the whole exercise. But we now know differently. Although there is still a reasonable amount of wool to digest, on current indications, there will be considerable equity to be returned to the growers. We have announced that it will be several hundreds of millions of dollars.

           Some growers will get a pretty nice cheque out of it and I say that is more power to them for the blood, sweat and tears of the last few years. It is a small return when you set it against the sorts of losses that they have experienced. I know it is very welcome and everywhere I go wool growers tell me how relieved they are and how much they look forward to it. The entitlement to that equity will flow through, starting with the first tranche of $81 million this year, and that specifically will be returns on section 51, the sale of non&amp;hyphen;wool assets.

           I have not got much time but I have given a bit of a broad overview of where I see the industry going and this legislation does provide growers who have paid wool tax between July 1993 and 1996 with entitlements to the equity of Wool International. In due course, they will receive the cash distributions of the surplus. Wool tax payers will be given unit holdings on the basis of a unit for every dollar of wool tax paid, and the units will be able to be traded at values the market applies to them from time to time. The Wool International register of these entitlements will be finalised in September.

           In terms of the interim and final payments of Wool International assets to wool tax payers, I am very pleased, as I have just indicated, that it will be about $81 million, which is more than the originally estimated $75 million. It is to be distributed equitably later this year—in fact, by December. There will be further payments in several tranches—probably two or three—over the next few years. And, as I said a moment ago, that is very pleasing indeed.

           In terms of the comment I made a moment ago about Global Wool, the legislation allows for the setting up of a growers investment trust, a special purposes investment vehicle—I will not spell out what that acronym is! Prior to that proceeding, I stress that Global Wool, as a concept, will need ACCC approval and then my approval before it can proceed, and Wool International will, in the meantime, have a cap on further expenditure on the feasibility study and the establishment of the trust of $1 million through to 30 June 1998.

           Wool International will also be allowed to establish, through a public tender process, a loan facility by a financial institution for the benefit of wool growers with entitlements to the equity of Wool International. They will be required to complete the tender process by 31 December 1997, thus giving equity holders more choice in the use of their equity in a way that suits their individual needs. There is a reasonable expectation that this arrangement will produce more advantageous terms than would otherwise be available to wool taxpayers negotiating loan arrangements with lenders individually. Growers will be absolutely free to negotiate their own loan arrangements if they so choose.

In short, we have a long way to go before the industry is in clover again, so to speak, but we have made great progress. I thank the industry for its determined efforts to pull together.

          —The International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill amends the International Monetary Agreements Act to allow Australia to comply with the IMF's new arrangements to borrow, which is to be a new line of credit provided by a group of countries to the International Monetary Fund, which the IMF would be able to draw on in the case of a financial emergency in one or more of its member countries to assist that country or those countries. The opposition does not oppose this legislation; indeed, it strongly supports it.

         I will go into the background of this measure for a little while. Firstly, it goes back to the Mexican crisis in December 1994, when private capital flooded out of that country as confidence in it suddenly evaporated following a string of high current account deficits—around eight per cent of GDP, as I recall—and led to reconsideration of the current international arrangements to respond to such a crisis.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The IMF provided substantial financial assistance to Mexico from its own resources, about $A24&amp;half; billion—by far the largest amount ever provided to a single member—and further amounts were provided bilaterally, especially by the United States. The need for such large financial resources to be provided for a relatively small economy led to considerable rethinking about the capacity of the IMF to respond to a future possible crisis, especially to a larger economy than that of Mexico.
        </para>
        <break page="5683" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          The existing formal mechanism for supplementing IMF resources in such a situation was termed the `general arrangements to borrow', a line of credit provided through the G10, which comprises the G7 countries of the US, UK, Germany, France, Italy, Canada and Japan, plus four smaller European countries—Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. That gives you 11 countries but it is still called the G10.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This general arrangement to borrow was established in 1961 when, under the then system of fixed parity exchange rates, the US dollar and the pound sterling were frequently under strain. The breakdown of the fixed parity system reduced the need for general arrangements to borrow, which has not been called upon since 1978. Nevertheless, it has remained in existence and, indeed, was extended in 1983 following the Latin American debt crisis of that time.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The next step along the way, following the resolution of the Mexican crisis with the financial assistance coming from the IMF and other ad hoc arrangements, was that the G7, at its meeting in Halifax, Canada, in June 1995, called for a doubling of the amount currently available under the general arrangements to borrow by the G10 and other countries with the capacity to support the system. So they were looking for others to assist the G10 in providing this kind of support mechanism at a time of international financial crisis for one or more countries.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The issue then became how to expand the GAB facility by bringing other countries into it. The simplest way was to expand the membership of the G10 so that, instead of having 11 members, it would have quite a few more. However, this was opposed by the smaller members of the G10 which were concerned that their privileged association with the G7 through this forum would be reduced. The role of the G10, of course, goes beyond the general arrangements to borrow—it acts as a caucus in the International Monetary Fund, in the OECD and also in the Bank of International Settlements. These smaller countries did not want other countries such as Australia to join the group. Accordingly, various other options were developed which would allow other countries outside the G10 to participate through separate arrangements parallel to the GAB, or through the establish of a new facility in addition to the GAB.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The problem with all these proposals, as initially developed, was that they would treat the non&amp;hyphen;G10 countries as subordinate to the G10—that is, with the same responsibilities but a lesser role in decision making. Australia rightly regarded this as wrong in principle and, in discussion on the IMF board in 1995, we made it clear that in our view all participants in any facility should be treated on an equal basis.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Then in October 1995, at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund&amp;hyphen;World Bank in Washington, I, as the Australian Treasurer at that time, made it clear that Australia would be prepared to participate in an expansion of the general arrangements to borrow, but only on three conditions. They were: firstly, that all participants should have the same rights and responsibilities—that is, there should be no second&amp;hyphen;class citizens; secondly, that contributions should be based on the relative economic standing of participants; and, thirdly, that the new participants should participate fully in the activation arrangements and voting rights should be determined by the shares of the commitments. Later in 1995, the G10 developed a proposal to expand the GAB, but it did not adhere to Australia's three principles of participation. Australia, along with various other potential additional participant countries, made it clear that we did not accept the G10 proposal or, at least in the case of some countries, had strong reservations about it.
         </para>
         <break page="5684" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          <para first-indent="16">
           The next step along the way was in April 1996 when, at the APEC finance ministers meeting, Australia proposed the establishment of a new set of borrowing arrangements—that is, separate from the general arrangements to borrow—which would meet each of the three principles of participation that I had spelt out in the previous October. This became the basis of agreement and, by May of 1996, potential participant countries in this new arrangement had broadly agreed on how it would operate. Later in 1996, the detail was finalised and it was strongly supported at the IMF executive board level in January 1997.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The details of the new arrangements to borrow are that it will make available to the IMF an amount of up to $34 billion special drawing rights or $A61 billion, which compares to special drawing rights of $17 billion or $A30&amp;hyphen;odd million under the general arrangements to borrow. This meets the requirement of the G10 that the facility be doubled in size. In respect of that overall amount, Australia's share will be $810 million special drawing rights or $A1.5 billion or thereabouts.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           This new arrangement will not replace the general arrangements to borrow—it will be alongside them—but it will be the facility of first and principle recourse in the event of a need to provide supplementary finance to the IMF. The participants in the new arrangements to borrow, apart from the G10, are Australia, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Hong Kong, Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Norway, Saudi Arabia—which had an associated arrangement with the GAB anyway—Spain, Singapore and Thailand. Thus, it is a markedly less Eurocentric group than the GAB, with a number of the dynamic east&amp;hyphen;Asian economies represented as well as ourselves, Kuwait and some other Europeans, in addition, of course, to the G10.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           It is, accordingly, a much stronger and more durable arrangement than the GAB, with 13 more countries involved—a total facility worth twice the credit available to the IMF under the GAB. It, therefore, represents a major strengthening of the international monetary system which, in a world where vast amounts of private capital wash around the world everyday and which can suddenly take flight in a devastating way, this is a great reassurance in the durability of the system.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Nevertheless, it is no guarantee that countries which do not adhere to sound economic policies will be free from concern. What the Mexico crisis demonstrated quite clearly was that, apart from the need for substantial financial resources to be available to a country facing capital flight, there is also an acute need to ensure that the economic policies in that country are such as to return the nation to economic stability. The crisis in Mexico only subdued after its policies were changed, policies which caused great pain to the Mexican people but without which they would not have resolved their financial crisis despite the massive IMF bail out.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           There are two additional points that I wish to raise. Firstly, in the event that Australia was required to make a contribution to the IMF fund of this facility, we could be required to produce $1.5 billion in a small period of time, which is not a small sum. This will either have to be borrowed by the Commonwealth—and provision for that is contained in this bill—or, in the event of a budget surplus, repayment of our debt would presumably be reduced to that extent. It is comforting to note that this would not have implications for the budget balance as it would be treated as a financing transaction below the line, which accords with international accounting practice.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           I would note, however, that, when I was Treasurer, the means of financing Australia's contribution that was then being contemplated by Treasury was for a line of credit from the
           <break page="5685" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            Reserve Bank of Australia to the IMF, not for it to be financed directly by the Commonwealth. This appears to be the way a number of countries have approached this issue, with Germany, Hong Kong, Sweden and Switzerland all represented in the new arrangements to borrow, not by their government, but by their central bank, which would seem to indicate that any call on those notions would be met directly by the central bank not the government. I would appreciate it if, in reply—if we are going to have one—the minister would advise the committee why it was that Treasury changed its mind on this issue and decided on government finance through the consolidated revenue fund rather than through the Reserve Bank.
           </break>
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Finally, this is one of those measures on which both sides of the House can feel some pleasure and, indeed, ownership of a successful outcome in which Australia has played a leading role. I would particularly like to congratulate the Treasury officials involved for their constructive, innovative contribution on this matter, which broke an international deadlock and provided the means of considerably improving the safety and security of the international monetary system.

          —The previous speaker alluded to the fact that this bill is before us as a result of what happened in Mexico. It is a very good investment of time to study what occurred in Mexico and what is occurring today in Mexico. For those of you who like listening to radio or tapes as you are driving along, I would strongly urge you to listen to Tom Fitzgerald's Boyer lectures of some years ago. Tom Fitzgerald was the

          </emphasis>
          economics editor, and in that very fine exposition, he assessed the Australian economy and where it was going. He passed a very, very harsh judgment upon us. Let me quote verbatim from the lecture. He said:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         At no point of time in the future will the current account come into a state of balance. In fact, each year that we proceed, this country will go further and further in debt and have to carry the sins of the past which will be imposed upon the Australians of the future.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The current account deficit has been fluctuating up and down, but there is no doubt that we are talking about a baseline which most certainly, if it is not rising, is staying static. That being the case, the country with each preceding year, as Fitzgerald said in those lectures, will become worse and worse off. As the Australian debt rises, the interest and repayments on that debt keep building upon themselves and have an exponential effect.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We have come from a state where we had $23,000 million owing to foreign institutions. We now have a situation in Australia where around $200,000 million is owing to financial institutions. That is not getting better, but each day is getting worse, which brings me to the subject of the IMF. When you get really bad, the IMF steps in and starts dictating to you the policy that you carry out in your country.

         The economies of Central and South America are often portrayed in the American media as if they were those of irresponsible Latin people who really could not run a country properly. I think a more fair assessment of Central and South America is the complete domination of those economies by the interests of the United States and the complete domination and submergence of their national interests to the national interests of those of the United States. With the United States now in a position that it is dictating policy to Mexico, it is very hard to see how that country can realise upon the potential of its citizens. If someone else is calling the tune in your country, then of course you are not in a very happy situation. Sovereignty is not a word that has much meaning to you.

In reflecting upon this, I must reflect upon the fact that we have a very narrow base of export earnings in this country—a very, very narrow base indeed. In fact, only eight items comprise 60 or 70 per cent of this nation's entire income—the big eight. Throw in the tourism industry and it is the big nine. Of those, four of them are agricultural products—cattle, wool, wheat and sugar.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The cattle numbers are down by 25 or 30 per cent on where they were a decade or so ago. Wool is down by some 30 or 40 per cent—depending upon which set of figures which you wish to rely on—and falling. In the cattle industry, one&amp;hyphen;quarter of the trade within two years will be live cattle: instead of selling a beast for $1,500 per head, we will be selling it for only $300 per head, and the current account implications of that are very diabolical. We are growing wheat everywhere we can in Australia now, and so there is no chance of expansion in wheat.

          When Thailand gets over the drought that they have been having, and when the restrictions upon Cuba are removed, the price of sugar is expected to fall through the floor.

The implications for the IMF and the current account for this country are very grim indeed.

          Turning to mining, I was saying the other day that, under the level playing field idea, the big international mining companies will impose upon Australia the same wage levels that they have in South America and other countries which, for a number of reasons, we used to refer to as Third World countries. I said that the wage structure of such countries as Chile will be imposed upon the mining industry of Australia, and that CRA has mines in both of those countries, so why would it treat our miners better than it treats their miners?
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I was very surprised to be rebutted by being told that the wages in Chile are very similar to the wages in Australia. These countries are leaping forward. They now have sophisticated staff to mine their mines over there. They enjoy, in spite of the remarks that I have just made, wage advantages over this country. Also, because of the enormous power of the multinational companies in Central and South America and in Africa—countries which are economically on their knees and which desperately need the mining revenue, and so are prepared to give the mining companies anything they want—such things as environmental considerations are not taken much notice of in Africa or South America; and that gives them tremendous advantages, cost wise, over us.

Russia is opening up huge areas—and it must have far and away the most extensive mineral resources in the world; but, because of communism, it has not been able to competitively exploit those resources which, of course, it now can. So our mining industry, which has been the juggernaut of the Australian economy, is in a very grave situation indeed.

          Let us look at the most successful economy on earth—and this has a lot to do with other implications of the IMF proposals that are coming forward here. The most successful economy on earth, by far and away, is Japan. Its balance of payments—to be technical—was $130,000 million. To put that in perspective, ours was a deficit of nearly $20,000 million, whilst theirs was a surplus of $130,000 million. The United States had a deficit last year of $106,000 million. Japan has an enormously successful economy. What makes it so different from the other economies on earth?

         <para first-indent="16">
          One other statistic which I should refer to is that the average income of a person in Japan is $36,000; the average income of an American is $24,000. That is quite remarkable. I was very surprised at that figure, which the library provided to me, and I confirmed it from the United States and Japan. Why is Japan so enormously successful? I think the major answer to that is in interest rates. The average interest rate in Australia in 1995 were 7.7 per cent, the average interest rate in Japan was 1.2 per cent, and the average interest rate in the United States was six per cent.

          Clearly, if business and development oriented business can access interest rates that are that low, they will move forward with great confidence and with very little fear imposed upon them. Clearly, that is the biggest differentiating statistic that one can look at in characterising the Japanese economy. If you want to wind back to before the bolsheviks, the socialists, took over Australia, we had a situation where our agricultural and other developing industries, most certainly mining in the case of Queensland, could access money—

Until our friends sitting opposite took over the running of this country with their enlightened economic rationalism—which they now seem to be running away from, after having imposed that disaster upon Australia for 13 years—we could access money through the Primary Industry Bank, the Commonwealth Development Bank, through QIDC in Queensland and various similar institutions in the other states. There was a whole range of financial institutions through which anyone who had a business which would result in the growth of the Australian economy, or a development oriented project, could access interest rates far, far lower than the rates that applied to the rest of Australia.

          Compounded on that was the removal of every other way of controlling the economy in Australia except interest rates. To quote again from Fitzgerald's lectures, the `bluntest of blunt instruments' was used to control the Australian economy—one single blunt instrument. If we had a very bad inflationary problem, as we did, starting with the Whitlam regime—if I could score a political point here—which would create great problems in terms of the International Monetary Fund and our situation financially with the other states of the world, it had to be restrained. So we restrained it with massive interest rates. In days past, we used statutory reserve deposits, and that sort of mechanism, to pull in a situation of inflation.

Of course, when you were competing against the Japanese economy, where interest rates were down around two and three per cent, you were going to take one massive hiding in the international competitive trade arena. That is most certainly what occurred to Australia during that period. We took one massive hiding because our businesses that wanted to get off the ground could not possibly borrow money at that level. Day after day, those that existed were falling over. Bankruptcies in Australia rose from around 4,000 in 1983 to 17,500 last year, and they are still rising as a result of that.

          —Let me start by thanking speakers in this debate. It is a very important bill. I would just like to record my appreciation, also, for the opposition's support which was indicated in the contribution from the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis).

         As has been noted, the key impetus for the New Arrangements to Borrow, to which this bill provides for Australia's participation, were the difficulties experienced in Mexico in late 1994 and the associated concerns about the adequacy of the IMF's resources to cope with possible future crises of the international financial systems. The New Arrangements to Borrow were progressively developed from that point following those events. Australia played a very significant role in the establishment of the New Arrangements to Borrow and for this we can be justly proud. The member for Gellibrand, I am sure, recalls his time in government when this initiative was developed.

        <para first-indent="16">
         As has already been noted, this bill essentially serves two purposes. Firstly, it will enable Australia to adhere to the International Monetary Fund's New Arrangements to Borrow, and, secondly, it will simplify the framework for Australia's financial transactions with the IMF. The New Arrangements to Borrow, the NAB, as it is shortened to, will double the IMF's capacity to borrow to forestall or cope with an impairment of the international monetary system, or to deal with an exceptional situation that poses a threat to the stability of that system. The NAB will therefore enhance the IMF's ability to safeguard the international monetary system.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Under the NAB, Australia may be called on to lend up to SDR$810 million, or about A$1.5 billion to the IMF. There is flexibility in this arrangement. In certain circumstances, Australia will be able to opt out of a call under the NAB and may also request early repayment of a loan under the NAB. Participants in the NAB will meet once a year to review and discuss macro&amp;hyphen;economic and financial market developments, especially those that could have an impact on the stability of the international financial system. This is potentially an important new forum for consideration of these issues.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill introduces a simplified framework for the conduct and recording of Australia's regular financial transactions with the IMF. Under the new framework, the transactions will
         <break page="5689" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          be conducted in a more transparent and cost&amp;hyphen;efficient manner. The amendments proposed in the bill will have no impact on the Commonwealth budget outlays, or on the budget balance.

         The member for Gellibrand raised a question during his contribution. He asked why the government has decided to finance a call under the NAB through the CRF. The government wanted the Commonwealth to be a participant in the NAB because decisions on whether to opt out of a call raised very critical policy issues that necessitate a proposed method. And, so that the proposed method is also consistent with the way we conduct our other transactions with the IMF, it is therefore an appropriate response from the government. Again, may I express my appreciation for the contributions and the participation of the people in the debate today and also indicate to the opposition that we thank them for their support.

          —I thank the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Baldwin) for his very brief contribution. Nothing could be further from the truth in terms of the government's asset sale program. Effectively what these bills do is to maintain the status quo. Currently the taxes and charges, the self&amp;hyphen;insurance provisions, apply in respect of the Commonwealth's fleet. It is the intention of the government, as it was the intention of the former government, to dispose of that car fleet. Effectively, this legislation maintains the current position, despite the fact that the cars will be owned by the private sector and leased back to the Commonwealth.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In that regard, the member for Sydney indicated that the government sought to impose these taxes and charges—that is, the Commonwealth's taxes and charges in respect of motor vehicles, the stamp duty provisions, the sales tax provisions—on the states during the course of the special Premiers Conference last year. That was not the case. In that instance, the Commonwealth gave the option to the states to make their contribution to fiscal consolidation either by way of the financial assistance grants or by way of imposing a very transparent and very up&amp;hyphen;front process on such issues in respect of motor vehicles as sales tax.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The states chose—in my view, surprisingly—to maintain their advantage in respect of motor vehicles, particularly on the sales tax exemption, and to make their contribution by way of a reduction for 2&amp;half; years in respect of the financial assistance grants. So the member for Sydney has got it wrong. This particular bill will enable the Commonwealth to simply get out of the ownership of a very large fleet of some 18,000 vehicles. There is no need for the Commonwealth to be the owner of that. The provision of those vehicles can be supplied, as it is to many states and to many private companies, by the private sector, and the provisions that currently apply will apply in that regard. It does not give an advantage to the private sector in any shape or form. It simply maintains the provisions that are now there to the extent that there is a need to have that fleet and there always will be. I commend the bill to the House.

          —The budget appropriations this year for Defence are particularly important. They address a whole range of important policy initiatives and a series of decisions that the current government has made. In fact, it has been a period of more decisions than policy, regrettably; a period in which there has been decision by press release, in which there has been an absence of policy, and in which our neighbours look with some bewilderment at what it is that Australia now sees for itself in terms of its own security and its interaction with the region and the wider world. Regrettably, it has also been a period in which a string of decisions without any direction or policy has produced, within the ranks of service personnel and people in the department, a drop in morale which is now reaching proportions of serious concern.

         During the course of the consideration in detail of this bill, I hope to make a number of contributions dealing with a series of different topics. At the outset, it is important to comment on the confusing signals which this government has been issuing in relation to its view of its place in the region. No strategic analysis has been released. In fact, I believe that no proper strategic analysis has been undertaken by this government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A little over a year ago when this government came to office it had the opportunity to endorse the former government's strategic analysis or to institute a new one. The Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) and the government decided to do neither at that time. Subsequently, the government has decided that it will institute its own strategic review. Unfortunately, it has decided to do that far too late in its three&amp;hyphen;year term. That is compounded by the fact that, without any concept of a strategic review in mind, it set about making some of the most
         <break page="5692" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          significant changes to the defence force structure this country has seen in more than two generations.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The minister has proclaimed the army restructure and the defence efficiency review in those terms, and yet they have been done without any consideration of what it is that Australia needs to defend itself. It has been done without any consideration of what it is that Australia confronts in the region and in the world, or of what our place in the region and the world is.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Having jumped step 1 and step 2, which should have been a proper force structure analysis, we have no strategic review and no force structure analysis, this government has set about a major restructure of the army. It has set about a major restructure of the defence organisation—I will say some more about the DER later. Suffice to say at this point that the defence efficiency review is not something I regard as being confined to administrative matters. I will detail my reasons for that subsequently, but the DER clearly goes beyond administrative considerations in matters of efficiency and, in doing so, should have been at least delayed until there was some serious concept in the mind of this government of our place in the world.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is not the case. It has become very evident in a series of statements made by the minister that either he has a confused view, or that the department and his office have a confused view. On each occasion that these confused views have been put into the public domain and reported accordingly, the minister has replied the next day, saying how he has been terribly misquoted. The first time that happened last year—and I can recall it quite well, as it was at a conference here in Parliament House in May—I gave the minister the benefit of the doubt and thought, `Well, fair enough, some poor journalist has given the wrong slant to it.'
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, it happened some months later when the minister appeared on the Channel 9

         program—I think it was last July. He made the offhand comment that the Americans might like to establish a naval base in Darwin. When these ideas are thrown around by senior ministers of the government in the public domain they actually have some importance. They have some weight. That is the sort of offhand comment a minister might make in a private conversation. He might get away with it as a second&amp;hyphen;rate shadow minister, but a minister should not get away with it when he has the responsibility of government on his desk and the responsibility of the defence forces on his shoulders. He should not make statements like that in his position.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         He also should not have talked about the upcoming meetings with American senior officials following shortly after that

          (Extension of time granted)
         </emphasis>
         It became clear in subsequent meetings with the officials in the United States that they had no interest in talking about a naval base, or even something less substantial than that. At the same time the minister was floating the prospect—and it was not just the Minister for Defence, as I think the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Downer) got into the act as well—of prepositioning American equipment in Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I recall, when the US Secretary of Defense was asked by the Australian media about that on the eve of the talks, he said, `It is not on the agenda.' The Americans had no interest in pursuing it yet, for some weeks prior to that, senior government ministers were floating those ideas around. I think it was part of a public relations spin that the government wanted to put on its defence policy. It wanted to somehow say, `Our defence posture is different from the former government's defence posture and, in relation to our critical alliance with the United
         <break page="5693" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          States, as a new Liberal government, as a new coalition government, our relationship is better than the former Labor government's relationship with America.'
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I can understand why the government, for some political gain, might want to put that twist on it, but everybody in the defence and foreign affairs organisation understands quite well that that was never the case. The relationship with the United States under the former government was extremely close, as it is under this government. That is only proper and it is something on which there is a bipartisan view. But putting that public relation spin on it, as the government sought to do, generated a lot of questions in the minds of people around the globe, and particularly in this part of the world, by talking about joint deployments with the United States troops in our region. When the government starts talking up joint deployments with the United States in our region, I guess a few people in the region start asking in which country in the region joint deployments are anticipated. I think that is not an unreasonable sort of response that people in the region might have to that sort of proposition.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I can recall the rhetoric that the government used, for example, in relation to the Tandem Thrust exercise, a major joint exercise. The government claimed great credit for having established the Tandem Thrust arrangements, saying that this was a new symbol of some closer ties when it was, frankly, a figment of the imagination of the PR people. I am indebted to the minister for acknowledging, on one occasion in the parliament, that the Tandem Thrust exercise was set in train by the former Labor government. It is not something that we have sought to criticise the government about.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What I do get concerned about is the small&amp;hyphen;minded public relations spin that the government sought to put on the Tandem Thrust exercise in its early days and following the Ausmin talks, claiming it as theirs and trying to say, `Here's the evidence that we have a much closer relationship with America than the former Labor government.' But when there were a few questions, comments and concerns flying about regarding the Tandem Thrust exercise, we had the government saying, `Really, it wasn't the coalition's initiative. This was actually a Labor initiative and we followed it through.' Yes, it was a Labor initiative, and yes, the government did follow it through, and yes, we support that.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What the government seems not to understand is that the public relations spin it puts on these things has an impact not just on the Australian psyche but also on the views of others in the region, because it is not taken in isolation. It is taken on the back of the enormous incompetence displayed by the government, and particularly the foreign minister, in things like the DIFF program, which strained relations with many key countries. Those sorts of statements are seen together. They are seen together with the debate about the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and with the way in which the Prime Minister actually defended that member's right to go and say all the things she said. But then when people like the Lord Mayor of Brisbane come out and attack the member for Oxley what does the Prime Minister do? The Prime Minister actually attacks the Lord Mayor of Brisbane for having the hide to criticise her.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         People in the region watch this, and they put it all together and say, `What is the new relationship with the United States that this new Liberal government talks about? What is their attitude to us, given what they have done to DIFF? What is their attitude to multiculturalism and engagement with the region when, at the most senior levels in government, they actively support the sorts of comments that the Independent member for Oxley makes and criticise those in the Labor Party who attack her?' All of those things go toward building confusion

         program, and the views about the United States. There is one, though, that I should mention because it came up during the course of last week and the minister raised it in parliament, and it has to do with our relationship with China, which is a critically important relationship and, indeed, a very important area on which I would prefer to see a united bipartisan view.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I commend the decision of the Chief of the Defence Force to go to China. I note the progress that has been made there by him and Hugh White. I think that is a very worthwhile and desirable thing. Part of the problem is that we are in the process of patching up a relationship that has become worse because of blundering over the course of the last 15 months. The relationship Australia had with China was, I think, a very mature and mutually advantageous one at all levels and in all spheres, whether in terms of trade, security or diplomacy. The relationship with China that this government inherited from the former Labor government was a very good one indeed.

        <para first-indent="16">
         What we saw through those things I have just mentioned, and particularly the blundering of the foreign minister in the DIFF program, was a worsening of that relationship—not assisted, I might say, by the Minister for Defence.

         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australian

It might be better if the briefs provided by departments to the minister, particularly in this area, were dealt with a little bit

         That goes back to my first point. The first thing this government should have done was sit down and, in its own mind, determine what it saw as our place in the world and what it saw as our strategic position. Frankly, had I been the incoming minister, that is exactly what I would have done. There should have been a new strategic review with the new incoming government and everyone would have said, `Fine, you're entitled to do that; go for it and make it public and put your stamp on it.'
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Having done that, you then sort out what you think the structure of defence should be; you need to address that and you then set about building that structure. We skipped the first two steps with this government and went about making a whole series of changes in the structure. I think that is very much the cart before the horse.

         I should make one final comment in terms of the strategic situation before I move on to other matters. That is to say that some time later this year the minister will have the final report of the strategic review. I would be willing to bet good money that the minister has already seen drafts of the strategic review. When that final document is available, I would simply urge him to ensure that there is a public release of a suitable document.

         When this matter has been raised in the past—and it has been raised in estimates committees; it has been raised directly by the media with the minister—he has declined to give a commitment. In fact, at the estimates committee his departmental people nearly got stumped because they intuitively said, yes, there would be a publicly released version, only to be told very quickly that no, that is not the minister's position. They had to retract that in the estimates committee and say that this was a matter that the minister would give consideration to when the report was finally done.

         Minister and Madam Deputy Speaker, the public release of a strategic review document I think is very important. We have led the region over the last decade in providing some transparency and in building confidence about what our view of the world is. We have encouraged other people in the region to do precisely the same and we have had success. In recent years we have seen a number of countries move to our model of a publicly released strategic review. It is a confidence building measure, not just between us and our neighbours, but amongst all the peoples of our region.

         It is important that we do not retreat from making available a public document that sets out our view of the region. As I said, we have been successful in encouraging others in the region to do the same. The minister has not ruled it out but he has certainly cast doubt on that in the press conference at the release of the DER and again through the Senate estimates committee. If the minister can confirm that there will be a document publicly released, I can assure him that that decision will be greatly welcomed by me and the opposition.

         There are a number of things that are important in terms of the structure, and I should make some comment about the defence efficiency review because, whilst the budget papers are scant in relation to that, certainly in this financial year we will see a number of very important changes made to the structure of the defence forces as a result of the defence review program. The defence efficiency review is now translated into a defence review program.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This defence review program is a bit like the phantom: it is everywhere and it is nowhere. This is the phantom set of documents or set of decisions. The minister might not just aid public debate and accountability in the parliament. He might help inform some of his own

         The government has spoken about a DRP, defence review program, and we have had press releases from the minister, as is his want, to announce major changes—press releases, again, without policy. So we have this series of decisions, and one of them says, `There is going to be a defence review program and we intend to have the whole lot of this in place by 1 July.' One of the things that became apparent after about six minutes of questioning at the Senate estimate's committee only last week is that, at the most senior levels, the people in the Defence Department have not got a clue what the DRP is. That is not because they are not good and proper officials, it is because the direction and guidance from government is simply not there.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Let us see a consolidated DRP. Let us see a consolidated government response. Let us see the detail of what the government plans to do in pursing those matters that were identified by the defence efficiency review. It does not exist. There is not even a collation of orders from the CDF. There is no document that can be identified. There is no collation of documents that can be identified as the defence review program. If there is, I would invite the minister to describe it, identify them in this debate. Better still, let them become available for some sort of public scrutiny or at least let a public version of them become available so that the people of Australia will have some idea of what it is that this government intends to do with the defence forces of Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is a fairly fundamental area of accountability I would have thought. The government should tell the people of Australia what it is doing with the defence forces of Australia. To date, what we have got is a one&amp;hyphen;page press release and a lot of confused answers from senior officers of the Department of Defence who themselves are trying to figure out what the heck it is that the government wants of them. This is a major management question that the government has simply glossed over.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Let me go to some of the things that are probably in the defence review program because they are certainly in the defence efficiency review, at least that document is public. There is to be a significant cut in the number of defence personnel. We are, I think, anticipating a civilian and uniform personnel, full&amp;hyphen;time, change of 8,000 positions, 5,000 of those being uniform. Of those 5,000 uniform positions, about 2,200 are anticipated to be shifted to other areas, which leaves you with a net cut between 2,500 and 3,000 uniformed personnel. That is in the first tranche.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is a second tranche that covers some 13,000 positions and, of those 13,000 positions, I believe 5,000 of those are uniform. I believe the estimate of how many uniform positions are likely to go out of that is about 3,000. So we are looking at a reduction in uniformed strength of about 5,000 directly as a result of this efficiency review. This goes to force structure. It is not about how to make the place run more efficiently. It is changing the very bricks and mortar that make up the defence force. This is force structure.

         Let us forget all this gobbledegook about how it was only about efficiency and saving dollars. When you cut 5,000 uniform people and about another 10,000 civilians out of an organisation, when you propose the sale of major defence bases, when you propose to amalgamate the first division deployable headquarters with NORCOM—which is actually in your DER documents—when you propose those sorts of fundamental force structure changes, forget about all this rhetoric telling me and others that this is about efficiencies. It has got nothing to do with efficiencies—well, it does to the extent that those people were set a task of finding somewhere between $500 million and $1,000 million a year, and they did that for you. But in doing that, they went to the very heart of force structure questions.

         At the end of the day, we will end up with a permanent uniform force in Australia of about 50,000 people, and the end of the day is pretty soon. The end of the day is about two or three years down the track. We will have 50,000 full&amp;hyphen;time uniform personnel. In army, air force and navy, the total strength will be 50,000 full&amp;hyphen;time uniform personnel. That represents the lowest number of full&amp;hyphen;time uniform personnel that Australia has had since 1962. This government will preside over a cut in uniform strength in the full&amp;hyphen;time defence personnel to levels not seen since 1962.

That is the lowest number of full&amp;hyphen;time uniform personnel in the army this country has seen since 1951.

         That is the result of what the government have done, and they have done all this without a strategic review and without a force structure analysis. They will reduce the defence forces to their lowest level in 40 years, without any concept of where we are in the region and what the structure of our forces should be to address that analysis. That is gross incompetence. But worse than gross incompetence, it presents for Australia a major problem. If at the next election there is a change of government, it will present for us, as the new government, with major challenges to put right those things which you will already have undone.

          I want to make some comment about the Holsworthy base because that has come under some significant scrutiny. The Department of Defence has a committee that is looking at what they will do, if Holsworthy has to close as a defence base, to make way for a second airport. As the minister should know, that committee has also had to consider not just what happens at Holsworthy, but also the impact on surrounding airports—both civil and military—and the impact on the opportunity for live firing ranges in that important part of Australia.

Some, I think, would be ongoing. They certainly were in the last budget and possibly are in this budget.

You have got to say that that is probably part of the problem rather than part of the solution. The Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel has given to coining a phrase, `Bishop's principles'.

She said, `I'll help in any way I can with letters of support, telephone calls, visits or whatever is required.' Now there is some hard&amp;hyphen;hitting policy development for you! The Minister for Defence Industry has said, `I'll do anything I can to help you. I'll write letters. I'll make phone calls.' The fact of life is that she is a standing joke in the defence industry community. The pity of it is that defence industry policy has gone down the drain in the same way general industry policy has.

            That really is a major problem and it can be glossed over, but the government has abandoned the defence industry systems that were put in place. Indeed, DER recommends that things like the defence industry development program be abolished. The government is going to do those things. It is going to take away the small measure of support that was there. There are success stories out of the DID program and, of course, there are failures. Any investment of that kind is going to reap failures as well as successes.

            The simple fact is that, in a process of looking at dollars and having no concept of where we are heading with defence, these decisions have been taken which are harmful and destructive to defence industry. Defence industry is critical to defence capability, and the minister and the government will say that. Unfortunately, they have done nothing to substantiate those words. Worse, they have stripped away measures that were in place before.

I was also pleased that the honourable member has chosen not to put about the sort of nonsense that he put about last year when, after all, we are supposed to be talking about Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1997-98. Last year he claimed that there was a decrease in actual outlays in last year's budget even though he had spent a long period of time being educated by some of the people from the department.

The fact that we got some outsiders was absolutely essential, I felt, because you cannot make radical change totally from within. You must have both the insiders and some outsiders evaluating those circumstances.

Quite frankly, making these changes will only enable us to keep up, in my view. We have some major decisions to make, as the shadow minister knows, in regard to major platform decisions—not necessarily acquiring—because these lead times are so very great.

         He also made the comment about the army being down to 20,000. My figures show that the army was down because national service was in place in the early days and it was down to those figures in the early 1960s. Every military organisation in the world is cutting its numbers. Why are the numbers being cut? Firstly, it is a matter of expense but, secondly, the platforms are getting very sophisticated and expensive and they are being operated by fewer people.

         It is exactly the same as making motor cars or driving caterpillar tractors. The military is no different. One man with the right equipment around him, whether it is for making holes in the air, or whether it is in the army or the navy, is doing far more because of the sophistication and the cost of the equipment that he has got. That cost enables that sophistication and capability. So, it is not a possibility under these sorts of budgetary restraints to be able to do everything. If we are going to have soldiers kitted out with the sorts of communications and abilities that we see today, they are extraordinarily more expensive than a soldier 20 years ago.

          —There are many commendable aspects of the veterans' affairs portfolio. Indisputably, this area—like areas such as immigration until more recent times, when the Prime Minister decided to run shotgun on that portfolio—has had a large degree of bipartisanship. We certainly recognise commendable aspects of this budget: medication management, the look at compliance packaging, the attempt to reduce the problems for people with memory lapses and eyesight problems—at the same time, it is not only altruism, with savings of $20 million in the government's predictions over the next four years—and the extension of disability pension to another 10,500 people and also some service pension and defence service home extensions to a small number.

         As we have indicated in many speeches in RSL conferences around the country and in correspondence with constituents, commendable aspects of the budget include also the continuation of Their Service—Our Heritage, and equally the minister's emphasis—understandable, I would think, from his background—on rural and remote areas, in regard to information delivery and information on home safety and security measures, et cetera. But I should say that, at the same time, this causes me concern, parallel with Medicare offices throughout this country. We find some country seats with three and four offices, conveniently, but many in urban New South Wales and suburban electorates, where Mr Deputy Speaker and I reside, are totally without Medicare offices in 1997.

         We support the provision for rural and remote areas; we recognise the significant numbers of veterans in those areas and the difficulties that they have because of distance, et cetera, and perhaps, to some degree, the lack of information. We support these gestures—the linking of this with state and federal departments—but we want to be very certain that we do not see, as a consequence of this, a shift in resources long term within the department.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Further with regard to resources, we see that the average staff numbers for the portfolio in the 1997&amp;hyphen;98 financial year will be cut by 610 from 3,406. That includes a reduction of 275 positions as a direct result of the government's imposition on the portfolio of an efficiency dividend of 14.3 per cent over three years. Once again, there has been a long&amp;hyphen;term commitment on both sides of politics that there should be service delivery by a separate entity, by a separate department. One has to question the critical mass of this department long term, with these kinds of reductions in the number of employees in the department, and to question, considering the aging of Australia's population, and more particularly veterans, whether that is going to be a defensible position in the long term.

He said, furthermore:

         There is a very distinct possibility that there are going to be longer term questions for the level, quantity, extent and timeliness of the service provided to veterans posed by these kinds of reductions. They are significant, they are noticeable. It is all right to go around assuring various conferences that you believe in this department, you believe these are a distinct part

          of the welfare community in this country, they have particular needs, they have a particular need for services. But if you have a situation where these kind of reductions are occurring, then there must be some concerns.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other reason that there must be increasing questions as to bipartisanship in this field is the interaction of this department with a number of others. It is no good going around and simply telling people, `We are going to give this much for the south Goulburn memorial,' or, `We are going to do this in Roma,' and so on, when we see that there are very noticeable changes in the Department of Social Security, changes that are going to impact directly on veterans. We saw a significant number of those in aged care in regard to income support in this country. The veteran community in this country does want to see the minister in there fighting and taking on the Social Security and Treasury direction that is dominating decision making.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In the long term, as we look at this portfolio, it cannot be just distinguished to one side by a fixation with commemorative activities and belief that in the long term that is going to simply impress veterans as being the ant's pants of the whole portfolio. There is a concern about what is happening throughout the portfolio, and the impact of other portfolios upon it.

         In 1996, we saw $1.26 billion slashed from social security over a two&amp;hyphen;year period in this country. Again in this budget of far less strenuous reductions, the fact of life in 1997 is that after two budgets there are cuts of $1.16 billion over three years. They are obviously having a very big impact upon the constituency of this minister and upon the people that he is representing. The opposition, veterans and older people in this country are not a collection of Man Fridays finding Robinson Crusoes in regard to this particular budget. It is not one off; it is not the only budget in which there have been failures to defend standards and conditions in the portfolio.

We saw the introduction of user charges in HACC or home care and there have been arguments that veterans are particularly discriminated against because of a lack of recognition by state authorities that they are actually responsible for these people and they are not just shoved totally into the control of veterans' affairs. Last year saw earning credits altered and obviously changes in deeming. When we come to this particular budget, it is not a one&amp;hyphen;off situation.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I will turn to some of the aspects of this particular budget. One measure involves saving $15.5 million over four years and relates to various panels for diagnosis. I want to put on the record some of the comments made by the Vietnam Veterans' Association. Quite obviously they have deeper concerns about this, because they have a view—and it has been articulated by departmental representatives as well—that PTSD is the main target of the government. There have been throwaway lines about back problems and other things, but the diagnosis of this condition is one which does seem to be the government's thrust.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Vietnam Veterans' Association reminded me that even the Agent Orange royal commission stated in 1985:

         Furthermore, the 1992&amp;hyphen;93 Auditor&amp;hyphen;General's report is apparently argued as being a very distinct and very influential reason as to why the government is attacking the rights of these veterans in regard to their compensation. This is the document which is the seminal driving force behind the change to smash these people's conditions and—as has been said by the department—deprive five per cent of people of their compensation, that is, 150 of the 30,000 applicants every year who are supposedly the target of this change. This not very sympathetic report said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         It is generally recognised by experts that the background prevalence of PTSD for Vietnam veterans is quite high—the ANOA's consultants suggest it is perhaps 30% of all veterans. . .
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         Furthermore, they put the point that PTSD is not the only psychiatric problem facing Vietnam veterans. In fact, they state:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Statistics from 1993 to 1997 show that some 40% of psychiatric conditions accepted as war caused by the Repatriation system were conditions other than PTSD.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         They further indicate that a particular study of 84 members of the D company—of whom only 30 per cent were at the battle of Long Tan—found that nearly 30 per cent had full blown PTSD, whilst a further 55 per cent suffered some of the list of symptoms associated with it—a total of 85 per cent with war caused psychological damage.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What we have is a variety of government reports—most of them unsympathetic, most of them critical and most of them driven by the attempt to reduce government expenditure—saying that this is a very real problem for Vietnam veterans. What we are seeing as part of this budget process is an attempt by the government to make a major change in regard to panel diagnosis under the pretext or veneer of a whole lot of veterans trying to be corrupt, undermine or steal money from the government. As I say, they have a variety of suggestions as to how they are going to cut this down.

         Furthermore, from personal analysis by people who are immediately connected with these particular Vietnam veterans, the veterans have said:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         That more and more are hitting the wall is not surprising either. We are reaching the age where our youthful energy is deserting us. Before, we could suppress our ailments and `soldier on'.

         So in all of the plaudits, in all of the aspects of this budget that we do find commendable, that we are happy with and where we feel the minister is putting up what should occur, this is one area where there must be grave concerns about the thrust of government policy.

          What is occurring there is, on all appearances, a very reasonable concern that this is a significant assault. The government might say at this stage that it is only 150. But, quite frankly, I think a number of service organisations, the opposition and the general public have to be vigilant because  this might be one of the few areas where the government is understating for the next few years what it expects to accomplish from this. It does seem a very interesting facet that to tackle only 150 cases that they supposedly claim are sham, corrupt or improper over that period of time needs this kind of emphasis from the government.

          There are other aspects of the budget. One that has been raised very strongly, both in this portfolio and in Social Security, is the question of the government's changes with regard to pharmaceuticals. From recollection, the figure is $39 million in savings over the next four years. This interfaces with the health department and it is interesting to note that, a year ago, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) said, `The new drugs are actually better and I would like to have Australians having access to the best and newest drugs.' He would like them to get access, but the fact of life is that in 1997, in this budget which this minister is part of, there is a very significant attempt to essentially reduce the ability of people to get access when they cannot afford it.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I note that the Secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, Dr Johnston, told the Senate estimates committee last week that:

         <para font-size="-=2">
          . . . I would be misleading you if I did not indicate that there is an expectation that treating doctors will be a bit more questioning in the prescription of some of these treatments and will not proceed with that in all cases.

          Assurances by the minister that, really, this is going to have a minimal impact are deflated, undermined, criticised and basically ridiculed by the comments of the secretary of the department that there is going to be a fundamental impact.

         <para first-indent="16">
          In the budget papers there is a figure of $39 million over four years, so to say that it is not going to have an impact, that it is not going to hurt people and, at the same time, to be recouping and saving that kind of money really does raise very significant questions. Both the delisting of these medicines and the therapeutic group premiums will have a significant impact on the portfolio. The opposition have indicated that they have concerns about these, as have service organisations.

          The question of what is occurring with peoples' rights and with the panel diagnosis is interrelated with another part of government policy. That is, the way in which other departments are eroding peoples' rights to actually take on departments, including this department, and this government. Amongst those changes has been a very strong attack on legal aid. There is also the question of the Human Rights and Equal Commission.

          Not only do we have the question of what they are doing on the pharmaceuticals front, but we also have the question of what the impact of aged care changes is on a population that is significantly present amongst older Australians, that is, the veterans community.

          —I wanted to use this opportunity to raise with the minister the matter of the exclusion from eligibility for repatriation benefits of members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in what was then Malaya in the period 1955 to 1960. In doing that, I think it is a matter that previous governments of both shades ought to have addressed but did not, regrettably.

I submit that, and veterans from that time submit, all RAN ships were involved in operations that clearly meet that category.

         Can I just say at the outset that we often get calls that we are not doing enough for veterans. That is so for both sides of the parliament as the opposition did so when in government. I just remind us all in this committee here this morning that we do appropriate almost $6.4 billion to care for our veteran community, our war widows and some dependants of veterans. It is important that we do focus on that fact from time to time. The government does see this very much as a bipartisan portfolio and we do give thanks for the shadow minister's comments in that area as well as some areas that he has flagged that he has some concerns in. It is important that we do acknowledge that all governments have tried as hard as they can to make sure they meet as many of the needs of our veteran community as possible. Given the constraints of budgets from time to time, it is not possible to extend some areas as far as perhaps we would like.

Admittedly, at the time they came to government, the ownership of all repatriation hospitals was with the Commonwealth.

         During their time in government, we saw the staff of the Department of Veterans' Affairs fall from something like 13,000 down to 3,400 or thereabouts. The large numbers of reductions in staffing certainly were associated with the privatisation of those repatriation hospitals which we in opposition supported. I would remind the opposition, when they talk about the outsourcing of some activities of the department today, to just look at what they did when they were in government. I also remind them that we supported them in that process.

         It is important that we do look at the efficiency of the department, as you should look at the efficiency of government.

Through running an efficient department and making savings, we have been able to deliver in this budget an extension of benefits to veterans who were not previously entitled to them. I will refer to a couple of those.

          The member for Maribyrnong raised the issue of the Far East Strategic Reserve in relation to the Malaysian emergency. I would refer him to our press release. If he has not already read it, I would commend it to him because we picked that up in the budget. We conducted a review of the anomalies we spoke out about prior to the election. We not only picked up the Far East Strategic Reserve, we picked up 11 other areas of anomalies.

          —I will speak very briefly on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1997&amp;hyphen;98 with respect to the Department of Transport and Regional Development, primarily because there is very little of great consequence in this current budget with respect to transport—so much so that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development was able to put out only two press releases as a result of the transport decisions in the budget. I will deal in brief detail with the issues that the two press releases dealt with.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Firstly, on the question of roads, in the budget of last year the government cut $622 million from the forward estimates for the national highway over the four years of that budgetary year and the three subsequent forward estimates years. Yet again, in the current budget, we have seen reductions, albeit slight, in overall road funding. The major savage decisions were made last year; they have been continued this year and, indeed, slightly exacerbated.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is noteworthy also that particular states, such as Queensland and Victoria, appear to be bearing the brunt of the reduction in road funding that has occurred. In my state of Victoria, for example, throughout the entirety of the 1990s up to last year Victoria received between 20 and 21 per cent of total federal road funding. That percentage went down to something like 17.9 per cent in last year's budget, and in this year's budget it is declining even further, to 15.9 per cent. Similar patterns can be seen with respect to road funding in Queensland.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is also notable in this year's budget that the proportion of funds going to the roads of national importance category—or, as I call it, the roads of National Party importance category—has increased again, at the cost of the national highway. In Labor's last budget, the national highway had an allocation of $834 million. That is a figure that was roughly similar, in real terms, across almost all of the time when Labor was in government. In this budget the national highway allocation is $697 million; there has been a very substantial drop from the $834 million in the 1995 budget to the $697 million in this budget.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is true that there is $112 million allocated for roads of national importance but, by definition, that will not go to the national highway. It will go elsewhere, based on highly dubious and, I suggest, very open&amp;hyphen;ended criteria which are designed ultimately to allow all sorts of pork&amp;hyphen;barrelling on the part of the minister to occur and are already, effectively, being used for that purpose.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I turn to the second issue on which the minister managed to get a press release out. His press release with respect to roads did not exactly tell us the true story about what has been happening with road funding over the past 15 months, and similarly his press release with respect to the national rail infrastructure authority or the track authority, which we have just been debating in the main chamber this morning, was a little less than forthcoming.
        </para>
        <break page="5715" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          The former Labor government proposed to spend $370 million over five years to allow the then Track Australia to own and operate the interstate track and to maintain the interstate track in Australia—a very important infrastructure investment and micro&amp;hyphen;economic reform. In last year's budget this decision was continued but cut from $370 million to roughly $245 million, I think, from memory. This time around, the minister has announced that the amount that will be spent will be a mere $175 million. His press release said $175 million; the budget papers, at table 12.4, I think, from memory, said that the figure would be $185 million. I am not even quite sure that he can get the figure right. He thinks he cut it by $10 million more than he actually did, by the look of it.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In any event, the minister tried to turn a cut, a vice, into a virtue by putting out a press release announcing—yet again—something that the former government had announced, something that his government had announced and something that was being announced in the context of substantial reductions in funding. He was trying to pretend that this was a wonderful decision for the rail industry and transport in Australia, when in fact it is a terrible decision. It is something that I think anybody who has got any association with the rail industry—users, workers and communities that depend on the rail industry—will live to regret. They will regret that this substantial reduction in the level of investment that goes into maintaining and upgrading the track, which is of particular importance in many areas such as the Brisbane to Melbourne and Melbourne to Adelaide sections of the interstate track, is occurring; that the process of negotiating with the states to develop the authority appears to have stalled; and that the minister is trying on this very day to get a bill through the parliament which will give him the power to make all the decisions with respect to the future track authority without any future reference to the parliament.

Again, in the 1997&amp;hyphen;98 budget, it copped another slug. So where does it leave the national highway program, when the former Labor government was only spending about $840 million each year: $622 million over four years, and we were only spending about $840 million? That gives you a very clear indication of the significance of that slug. As a result, national highway projects right around the country have ground to a halt.

          —You are not doing much to help it. Cessnock has some economic difficulties. The council wants to do something about that. It wants to start by refurbishing the central business district but it cannot make a move while ever that main street is accommodating 400 heavy vehicles each day.

         So Cessnock council is looking at some alternatives. It has now undertaken a study into a simple bypass of the town, a $33 million project which would effectively take those heavy vehicles out of Cessnock's central business district and out of those roads such as Allandale Road and Aberdare Road which house a number of residents. Of course, this thing has to be funded. We should not fear because the present Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp)—or should I say just `Transport' since his statement that the Commonwealth has no role to play in the area of regional development—when he was shadow minister, visited Cessnock and spoke with Cessnock council and the National Party candidate about their concerns. What did he say? `You need not fear. We will have a fund in government known as roads of national importance'—or significance—`and this looks like a project which could quite neatly fit into such a scheme.' That is what he had to say before the election but we have not heard from him since.

        <para first-indent="16">
         So what are Cessnock council's options? It is now asking the state government to fund the project; as I said, it is some $33 million. You know, Mr Deputy Speaker, how difficult it is to get that sort of money out of a state government for a road project. The council will be visiting the minister, the now minister, to ask him to meet his commitment from prior to the election, but I fear that they have very little hope. I cannot see them spending $33 million—

          —One of the most disturbing things to have occurred during the life of this parliament is the demise of regional development as a serious portfolio responsibility of the government. Regional development is paid lip&amp;hyphen;service. It was given very uneven attention by the previous government, I might say, although at the very end of its term Labor seemed to get things right in at least one area with the creation of the RDOs, those regional development organisations which, finally, after years of similar bodies, state and federal, with overlapping responsibilities and no real purpose, seemed to have the right formula. The personnel was right, the plans were in place, and the expectations were credible. What did this government do? It eliminated RDOs because of the Labor taint and it eliminated in all but name the Department of Regional Development—and this from a senior National Party minister. No wonder the people in the bush are scratching their heads in bewilderment and looking elsewhere to put their votes.

          One of the most cynical exercises was this government's complete rejection—having promised to support it—of the feasibility study into Parkes export airport. I mentioned this in more detail in my response in relation to primary industry expenditure last night. Western New South Wales feels rejected by the government's walking away from a miserly $250,000 commitment to a project that looks like coming up trumps, despite the government's lack of interest and, I might say, lack of vision.

          I welcome the funding for a national rail infrastructure, but I wonder if it will benefit the main western rail line through New South Wales, Bathurst, Parkes and Broken Hill. That infrastructure needs urgent attention to take advantage of the natural advantages, the rail freight facilities at Bathurst, Blayney and Parkes, combined with the north&amp;hyphen;south Newell Highway road intersection office. As well, by encouraging heavy freight onto rail, and hub and spoking smaller loads from depots, such as Bathurst, Blayney and Parkes, the load is taken off both the highways and the highway budget.

          One hundred and seventy&amp;hyphen;five million dollars over four years is fine, but far more will be needed if we are serious about rail regaining and exploiting its potential to save money. It is rational economics—the cost of not having heavy and hazardous freight on rail. The impact of that is there for everyone to see at the moment: the risk of accidents; the breaking up of road surfaces; and the struggle by local government to meet its road commitments, especially with its FAGs, those federal assistance grants, cut by 1.2 per cent in real per capita terms in this budget.

         <para first-indent="16">
          It is interesting, too, to note the concern now being expressed by local governments and states about the impact of changes in load allowances. The air suspension on the new generation of trucks is being regarded with grave suspicion, with data showing bridge damage likely to be substantial from the double&amp;hyphen;B era of vehicles. I suspect that the $11 million set aside for a national survey of bridge requirements might turn up some interesting data. While this government supports increased mass weights on vehicles on the premise that it will mean fewer vehicles, the so&amp;hyphen;called road friendly suspensions may not, according to my information, be so friendly after all.

          At a time when the west of New South Wales is crying out for support, it seems that this government, as did the one before—except on the Mount Lambie section, and then only after extreme public pressure led by the Highway Safety Action Group—will continue to disregard the claims of the Great Western Highway for national highway status. Coalition members across the mountain should hang their heads in shame, if they are not pushing for this status. Not only is it a major tourist link through their districts to the historical goldfields and other attractions of the central west, but also it is a main artery, feeding traffic to and from the west.

         <para first-indent="16">
          With increased loads, both in size and frequency, of timber and farm produce and other items travelling the route, this link is a potential social, physical and economic disaster. Its accident record is worse than that along the Pacific Highway. The absence of any commitment to the western rail line is hampering growth and decentralisation. I realise that we are a vast country with a huge demand on the $697 million road budget. But smart spending on an integrated rail and highway transport system should include the main western rail line and the Great Western Highway.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It is apparent, of course, that the bureaucracy generally would advise governments about the structure of the bureaucracy and the relationship between portfolios. To have a Department of Transport and Regional Development is a very sensible arrangement and a very sensible connection. In July last year, we had the government announcing that the regional development and urban programs within this Department of Transport and Regional Development would be terminated and so the funding was withdrawn. The Department of Transport and Regional Development then in effect became the Department of Transport. The Minister for Transport (Mr Sharp) is quite clearly charged with the responsibility, as Minister for Transport, not to develop transport but to tear away funding, to destroy programs and to sell off the assets. That is the role which the Minister for Transport has been required to adopt.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Mr Deputy Speaker, I think there is a great deal of concern in regional Australia about the fact that this government, in effect, has turned its back on it. To a large extent, the government has allowed economic forces to determine the direction in which regional development will go. That simply is not good enough. Governments do have a responsibility for national planning, for determining regional strategies and for acting as a catalyst for the type of development that needs to be undertaken. If you allow, for example, market forces to determine the nature and the direction of regional development in Australia, you can finish up with the type of thing that we are seeing now in places like Geelong and Newcastle.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Newcastle, for example, I referred to yesterday. BHP has made a decision that the primary steelmaking capacity and facilities in Newcastle will disappear from September 1999. The free marketeers and the economic rationalists might well say that is the way the market is taking us. The point that I emphasis is that that betrays a complete lack of understanding about what regional development and regional economies are all about.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In Australia we do have very significant identifiable regions. They are integrated and they are coordinated. They operate as regions. Allowing steel, for example, to come out of the Newcastle region or the Hunter region would be like saying, `Here is an engine of a motor car with a bit here that probably is not necessary. We will allow that to be taken out,' and you take out the carburettor. The engine then, of course, stops operating.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Mr Deputy Speaker, that is probably a good example of the essential role which the component elements of regional economies play and the way in which each of them depend on other sections of it. What we need is a national government which is prepared to provide leadership in questions of national development. National development takes place as a result of the coordinated and the integrated development of each of those regions and the contribution which in turn each of them make.

          best examples are the wholesale closing of offices and government agencies in the regions of Australia. In the budget of last year there were 11,200 in the public service, many of them in regional Australia, who lost their jobs. This year another 16,500 and in addition to that 8,000 in the defence forces in Australia. As a result of other decisions made by this government another 22,000 telecommunications workers are going to lose their jobs. Many of these are in regional Australia.

          —I had not intended to enter this debate but the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) has just encouraged me to rise to my feet to respond to one portion of what he had to say. I, as much as anyone else, regret that we will no longer make primary steel at Newcastle. That hurts me and I think the honourable member acknowledges that. But to imply that somehow government, through lack of production of infrastructure, or BHP itself, or between the government and BHP, we should continue to make a product unprofitably is just an absolute nonsense. That is not economic rationalism. It would be totally irrational to continue to make products for which you lose money.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The honourable member for Charlton, no matter how his sympathies may lie, will have to admit that the communist theory and philosophy, the Marxist theory and philosophy, failed and so the walls came tumbling down. The world, even China, has become enamoured of the free market. No matter how much you might dislike it, nonetheless that is a fact. It is a fact that BHP cannot afford to make a product for which they lose money, as they are doing. A large portion of the product of that mill is exported because there is not enough domestic market. The product out of that mill, the bar and rod and wire, is more expensive than product made by Smorgons in Melbourne or a BHP in Sydney, because those operations use electric arc furnaces.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To the best of my knowledge—and I would bet on it—nobody will ever build another blast furnace in the world. Not one more blast furnace will ever be built. Today, some of the more recent ones are absolutely huge—I believe, 3.5 million tonnes for one blast furnace. When I grew up on a blast furnace, a million&amp;hyphen;tonne unit was a huge blast furnace, absolutely gigantic. Those expanded themselves, but to build a new furnace at 3.5 million tonnes is just unheard off.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The point is that those old furnaces with old technology just cannot compete with a scrap fed electric arc furnace. BHP ain't got the scrap to feed to Newcastle, because Australia's scrap is already consumed by Smorgons, by BHP and by whoever else it is in Sydney.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am not an apologist for BHP; I regret the fact that Newcastle is going to close. I simply make the point to the member for Charlton that you have to make economic decisions based on profits and on losses. It is not the government's fault that the world price for bar and rod has fallen with respect to its price for flat product. Port Kembla is profitable and Port Kembla is expanding. Why? Because it makes flat product, it makes it in modern facilities and those furnaces will run, I hope, for a very long time.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is not economic rationalism per se, nor is it some sort of economic conspiracy against the people of Newcastle. I think all of us have the greatest sympathy for the people of Newcastle.
         <break page="5720" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          I certainly hope that we can find mechanisms to help Newcastle to help itself to attract new industry and new jobs, and build an exciting future that is not dependent on the old steel mill, not dependent on old technology. As much as I regret their losing that culture, I know—because I am an old steelworker—that old steelworkers never die. We never forget our steel mills. It is part of our life and part of our culture, and nothing else will ever be the same once they have finished. I thank the member for Charlton for his contribution, but he got that little bit wrong.

I was talking about the problems that that will cause for the Cessnock area, in particular. I was calling upon the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) to make good his commitment prior to the election to fund a bypass of Cessnock under the roads of national importance fund—if, indeed, he is not going to commit the government to the Kurri Corridor.

We are talking here about some significant issues and, at the very least, we should have the parliamentary secretary in here. What do we get instead? With the greatest respect to the minister, we get the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) from Queensland, rather than the minister himself or, indeed, the parliamentary secretary. I know that yesterday, Mr Deputy Speaker, either you or one of the other members of the speakers panel passed comment on the fact that ministers were making an effort to get into the Main Committee for these discussions, but it is very unfortunate that the Minister of Transport has not seen fit to do so or even to send his parliamentary secretary up to represent him.

         I want to turn to a short&amp;hyphen;term alternative. Even if the minister funds a bypass of Cessnock tomorrow, it is obviously going to be years before it is constructed and, therefore, the heavy vehicle movement problem in Cessnock is going to remain with us for some time. I myself have described the idea as naive and novel, but it would be wonderful if we could load limit the state road that those heavy vehicles are using. Of course, it is impossible to load limit a state road and, in any case, it would be difficult to differentiate between those trucks that are actually servicing the Cessnock area and those that are using the town only as a short cut to the national highway.

          them to do something which is, as I conceded, fairly novel and which may be naive, and that is to simply ask the trucks not to go through Cessnock and not to devastate our local community. They come through Cessnock simply because it saves them seven minutes and 14 kilometres, that is all. It is not a significant amount of time in the scheme of things, when you are talking about haulages from, for example, Melbourne to Brisbane. It is a saving of only seven minutes and 14 kilometres.

The reason I raise this is that I think my campaign to have them voluntarily withdraw from Cessnock would be greatly enhanced if the state and federal ministers became involved. I have had good responses from the trade union movement, the Road Transport Forum and the New South Wales Road Haulage Association. They are running some campaigns for me, putting some articles in their industry newsletter, et cetera.

There were, in the past, reports suggesting that land around Essendon airport could be rezoned industrial. Fortunately, the government of the day rejected those reports and recommendations, but we have had National Party MPs suggesting that land around the airport might be rezoned industrial. That would be outrageous and a scandalous thing to do to residents in that area, and we seek assurances that in light of private leasing of the Essendon airport there will not be any such attempts.

          —I am very pleased to have this opportunity to participate in the committee stage of the deliberations on the budget that was recently brought down by the government. I want to raise an issue which relates to the matters which have been raised in this debate by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson). My concern is not so much the sale of Essendon airport—although I have expressed a public view on that—but rather the development of Avalon airport as a dedicated air freight hub for the export of perishable products to South&amp;hyphen;East Asia and other destinations. It is a very important consideration for the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) because this particular development impacts on both areas of his portfolio.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would support the view of the honourable member for Wills that Essendon airport ought to be closed down. It is an inappropriate facility to be operating in an inner urban and residential area of a major city. It ought to be closed down and at least part of its functions transferred to Avalon airport.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Avalon was recently leased by the government to a joint venture between Lindsay Fox and a British company, Serco. The Geelong community has long argued for this facility to be developed as an air freight hub for the export of perishable products. I would encourage the government to support the project through the various programs it is funding in this budget, particularly through its supermarkets to Asia strategy and some other programs that might be appropriate. I hope that the minister for transport will examine those programs and assist the development of this facility in whatever capacity he can .
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Avalon airport is situated at the juxtaposition of four key transport assets. There is the airport itself, the Princes Highway, the port of Geelong and the national standard gauge. Very few locations on the face of the earth have this particular transport advantage.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have a skilled labor force in the Geelong region. The proposal that we are mounting to turn Avalon into an air freight hub for the export of perishable products will see produce drawn from the south&amp;hyphen;eastern region of Australia, a four&amp;hyphen;state hinterland comprising Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Riverina of New South Wales.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have tertiary institutions very keen to support this development from a training point of view and some very substantial commercial players that are ready to invest in this development. The government did close ASTAS in its first year, with the loss of 450 highly skilled jobs to the Geelong region. I am asking the minister to look closely at this proposal and the government to look to ways to edge this development along. We believe it offers the Geelong region the opportunity to create 5,000 jobs in the immediate Geelong region, if the vision we have for this facility were to become a reality.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development should assist this particular development on two grounds. The first is the utilisation of a critical transport asset because Avalon is a very high quality airfield compared to others throughout Australia and the second is  regional development because of its job creation potential.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Comparable developments overseas have seen enormous job creation take place around the development of airports as air freight hubs. We certainly have the productive hinterlands to feed this particular facility. All that is required is for the Victorian government to show a bit of metal and a bit of vision and for the federal government to pick up the baton on this project and run with it. I can certainly promise a bipartisan approach to the development of this

          —Mr Deputy Speaker, earlier today I took the opportunity to make some observations about the regional development part of this portfolio, or rather I should say the regional development part which used to be in this portfolio until the present government withdrew all of the funding as a result of the announcement made in June or July of last year.
         </para>

         My comments provoked a response from the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) who has, I acknowledge, a personal interest and background experience in the steel industry. In replying to some comments that I made about the BHP decision to withdraw from primary steel producing in Newcastle and the important core activity that that represented for the regional economy, the member for La Trobe suggested that the market imperatives were of primary importance, if not of exclusive importance. If the market realities were such that profit could not be made for any particular activity, then the obvious decision that private sector owners would make—that is, to close that activity down—would appear to be the most appropriate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I make two points about that, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I do not want to spend too much time on it. The first one is this: BHP in Newcastle makes a profit. The trouble is, BHP in Newcastle is not making the profit that BHP wants, which is  15 per cent return. No steel industry, no steel corporation anywhere in the world is making 15 per cent. BHP Steel in Newcastle makes a profit. That is the first point.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second point I want to make on this question is that the claim made by the free marketeers, the economic rationalists and the economic libertarians to the effect that market realities must be allowed to rule supreme, is something we have to get right away from. If the market mechanism was appropriate to resolve all of the types of problems that the free marketeers appear to suggest, then we would not have any need for government. We would not have any need for any type of mechanism for the maintenance of social order, social equity, social justice and social security. The market would do the lot.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I know people will say, `Oh no, it's absurd to take it that far.' But the point I am making is that, once you start to move along the spectrum of the roles that market mechanisms can fulfil, you have to draw the line somewhere. Market mechanisms will not resolve all of society's problems. That is the very reason why government, in a positive way, exists. If we do not exist for those reasons, then we exist for no reason, and government might just as well wither away.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For 200 years, people have accepted the fact that market mechanisms are not sufficient to overcome the types of social inequities that a free market system, a free market society and a free market economy may cause. For that reason, it has been accepted that government—the public sector—does have a responsibility to attend to those examples of market failure to ensure that where social equity, social justice and social security are not necessarily provided by market forces and the operation of the market, government will be active in those areas. So it is a matter of degree.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Quite clearly, I believe that line should be drawn not so far along as some of the free marketeers would appear to support. Governments do have a role and governments have to accept that role. The sooner we come to some type of rational decision about where
         <break page="5725" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          government responsibility ends and where the indicators of the market can be allowed to operate, then the sooner we will be making a better approach to the whole question of public policy. I spent more time on that than I wanted to.

         The matter I want to go on to now is the general question of transport funding. I said this morning, and I repeat it again, that the area of funding in regional development has been eliminated, so the only area which remains in this portfolio is that of transport.
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          (Extension of time granted)
         </emphasis>
         In the area of transport, I am also concerned about the very significant retreat which has taken place as far as policy is concerned on the part of this government.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In relation to the national highway system, everyone will be aware that in 1974 the Whitlam government adopted that national highway system and established the intercity links all around Australia—not all intercity links, the highway from Brisbane to Cairns was an additional road that was put into the Queensland system. There are other examples around Australia. But 16,000 kilometres of highways around Australia were accepted with full responsibility by the federal government as national highways.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         During the period that I had responsibility in the area of land transport, I declared two additional roads, the Sturt Highway in New South Wales and the Newell Highway in New South Wales, linking Adelaide to Sydney and Melbourne through to Brisbane respectively, as additional lengths of the national highway. That added another 2,500 kilometres, for which the federal government took full responsibility. They were added to the national highway network in January 1994 and they are now locked into it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In this area, where the federal government has primary responsibility, we see that very serious cuts have been made. It was announced that the cuts over a period of years in the Howard government's allocations to national highways would have been a bit over $600 million. In last year's budget the reduction was $113 million. In this year's budget the reduction is $138 million.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the two years that this government has been in office, the real reduction in national highway funding has been over 15 per cent. I well remember, because I was the minister responsible, the criticisms that were levelled at the previous Labor government by the then coalition opposition about the level of funding. The level of funding when Labor was in government averaged in excess of $800 million every year. During the One Nation and Working Nation programs the cabinet was responsible for allocating an additional in excess of $600 million into those road networks.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I draw attention to some of the transport programs and transport initiatives that were taken during those years. I am delighted, of course, in my usual modest way, to take some credit and to take a great deal of pride in some of those initiatives. I have referred already to the 2,500 kilometres of national highway that were extended as a result of the addition of the Sturt and the Newell highways. There were programs for state arterial roads, programs for provincial cities and rural highways, and programs for local roads.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I know that the cuts that have taken place in funding for local roads will mean, for all of those 850 local government authorities around Australia, a reduction of something like 400 kilometres of new sealed road every year. I hope people in local government understand that. I hope they realise where the cuts are being made and who is making them. We introduced the black spots program together with a 10&amp;hyphen;point road safety program and those initiatives together were responsible for bringing down fatalities on the roads each year from something like 2,400 to a number below 2,000. I know that it is now crawling up again.

          Urban public transport provided the states with a lot of urban transport opportunities that would not have been available to them otherwise. We established a National Road Trauma Council, the National Road Transport Commission and the National Rail Corporation, an important initiative which this government is in the process of considering the best way to dispose of it.

          The last decision that I participated in before I ceased to be minister was with Allan Brown, the Victorian transport minister. We came to an agreement to complete the last link—from Melbourne through to Adelaide—in the standardised rail right around Australia. That then stands as a monument not only to the Liberal government in Victoria and Allan Brown as the minister, but also to a Labor government in Canberra and Bob Brown the minister at that time.

          These are the ways in which a national government can accept responsibility not only for transport itself—and the tremendous importance that transport has to the development of the national economy—but for the important role that it plays in regional Australia. That is why those two portfolios are linked together. That is why they should be funded, and funded adequately. This government has betrayed both of them.

          —I wish to address my remarks at this stage of the debate to the regional development portion of the transport and regional development portfolio. It is very clear that there is a central failure of the government's economic policy, especially in relation to the regions of Australia. I travelled throughout those regions after the first budget and after the second budget, and there is a deep sense of betrayal at what the government has done to the regions of Australia in those two budgets.

         Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that infamous first Howard budget when the funding for the regional development program was completely withdrawn by the federal government. For the life of me I cannot understand how the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) can come into the parliament and say that he is the minister for regional development when, by his own admission in that press release after the first budget, he declared that the federal government had no constitutional interest in the area of regional development.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Of course, what followed in that budget was a reduction in business support programs that have hit regional businesses. There has been a massive curtailment in labour market programs that delivered skill formation to rural and regional businesses and, of course, there was the abandonment of the building better cities program, which was a vital conduit for getting moneys into regional businesses throughout Australia. We see that the essential funding has not been restored in the budget that has been delivered by the government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The reflection of the government's failure in the area of regional policy is contained in the unemployment statistics that were released recently. We see that the state of Victoria is bearing the brunt of conservative governments at both the state and federal level, with massive increases in the rate of regional unemployment since the Howard government came to power in March 1996. To quote some of the statistics that have been recently released, we have seen a dramatic increase in the unemployment rate from 8.4 per cent in my particular region, the Barwon&amp;hyphen;Western District region, to 12.9 per cent.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is a massive increase in unemployment in my own region, and that story is repeated throughout the length and breadth of Victoria. Clearly, through the length and breadth of its programs—and not only in this portfolio but in other areas in the budget that it recently delivered—the government is failing to deliver the critical support that is required for the

You rolled over and admitted defeat by saying to the Australian people and to the people in the regions, `We can only manage 3.5 per cent.' You admitted defeat again in the budget that you have just delivered.

         Let me outline some areas of funding going into our regions. We have $75 million going to the Pacific Highway. I well remember the member for Charlton when he was transport minister. I think it was during the election campaign of 1990 and there were the tragedies of the road accidents and deaths on the Pacific Highway. None of us liked witnessing those tragedies. To ensure that the Pacific Highway is funded, we have given the Pacific Highway its own line in the Budget. I think if members on the other side of the House were honest with themselves they would say that the only way to commit to a road such as the Pacific Highway, which was in chronic need of upgrading in many areas to prevent dangerous accidents and many deaths occurring, is to give it its own line in the Budget.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The $75 million of road funding on the Pacific Highway will see jobs created in regional Australia and will also see a much safer road infrastructure in a very fast growing region. We are going to spend $696 million on the national highway system. We have $112 million for roads of national importance. We have reinstated the $36 million that is going to the road safety black spot program that was abolished by the Labor Party. They said that local government could pick up those black spots. We have reinstated it.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We have done a lot for regional development and I have to remind those on the other side of the House of what we have done. There is the $250 million for regional telecommunications infrastructure, another job creation program that will bring much better telecommunications infrastructure into regional Australia. There is $1.25 billion going into the National Heritage Trust, an injection of funds into our greatest natural resource—that is, our land, our rivers, our streams.

         I urge those on the other side of the House to go back to their offices, look up the appropriation bills, find those programs, go into their constituencies and promote them, because they will help their own constituencies. That is their responsibility—to work for their constituents. There are a lot of initiatives that will assist regional and rural communities. There is funding to ensure that we have a national road program. We have identified the needs of the Pacific Highway, with its own line in the Budget. This is a government that understands the needs of our regions, and also understands the need for a national road infrastructure. We are committed to a national highway program.

         In conclusion, I want to thank those members from both sides of the House. I urge them to go and look at the budget appropriation bills, because there are a lot of initiatives there that they can be involved in with their communities and that will advantage their own communities. Many of them, of course, live in regional areas. I thank members.

         The other thing that I want to make brief mention of before we conclude the discussion on the transport appropriation is to make an appeal to the government to consider very carefully what it may finish up doing with the Indian Pacific rail service and perhaps the Ghan service as well. Under the previous government, the Ghan was completely refurbished and became the first major train service of that kind to be significantly improved. There was then a program of $12 million for the refurbishment of the Indian Pacific. There is no question that those two services, in particular, are two of the really great train journeys of the world.

I will be going on that service between Pretoria and Lake Victoria. Let me say at this stage, to get it in the record, that I will be doing that trip at my expense because I am interested in the developed of these services. Rovos is privately owned. Rohan Vos has undertaken private investment for the refurbishment of all of those trains. It is a magnificent service, and I am looking forward to having a look at the way in which private services are operating.

When you talk to them, you get some idea of the number of people who travel to Australia simply to take that trip because they have heard of it. It is a magnificent trip.

         The Prime Minister (Mr Howard), in the lead-up to the election, said that he was going to govern for all Australians. I will tell you what: there is one section of Australia that has lost, and lost dramatically, as a result of this government's decisions in its first two budgets. I would remind the chamber that soon after being elected, the Howard government said that there was no constitutional role for the government to actually serve and assist regional Australia. I must say that to me there is one issue of major importance to regional Australia at the moment. That goes to the questions of jobs and job security. For regional Australia, it has been a wasted 15 months of government; regional Australia has lost. It has lost because of a failure of this government to give support for initiatives aimed at attracting industry and investment. It has lost because this government has really walked away from its responsibility to give ongoing support, for example, to area consultative committees and regional economic development organisations.

         The facts speak for themselves. The Prime Minister, in the lead-up to the recent budget, went all around Australia in the media suggesting that he was going to get relevant. That was the headline in the

          Australian
         </emphasis>

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I will tell you why he had to tell regional Australia that he was going to get relevant: there was one reason and one reason alone. He basically failed regional Australia on the question of jobs. I would like to refer to this government's record with respect to jobs in regional Australia after the first 12 months. It is interesting to note that outside of the capital cities, after the first 12 months of this government, 77 per cent of rural and regional Australia have seen no dent in the unemployment queue.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let us go to a couple of states, because facts speak loudly. Outside of the Melbourne metropolitan area, unemployment went from 8.5 per cent in March 1996 to 10.3 per cent in March 1997. Outside of the Sydney metropolitan area, unemployment went from 9.8 per cent in March 1996 to 10.6 per cent in March 1997. I know the Minister for Veterans' Affairs does not like these facts.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Outside of the Brisbane metropolitan area, unemployment grew from 10.3 per cent to 11.5 per cent in the first 12 months of this government. Outside of the Perth metropolitan area, unemployment grew from 7.5 per cent to eight per cent. Finally, outside of the Adelaide metropolitan area, unemployment grew from 7.3 per cent to 7.8 per cent. Yet this government has the hide to come in here today and suggest that it is a government that governs for all of Australia. It has the hide to come here today and suggest that it cares about unemployment in regional Australia. Regional Australia has lost because of a lack of attention and support
         <break page="5731" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          for regional Australia. Regional Australia requires a government that is prepared to get involved, roll up its sleeves and offer a helping hand to try to reduce unemployment in regional Australia.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The real problem is that it is getting worse. I take the chamber to the most recent long&amp;hyphen;term regional unemployment figures and I will deal, by way of example, with the seats of Richmond, Page, Cowper and Lyne. In March 1996, unemployment was 11.8 per cent. Guess what it is this week in four coalition seats: it is 14.5 per cent. This government suggests that it cares about unemployment in regional Australia. I would hate to see what the government is doing for those seats if it did not come in here and claim that it was delivering on the issue of jobs. In that area, there are now 3,000 more unemployed people than there were in March 1996.

        <para first-indent="16">
         But that is not the real black spot. There are worse areas of regional unemployment as a result of the first 15 months of this government and the fact that in its budget strategy it has walked away from its responsibilities. It has taken jobs and services out of regional Australia. It has closed Commonwealth Employment Service offices. It has closed taxation offices. It has closed Family Law Court opportunities.

         He also outlined some of the figures in relation to unemployment in rural and regional Australia. The simple fact of the matter is that his government had no ideas; they ran out of them. In fact, youth unemployment in much of rural and regional Australia was up around 30 per cent. This government has a range of programs designed to give new opportunities to young people, not only in rural and regional Australia but also in urban and metropolitan areas. I think people are sick and tired of absolute hypocrisy.

         The member opposite is a member of a party which in government was responsible for the worst recession we ever had. It was a government which simply could not tell the truth. It was a government which was prepared to do and say anything to crawl back into office. It was a government that saw 313,000 men lose full&amp;hyphen;time work, many of those people in rural and regional Australia. I think it is about time that the honourable member opposite stood up and was honest and said that the Labor Party over the last 13 years made a monumental botch&amp;hyphen;up in the area of unemployment. They failed to offer hope to young Australians. They, indeed, were complete and utter failures.

His party was a government which was responsible for the worst economic situation that this country has ever seen—a government which, during its 13 years in government, had an average unemployment figure of 8.7 per cent. He fails to recognise that the coalition has only been in office for 15 months and that the benefits of the very many programs which we have implemented have not yet flowed through to the job market.

          , the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) wanted the Australian public to believe that we ought to be patient, that it is a big ship and it is really a huge problem to turn it around. He was talking about the question of unemployment. But, after all, facts tell the real story.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I want to deal with the performance of this government after the first 15 months in office. Let us go to the issue of facts and the question of jobs. In the 15 months since the Howard government took office, the number of jobs has only risen by 86,800. More importantly, the number of full&amp;hyphen;time jobs has actually fallen by 700. The number of male full&amp;hyphen;time jobs has fallen by 9,900. The number of people unemployed has only risen by 39,000, because unemployment has risen from 8.5 to 8.8 per cent.

         Now go to the issue of youth unemployment, where we are now all about fudging the figures with the new youth allowance, hiding young unemployed people, forcing them off benefits. I will tell you why. The Prime Minister said at the National Press Club on the eve of the election that he would be judged by his performance on the question of youth unemployment. What we have is a new strategy now about honesty and integrity in government; it is about fudging the figures. And I am not surprised, because after 12 months the youth unemployment rate has risen—yes, risen. That is a real problem for this government, because the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) is correct—this government has to be judged by its performance on the issue of jobs.

         I am prepared to basically judge our performance, as the previous government, against the performance of this government in its first 12 months. That is what the member for Fisher challenged me to do. Unemployment under this government in the first 15 months has risen from 8.5 to 8.8 per cent. What did the current Prime Minister, who was the then Treasurer, leave us with in March 1983? Surprise, surprise—he left us with double&amp;hyphen;digit unemployment—a pretty big ship, as he described it on the

         I note that the member for Fisher is yet again running for cover, because he does not want to deal with the facts. We reduced unemployment, in our first 12 months, from 10 per cent to 8.9 per cent. As he puts his tail between his legs and runs out of the chamber, because he does not want to deal with the facts about unemployment, I would again take him to the question of regional Australia. I have dealt with some of the Northern Rivers seats in New South Wales. Let us go to the real black spot on the unemployment front in regional Australia at the moment—Victoria. Rural and regional Victoria has become the black spot, and we know they like to talk about black spots. Regional unemployment is now 11.2 per cent, compared to a pretty bad state average in Victoria of 9.2 per cent. We have a coalition government at a state level there, as well as at the federal level.

         <break page="5733" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          They want us all to believe that this government cares about regional Australia and is committed to trying to reduce unemployment queues in regional Australia. Let us go to the Central Highlands and Wimmera. I know the Deputy Speaker understands the importance of these issues as a representative of rural Australia. Unemployment—surprise, surprise—is 9.8 per cent in that region. That is a bit higher than the national average, but what was it in March last year? It was 7.9 per cent. That is another great achievement, one that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) likes to stand up and gloat about.

          —That is why I was really trying to deal with the all-important question of how you support regional initiatives such as REDOs and area consultative committees. Do you know what REDOs and area consultative committees used to do? They used to really embrace those Working Nation labour market type of programs because out in regional Australia there is a real problem in raising the necessary expenditure to support capital works. I can understand that because I believe that regional Australia is entitled to the same level of services that we receive in metropolitan Australia. That is why regional economic development organisations are of the utmost importance to regional Australia.

        <para first-indent="16">
         On that note, I want to talk about the fact that regional economic development organisations are now most concerned about the fact that the Working Nation programs were ripped away from them. This government wants us to believe, for example, that Green Corps is of assistance to regional Australia. I will tell you that it is not of much assistance to regional Australia and, more importantly, it is not of much assistance to the unemployed. The facts show that in the first round of pilot projects under Green Corps, the majority of people were either employed or engaged in full-time education. The opportunities did not even go, in regional Australia, to unemployed people.

         If I were a National Party representative, for example, of those northern New South Wales seats, I would be crying out for support for the unemployed—not support for people who have jobs or education opportunities. I would compare that with the old LEAP programs that the old REDOs used to really embrace and support and try to provide infrastructure in their regions with.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I go, for example, to Green Corps—a mere $3.7 million for 1996&amp;hyphen;97. That compares with nearly $90 million under the former Labor Party government's LEAP program—the old landcare and environment action program.

          I agree with the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper). Let us deal with the facts and the real issues that Australians are concerned about at the moment—the issues that regional Australia is, in some ways, I suppose, off its face about. Their view is that this government has walked away from its responsibilities. The real issue goes to the question of unemployment and the requirement to put in place regional initiatives that do something to assist regional Australia.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          If you want to assist regional Australia then, for example, it is not smart to close the Taxation Office in Launceston, it is not smart to close the Department of Immigration office in Townsville, and it is not smart to close the CES office in Mareeba because they are all local jobs that regional Australia depends on.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          When you take those jobs out of regional Australia, you do not just take government jobs out of regional Australia but you actually take out regional Australian private sector jobs because those pay packets disappear from regional Australia. Public servants are not buying local goods and services and therefore the private sector jobs disappear.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I understand why the Minister for Veterans' Affairs is looking a little concerned at the moment because when we lay the facts on the table the conclusion is that this government does not care about the all-important concept of one nation, of one Australia and of all Australians being entitled to the same level of services, irrespective of whether you live in metropolitan Australia or regional Australia.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I put to the House that the Commonwealth government has a responsibility to get involved and assist regional Australia. The Commonwealth government has the responsibility to actually develop regional initiatives such as the old REDOs aimed at trying to create jobs and, in the meantime, also assist the unemployed with decent labour market programs.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          That is what it comes back to: do you care about Australia at large? Are you going to run away from your responsibilities for regional Australia? Do you believe that the high level of unemployment that currently exists, for example, in the Northern Rivers seats of New South Wales is acceptable? Or is it the view of this government that it is prepared to cop ghettos in the Northern Rivers area of New South Wales, as indicated by its lack of support for important country towns such as Lismore? I know that does not count much to the coalition government because in the end it is has got a huge majority and it is prepared to sacrifice a few seats on the way through. But I do care because if you do not invest in those regions and actually support regional initiatives, you end up with an underclass in Australia.

         <para first-indent="16">
          This government might be prepared to tolerate a regional and rural underclass; I am not prepared to tolerate a regional and rural underclass. As far as I am concerned, whether you live in Mareeba, Burnie, Sydney, Melbourne or Adelaide, you are entitled to the same level of services, the same investment, and a willingness by the government to actually lead and make hard decisions.

          I, too, want to place on the record my support for the thrust of the reforms, particularly the accommodation bonds option of funding infrastructure for nursing home accommodation. Somewhere this week I saw a mention that $1 billion, or thereabouts, is needed to bring the system up to standard. Obviously, as much as we would like to pay for that bill from the public purse, it is just not feasible. So the users who can pay option is the only route.

          Just let me clear the record. During my move to splendid independent isolation in the House in the week that the vote was taken on the aged care bill, I became a little disorganised without the aid of any unofficial whipping support, so
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Hansard

          will show my voting against the bill but supporting the consequential amendments. I misread the third reading division as another attempt to gag debate and so literally misplaced my support for the legislation. I correct that now.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          However, I must say that there is still a great deal of concern out there in the regions—and elsewhere, I presume—about certain aspects of this legislation. Let me just detail them quickly. Those providers of concessional only or near enough to total pensioner clients are concerned at the lack of capital funding the system will provide. The St Vincent de Paul organisation in Orange is one which doubts its ability to raise sufficient funding through bonds, and it certainly does not believe that the $5 a day contribution from the Commonwealth will go anywhere near meeting that need. They are talking about at least a doubling of that amount.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The Uralba Hostel at Carcoar is typical of a smaller rural community aged care centre. It believes that the $5 a day for concessional residents will go no way towards meeting its capital requirements. These shortcomings in the plan are causing real concern out there and are jeopardising the positive sale of these reforms in the marketplace. This money—that is, the $5 a day—will provide for this Carcoar hostel $9,250 per client over five years, while a bond could deliver $13,000 in the same time.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          You see, the home with concessional patients is worse off. Why can't they access a bond? Because in very many cases the partner is living in the home, or on the farm, and there are no assets to access to pay the bond. It is a catch&amp;hyphen;22 situation. There is, according to Uralba Hostel at Carcoar, no way they are going to be able to pay for capital rebuilding or upgrading.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Uralba agrees totally with the ageing in place philosophy, keeping elderly people in hostels where possible. But, if they are forced to push these people into nursing home accommodation—and they are becoming more and more every day nursing home&amp;hyphen;type patients—the subsidies they will receive are well below what they get now and they will not be able to meet capital updates. They will not even meet the standards to be able to charge bonds and will not, perhaps, be able to survive in places like Carcoar.

          Take the case of Yeoval multipurpose health centre, once just the district hospital, which was closed by the state government. The community fought like blazes and started their own cooperative health care which has grown into the model for multiservice health delivery. I would urge the minister to take a look at that facility, perhaps visit it, and see what I believe is the future of integrated hospital health and aged care delivery in rural Australia.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Yeoval entered into a recurrent funding agreement with the federal government, took out a loan, and is being repaid by the Commonwealth for that capital program. Now it has to decide whether to maintain that arrangement or go down the uncertain path of accommodation bonds and the $5 per day for concessional residents path with all the same concerns that Carcoar has about its aged care capacity under these reforms.

          —I want to specifically address, in these few minutes that I have, the questions that arise from the decisions the government has taken, as evidenced in the budget papers, to do with the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. I am particularly concerned at the changes to the therapeutic group premium, as it is formally called, which are apparently going to take effect from February next year. As we know, this is going to make Australian citizens have to pay more for the latest and safest or most effective medication in the six drug groups that are treating things like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, ulcers, depression and so on.

         The reason for my major concern is the comments that were made by the president of the AMA, Dr Keith Woollard, very shortly after this decision was announced in the budget. He has said that although separate medications within the six nominated classes had similar therapeutic effects, they could have different side effects which made them less appropriate for some patients. He said:

        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         I find that particularly alarming when it is coming from someone like the president of the AMA. I couple that with statements from the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia, where they feel that it is necessary to monitor the changes that are going to take place under the PBS through this new strategy. The national president of the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia said that the PSA would monitor the changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme contained in the 1997 federal budget to detect whether or not they were having any adverse effects on consumers.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I find it pretty appalling that a government can take a decision where, first of all, the AMA has a view quite different on medical grounds to the government's and, secondly, an organisation like the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia believes it is necessary to monitor for adverse effects. I do not think that it would be very responsible for a government to take a decision in the health area where there could be any question of adverse effects on consumers. Mr Plunkett, the president of the PSA, has said that while some people argue that some of the moves may be a cost saving measure for the government, others argue that it will significantly change prescribing patterns and adversely affect the health of patients who will not be able to afford to buy those more expensive drugs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I seriously believe that the government needs to look very carefully at what it is doing to the PBS, for two reasons. First of all, the PBS as we know it in Australia has been a very highly applauded and, might I say, highly envied process by the rest of the world. It has worked extremely effectively and has been held up as a model for many places around the world when they look at the way that we can dispense pharmaceuticals on a fair and even basis to our community. Secondly, and even more importantly, there is the question of whether or not it is going to adversely affect the health of those people in this country who may not have any choice in terms of whether they can afford to buy the preferred drug.

        <break page="5737" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          I also ask this question of the minister: when, if ever, will the detailed arrangements and costings of the new structure be made available? The model has, I believe, been talked about in Senate estimates; we do not have that detail, it has not been made available. I think it is terribly important to everybody involved in this process that they have access to that detail. As I said at the outset, I raise very sincere concerns on the basis of health care and I question the government's decision in this PBS process very seriously indeed.

          —In the five minutes that I have, I want to refer to the child&amp;hyphen;care aspects of the expenditure. In looking at child care, we need to look at the 1996 and 1997 budgets, because some of the effects of the 1996 budget are only now taking effect. In the 1996 budget, we saw a $500 million cut in child&amp;hyphen;care funding and in 1997 we have seen a further cut of $321 million—amounting to a $821 million cut in two budgets. This, of course, is going to have a devastating effect on child care, throughout the country.

        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Initially, I want to relate one example of a single parent who came into see me. I do expect that, when I get back into the electorate at the end of next week, there will be quite a number of people who use child care coming in to see me. The single parent—a single lady with one child—is going to TAFE at the moment to study to improve her skills so that she can get employment. Her actual child&amp;hyphen;care bill has increased by $36.50 since May. Taking into account that she is a single mother on a pension, that is an astronomical amount of money. Of course, the end result is that she cannot now afford to keep her child in child care for the full week, and has now withdrawn her child from the child care facility for at least two days per week and has to use other arrangements through parents and grandparents. This is at considerable inconvenience to herself because she has to travel considerable distances to take her child to be minded.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To clarify the cost increase of $36.50 since May, it comes about in two stages. Firstly, as a result of changes to child&amp;hyphen;care assistance, the child&amp;hyphen;care fee for this particular lady went up from $28 per week to $43 per week—an increase of $15 per week from 26 May. Secondly, as a result of the removal of the operational subsidy which will take effect from 1 July, her fee per week for that one child went up from $43 per week to $64 per week—an increase over that period of $36.50. This is quite outrageous. It is totally impossible for people to keep their children in child care when they are on low incomes and have large bills and a mortgage to pay—or, as is the case with this particular lady—when they are actually on a pension.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Having given that example, I just want to give a little background to child care in general. Maybe a lot of people do not know that this was not a Labor Party piece of legislation. It was not the Labor government that introduced child care. It was, in fact, the McMahon government in 1972 which introduced child care, in recognition of the increasing number of women in the labour force and the subsequent need to provide affordable, quality child care to their children. In hindsight, of course, this was a very noble and far&amp;hyphen;reaching piece of legislation. It certainly showed a lot of vision in relation to the numbers of women who have entered the work force over that period. But now we see a government of the same persuasion actually cutting back on child care.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The need for child&amp;hyphen;care places to assist women in the work force should be recognised. The rate of female participation in the work force has increased from 40.6 per cent in 1972, when it was introduced, to 53.4 per cent in 1996. This increase has been particularly high in the 25&amp;hyphen; to 59&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old age group. My own particular electorate contains a large, fast growing residential area where two&amp;hyphen;income families reside and more young families are moving in at
         <break page="5738" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          a rapid rate. There is, therefore, an urgent need for family support services, particularly child care, to allow both parents to take part in either full&amp;hyphen;time or part&amp;hyphen;time work so that the family's budget can be balanced. Clearly, this is no time to decrease child&amp;hyphen;care funding; it is now time to increase it.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It has also been suggested that low income families will have a considerable increase in the cost of their child care. It was thought initially that that might be between $29.50 and $50.90, but in the case that I have quoted there was an increase of $36.50. There are some industrial consequences too.

The ointment is something he has to use for the eczema that goes all over his body but it is now going to be taken off the list.

         When you talk about child care it looks very clear cut—$320 million over four years. It is almost like going back to the days when you were told, `You have your kids. Stay home and look after them.' It is saying to the women who make up 52 per cent of the population, `If you have your kids, you are not going to have a job. Get out.

         That is an appalling situation. We are going to go back to what was referred to many years ago as latchkey kids.

That is an appalling cost on top of everything else that parents on very limited incomes have to cope with. They are trying to add to society through their work. They are also trying to make sure that their children are looked after properly on the limited amount of money that they bring home.

Tell you eldest kid to pick the kids up from school and bring them home,' or, worse, go back to what it was previously. I can go back 15 to 20 years ago when you virtually had a little backyard shed where children were minded because it was offered at a cheaper rate. I do not think we should go backwards and I do not think we have a need to go backwards. I believe that is what some of these cuts will do. There are a lot of other things I want to touch on and I will get to them when I get another call.

          —Mr Deputy Speaker, one of the difficulties when dealing with such a large portfolio as Health and Family Services is that when we consider it in detail we jump around all over the place on different topics. At some stage, whilst we cannot dictate to the minister how he wants to handle responses, he might try to get some order or he might choose to respond to some of the topics already raised.

         I wish to raise the therapeutic premium groups decision of the budget. I think it is an important decision that needs to be explained because it is a vast extension from generic prescribing to, as it now seems to be called, brand premium. The problem there is that, of course, under generic prescribing we developed a system that was dependent upon the drugs being the same and having the same bioequivalence but under different brand names. This was important for the generic manufacturers who were coming on board as drugs came out of patent. It gave them an attempt to compete against those that had already got the drug listed
         <break page="5740" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          under different brand names. In fact, to the extent with which we can have that form of competition to have the drugs listed, it engendered that.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But the theory behind the therapeutic group premium is dependent upon the fact that, and I quote from an answer in the Senate estimates, `the drugs are very similar, chemically related drugs.' The problem is that they are not the same. I think the minister would understand that. It is not for me to talk to him about medical practice, but there will be situations where these drugs will not suit the patient's circumstance. That is the difficulty with this in the clinical sense. There will be patients that require to have other drugs in the group for whatever reasons. It is one of the quirks, I suppose, of modern medicine that these things happen, especially for some of the conditions where patients will be having a cocktail of medicines and therefore really need those medicines adjusted.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other thing that I might add is that these are drugs that are already listed. We are not talking about generic manufacturers trying to bring on a new brand name of the same drug. I reject the argument that the therapeutic groups premium will create the competition that is suggested because it is a very closed market dependent upon the listing.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The thing that has to be stressed and is sometimes I think glossed over and ignored is that those drugs that get listed on the pharmaceutical benefits schemes are listed at costs that are much reduced compared with what drug companies can achieve on more open markets overseas. Already, over the years, because of the nature of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and because of the nature of the way in which drugs are listed, we have been able to attempt to put a lid on the costs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I know that the minister, like his predecessors under Labor administrations, will jump up and down and say that the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, if you look at the graph, is going right out of the ceiling. But he has to acknowledge that attempts have been made to put a ceiling on that and to dampen it. But I just believe that the therapeutic groups premium is not the type of thing which is likely to achieve the results that are suggested. It is not likely to get the acceptance with the consumer that is expected. Already we have had to have a very softly, softly approach to generic brand funding. The honourable member for Prospect (Ms Crosio) talked about people preferring their red tablets and their blue tablets. One of the real things that we had to be careful about with generic prescribing was where there was a change in the colour and the shape the patient was going to have some rejection of the concept. We have slowly but surely, I believe, won the battle.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What we probably have not done yet is educate the consumer to ask the questions at the right stage. Even under generic prescribing, the patient is there with the general practitioner, the GP writes out the script, the patient takes it to the chemist, it is dispensed, and it may not be until the patient gets to the cash register that he realises that, under the brand premium scheme, he has a higher cost drug. These things need continual education. It is too early and too ambitious for the therapeutic premium group scheme.

          —I rise tonight on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1997&amp;hyphen;98 to raise the issue of Medicare office closures. Two office closures in my electorate will be caused by this budget: one in Leichhardt, situated at Leichhardt Market Town; and one in Marrickville Road, Marrickville, just down the road from my electorate office. A third closure—that of the Campsie office—in the electorate of the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) will also impact on my constituents around the Canterbury area.

          These office closures were foreshadowed in last year's budget. Thus 12 months of uncertainty have been caused by this government. Last year a document indicated that up to 86 offices might be closed throughout the nation. The budget last week indicated that 43 offices will be closed. It is interesting that 17 offices are to be closed in New South Wales, and nearly 80 per cent of those offices are in Labor electorates. This very political decision by the government says: `If you vote Labor, you do not deserve services.'

         <para first-indent="16">
          People in Labor electorates are less likely to have access to transport and their income tends to be lower than that of people who live on the North Shore and in the eastern suburbs of Sydney, and yet it is the people in the Labor electorates who have been most adversely affected by these changes.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There has been considerable disquiet, certainly in my electorate, about these changes. On 17 May, a rally was organised at Leichhardt Market Town, with the support of the local council and the local state member, Sandra Nori, the member for Port Jackson. I participated, along with the workers—about to be non&amp;hyphen;workers—of the Leichhardt Medicare office. That rally was well attended.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There was another rally on 17 August last year at the Marrickville Road Medicare office, organised by myself and Dr Andrew Refshauge, the New South Wales Minister for Health and Deputy Premier. At that stage, it had not been indicated that the Leichhardt office would be closed. I invite the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), who is at the table, to the rally which is being held on 3 July at the Marrickville Road Medicare office.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It has been organised by me and other members of the community, with the support of the local Marrickville council, and the state member, Dr Andrew Refshauge. I invite the minister to come to Marrickville, to downgrade himself and come to an area which, whilst it has some economic difficulties, is an area that I am proud to be associated with. I am sure the minister would get a very interesting welcome to that electorate, especially when he tells the people that their Medicare office is being replaced by a fax machine in a pharmacy somewhere up the road.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Opposition to these office closures does not just come from the people directly affected. The closure of a government office in a strip shopping centre takes away business from the other shops in that area, because the people who go to the Medicare office to get their rebates or whatever will not be going there. A lot of concern has been expressed to me by small businesses in both Marrickville and Leichhardt about the negative impact that these changes will have on their business. That is symptomatic of a government which is reducing services.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It also flies in the face of the commitment that this government made during the election campaign that there would not be any attacks on Medicare. There is no doubt that closures of Medicare offices, in conjunction with the massive cuts to health funding and pharmaceuticals, which the member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) has highlighted here tonight, all add up to a major attack by this government on the public health system. It should be noted that New South Wales in particular has suffered in terms of public health funding. It would appear that it has been penalised for having a Labor government, just as people in the western suburbs of Sydney are being penalised for voting Labor at the last federal election. I am sure, with responses such as this, they will continue to do just that.

          <break page="5742" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           programs—the immunisation program and the Aboriginal sexual health program—are to be retained by the Commonwealth. That is fine and I do not have a problem with that.

         But I really wonder how a government makes it decisions in this area. I understand that programs such as the cervical cancer program, the breast screening program, the national drug strategy, the HIV/Aids strategy and the national women's health program are all going to be allowed to slip through to the states and territories. I have serious concerns about this government's attitude about the role between it and the community when it looks at the way in which it wishes to govern and in which it wishes to deliver services to the community.

         There are certain areas that I believe should either be retained by the Commonwealth or should only go through to the states and territories under very strict circumstances because of the need for equality of access to service and for equality of delivery and level of service that is going out to the community. I question very sincerely why this government can make a decision to retain certain programs and not others. Is it because some are more important? Is it because some are more sexy out there in the community? What is it that makes a Commonwealth government decide that it is going to retain its role with the immunisation program but it is not going to retain the same level of role with cervical cancer or breast screening or the HIV/Aids strategy? I would like to hear some detail on how this particular area of the government's health portfolio operates.

         I want also to quickly touch on—and this was brought up earlier tonight—the issue of nursing homes. In the debate in the House, in the detailed stage of the particular bill and the budget decisions that surround it, there was a great deal of screaming and carry&amp;hyphen;on from the government benches about our shadow minister and our side of politics running scare campaigns. I feel very strongly about that accusation. I had the opportunity the other day, and I repeat it here, to say that the comments coming to me—as a federal member in this parliament representing a constituency from the ACT—were coming not from my shadow minister but from the community. I want to talk about that.

         The reason for my bringing this up is quite clear: we were not running a scare campaign at all and we are not now. We are attempting to reflect to the government, through the appropriation debate, the concerns from people at an incredibly high level out there in the community who service those who require access to nursing homes. I am dealing right now with a constituent—in fact, I have had two conversations with her today—who is desperately trying to get access to a nursing home. Her overriding concerns are about how all of these future implications will impact on her family.

It was not something that was advertised; it was not something that you were all of a sudden told was going to happen. You had to read through line by line, item by item, of the budget papers to find out that the 11 family resource centres throughout Australia, which were originally set up in 1991 as a Labor initiative in some of the most disadvantaged areas in Australia, were going to have their funding done away with. In fact, they have all been told that that funding has to cease as of December this year.

In an area like mine, it seems that we have all of these things against us. When we have a service that is helping to coordinate help for people and to assist people affected by these problems, it's difficult to see that being taken away.

         It is just another harsh decision that this government has taken without realising the long&amp;hyphen;term ramifications. It is not just some little group of people who are buried away in an area that people do not have access to. These are very organised people who are concerned, who are out there working in the community, coordinating and putting programs into place. In my area in particular, I found it ironic that after the decision to cut family resource centres, including the centre in my electorate, which we call Ettinger House because of the historic place they operate out of—the very week when we were objecting to these cuts, the Minister for Family Services, the honourable Judith Moylan, actually came out and opened an ethnic Chinese nursing home. It was the completed product, but what is interesting is that the very first line of putting together the application for the nursing home occurred when a group of Australians of Chinese descent, who wanted to provide for their aged, went to Ettinger House, which in turn helped them fill in their application and showed them how to go about getting funding. Then, when all of that was done, we put it forward to the minister of the day, saying that we would like funding to go ahead for that group of people.

         That is just one of the many examples I could relate, time and time again in this parliament, of what has been achieved since that resource centre has been operating in our area.

         I would also like to add that my electorate is suffering again in the cuts to the Medicare centres. We are actually losing one in Cabramatta and one in Merrylands. In an electorate like mine that basically means that something like 500,000 people are going to be treated to one Medicare office in Fairfield itself—and the queues are out the door now. A lot of those people are from non&amp;hyphen;English speaking backgrounds and the staff, who are superb, have to help them fill in the forms and show them what to do. There is going to be nothing else in all the area from Liverpool to Parramatta except the one in Fairfield. We are closing down the other two. It is absolutely appalling. This is an area where we need growth in these types of facilities, which are required, and what do we do? We are shutting them down. Where do these people turn to? Do you think they are going to go to a pharmacist and fax away a rebate form? Most of the people who go through my Medicare offices now are there waiting for the payment to come back. I know we have one of the largest bulk billing areas in a community like mine.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But those who have got to pay that money up front cannot wait for another week or two weeks for it to come back. That is why a lot of them take their forms in personally so that they can put them over the counter. They can be assisted by the staff there, and they can wait and get their payments. It may not mean a lot to this minister or this government. But believe me, in a community like mine that extra $15, $18 or $20 means a lot for that mother to go home with. She realises then that she can pick up the bread and the milk and the stuff for the kids on the way home because she has got that little bit more money back in her pocket.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is not going to happen now. She is going to have to wait in the queues that are already accumulating out through the doors on that one particular service. Previously, they had the possibility of going to other offices in the area. Now that has been denied them. How many more cuts are we going to see for people that live in western Sydney? It is the largest population growth area in all of Australia, I daresay, with the largest growth, too, in the number of first settlers coming in—52 per cent of my electorate was born overseas.

In the budget papers the item that refers to it—and it is not an item in the appropriations—is in budget paper no. 2, page 7, where it mentions broadbanding other family and children services for 1997&amp;hyphen;98, minus $3 million; and for 1998&amp;hyphen;99 minus $6.4 million, with $6.6 million and $6.8 million in the out years.

         I do not know whether we need some sort of cipher to work out what these code things are, but when you go to page 78 of this document to get the fuller explanation, it does not even mention FRCs. It talks about consolidation of a number of other programs. It is just a real worry that here is a government that has come in saying that they want to have transparency in their budget documents, and things like that, and it is just so difficult to work out what is going on.

          The item I now want to turn to is an issue that has got legs since about last Friday and that is the defunding of the Family Planning Association and the Australian Pensioners Superannuants Federation. These were organisations funded under the Community Sector Support Scheme.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Later on, in response, I hope that the minister (Dr Wooldridge) can clarify what is actually really going on here because if one goes to the appropriations, it would appear on my reading of the appropriations that in 1996&amp;hyphen;97 the estimated actual is $6.355 million. The appropriation for this year's budget, 1997&amp;hyphen;98, is $4.987 million, a 22 per cent decrease. I want to make sure that I have got the facts right on that because if that is correct, then the explanation that the minister gave in his interview on
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

          </emphasis>
          on Friday and the explanations that the minister representing in the Senate has given in a couple of questions yesterday, are inadequate.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I understand the point that the minister put in the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           PM
          </emphasis>
          interview that he had four or five organisations, as I understand it, receiving seeding grants that have now gone to a fuller form of funding. But one has to ask why those two organisations that have substantially been defunded have been picked out.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As it transpires, it appears that a Coopers &amp; Lybrand study that was commissioned by the government did not, in fact, recommend the defunding of the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, so this is a decision of the government. But it would be interesting to have fully explained the reasons that the Coopers &amp; Lybrand report cannot be made public because if it was important in the decision making of government, it should be important in the public discussion of the defunding because legitimately, there can be suspicion about why those two organisations were defunded.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is legitimate to ask whether the defunding of the Family Planning Association is something that has been a requirement on the government because of the discussions with a certain independent senator. Likewise, with the defunding of the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, is it because the federation has been harsh in its criticism of certain items? The honourable member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) mentioned that organisation as one that had been critical of the nursing home decision. It is legitimate to ask these questions as there might be legitimate answers that can quell the fears that people have. I think the minister would agree that these organisations have an important role.

          </emphasis>
          . The chair was the member for Scullin at the time—this was back in February 1991 so it is a dusty document. The committee recommended continued Commonwealth funding for national secretariats of non&amp;hyphen;government health, housing and community service organisations on the basis that public education, public debate and community consultation assist the development of appropriate policies and programs, especially where disadvantaged groups are concerned. I think that that still stands and I am not saying that the government does not recognise that.

         <para first-indent="16">
          One of the reasons for the defunding appears to be that, as the minister has said, there are two other organisations that are well placed—I am not sure whether he is saying better placed—to convey the thoughts of people who have interests in aged care or aged people themselves. I would think that if it has been satisfactory to have this diversity of view, including that of the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, then that should continue.

           The minister may have a problem because he believes that, because that organisation takes up issues of social security and the like, it is outside of his portfolio. That was why I read the recommendation which was couched in terms of the government having an obligation. I believe the government cannot run away from seeing that it has an obligation to organisations such as this one, and that it should take a whole of government approach. The spokesperson for that association has said—I believe that most members would acknowledge this point—that income support is very important to the health of any sector of the community. To dismiss continuing funding for this organisation on the basis that it takes interest in social security matters is a nonsense.

          <para first-indent="16">
           But the real thing that I want to get clarified is whether the underlying reason that these two organisations have been defunded, besides the suspicion that they might in some way be being punished, is that the funding for this program has been reduced by over a fifth. If that is the case, we will have things trotted out that say that it is the previous government's fault, et cetera, which, of course, is an absolute nonsense. But let us get it on the record so that we can clearly identify the commitment of the government to this program. I am quite happy to have it explained that I have got the wrong end of those figures. It is a one&amp;hyphen;line item. It is an appropriation in Appropriation Bill (No. 1)—I think it is 340 2.02. That 22 per cent reduction needs to be explained.

           As I said earlier, this portfolio has a smorgasbord of issues that one could raise. I am quite satisfied that a number of the issues that I would have raised have been raised by my colleagues, whether it be the issue that the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) raised, which affects my electorate, about the closure of the Reservoir Medicare office, or whether it be the discussions that we have had about nursing homes and aged care. The honourable member for Batman reminds me of the closure of the Heidelberg Medicare office, very important for the overall scope and coverage of Medicare offices in the region. I think it is perhaps a bit disconcerting that we have had this debate in the way that we have.

          <para first-indent="16">
           I know that from time to time the honourable member for Batman's behaviour either in the chamber or in the Main Committee is a bit disconcerting, but he reminds me of an issue about the Medicare closures. The simple fact is that the statistics show that six out of the eight closures in Victoria were in Labor&amp;hyphen;held seats—six out of eight. Given the circumstances of the electorates we hold, that is a very important thing to expose and to keep reminding the minister of. It is also a fact that, on the occasions when I have tried to get a greater coverage of Medicare offices and an office in the city of Whittlesea, responses have been couched in terms of it being the HIC's problem. It is clear that, on this occasion, the minister interfered in the decision&amp;hyphen;making process. Let us not get into the nonsense that it was actually the commission's decision: it very much had direct government involvement.

          —The member who spoke previously, my colleague the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), reminded me that the newsletter that just came from the Alcohol and Drug Council of Australia pointed out that all public health funding had now collapsed into a one&amp;hyphen;line appropriation. The ADCA is concerned because decisions have not even been made yet as to how much is going to be allocated to HIV/AIDS, national drugs strategy, diabetes, et cetera. One of their other concerns affects an area like mine, in that there is a major initiative which will involve removing methadone from the Medicare scheme and replacing this form of Commonwealth funding with a set payment through a specified cost&amp;hyphen;shared funding scheme. Trials of the new arrangements will take place this year, and

         Recently the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) of this country announced—if my memory serves me correctly, it was on 5 June—a program of something like $13 million at a federal level over three or four years to look at domestic violence and associated crime—this without looking at what is causing domestic violence and crime in this country. At the same time, it is estimated that nearly $4 billion is being collected in this budget with excise and taxes on alcohol and on tobacco. Yet, in the same budget, we find—again, through press releases put out by the very reputable Alcohol and Drug Council people—that something like only $33 million out of that $4 billion is being put back into a drug education strategy.

         If you take that one step further, you find that the $33 million that is going back into the national drug strategy program for education amounts to less than $2 per person throughout Australia.

I know that in the questions I have had on the notice paper that both he and the Prime Minister have said, `You want a national drug summit, but that is actually a waste of resources and a waste of time.' What price do we put on human life? What price do we put on it when we can take $4 billion in revenue and yet give only $33 million back to the National Drug Strategy?

In the very week that I was speaking about this particular topic in the parliament, three more people lost their lives in Cabramatta, which is part of my community. I know these people may not have parents who are as articulate as some of the other parents who are now taking up their cause, but they are still someone's brother or sister or husband or son or daughter.

          —Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. One more really important issue that I would like to discuss here briefly tonight is the question of youth suicide and the ongoing funding that has occurred in previous, current and hopefully, future budgets. I say hopefully; in fact I know that it will be continuing.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The simple message that I want to bring to this debate tonight in relation to the funding of this program is this: the previous government had a commitment, roughly $13 million over four years, that began in the 1995&amp;hyphen;96 budget for a program called Here for Life. My figuring now is that we have entered the third of the four years of that program.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We also have the current government bringing in a new program last year with continuing funding this year, called the National Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy, of $19 million. I am a member of a committee in this place that has recently brought down a summary report on this subject, which was tabled in the House recently.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When we consider the expenditure of the these funds I implore the minister to consider certain factors. It is imperative in my view that the previous government's program and the current government's programs are somehow linked, reflected or learned from. There seems to me to be a great risk that the allocation of the current funding through to the new program appears to be getting, to some degree, done in isolation from the earlier one. I would be happy to be contradicted on that.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There also seems to be, again in my view, a lack of, or a very low level of, funding through to the educational level. When I talk about that what I am meaning is that for the appropriate data to be available for any government to carry out a sincere approach to the question of youth suicide we really need much more detailed national collective data than we have. It is all very well for us to understand that, for argument's sake, young men in rural areas commit suicide at a higher rate than, say, young men in other areas. But we do not really understand to any great detail why. We know the symptoms; we can have experts give us the symptoms. But we really do not have that detailed data that I think should be had to that level.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other thing is the need to recognise the signs of depression, particularly in our young people. Are we putting enough money and effort into our schools, into our counselling services, through to our GPs and our general community nursing areas so that they are actually taught to see and are advised to look for the appropriate signs, so that they can see what is going to happen in front of them?

          One of the most appalling statistics in the whole of the debate of the question of youth suicide, or suicide generally, is that I understand that 60 per cent of those people who eventually succeed in the act of suicide have in fact tried it before. We really need to question what we are doing wrong in terms of follow&amp;hyphen;up, counselling, recognition and understanding that we allow that 60 per cent who have tried it once or twice earlier and failed to eventually achieve that end.
         </para>

          We should look at this in a constructive fashion. I am not saying any of these comments in a particularly biased view. The committee that I am on really approached this subject from a very broad base of consensus. We all agreed across the board that we needed to do something desperately. But what I am saying is that from my perspective, from what I have observed and what I heard, these areas really need to be addressed. Are there enough school counsellors out there? Are we going to have a whole of government approach sufficient to attack this problem? Are we going to isolate it only into certain areas? Are we going to be able to say, within the health area, for argument's sake, that an effect within the education area is going to be recognised? Are we really going to put enough into youth services? Are we taking enough consideration of youth homelessness, youth unemployment and all of the other pressures that we have?

         <para first-indent="16">
          As the previous speaker was talking about drugs, are we looking at that? Are we taking enough into consideration from the mental health area? Are we looking at whether or not our services in addressing mental health are, in any way, contributing to the question of youth suicide? These are the things that need to be looked at carefully, holistically, across government and nationally.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I know that there is and has been, between the previous government and the current one, a huge amount of effort and money going into it. What I am suggesting is that we need to take a very deep breath and look very carefully at how we are expending those funds so that we really understand what it is we are attempting to attack and then direct those funds in the most precise fashion that we can, given the difficulty of the subject at hand.

He talked about uncertainty relating to accommodation bonds and the amount for disadvantaged customers of $5 a day. I think a lot of that uncertainty about accommodation bonds has now been removed. I just make the point that our costings on $5 a day, as I understand it, actually give homes more than they are currently receiving today. Obviously, people will always ask for more.

         The fee increases quoted are for a single parent with one child, studying full&amp;hyphen;time, and therefore needing care five days a week.

I think I have addressed that in the broad. She talked about a figure of $9 a script for her pensioners. I would be utterly confident none of her pensioners would have to be paying that amount.

That is why I am asking a group of experts—the Pharmaceutical Benefit Advisory Committee, a completely non-partisan committee appointed on the basis of expertise—to determine what should and should not be in and to have a look at the particular circumstances that he states.

I concede that in Victoria and New South Wales there was a predominance of Labor seats where the Medicare offices were closed, but in South Australia and Western Australia and Queensland there was a predominance of coalition seats where Medicare offices were closed. If you take it over the country as a whole, it was about fifty&amp;hyphen;fifty. The criteria that we used was that we had a look where there was another office within 10 kilometres—that did in some cases go out to 12 kilometres—and we had a look where there were fewer than 400 claims per day, rather than per week. I might have to be corrected on that.

So one was an adverse event, one was a positive event, and both were coalition seats.

I generally did not accept recommendations on the basis of strong support from a local member—and members on both sides of the House had put positions to me—and on distance. Initially, they were suggesting that some offices up to 20 kilometres from others should be closed, but I was not prepared to accept that.

The trials of the new pharmacy claiming that we have run around Townsville have shown it to be incredibly popular. It has had some glitches, but the trial has sorted them out.

It has worked very well in hostels, and the reason it is being done is because of the $1 billion shortfall in capital funding that the Gregory report showed was the net result of 10 years of administration by the Labor Party.

Given that money is finite, I have made a decision that I am putting a priority with carers, with volunteers, with heart support, and an organisation that really was on its last legs after it had been defunded, after its seed funding ran out, by the previous government—Asthma.

I understand paranoia might be a normal state in politics, but I can assure him it did not relate to anything in another place. He addressed the issue of a majority in Victoria being closed, I accept that. But if he looks at the criteria on which it is done and the criteria that I mentioned, he will see why that happened.

The fact is that methadone will still be available through chemists, it will still be available through health based services, and the people who will lose out of this will not be the people who need methadone, it will be the psychiatrists who are making three&amp;hyphen;quarters of a million bucks a year by doing nothing but doling out methadone—and this does happen.

Essentially, organisations such as SERAC can play, and have played, a very important role in local areas in order to try to ensure that that cake which needs to be allocated is allocated as fairly and as cost effectively as possible for government in terms of the delivery of services. Others have talked about the question of the need to look at those issues with a sense of concern as to what the real impact is on local areas. That is the sort of thing SERAC also does.

         Here we see a decision which, I think, is incredibly short&amp;hyphen;sighted. One criticism of government that has been made for as long as I can remember, and I have been here quite a while, is the question of new programs often being established to deal with particular problems which are serious but after a while, the programs are altered and the circumstances are that the real importance of those programs is lost over time. This is partly done sometimes for a concern with changing priorities. Often we are seeing a situation where in the first place, the understanding and the needs of a community are not fully understood by government and, therefore, decisions are made about the allocation of funds which although at the time make sense, or appear to make sense, in fact, in practical reality, they do not.

         That is why organisations such as this are crucial in terms of ensuring that government dollars are spent effectively. When you look at the question of what will happen in that area and the lack of coordination which will now occur around service delivery, you have to wonder about the real efficiency of this decision in terms of government. What we might see here is a situation where some $4.7 million is saved under a particular program heading under the Department of Family and Human Services but instead, on from that, money being wasted or not used as effectively as it could be in terms of the delivery of services.

         We talked earlier about regional development and the need for communities to have an understanding of the issues in their local area and their capacity to be able to influence those issues. We talk about—as members from the other side often do—the needs of rural and regional Australia and the fact that communities out there are hurting and that, basically, those communities know the answers and want government to listen. We are seeing here a situation where government has defunded an organisation which has played a crucial role in allowing local communities to articulate and develop responses to what is needed in their local areas. It is a bad decision, and I ask the government to reconsider it. I wish to get an answer on these issues.

          —I will be very brief because I realise that time is going to be against me here. I was not going to raise the nursing home legislation, or the bill that has recently been debated because I understood that that was part of the last budget. I know that it only comes into effect on 1 July this year and that they are certainly going to put some other regulations back further.

         The minister did raise it in reply to a number of speakers on this side of the debate. When the minister is saying that all these services are going to ask for more money, I would remind him that the Aged Services Association of New South Wales and the ACT that represent, I believe, something like 900 aged care services through New South Wales and the ACT, that they are concerned that the legislation is still not fully explained to the industry out there at

Not only do they feel that the $5 a day concessional subsidy is a pittance, but the fact is that we have not explained to them and to all the other agencies that are looking after the elderly in these nursing homes how they are going to come into effect and what they are going to have to do from 1 July.

         I actually did a survey of a number of nursing homes in my electorate and I asked, `Do you understand what it is all about, what it is going to mean?' They said, `We don't know. We haven't got a clue.' I went so far as to question the availability of beds in one particular nursing home and they quite openly said, `We've got three available, but we are not going to give them out until after 1 July because we will get more money for them.' I found that appalling. If the minister wanted to touch on it, we could go a lot further rather than just rehash the bill.

         You cannot say that these groups that are providing such wonderful services to our aged people are only after more and more money. They are after some understanding of how this bill will affect them bill is intended to do and after something more realistic than the $5 offered to those patients who are going to go in because they do not have the money available from selling their own homes.

        I am unable to supply the information requested by the honourable member at this time. The Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) is required, on the advice of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), to issue invitations to all recognised National Olympic Committees one year prior to the staging of Sydney's Olympic Games—ie those invitations will be posted from Lausanne, Switzerland on 15 September 1999. National Olympic Committees in receipt of invitations have four months after the date on which the invitations were sent to notify the IOC of their participation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        At this stage, SOCOG can only rely on the number of National Olympic Committees who participated in the Atlanta Olympics in 1996—which was 197.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Before existing as a National Olympic Committee and acquiring the rights to be designated as such, the organisation must be recognised by the IOC. This recognition can only be granted to an organisation, the jurisdiction of which coincides with the limits of the country in which it is established and has its headquarters.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        If more National Olympic Committees are recognised by the IOC, then those Committees would also be included in the invitation list to attend the Sydney Games.
