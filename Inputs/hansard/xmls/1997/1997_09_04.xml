          The Department of Defence proposes to develop the Bradshaw Field Training Area to allow company, battalion and brigade sized units to conduct collective and joint training in live fire and manoeuvre activities.

What you have ruled on is the form in which he has moved his motion. That is all that he is entitled to refer to. Anything else is outside the standing orders.

The circumstances of this matter are the conventional, entirely predictable norms of the House; that is, as has been clear all week, the opposition has wanted the government to bring on for debate the question of policy in the textiles, clothing and footwear industry. This is an important issue. The government has put a reference to the Productivity Commission and is awaiting the Productivity Commission's final report. Obviously, there is a lot of public interest in this issue. Senior members of the government today are meeting people from the textiles, clothing and footwear industry, which is the reason that the opposition moved the motion that they did this morning. A motion with the same content has been moved every day this week.

Clearly, the government will, in due course, make a decision about the textiles, clothing and footwear industries and there will be a debate on those issues.

There is a great attraction to do that because, as I have explained, the convention and the practice in this place is that, if you are in opposition and you move for a suspension, you know you are not going to be allowed to speak to it. So what do you do? You put your speech into the motion. You know that they are going to gag you. You know that you are going to say, `They're fascists,' `They're wearing their jackboots, as usual,' and `The Leader of the House is anti&amp;hyphen;

Good luck to him in the sense that he enjoys his politics, but the truth of the matter is that on each and every one of these issues, whether it is somebody's job in Geelong or whether it is the standing orders of the House, he thinks it is all just a great game and he plays it accordingly.

That is a long tradition of this democratic institution. We inherited many of these forms originally but developed them for our own purpose here to reflect Australian circumstances and needs.

          I have been aware, I must say, for some years now—we were conscious of it in opposition—that you cannot move for a suspension and use that motion as a substitute speech for a speech which you know is going to be gagged. Therefore, I think this is a very commonsense ruling. It is said by the opposition that it is a means to gag debate. The truth is that most days we have a matter of public importance after question time. At no stage has the opposition nominated this issue for the general debate. So it is not as if there is no opportunity to speak on these issues.

          It is quite simple what has happened this morning—that is, the Manager of Opposition Business has gone too far. He has pushed too far and you have, quite rightly, said there is a limit to how far you can go in drafting these motions. I think that is sensible. That will obviously develop over time. For that good reason, the government fully supports your ruling and we propose to complete the debate forthwith.

          —Thank you. This bill seeks to put in place a permanent exemption for the Austudy and Abstudy student assistance schemes from the provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 as they relate to marital status. A person who is married is entitled to the independent rate of Austudy, subject to the normal income and assets test and the actual means test, if applicable. Abstudy living allowance, income testing and rent assistance eligibility criteria also come into conflict with the requirements of the Sex Discrimination Act in this regard.

         <para first-indent="16">
          There is an expired provision in the act for a three&amp;hyphen;year exemption for student assistance schemes. This was to allow time for a way to be found to provide assistance to students without discriminating between those who are married and those who are in a de facto relationship. This point is actually very important because, unlike social security payments, where lower rates are often payable to people in married or de facto relationships, the incentive in Austudy is the other way.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          If de facto relationships as well as marriage were a sole criterion for receiving the independent rate, there would be a financial incentive for students under 25—when the independent rate is payable on the basis of age—to set up such relationships in order to be regarded as independent and free of the parental means test. The incentive is much stronger now following the government's unjustified and unreasonable decision in its first budget to raise the independent age for Austudy payments from 22 to 25 years.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In his second reading speech on the bill, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott) spoke of the difficulty for scheme administrators in verifying the legitimacy of de facto relationships. The opposition acknowledges this point and, therefore, we await with interest the proposals for verifying the legitimacy of such relationships once the youth allowance is in place and students in de facto relationships of two years or more can qualify for the independent rate on that basis alone.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Once the temporary legislative exemption for student assistance schemes in the Sex Discrimination Act had expired, the previous government sought exemption by administrative means through the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Such exemptions are granted only for a finite period. When the Labor government's exemption period expired, the new coalition government sought a further exemption, which will now expire on 31 December this year.
         </para>

          The opposition finds it extraordinary that the minister would allow this bill—which makes very clear the direction in which the government is heading on discrimination in Austudy and Abstudy—to be introduced before she has met her commitment to report to the commission. Senator Vanstone seems to go out of her way to crudely deal with sensitive issues. It is not as if student assistance overall has been treated generously by this government. In its first budget, it launched a half billion dollar attack on Austudy, which included raising the independence age to 25, removing case management and the schooling incidentals allowance for homeless students and extending significantly the actual means test.

The government has described these cuts as `better targeting', but if they are about better targeting the funds would surely be redirected, not cut. Worse still, the government has announced a review of Abstudy after the cuts, with a clear instruction that it should not recommend increased expenditure.

           Student and Youth Assistance (Sex Discrimination Amendment) Bill 1997
          </xref>
          represents an administrative change which will allow statutory exemption from the Sex Discrimination Act for the Austudy and Abstudy schemes. Since 1994, the federal government has had a problem with applying different tests for individuals, married couples and couples in a de facto relationship because of its breach of the Sex Discrimination Act.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We all know that under the Austudy scheme single applicants are assessed differently from couples. The parents of individual applicants are means tested to assess their eligibility, while married couples are treated differently. They are treated as being independent, and their parents' income is therefore not taken into account.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This different treatment is based on the principles that underpin Commonwealth allowances such as DSS payments and are accepted by both sides of this House. The principles are based on the assumption that a person with a partner has access to the financial means of that partner to meet their combined costs. In contrast, a single person who is independent of parental assistance does not have this opportunity to share costs for accommodation and other living expenses.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Further, differences in the way Austudy is assessed are found in the way married couples and de facto partners are assessed. Married couples are automatically deemed to be independent in assessing income, but de facto couples are not. If de facto partners were automatically assessed as being independent for Austudy eligibility, it would encourage people as young as 16 to leave home, enter a de facto relationship and receive full independent Austudy, free of parental means testing.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I do not believe that breaking up family homes is the type of thing this government, or indeed any government, should be encouraging. I believe there are already too many incentives for parents and children to part company for the sake of collecting an additional social security payment—although I do recognise that there are times when it is appropriate.

          Indeed, this is the reason why the government has announced the common youth allowance, which will encourage young people to stay at school or in training rather than leave home and collect unemployment benefits. This change signals an important shift in the way this government will tackle youth unemployment and better distribute assistance to those people and families who most need it.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The ALP will stand condemned for opposing the common youth allowance but, given its record of blatant obstructionism during this sitting and throughout the whole year, I will not be surprised when it decides to oppose this important policy.

          Returning to the issue of Austudy and Abstudy in relation to the Sex Discrimination Act, it should be noted that in 1994, under the Labor government, a temporary administrative exemption was issued by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner under section 44 of the Sex Discrimination Act. This was followed by the granting of further temporary exemptions, with the current exemption ending on 31 December this year.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I understand that officers from the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs have considered renewing the exemption or finding other non-legislative avenues to comply with the Sex Discrimination Act. However, such options were found to be prohibitively costly, administratively complex, legally flawed and totally against community attitudes; therefore, a statutory measure is required, which is what this bill will provide.

         <para first-indent="16">
          It is important to note that the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Ms Sue Walpole, was fully consulted on this issue and that all relevant departments agreed to the permanent exemption, including the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's Department, the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and, most importantly, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.

         The  Student and Youth Assistance (Sex Discrimination Amendment) Bill 1997  will provide a permanent exemption for the Austudy and Abstudy schemes from the operation of the marital status provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act.

        <para first-indent="16">
         When I first saw this bill, I could not work out why the government was introducing it. The explanatory memorandum says it will have no financial impact. The bill, by adding an exemption, appears to conflict with the stated intention of the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1996—currently before the Senate—of making laws fairer by removing or limiting exemptions for discrimination. It conflicts with the government's purported view that exemptions to the SDA should be limited and that, where possible, all federal legislation should be consistent with the SDA's objectives. That was in the second reading speech of the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) to the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1996.

        <break page="7809" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          It also conflicts with the government's stated policy `to introduce positive measures to encourage equal opportunity and to prevent discrimination against individuals'. That is in the coalition's law and justice policy. Further, half the bill will be irrelevant after July 1998 when the controversial proposed youth allowance commences, rendering Austudy obsolete. Finally, the SDA has been around since 1984 and the Student and Youth Assistance Act since 1973.

         <para first-indent="16">
          If the government has been able to secure exemptions from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission for all of these other years, why is it not just getting another six-month exemption this time? What is the difference this time?

         <para first-indent="16">
          The 1997 exemption of the Austudy and Abstudy schemes from the operation of the marital status provisions of the SDA was granted on condition that the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) gave an undertaking that a report would be made to the HREOC prior to the expiry of the proposed exemption—that is, 31 December this year—on long-term solutions to address the marital status discrimination within student assistance schemes, existing and proposed.

          DEETYA claims it is currently preparing the report, but it is difficult to see how it will be meaningful—at least as it relates to Austudy—given the impact of the bill and the imminent introduction of the youth allowance. A cynic might argue the government has decided to implement the bill because it has been taken aback by HREOC's condition. HREOC was saying, `Okay, enough is enough, the SDA has been around for 13 years. It's about time the government actually stopped talking about removing discrimination in the difficult areas like marriage and actually addressed the issue.'

          What was the government's reaction? It was not about to be dictated to by the commission, was it? No, rather than try to address the issue, it has taken the easy way out.

          To gauge further the government's position, you have only to look at how the Attorney-General, and the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman), handled the report of the Steering Committee on Social Security Discrimination. The report recommended a review of the implications of the policy based on dependency assumptions; for example, indirect discrimination due to the different treatment of married couples and de facto couples in income and asset testing rates of payment.

          , the Attorney-General, with the Minister for Social Security, undertook to report back to parliament within 12 months in relation to the issues raised by the steering committee. I may be wrong, but the only report I have been able to find so far is a dismissive two-page press release which concludes the government will not take steps to reduce `discrimination in the social security regime on the grounds that reduced payments to couples recognise principles of economies of scale'. That is, the government assumes a person with a partner has access to the financial means of their partner to meet their combined costs whereas a single independent person, who is independent of parental assistance, does not have the opportunity to share costs.

          That says it all. The government simply does not want people to live together before they are married, and it definitely does not want to pay them the independent rate of Austudy if they choose to do so.

          I would just like to take the opportunity to remind Mr Abbott that there was a time when de facto couples received independent Austudy. Way back between 1976 and 1982, if applicants could prove their status by providing two stat decs—preferably from their parents—confirming that they had been living together for at least two years, they were considered independent. I can only conclude that the government did not look too hard for solutions.

         <para first-indent="16">
          What we have here is a government which claims it supports non-discrimination principles. It then introduces an SDA amendment in 1996 which claims to limit exemptions from the operation of the SDA but which, in reality, just maintains the status quo. We have an education minister who prefers to entrench a discriminatory exemption after the commission requested she investigate how to remove discrimination from the Student and Youth Assistance Act. We have an Attorney-General and Minister for Social Security who have recognised the problem and promised to investigate and report back to parliament but who, from the detail of their report, appear to have given the issue only cursory attention. To top it off, we have a Prime Minister (Mr Howard) who earlier this year endorsed tax incentives to persuade married women to leave the work force and stay at home.

          It all adds up to a serious lack of commitment on the part of the government to the non&amp;hyphen;discrimination principles it claims to respect. It is a contradiction.

           The Australian parliament introduced the Sex Discrimination Act in 1984 with a commitment to do all it could to remove from the Australian landscape discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital status, pregnancy or potential pregnancy. While current and past governments have continually reaffirmed their commitment to the principles of the SDA and to the international convention it ratifies, one could be excused for thinking that the current government is not fair dinkum about really taking a proactive approach to removing discrimination on the basis of marital status.

It is clear this government will get proactive on removing discrimination only when it will not cost anything to do so.

           I wonder how many de facto couples in my electorate will be forced to get married earlier than they would like just so they can study. To be consistent, the government should remove marriage as a criterion of independence. I will certainly study the amendment to be moved by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). I reserve my vote on this piece of legislation.

          seeks to provide a permanent solution to what would otherwise be an ongoing problem. It is a problem which has bedevilled the parliament and the last government and this government for quite a few years. From their inception, the Austudy and Abstudy schemes operated under a regulatory exemption from the principles of the Sex Discrimination Act. Then in 1991 these schemes were given a temporary legislative exemption that was to run out in three years. So from 1994 these schemes have operated under a series of temporary administrative exemptions. We have gone from a regulatory exemption to a legislative exemption to an administrative exemption. Now we want to go back to a legislative exemption, only this time we want to make it permanent.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We do need an exemption, because this scheme, in common with all other income support schemes, treats married persons and single persons differently. They all do that because they are all based on an assumption that couples have access to the resources of each other. That is a perfectly reasonable assumption. It is acknowledged by all parties, as far as I can work out, and at all times.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Austudy and the Abstudy schemes treat differently formally and informally married applicants. Formally married people are regarded as independent under Austudy and Abstudy. De facto couples are not regarded by that fact alone as being independent for the purposes of Austudy, and for the purposes of Abstudy the relationship is required to be on foot for six months before it is recognised.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is obviously a very significant issue. It cuts to the nub of the problem that the member for Calare (Mr Andren) has alluded to. Obviously, if we were to do what the member for Calare seems to be suggesting—that is to say, extend independence to de facto couples—we would be creating a lot of additional costs for the government. In addition to that, we would perhaps be encouraging people to move into de facto relationships
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          rather earlier than might be good for them. So this government, in common with other governments, is faced with a dilemma. We have to solve the problem.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We could run Austudy and Abstudy in ways which entirely comply with the Sex Discrimination Act. We could end discrimination between de facto and other married couples. We could do that by removing marriage as a ground for independence, and that is something which the member for Calare mentioned as a possibility. Indeed, it is something that the former government tried in February 1995, but that regulation was rejected by the Senate. Or we could add de facto marriage as a ground for independence but, as I have just said, that would be an extremely costly exercise. Sadly, someone would have to pay for it, and that someone would be your constituents and my constituents and the taxpayers of Australia. Or we could try to provide a permanent exemption, and that is what we are going to do with this legislation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Should the Sex Discrimination Act mean that married and unmarried students are treated exactly the same for income support purposes? I do not think it should mean that. It does not happen in other bits of legislation and it should not happen here. Should the operations of the Sex Discrimination Act encourage people to move in together?  Should it provide, even if only indirectly, an incentive to shack up? No, I do not believe that that is the purpose of the Sex Discrimination Act.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would point out to the member for Calare that the youth allowance will at least in part address this problem. The youth allowance, as the member for Calare should know, will provide for de facto relationships of two years standing to be a ground of independence for the purpose of being assessed at that independent rate. In fact, we are doing with the youth allowance what was done with the tertiary education assistance scheme back in the 1970s and early 1980s. So, to that extent, the government's policies are accommodating the member for Calare's concerns.

         The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) in his contribution suggested that we should not do anything until the department has completed a report to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. That report is indeed in preparation, but obviously we would not be introducing this legislation if we did not think that it was perfectly consistent with the tenor of our investigation so far.

        <para first-indent="16">
         What the member for Werriwa is suggesting is that we go back to the former situation of a temporary legislative exemption. Well, we did that before. The former government did that. It expired and they were left with the problem. That path has been tried; it was not very effective. Why go back to something that has failed? I have to say, for a gentleman who thinks that he is better than the people who have gone before him, I am disappointed to see the member for Werriwa going back to old, failed solutions. We all know that the member for Werriwa thinks that he is better than his senior colleagues; it is a pity to see him emulating the sort of thing that was tried by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans).

         . It is interesting to listen to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott). He provided a very poor justification as to why the government has not made public its report; why it has not completed due process and reported on these
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          issues to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.

         It seems to me to be an absolute perversion of process for the Parliamentary Secretary to stand up and say in the House of Representatives, `We know what is in the report and it is not inconsistent with our legislation.' If they know what is in the report, and he is willing to say that in the parliament, then make the report public. Report to the human rights commission so that due process, at the very least, has been completed. This is a basic principle in having faith in the processes of government—that information is made public and it is subject to public accountability and scrutiny. It is poor form indeed for the Parliamentary Secretary to take that course of action, to treat the parliament and the public with contempt on what he described as a very important issue.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If I might respond in the spirit in which the member for Warringah concluded his remarks. I was interested to hear his reservations about the impact of this provision on de facto relationships. Certainly, from talking to my parliamentary colleagues about this, we acknowledge there is a concern about the administrative difficulty of monitoring the legitimacy of de facto relationships in these circumstances. I think that is a public administration concern that a reasonable person would acknowledge.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But the member for Warringah comes from that social engineering strand of the Liberal Party that places greater emphasis on what he thinks people should be doing. His main concern was not about the administrative difficulty; it was about whether or not it is in their best interests for people to be in a de facto relationship. I think his exact words were `that it might not be in their best interests to be in a de facto relationship at this time'.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I know that the honourable member for Warringah has wide interests in these matters. I am not saying he is part of the bedroom police at this stage, but I don't think he is in any sort of position to make a judgment about whether it is in the best interests of consenting adults to be in a de facto relationship or out of one.

          There are limits to what parliamentarians can legitimately achieve in public life. We have to allow a bit of freedom of choice and adult discretion. It is not our job to ascribe to people what their interests may be if they are in or out of a de facto or any other form of relationship. So I urge the member for Warringah at the very least, in his consideration of this matter, to drop the social engineering strand from the Liberal Party. Let us stick here to public administration matters. There are some administrative difficulties, so let us stick to those instead of getting into the sort of social engineering for which the Lyons Forum in this place has become renowned.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I think these are the two matters of substance. Let us stick to the administrative issues, and let us also acknowledge the need for due process. Quite frankly, the Labor Party is not in a position to support the bill in its entirety until due process has been completed, and it would be unreasonable of the government to expect us to take any other position.

It is a very difficult job, but, if we cannot make it simpler and fairer, obviously there is something fundamentally wrong with the concept or there is something fundamentally wrong with us.

          Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1997
         </xref>
         amends the previously legislated amount payable to the states through the ANTA agreement to provide for cost supplementation and the effect of budget changes and also legislates an amount for 1999. The reason the amount in 1998 is to be reduced despite cost supplementation is that the 1997 budget announced a cut in Commonwealth vocational education and training grants to the states and territories of $20 million per calendar year beginning next year.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These cuts are being introduced under the interesting label of benchmarking efficiencies, which are described in a budget measures table as providing `an incentive to the states to achieve efficiency gains in their VET operations by, for example, benchmarking their activities against the most cost&amp;hyphen;effective states'. The most cost&amp;hyphen;effective state for this purpose is described as Victoria. I would suggest it has been much more about crudely cutting costs than about building effectiveness within its TAFE sector.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The closure of TAFEs, described by the Kennett government as `amalgamations', the running down of their system and the merger of 14 TAFE institutes into eight and possibly five is a further indication of how these do represent cost savings much more than efficiency or effectiveness gains. These decisions by the Victorian government have now been rewarded by the Howard government holding this as a model for the rest of the country. The irony is, however, that in Dr Kemp's so&amp;hyphen;called $4.5 billion TAFE `deal', delivery of guaranteed Commonwealth funding is dependent upon states and territories creating an extra $100,000 student places each year.
        </para>

         Of course, this whole approach to vocational education and training, like the govern
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          ment's overall tackling of higher education, is input focused. Dr Kemp talks about the need to improve quality, yet the benchmarking measures he is forcing on the states are entirely focused on costs. Nothing demonstrates this better than the results of the national employer satisfaction survey conducted in late 1995 and early 1996 by AGB McNair and funded by ANTA. It is interesting to note how Dr Kemp's star state performer—Victoria, by his assessment—is actually measured in this survey. For instance, on the question of supervisor satisfaction about the extent to which the course fitted in with work commitments, there was an Australia&amp;hyphen;wide level of satisfaction of 74 per cent but for Victoria only 65 per cent.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         On the question of recent TAFE graduates, where supervisors were satisfied with the compatibility of the course with training requirements, Victoria again failed to measure up to the national average. The state rated a dismal 42 per cent on the issue of satisfaction with the incorporation of on&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;job training, compared with 68 per cent for the New South Wales sector and a national average of 61 per cent.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The benchmark state ranked second lowest in the country when employers were asked about the relevance of skills to the current needs of their organisation and second lowest on the issue of job readiness of graduates. Not even on the cost&amp;hyphen;effectiveness measure does Victoria make it anywhere near the national average. It scores 58 per cent, as against an Australia&amp;hyphen;wide satisfaction level of 69 per cent.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Finally, when employers were asked to rate their general satisfaction with the training provided, where does Victoria rank? Last by the length of the straight. This so&amp;hyphen;called `model state', when it comes to various measures of effectiveness and satisfaction within the sector, comes a long last. It should be noted that New South Wales, the object of some criticism by Dr Kemp, rated higher than or equal to the national average on every one of the above criteria.

         TAFEs are being expected, with reduced funding, to continue their traditional role of providing broad access to adult education while, at the same time, competing with private providers to meet the needs of employers. As the Pro&amp;hyphen;Vice&amp;hyphen;Chancellor, Vocational Education and Training at the RMIT told the Senate inquiry into this legislation on 5 August:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         There has been a substantial decrease in capital funds for VET. That is a concern to us because of the old stock that we have . . . if we are going to go into a competitive trading market, we are competing with other providers that may be up to date with buildings, facilities and equipment, whereas we have been left with a fairly run&amp;hyphen;down situation.

         This government is walking away from its responsibilities in all sectors of education. Mr Des Fooks, a former head of DEETYA's Vocational Education and Training Division told the same Senate inquiry:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         Of the graduates of TAFE in 1995, 55 per cent were female, 27 per cent of them came from a non&amp;hyphen;English speaking background, six per cent had a disability and 1.6 per cent were Aboriginal. That is a pretty impressive little bundle of statistics to demonstrate the importance of TAFE in the community . . . Anything that is going to impact on TAFE resources will impact immediately on those target groups, many or most of whom will have nowhere else to go—

         in the education sector. According to an ABS survey of TAFE graduate outcomes for 1994, the average age of TAFE graduates was 29 years, with 11 per cent of graduates being over 44, highlighting its critical role in the development of life&amp;hyphen;long learning, opportunity and possibility in Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The survey also highlighted the increasing significance of TAFE in providing particular skills to people who have previously completed a university education, with some five per cent of graduates having completed a bachelor or higher degree before commencing their TAFE course. By inadequately resourcing TAFE, therefore, the Howard government is effectively abandoning one of
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          the most important roles it can play in Australia's current and future interest: ensuring the appropriate provision of quality education and training for all our citizens.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In Dr Kemp's media release of 8 June, announcing his so&amp;hyphen;called $4.5 billion `deal' to the states and territories, he claims his funding contract will lead to a major upgrade of the TAFE system. Dr Kemp implies, as he does in so many other areas—literacy, vocational education in schools and civics education, to name a few—that nothing ever happened until he arrived on the scene. The truth is that between 1991 and 1994 contact hours in the VET system grew by 21 per cent. The average growth rate for TAFE over the last decade has been around seven per cent per annum. In the last five years growth has been something like 10 per cent per annum, according to submissions received by the Senate inquiry.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These achievements are now being ground to a halt. The Kemp deal, which reads more like a threat to the states and territories, commits the Commonwealth to a guaranteed level of funding of around $900 million annually for the next five years on the condition that the states and territories increase student places by 500,000. There will be no growth funds from the Commonwealth. All this growth must be funded from the states and territories through so-called efficiency gains.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is a peculiar minister indeed who is promising an extra 500,000 places in TAFE off the back of no increase in Commonwealth funding. Dr Kemp is winding back the growth component of Commonwealth funding yet telling the Australian public that 500,000 places can be produced. It is a bit like the New Testament—I know the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), will relate to this—Dr Kemp positioning himself such that he wants to turn fishes and loaves into a feast. There is no feast without Commonwealth resourcing. There can be no feast or growth in the TAFE sector without a matching Commonwealth contribution.

        <break page="7821" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          All the ANTA documents received by the minister highlight the past funding growth under the former Labor government and the fact that his deal is more a threat. His deal cannot produce a feast unless the Commonwealth keeps up the growth funding that the former Labor government had committed to TAFE and vocational education and training in Australia generally. The schedule to the Australian National Training Authority Act states:

         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          The minister is now even acting outside the schedule of the legislation. This is the reason why he wants a new ANTA agreement—an agreement on his terms and conditions alone. The government does not want to be reminded of the commitments and responsibilities from which it has walked away. It is no wonder the states are resisting so strongly.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This is not an ALP piece of resistance. It is not an ALP objection to the way in which the minister is going about his business. The strongest objection, the strongest piece of resistance, comes from his own colleague in Victoria Phil Honeywood, the Victorian Liberal Minister for Tertiary Education and Training. He has led the drive by state and territory training ministers. They met in Adelaide because of their concerns about the future of the system. They believe in their statement that young people have had their expectations raised unrealistically. They wanted to come to Canberra to meet Dr Kemp and discuss a more reasonable proposition for future TAFE funding than the one being put forward by the Commonwealth. The minister refused their request and now the states are talking about involving the premiers—going to the top.

         <para first-indent="16">
          We cannot wait for Jeff Kennett to involve himself in vocational education and training. He has been such an astute critic of this government that I would certainly welcome his intervention in this debate. He would know, as does his minister, that the states are being screwed over. The states are being ripped off in this so-called deal which, from their perspective, can only be understood as a threat—the threat that unless they squeeze

          The states in this regard are being placed over a barrel. They are being placed in an untenable position—the 500,000 places are to come off their budgets, out of their efforts, without any Commonwealth growth funding. One could reasonably understand why they are objecting and why they have put party politics to one side to barrel the minister and highlight his hypocrisy on these various matters and to highlight the way in which his public rhetoric, particularly the promise of an additional 500,000 places, does not accord at all with the sort of information that has been provided to him by ANTA.

         <para font-size="-=2">
          Experience suggests that for most states a baseline efficiency of one per cent per year has been achieved over the past five years. Nationally, annual average efficiency growth of one per cent would fund only between 9 and 20 per cent of the required growth in VET clients.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          For the past five years they have made a one per cent efficiency gain. If they were to do that for the next five years it would only meet one&amp;hyphen;fifth of Dr Kemp's target. So Dr Kemp is expecting the states and territories after a substantial period of change and reform within their TAFE sectors to multiply by a factor of five the efficiency gains to meet his target.

          Clearly it is unrealistic. Clearly it is nothing more than a publicity exercise. Clearly it is nothing more than the minister again trying to protect his own hide, advance his own interests against those of Senator Vanstone. That is not hard to do. You do not need to mislead the parliament or mislead the public to look better than Senator Vanstone. Dr Kemp is out of control and he is certainly not providing this parliament with any accurate information when one examines this ANTA document.

           The bottom line is that this information is not available. It is not available to ANTA. It is not available to the minister. The minister has no right or authority for making the claim that 500,000 extra TAFE places will be provided in the coming period. The information is not available. He is engaged in a public relations exercise that is doing damage to the relationship between the Commonwealth and the states and territories and, ultimately, and most unfortunately, doing damage to the whole nature of vocational education and training in Australia.

           These matters need to be placed on the public record. I am delighted to be joined in my criticism of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Dr Kemp, by Phil Honeywood, who has come out in his frustration in recent weeks. For example, on 13 June Mr Honeywood was reported in the

Mr Honeywood has been a pretty effective dismantler, a strong dismantler, in his own right. But now he is asking the question: `who will guard the guardians?' One of the dismantlers is saying that the system will be under further pressure if Dr Kemp has his way. On 12 June the

           <para style="Para">
            Upon coming to office, this government acted quickly to signal that it has no commitment to any part of the education sector. It made education and training funding its No. 1 target for budget cuts at exactly the same time as it was trying to quarantine Defence spending.
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            In its first budget, it reduced vocational education and training grants to the states and territories by $66 million over four years and abolished the five per cent real growth on TAFE for a saving of $91 million over four years. The government also cut $12 million from ANTA's operating expenses. The trend continued in the 1997 budget with the so-called $72 million benchmarking efficiencies, to which I referred earlier. Vocational education and training funding has been cut by 2.2 per cent in real terms between 1996 and the year 2001, yet the government came to office having promised—again, it must have been a non-core promise—to:
           </para>

           </para>
           <para style="Para">
            That was the public promise. The reality since the election has been nothing more than betrayal, nothing more than empty publicity stunts, nothing more than cost saving measures and nothing more than running TAFE into the ground and not fulfilling the commitment of the former government to grow TAFE, to grow the pathways available for post&amp;hyphen;secondary education in Australia. The other cutting blow to the TAFE sector comes with the creeping privatisation of the sector such that some $500 million a year in Commonwealth and state funds are to be made available to fund the training of all new apprentices and trainees through the provider of the employer's choice.

I would question the nature of a sectional interest when employers in Australia are provided $500 million under the banner of user choice without any matching user pays. I have not known of a single part of the public sector in these recent decades of reform where user choice has not been accompanied by some element of user pays, yet here we have the federal government authorising a transfer of $500 million to employers for them to undertake the training options on behalf of their employees.

I would have thought that, if employers were given a user choice, they would be expected to fund more substantially the nation's budget in vocational education and training than they do in Australia. If they are to have a choice of training options for their workers, they should be making a greater contribution to training funding and general support in the workplace than what we have seen in recent times.

            It is a dangerous proposition to place worker and employer interests in this particular perspective because it may be tempting for some employers to use their choice, to use their budgets in this particular area, to cast a narrow set of skills for their particular workers. I would have thought it would be preferable to have workers very closely involved in the casting of their own training, their own skill development.

         We are not taking money from vocational education but ensuring that the money that is spent is spent wisely and to the benefit of all those students who will not be going on to university. We are ensuring that the appalling lack of apprentices right across the board is addressed. The fact is we have a lack of skilled metalworkers and skilled people in the hospitality industry as far as chefs are concerned. We have heard that in Mount Isa they cannot get apprentices. In fact, MIM have told me personally that they were only able to fill half the apprenticeships they had available in 1997. Why is that?

        <para first-indent="16">
         Mr Deputy Speaker, I put it to you that it is because the vocational education system applied by the previous government failed the young people of Australia. We need businesses, industry, industry leaders, the private and public sector training systems and the schools to work together. It will only be then that we will start to address the problem of vocational education needs in the schools.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If I can just talk briefly about the CASILS project, we have seen young people being given an opportunity to work one day a week in a workplace so that they understand both the rights and the responsibilities they have in a workplace. Some have already gone on to traineeships and apprenticeships as a result of the work that has been undergone in Caboolture in the last few months. What has impressed me is that the business community have not just supported this; they have become almost fanatical in their approach to wanting this scheme to progress so they can employ young people. This is a great turnaround, and it is a turnaround that has been fostered by a government policy which sees the need for vocational education to take a proper role in society.

         One of the private schools in Brisbane—Nudgee college, which has a very long history—has also seen the need to embrace vocational education. Through its dedication, it has seen a growth in the number of young
         <break page="7825" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          people getting jobs in that sector and not just going on to university. Nudgee is catering not just for the 30 per cent who go to university but for 100 per cent of its students, including the 70 per cent who must find jobs in the workplace.

         So the picture that is painted is that we have to move away from a system that has failed young people and that has failed the wider community in not allowing us to have the skills base that we need to take the opportunities that Australia offers us. Isn't it appalling that we have to go overseas to find skilled people to fill jobs in Australia? The wider community gets very upset about that, and understandably so. But we have to do that because the system that we have had in place for many years has failed to bring through those people with the skills necessary to fill positions in the industries that Australia has. Unless we turn this around and we start to put vocational education into the schools in such a way that it meets industry needs, that it is proactive rather than reactive and that it uses the resources of the public and private sector—whether it be TAFEs or private providers—then we are not going to be able to progress.

         The previous speaker, the member for Werriwa, mentioned ANTA. ANTA actually has the task at the moment of sifting through a number of trial schemes to come up with skills centres. Skills centres allow for technology to be placed into schools so they are able to increase the vocational education ability of the attending students. I am very much a supporter of this entire project. Once again, it is a demonstration of the government's commitment to vocational education and also its dedication to the knowledge that we must immerse both traditional and new skills in technology. This has been very well done by John Paul College on the south side of Brisbane, which have a success rate in placing their students approaching 100 per cent. They do not just have computers in the school; they have actually immersed every subject in technology.

         I rise today to support the second reading amendment moved by my colleague the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). In doing so, I support the condemnation of the  Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill  expressed in the second reading amendment. This bill is about further cutting the funds needed to help train young Australians for jobs at a time when this government is responsible not only for the growth in the number of young people coming from overseas under the working holiday makers program and taking jobs and training opportunities that ought to be available to young Australians but also for a 50 per cent growth in the independent skill category of migration. So much for this government's support of training and apprenticeship opportunities for young people in Australia. This government would prefer to give training and job opportunities to people from overseas rather than concentrate on the needs of young people in Australia. That is the crux of the problem. This government has made no commitment at all to job and training opportunities for young people. It is about time this government faced up to the fact that unemployment is the biggest problem confronting Australia, in association with a lack of opportunity and a lack of a sense of security in people's lives.

         The bill is to implement the 1997 budget decisions—to do what? It is to cut $14.3 million from vocational and industry training and another $72 million from education and training grants to the states. That is what it is about. It is not about increasing opportunities but reducing opportunities through cutting the very programs that are supposedly aimed at helping young people in Australia to get decent skills on the basis of which they can be attractive to employers.

The cuts I refer to are in addition to the $183 million cut from vocational education and training in the 1996 budget, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott) is well aware.

         It is not about increasing opportunities; it is about reducing expenditure in the first two Howard budgets on training for young people in Australia and ripping away their opportunity to gain the skills that are so necessary in order for an employer to be willing to say, `Yes, I am prepared to give a chance to that young man or that young woman for the purposes of training and for getting a job with me.'

          Last night the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), in the inaugural Prime Minister's lecture, suggested that Australia is safer and fairer than it was 18 months ago.

          I suggest that the Prime Minister has been letting his Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) run around wasting money on publicity while our TAFE colleges and apprenticeship system fall into neglect. In an extraordinary outburst last week, the minister's Liberal Party colleague, the Victorian Minister for Tertiary Education and Training, Mr Honeywood—a person well known to you, Mr Deputy Speaker—said that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training was more concerned about his personal publicity than he was with putting young people into jobs.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We all know what that is about; it is about Dr Kemp stabbing his senior minister in the back so that he can obtain her post at the cabinet table at the expense of young people, purely on the basis of his own self&amp;hyphen;promotion and publicity. Last week, the minister put out this very expensive glossy kit, which includes a colour photograph of himself. We all know about publicity—and we will deal with that in due course—but surely this money would have been better spent on helping some young people get training opportunities, rather than on colour photographs of the minister.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The minister is also well known for doctoring the figures to give the opposite impression of the truth. Recently he has been exposed in the House on a number of occasions in question time with respect to those activities. He was known as misrepresenting statistics in his academic days, as throwing figures around without proper caution to justify his claims. He is continuing that approach as a minister of the Crown.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I have the articles here to prove it if he wants to have a debate about it. He doctored the figures on the success rate of Working Nation programs, for example, to justify abandoning the election promise to maintain
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           labour market program expenditure in real terms—again not a core promise, despite the promises before the last election. Nearly $2 billion was taken out of jobs programs in John Howard's first budget. Clearly, the real losers as a result of those cuts—for example, with respect to LEAP, which is a highly successful green program that assisted young people—were young people, their families and their local communities.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training had to find an excuse to justify this massive betrayal—that is what it is—of a promise to maintain spending and to do something positive to reduce unemployment. But, as usual, the minister could not rely on the real facts. The real facts were that the number of long-term unemployed had fallen by 35 per cent since the Working Nation labour market programs came in. The number of long-term unemployed had fallen in trend terms every month for the last 32 months of the Labor government.

          So the minister, the honourable member for Goldstein, set about twisting the facts to justify cutting these effective and compassionate programs for the long-term unemployed. He even manufactured figures to discredit the programs, and the department itself knows this. For instance, he baldly stated in the House—and the Prime Minister repeated the claim—that the cost per job obtained through new work opportunities was $143,000.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It later became clear that these figures related not to the cost per person assisted, as the statement implied, but the so-called cost per net impact of the programs. It also became clear—as the parliamentary secretary is well aware—that the so-called cost per net impact was a very artificial concept which served only one real purpose, and that purpose was to mislead the Australian people into thinking more was being spent on these programs than there actually was.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The member for Goldstein's own senior minister, Senator Vanstone—the person whose job he is after—has admitted under questioning in Senate estimates that assessing labour market programs according to the cost per net impact is a limited measure of their effectiveness. She has specifically said that suggesting
          <break page="7828" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           that the figure for jobs under the new work opportunities program is $143,000 is not the cost per person. Department officials made clear that this figure is in fact 14 times—yes, 14 times—the actual cost per person assisted. But that does not worry the minister, the member for Goldstein, because it is just a little twist of the figures. He did it during his academic days, and he is continuing it whilst he is a minister of the Crown.

          The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training has been doctoring the figures again recently in relation to the number of apprenticeships in Australia, and we will deal with the facts again to prove the point that I have just suggested. At the time of the 1997 August budget, his media release titled `Funding for new apprenticeships' portrayed the government as providing $265 million for 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships in 1997-98. This is grossly misleading. As this bill makes clear, funds for vocational education and training are in fact being reduced, not increased. The facts speak for themselves.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The so-called new apprenticeships and traineeships are just the continuation of annual commencements, and their rate of growth has slowed drastically since the Howard government took office. The number of traditional four-year trade apprenticeships has in fact fallen, not risen, since the Howard government took office.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Independent officers of the department confirmed at Senate estimates hearings a fortnight ago—and I hope the parliamentary secretary is listening because these are the facts—that the number of apprenticeships in 1996-97 will be as many as 2,000 down on the 1995-96 figures; that is, around 46,000 compared with 48,000. They are Senate estimates facts, not my figures.

          Then we go to the rate of growth in traineeships, which has also dramatically
          <break page="7829" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           slowed since the Howard government took office. It has gone from 117 per cent in Labor's last year of office to around 33 per cent in the last year, with virtually no growth expected for next year. The reason for this is that the Howard government has cut rather than expanded vocational and industry training in its first two budgets by nearly $270 million—and again we are talking about facts that have been twisted and distorted to suit the minister's own best interests.

          Most of those cuts have been to grants to state governments. It is no wonder that the Victorian Minister for Tertiary Education and Training, Mr Honeywood, has had some harsh words to say about the performance of this government in recent weeks. When you look at the 1997 budget papers, as distinct from the minister's PR material, you see very clearly in the savings measures table—table No. 7 of budget paper No. 1—that another $72 million will be cut through benchmarking efficiencies in vocational education and training grants to the states.

I suggest this bill is a further instalment in a series of cuts. As a result, there has been understandable outcry from the states.

I think `18,000 new apprenticeships for secondary students' sounds like a good headline—it was, after the program. But at the Senate estimates hearings a fortnight ago, the department when questioned about the fine print was forced to admit that only 900 young people would start apprenticeships and traineeships in schools as a result of this program—not 18,000. At Senate estimates, a parliamentary process of this nation, we were

I can understand that the minister wants to promote himself, but I would have thought the expenditure on the production of that glossy photo and on all those kits would have been better spent on trying to train young Australians rather than again opening the gates and reverting to increased immigration from overseas. That will be the end result of cuts to these programs by this government.

The study also determined, from the results of a survey of TAFE participation, that students in non&amp;hyphen;metropolitan Australia were less able to participate in TAFE than students in the state of Victoria at large.

         That information was on the record in 1994. What did Labor do about that? Unfortunately, next to nothing. That is why, of course, we see in this House only two Labor representatives of regional Australia. Regional Australia got very sick and tired of being treated as second&amp;hyphen;rate citizens.

         That report in 1994 recommended that traineeship places should be expanded and targeted at 15&amp;hyphen; to 25&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds in regional areas. That did not happen. It said that training should include basic general education, vocational education and employment. As we saw, under Labor's VET programs the participation rates of schools were minimal. In 1994, we were told traineeship programs should be further developed on an industry basis with programs controlled by employers, unions and workers in the industry rather than specifically just in educational institutions. In other words, it was calling for a participatory, coordinated, cooperative approach. That, of course, did not happen. It is happening now.

I think that is an indictment of the previous government. They should be feeling very ashamed.

         How did we get to this situation? We have had a massive maldistribution of skills throughout Australia. We have had a cultural cringe about apprenticeship training and technical training compared with a goal of going to university. Tragically, decades ago all that started to happen. Victorians in particular will remember that one of the premiers of the day, Joan Kirner, abolished the name `technical schools' from our vocabulary. Technical schools were very substantially encouraged to amalgamate with the high schools to become so&amp;hyphen;called `secondary colleges'.

Of course, it is no surprise that we saw a significant decline in the number of young Australians commencing apprenticeships. In 1988&amp;hyphen;89, 62,678 commenced apprenticeships, including 5,217 who began metal fitting and machining apprenticeships and 1,252 who began horticulture apprenticeships.

           for Werriwa (Mr Latham). The government's legislation amends previous legislative amounts payable to the states through the Australian National Training Authority for cost supplementation and effects of budget changes and legislates an amount for 1999. The Vocational Education and Training Funding Act gives the minister the power to make payments up to a maximum legislated amount. However, while I will be referring quite extensively to figures and costs and how this will affect my state of New South Wales in particular, the key issue of the debate is the danger of stopping the reform process begun by the Labor government through short-sighted cost cutting and failure to properly invest in educating and skilling Australians.

         Following on from last year's cuts to vocational education and training, the  Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1997  implements a further reduction of $20 million per calendar year, as announced in the budget. These cuts are being called `benchmarking efficiencies', aimed at encouraging states to benchmark their vocational education activities against the most cost&amp;hyphen;effective states. The coalition government's cost cutting exercise for vocational education and training will once again lead to uncertainty and stop&amp;hyphen;start policies in this vital area of educating and skilling the Australian work force.

         Under the new ANTA agreement, the minister wants an efficiency dividend of 100,000 extra enrolments to be produced each year. At the same time, the government wants the states to meet the cost of training places for unemployed 16&amp;hyphen; to 17&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds previously on unemployment benefits. This would require the states to fund over 262,000 training places at $6,000 per place, totalling $1,572 million.

         This cutback and additional responsibilities will create the possibility of derailing the training reform process begun during the term of the Hawke Labor government.

          work force. This program is now under even greater threat. Worse still is the fact that these cutbacks are being implemented at a time of high youth unemployment with a dramatic reduction in the number of jobs for young unskilled school leavers. The economy and industry are still undergoing considerable change with new and more demanding requirements of the modern workplace meaning higher than ever levels of vocational training have to be achieved, with the work force being required to be equipped with the knowledge and skills needed in a highly competitive global economy.

         I am very concerned at the general thrust that is being given to really downgrade the TAFE system. The cuts contained in this legislation merely serve to underline that issue. When one lines up the cuts with the passion for a training market in vocational education and training, the concerns become even more intense. I intend to quote from information provided to me, once again, from the New South Wales Teachers Federation. It relates to AEU briefing paper No. 3, as follows:

         The zealots driving the market will use the figures above to invigorate their efforts. Firstly, they will be hoping that user choice, commencing in January 1998 and involving some 20% or $500 million of recurrent funding in VET will finally get the market operating. ANTA's plan for user choice is to ignore both public and private providers and concentrate on enterprise-based training with the enterprise as the provider.

          The reductions in VET funding for New South Wales will impact on the state's ability to meet the demand for vocational education and training. The total reduction in national VET funding of $20 million in 1998&amp;hyphen;99 and $72 million for the period 1997&amp;hyphen;98 to 2000&amp;hyphen;2001 will mean a loss to New South Wales of $6.72 million in 1997&amp;hyphen;98 and $24.19 million over 1997&amp;hyphen;98 to 2000&amp;hyphen;2001 on a population share basis.

          It is proposed that the cut in ANTA funds be offset by state efficiency gains. This ignores the fact that New South Wales has been achieving significant efficiencies in VET. There are major difficulties with benchmarking efficiencies between states and territories because of the lack of comparability of data. New South Wales has consistently taken up this issue with the Commonwealth and ANTA. New South Wales would favour an alternative method for distributing the $20 million cut, as would most other states and territories. The favoured alternative is to base the cut on a relative population share—of the 15&amp;hyphen; to 65&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old population—so that all states and territories bear the cuts equitably.

The $20 million cut represents around 0.7 per cent of total VET expenditure and will have a significant impact on TAFE New South Wales, whose share will be approximately $7 million annually or $24 million over four years.

           vocational education and training amendment as one of the most important proposals to come before this House in this session. I noted from the comments of the member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield), who spoke extensively about what sounded like the difficulties he was having with his own state government in New South Wales, that one of the key tenets of the sorts of program the government is pursuing is that it is not a TAFE only sector. There are other options, and certainly the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) is to be commended on encouraging industry groups and the like to explore training delivery alternatives.

         I know that, in my own electorate, a high school in its current incarnation, Monterey Secondary College—things change as we age—has in fact quite a respectable motor trades workshop. It has the capacity to be more involved in training through that venue; and now, with the changes that the government has implemented, the opportunity to mesh the vocational training with secondary schooling is available and possible. It is something that the schools in my electorate are taking a great deal of interest in.

         I remarked in my maiden speech to the House 15 months ago that the presence in Dunkley of institutions like Peninsula TAFE, Monash University's Peninsula campus and the broader educational infrastructure made it quite well suited as an academic centre of some prominence. I talked of how strategic alliances between our educational institutions and our primary and sunrise industries had the potential to enable Dunkley by the bay to excel in areas like clean and green food production.

         What I did not say in my first speech was that a year and a half on it is becoming clearer just how the government's plan is beginning to produce a demand driven training system; a system of education that is moving from being often largely concerned with providing students with a liberal education—and that is not to be criticised—more towards one that provides them with the wherewithal to find employment. We need to bear in mind that 70 per cent of the students
         <break page="7839" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          in my electorate of Dunkley do not go on to university. They have to consider other career options and the government is putting in place strategies that will aid their search for employment. While we have the taxpayers still funding, on average, three-quarters of every university degree, people who do not choose to go down that path currently are not getting the sorts of attention and assistance that this government believes they deserve.

         We are all aware also of how the former government ran down apprenticeships to one of the lowest levels since the war. That was a disgraceful measure for them to simply turn their back on. When you look forward to the future you realise that we need a very skilled labour force if we are going to compete. If we are not investing in the vocational skills that are so important to our future, particularly in the fast-growing services area, how are we going to be well positioned to provide the jobs for the young people who are leaving the education system?

         A quality national training system built into all industries has a critical role in establishing Australian businesses, services and products as leaders in the worldwide market. Quality training is about people: equipping them with skills and matching them with the needs of employers. That is precisely what the minister has been talking about. I understand that the personal attacks directed at him by earlier contributors just illustrate how little grip the Labor Party has on these issues facing the nation and these 70 per cent of young people who quite rightly believe that Labor has turned its back on them.

This is not advocating credentialism—collecting pieces of paper just for the heck of it. It is about accumulating skills and competencies—I see you like that, Mr Deputy Speaker—that enable young people to present themselves to employers as productive persons in the workplace. It is

          another area where this government has taken some very important initiatives. The measure that recognises that apprenticeships need to be renewed, upgraded and made more responsive to today's economy is one of the most excellent initiatives that Dr Kemp has introduced—and there have been many of them, so it is quite a compliment to point that one out as one of pure excellence.

         If your training schedule and the program that employer and trainee work through have an emphasis on a greater level of training in the earlier part of their employment, to enable those skills to be accumulated and to enable those qualifications and credentials to be obtained, then that should be encouraged. All we are saying to employers is, `You pay for the productive time of that young person, for the time that you are getting value out of them so that that person is attractive to your business, and the government will make a contribution to top up the salary that is paid to make sure that it meets national training wages.' That is a very important measure—to recognise that this concept of training is not solely about the trainee.

         We need providers of training, which we are talking about here today, but we need employers willing to participate in that structure as well.

Again, it is another reason to compliment Dr Kemp on his very visionary and forthright approach to this portfolio. It just disappoints me greatly that those opposite can only resort to denigrating him personally rather than addressing the issues before this House.

         From estimates made by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, there are about 160,000 Australians who currently have an apprenticeship or a traineeship. Dr Kemp recently launched, in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne which stretch from Kew and Whittlesea to Portsea and south of Pakenham, a new apprenticeship training one&amp;hyphen;stop shop in the electorate of my friend and colleague the member for Deakin (Mr Barresi). That is important because that region alone accounted for just under 4,000 apprenticeship and around 2,000 traineeship commencements in 1995&amp;hyphen;96, with a further 12,850 apprentices in training.

Almost one&amp;hyphen;quarter of the TAFE's enrolments in 1996 were in engineering and in personal services, showing the degree to which the local industry and tertiary industries, such as tourism and hospitality, are dependent on these sorts of training facilities.

         We might dwell on that issue for one moment. In the hospitality industry, as in many other service industries, there are no traditional apprenticeships. If we had left the responsibility for managing this important area of our future in the hands of the Labor Party, they would probably still not be recognised in that formal training structure. Dr Kemp has introduced a regime where industry is encouraged to work with trained providers to get accredited training programs in place and to provide new apprenticeships in industries where the new job opportunities are for the people of this country.

I found the minister's remark especially appropriate for the Dunkley community, because we have a lower percentage—around 30 per cent—of young people taking up the university option than the national average, which is around 37 per cent.

Employers will see their businesses become more productive and competitive if they take on an apprentice, particularly in the new apprenticeship framework, where they are paying only for the productive time of that apprentice while also gaining the benefits of their productive time, for which the business is paying. It is attractive for business to pay for productive time and to have the government step in to support these new traineeships with a top&amp;hyphen;up of income so that the trainee can enjoy the national training wage. The government has made a long&amp;hyphen;term commitment to training the young people of Australia so that our companies and small businesses, and micro businesses in particular, can continue to be great contributors to our country.

         <break page="7842" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

Without those core skills, participation in the workplace and in the community, being able to read training manuals, being able to understand safety instructions in the workplace and being able to comprehend orders that come through from customers are made very difficult. This is why we need to invest in these core competencies of literacy and numeracy. It is a commendable effort that complements what the bill before the House today is seeking to achieve.

All young people in this country deserve to be invested in.

         The effect of the amendments is to cut $20 million each year from the Commonwealth funding to the Australian National Training Authority for allocation to state and territory training agencies for vocational education and training.

This is a nonsense. It again assumes that major inefficiencies exist in the training and further education sector which, if overcome, would provide a sufficiently large pool to fund these 100,000 places a year—a figure which the minister estimates would cost $300 million each year. How the minister has arrived at this figure, we have no idea. Certainly not through discussions with those with the clearest understanding of the sector, that is, those who work in the TAFEs—the teachers and administrators.

         Who would actually fill these 100,000 places? The Australian Bureau of Statistics calculated in 1996 that 62,000 people were unable to gain a TAFE place. Of these, 7,000 cancelled their applications, 11,000 were not eligible for the courses for which they applied, 6,000 applied too late and 21,000 gave `other reasons' for their failure to gain a

         It is true that some added demand will result from the government's plans to force more young people to remain at school or to go on looking for vocational education. The other plank of the government's efforts, as far as 16 and 17 year olds are concerned, is to deprive them of any income if they choose to leave school without having a job. The government itself estimates that this is around 27,000 students a year. Nor are the government's new traineeships and apprenticeship arrangements likely to result in demands on the TAFE sector of the magnitude suggested by the government's target for new places, given the states' reluctance to support them.

          Mr Honeywood's fears appear to be well founded. Departmental advice to the minister suggests that schools will be required to cater for an additional 27,000 students per year when changes to the youth allowance take effect. It suggests an additional allocation of $140 million per year would be required as a result, but the Commonwealth has made no move to increase its contribution to schools funding.

This is a further example of the government's neglect of our public institutions and its attempts to channel public money into the private provision of services, which are motivated by ideology rather than any evidence that the private sector can provide an equivalent quality of service at a lower cost.

Quotations and thoughts of the likes of Thomas Jefferson, Martin Luther King and Anne Bronte are as brilliant as they are timeless. There is one adage, however, which has not survived the test of time: the conventional wisdom that the only fundamentals to a good education are the three Rs. It is both unfashionable and obsolete in the context of a beneficial, contemporary education. Arithmetic, reading and writing are only the beginnings of a relevant, modern education. The development of practical skills and abilities, a pertinent knowledge of information technologies and an aptitude for further learning and professional development are supplementary qualities which today's employers require.

          the last decade has changed forever our approach to vocational education and training. To illustrate this point, in decades past there were many vocations where you could literally walk off the street and into employment without any experience or training. Such is not the case today. Every job requires a particular range of skills and abilities. Indeed, in the past it has been the lament of many young talented Australians that they cannot find work because they have no experience or relevant training in the industry in which they wish to make a contribution.

         Consequently, this government has set about redefining the fundamental three Rs of education—whether it be school, tertiary, vocational or training—to relevance, responsiveness and realism. A particular priority for reform for this government is vocational education and training. It is significant to note that 70 per cent of school leavers do not go to university or to TAFE on a full&amp;hyphen;time basis. Yet, despite their number, it is a group which was marginalised by the former Labor government.
        </para>

         In my previous term as the member for Sturt, young people and parents alike would often ask what was being done to help that majority of school leavers who did not go to university or TAFE.

        <para first-indent="16">
         These frustrations were not isolated to an unlucky few. During the recession that middle&amp;hyphen; and lower&amp;hyphen;class Australia had to have, national youth unemployment reached 34.9 per cent in July 1992, compared with total national unemployment of 11.1 per cent. The former Labor government's ineptitude in this particular area punished not just young people but also Australian small businesses and industries—and the member for Banks (Mr Melham) was a member of that government. A philistine approach to industrial relations policy, coupled with inadequate training programs, stifled apprenticeships and training opportunities in a great variety of small businesses and industry. To a certain extent, the effects of this era are still felt today.

          Some other government initiatives to complement this bill include an allocation of $45 million towards achieving improved literacy and numeracy rates, of which I have spoken earlier in our term of government. This commitment represents a 50 per cent increase on the former Labor government's expenditure in this area. There is also a $23 million investment in professional development for teachers, including up-to-date training in industry experience, and a $74.1 million initiative aimed at developing Asian language skills among our school students, which will likewise complement this government's cohesive vocational education and training strategy.

          This bill provides for an increase in funding of $17.938 million to the 1997 amount previously appropriated under the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992. This will take this government's commitment to vocational education and training to almost $1 billion in 1997—$909 million, to be precise—a 12 per cent increase on the former Labor government's 1995-96 vocational education and training expenditure.

          It is anticipated that this increase in funding will contribute to an estimated national total increase of 55,000 training places for our youth in this year alone.

This adjustment is in accordance with the resolution of state and territory ministers at the Australian National Training Authority ministerial council meeting in May this year.

          However, the most significant aspect of this bill is the establishment of the new apprenticeships program. New apprenticeships have been developed by this government to provide
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           trainees with a nationally recognised qualification which embraces the concepts of simplicity, relevance, flexibility and responsiveness to the needs of employers and trainees. Accordingly, this government also expects new apprenticeships to play a major role in ensuring that Australian small business and industry can confidently meet the challenges and demands of the global economy into the next century and beyond.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The key words in defining new apprenticeships are `relevant training'. The former Labor government, as is their wont, tentatively approached vocational education and training by aimlessly throwing money around in the desperate hope that there might be some method in their madness and that some of their expenditure may end up representing good value for the taxpayer.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          To make matters worse, they could not even afford to pay for their irresponsibility, so they did what all good, irresponsible governments do: they booked it up on the national credit card. Unfortunately for Australia's youth, small business and industry and, indeed, the economy in general, the former Labor government's vocational education and training strategy was obsolete in the technological and performance oriented business culture of today.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          New apprenticeships will address these deficiencies. The parameters under which new apprenticeships will operate can be broadly summarised as a national system which is responsive to and accessible by small and medium enterprises; ensures that training leads to quality and nationally agreed qualifications; gives business a key role in leadership and provides training which is relevant to business; has streamlined regulation delivery mechanisms to ensure responsiveness to clients; and is more efficient through the use of flexible, workable and competitive delivery arrangements.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Thus, the coalition government has given small business, the engine room of the Australian economy, the confidence and assurance for the utilisation of this initiative. A reduced budget deficit, a revitalised economy and the abolition of the anti&amp;hyphen;economic growth provisions of the Industrial Relations Act have
          <break page="7848" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

          Nationally accredited and accepted qualifications in vocational education and training is also a long overdue initiative which will lend itself to recognising geographic diversities. This bill is responsive to both regional and urban needs. The government achieved this by recommencing the dialogue suspended during the Labor government between government and urban and rural small business and industry interests.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In its pursuit of excellence in all forms of education, this government has encouraged small businesses and industry to assist in the development of training programs. This will ensure that the vocational education and training provided is relevant to the demands of the particular industries involved, which, in turn, will give our school leavers an appropriate preparation for employment. This government, as promised in the election, will continue to accompany and assist the youth of this nation, particularly in the formative stages of new apprenticeships. A training which is both nationally accepted and relevant will give trainees the flexibility and adaptability to pursue their own employment ambitions.

         <para first-indent="16">
          By simplifying and streamlining vocational education and training whilst avoiding the disproportionately large administrative expenses of Working Nation, the government has also made significant savings for the taxpayer. The new apprenticeships program is good for youth, employees and, inevitably, the economy. As a form of illustration of this assertion, the national training manager of Woolworths expects to treble their trainee numbers from a present total of 350 to a minimum of 1,000.

          In addition to the involvement of companies such as Woolworths, other small businesses and industries are likely to appoint trainees in trades such as manufacturing, maintenance, engineering and construction, graphic design, forestry, child care, youth support work, sport and recreation, and rural industries. New and expanding industries such as technology and communications, tourism and hospitality, the domestic music industry and information

          It is this far&amp;hyphen;sighted, equitable and fiscally responsible attitude of the government which will define new apprenticeships as a groundbreaking program. Indeed, the coalition government is providing hope for Australian school leavers regardless of their career paths. Encouragingly, enrolments for undergraduate students in tertiary education are up by 14,350 or four per cent. Contrary to what Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Carr would have us believe, an injection of funds for better targeted programs for vocational education and training and a strengthening economy is evidence of this.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As with a number of other issues, I have gone out on the front foot and said that 10 years ago we were right in advocating a senior high school for Mount Druitt. Regrettably, the then Labor government did not proceed with that, but the Liberal government formed the first ever public senior high school
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          at St Marys. It is not based on the model we proposed, but, to give credit where credit is due, the first public senior high school in New South Wales at St Marys, which is  now in my electorate, is an outstanding success. At that senior high school there are 800 applications for 400 positions in year 11. This is a public school that is reversing the drift from public to private. It not only offers exceptionally rigorous courses that lead on to university but also offers rigorous vocational courses.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am very keen to ensure that this senior high school at Mount Druitt not only has vocational courses which are board approved but also, more importantly, lives up to the principles that Laurie Carmichael was espousing. We must ensure that TAFE units are placed in that senior high school so that we give reality to the proposition that people can complete high school and be part way to their TAFE qualifications. For example, if someone wanted to do an apprenticeship, by staying on and doing years 11 and 12 at Mount Druitt Senior High School not only would they finish with a department of education qualification but also they would be well into their apprenticeship, including practical experience. I am going to continue to fight for that.

         I have to say that the abolition of the youth allowance has had a dramatic effect on my electorate. Again, I think the minister is a little confusing if not misleading in his statements. I can remember when we were doing a review of Austudy in this place quite rightly coalition members said—and I note that the former deputy chairman, now chairman, of that committee, the honourable member for LaTrobe (Mr Charles) is in the House—said, `We have to make sure that people just do not go to school to collect their Austudy and that there are benchmarks of progress.' The committee agreed with him and we recommended that way.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         By abolishing the youth allowance, what you are doing right across Australia, and I am talking about my electorate, is forcing people back to school not because they see school as giving them extra skills, giving them a better start in the job market, but merely because they have been deprived of a benefit. Schools have sufficient challenges just dealing with
         <break page="7850" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          young people and all their aspirations in years 11 and 12. If you get a group of unmotivated students, as the coalition was saying when debating the Austudy provisions, who are merely at school to fill in time, then the potential for disrupting serious students becomes even greater.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In my electorate there are something like 537 students who may be going back to school because they have been cut out from receiving the youth allowance. As the shadow minister has said, there has been no extra money provided for schools to cater for this huge influx and no extra resources provided to maybe have a second chance at interesting them in worthwhile subjects and seeing their potential and talents developed. It is going to be an extra burden for high schools that the McLaughlin report has suggested already are very fragile and near collapse. I think that is a very unfortunate approach to this problem.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In western Sydney we are well provided for by a network of TAFEs. I have been pleased to see the Mount Druitt TAFE go through seven stages of expansion—not all in the time I have been a member. I was thrilled to be there, because we promised to provide a TAFE, when the sod was first turned. Now I am thrilled to see a vibrant institution with effectively some 8,000 full&amp;hyphen;time places for young people in my electorate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think it is regrettable that when the minister suggests that there is going to be wholesale expansion of the TAFE sector—for example, Mount Druitt TAFE is going to be able to take even more students—what he is really talking about is that there have already been federal government cutbacks to the TAFE sector and they are expected to be able to achieve extra places through efficiency gains. This is at a time when in New South Wales through a similar methodology 5,000 extra places were already provided.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I can say that in New South Wales and at Mount Druitt TAFE there is not the opportunity to dramatically increase the intake of students by these so-called efficiency gains. Even if there were, two-thirds of the funding to expand TAFE places comes from the state government. When the minister says that we are going to have an expansion of half a
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          million places in TAFE, what he is really doing is trying to predict how the states are going to be able to spend their money at a time when, in terms of direct line items and untied grants, they are cutting the budget.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Vocational education for young Australians, indeed all Australians, is too important to trivialise and it is too important for the minister to make misleading statements about—misleading statements about TAFE's capacity to expand the system without any extra federal funding. I think the opposition would welcome an expansion of the TAFE sector, but what we really want to see in that expansion is the government putting its money where its mouth is. The high schools in my electorate are being expected to take on an extra 550&amp;hyphen;odd students without any additional funding.

What the existing Native Title Act has done, because of its flawed operations, because of its manifest complications, is contribute to rather than subtract from division and argument within the Australian community. We now have the extraordinary situation where the Australian Labor Party is still supporting the maintenance of a right to negotiate potentially in relation to 78 per cent of the land mass of Australia.

         The Mabo decision of five years ago contains sound  principles. The Native Title Act of the former government took the Mabo decision way beyond the original decision of the High Court of Australia. The Native Title Act of 1993 introduced concepts which were completely alien to the land law of Australia. What we have been left to do, as we were left to do in relation to the budget, as we were left to do in relation to unemployment, as we were left to do in relation to so many other things, is take responsibility of cleaning up the Labor Party's native title mess.

You always have to be suspicious of plans that draw unanimous support from everywhere.

Having been forced by this government to use their super between 55 and retirement age, how can the government claim that these people have a more secure retirement income when the government's policies will deliberately undermine that security?

Some of the evidence that I have seen suggests that the greater sense of

I do not recall that your government attempted to do anything about that during the 13 years that it was in power. The third thing that you appear to have completely and deliberately ignored, that you have paid no account to at all, is the major improvements in the network of security that my government has provided to older Australians.

         Let me remind you of what my government has done for older Australians. The first thing we have done is reduce inflation, which has produced a great deal of price stability. The second thing we have done is provide incentive for private health insurance. The third thing we have done is introduce the same taxation provisions for self-funded retirees, which have been very widely welcomed by the elderly of Australia. Fourthly, we have introduced reforms in the aged care area which will in fact lead to improved quality of accommodation in aged care, despite the scare campaign that the member for Jagajaga has assiduously mounted all around Australia.

          —I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. Retail sales in July recorded a 2.6 per cent rise, the highest monthly rise in over three years. Retail sales have exceeded 2.6 per cent for a month only three times over the whole of the decade. This is a very strong growth in retail sales, which probably explains why the Labor Party has no questions to ask about retail sales today.

         I have never seen a group of people who get more morose as the economy picks up. Absolute silence is coming from the Australian Labor Party. They were very interested in retail sales a couple of months ago, but with a 2.6 per cent increase—the highest for three years—there are no questions on it, no economic statements and, in fact, no economic spokesman coming in here and asking questions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Seasonally-adjusted retail sales, which grew in July, showed a particularly large increase of 17.6 per cent in the department store component of retailing. Although anecdotal evidence suggests this could in part be a result of end of year clearance sales, growth in total retail sales over June and July averaged 1.1 per cent, a step up from the average growth of 0.4 per cent per month recorded in the first five months of the year. Excluding department stores, retail sales grew by a solid 1.2 per cent in July.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The retail sales growth was broadly based across all of the areas, other than recreational, hospitality and services and, as I said before, it was particularly strong in relation to department stores. In addition to that, revisions have occurred for past months which have actually made the retail sales for June somewhat stronger than had originally been thought.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The big step up in retail sales for the month of July is a welcome sign in relation to consumer spending and consumer spending patterns. That can be taken together with the national accounts for the June quarter, which were released yesterday. They showed a 1.2 per cent increase, which was a very strong result in relation to the June quarter. We have seen, coming together with a low inflation climate and a low interest rate climate, an economy which is definitely stepping up into

The fact is, as the honourable member should have known as the legislation went through this House, that legislation provided that no more than 35 per cent of the shares be sold to non-Australians.

          The honourable member also referred to the fact that there is some considerable demand for shares, if one can judge from the reservation of the public offer document. It is true to say that, since that particular process started about three weeks ago, there has been some considerable interest and a number of applications have been made. One cannot take from that that all those who reserve the public offer document will in fact, subsequently, after receiving advice from their brokers, proceed to apply for shares. The international experience on that is that between 30 and 60 per cent of those who reserve the public offer document proceed subsequently to actually apply for shares.

          If I could indicate further, prior to the election, we made it abundantly clear to all Australians that we would proceed as a government to sell one-third of Telstra in shares so we could get funds to provide for the biggest single attack on environmental degradation in this nation's history through the $1.1 billion Natural Heritage Fund. That is one of the main purposes behind the sale of one&amp;hyphen;third of Telstra. We said at that time, and nothing has changed today, that we were very interested in as many Australians as possible—the mums and dads of Australia—getting access to this great Australian company.

I can assure her that that process of providing for the mums and dads of Australia to buy shares in this great Australian company is still to the forefront of the government's thinking and, ultimately, when the allocation is made, that will be seen by all Australians to be the case.

          —I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. On a recent visit to her electorate, I was very impressed by the very deep and widespread support for the government's work for the dole scheme and for the principle of mutual obligation, on which that scheme is based. I detected this level of support also in recent visits to the electorates of Warringah, Wannon, Ballarat, Bendigo, Dunkley, Deakin and others. Indeed, the Australian community has embraced the work for the dole scheme.

         The Commonwealth recognises the need for protection for all participants in work for the dole projects. Participants in projects will not be employees of either the Commonwealth or sponsor bodies. Accordingly, the Commonwealth will be purchasing accident or liability insurance to ensure proper protection for all participants in line with current insurance arrangements for labour market programs.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The accident and liability coverage also protects a participant's liability arising out of negligent acts which cause personal injury to a third party or damage to a third party's property. But I should say that sponsors are expected to provide and maintain a safe working environment in accordance with relevant laws relating to occupational health and safety throughout the projects. Sponsors will be required to maintain public liability insurance—the cost of which can be included in the project costs in the application.

         I am very pleased to say that the first contracts are expected to be signed by the end of September, after some 600 applications have been sorted through. That shows the level of community support—community support which the Labor Party has completely failed to acknowledge. The Labor Party, as

          we know, opposed the work for the dole scheme until Major Backflip over there decided that he could not withstand public opinion any further. The overwhelming response to the work for the dole scheme indicates the government's and the community's commitment to helping young unemployed Australians.

         This is good news for young doctors and it is also particularly good news for rural areas. For young doctors it will give them the tangible benefits of having an alternative pathway to have a guaranteed place that will lead to a provider number. For rural people it will provide additional doctors; it will make country hospital positions much more attractive than they have been in the past, and it will ensure that those positions are quality positions.

         I would like to say to the honourable member, as to other rural members who have raised the issue with me time and time again about attracting doctors into rural areas, that this will make those hospital positions much more easy to fill. The hospital positions in the country will now be the only ones in Australia with this sort of guarantee. It is well known that the AMA and I have had a few differences in the past, but I must thank the AMA and other organisations for the cooperative way in which they have approached these negotiations.

          —I thank the member for Cowper for his question. Mr Speaker, this government does not accept that residents' funds can be subjected to any level of risk. The prudential arrangements that I have announced will provide full protection of residents' funds and will ensure that the balance will be repaid in full and on time.

         The government cannot compromise on its commitment to prudential arrangements. While the record of the hostel sector has been very good, the reality is that a number of facilities have encountered financial difficulties as a result of a variety of factors. In one case a large facility in Victoria became insolvent; in another case another facility in South Australia encountered financial difficulties. In these situations residents either face lengthy delays in receiving the balance of the bonds or the complete loss of those bonds. No matter how limited the number of such incidents is, the consequences are simply unacceptable.

         I have also said that there will be a capacity to approve alternative prudential arrangements where a group of providers can demonstrate that they can deliver an equivalent guarantee to residents. The Aged Care Act provides for this where such alternative arrangements are at least as stringent as the general prudential scheme. Prudential arrangements are an integral component of this government's aged care reform package. We will accept nothing but the full protection and security of those residents' funds.

          —Mr Speaker, my question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Given the minister's demonstrated errors in his claims on TAFE and ANTA funding, will he now correct the information he has provided the House on schools funding? Why has the minister claimed in this House that government schools will receive an extra $2.3 billion when his own department has told the Senate that the real level of direct Commonwealth funding will fall by $41 million in the four years following 1996? Or is the minister now using Billy Hughes's counting system as well as his hearing aid?

         So you can commit these figures to memory so that you do not go around the country trying to mislead people and, indeed, telling people that the government's decisions are running down government schools when the fact is that our decisions are the best news government schools have had for a long time. I will just repeat it. What the government's funding commitments equate to is an increase of 17 per cent per capita for each government school student over the next four years, an increase of 17 per cent compared with 14 per cent per capita for non&amp;hyphen;government school students.

         It is a pity that you cannot read the tables straight. The table that we have put forward and the table that I am quoting from is the table that the Australian Education Union—your mates—have said is the only realistic way of presenting Commonwealth funding for schools. Indeed, the new putative spokesman for training in the Senate, Senator Kim Carr, has also said that that is the only presentation that gives an accurate picture of Commonwealth funding for government schools. So go and talk to your mates before you come in here and show your ignorance once again.

          —I thank the honourable member for her question. As extraordinary as it seems, Australia has had no regulatory infrastructure to oversee the Commonwealth's nuclear activities. So we have decided to merge the Australian Radiation Laboratory, which is located in Melbourne, and the Nuclear Safety Bureau, which oversees ANSTO, which is in Sydney. We are putting the two together to form the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency.

        <para first-indent="16">
         This agency will have a number of activities. The first is that it will regulate all activities at Lucas Heights. So for the first time the regulator will be at arms&amp;hyphen;length from who is being regulated. It will also have statutory power by way of its office&amp;hyphen;holders. It will work by having a system of advisory committees and working parties. These advisory committees and working parties will allow direct input from interest groups, local people and people with expertise on health issues. Finally, it will be responsible for trying to get uniformity in state and territory laws on matters relating to nuclear radiation. This was an issue that I raised with my colleagues at the last health ministers' meeting in Cairns and they agreed that Australia should move towards uniform Commonwealth&amp;hyphen;state regulations and laws on nuclear radiation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The member for Hughes also asked me what the benefits would be for her constituents. The benefits are very simple. For the first time, located in my department, there will be a body that oversights all activities at Lucas Heights. These activities will not only include the decommissioning of the old reactor but also the activities of the new reactor, the storage and disposal of spent rods and the production of isotopes, which are so essential to medical diagnosis. Also, her constituents will have a chance to have a direct input into this by way of the operation of the advisory committees and working parties.

         When it was first put to me that there should be a new authority like this and that it should be located in my department, I was not wildly enthusiastic. But after a long period of advocacy by the member for Hughes, I was

        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         Here he is—the arrogant and the endangered who spends all his time trying to manipulate information before this House. He is told one thing by ANTA and he tells this House something completely opposite. It is like reading an Orwell novel where this minister tries to pretend that black is white, good is bad, cuts are growth and funding reductions equate to opportunity. For a man who spent most of his adult life campaigning against totalitarian governments, he has embraced the 1984 ethos—that is, white is black, good is bad, cuts are growth. That is the nature of this minister's performance in this House on every single issue of education funding.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I invite the House to look at the record of this minister's comments critical of the funding policies of the former government and then examine the information that has been provided to him by ANTA. This is what
         <break page="7875" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          ANTA had to say about funding policies under the former government:
         </break>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . total VET participation, measured in terms of annual hours curriculum (AHC), has grown by an average of 5.0 per cent per year in the context of significant real increases in government, especially Commonwealth government, funding (an average annual real increase of 3.4 per cent).
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         So under Labor there was an annual increase of 3.4 per cent. The number of additional dollars that this minister is putting into VET—into vocational education and training—is a big fat zero, abolishing the growth that Labor had running under the former ANTA agreement.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So, while in this House he criticises the former government, he has clear information from his own authority, ANTA, to actually praise the former government and its funding policies. Then there is the mother of all misrepresentations, the mother of all Orwellian tactics. In his press release on 8 June this year, the minister said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The number of student places in TAFE colleges will increase by up to 500,000 in the next five years.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         Not `may increase', not `might increase' but `will increase', according to the minister in his public statement, by up to 500,000 in the next five years. This is what ANTA said to the minister recently in this document that has been provided to the opposition:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The capacity of States and Territories to deliver efficiency gains of this order, within a single calendar year, is problematic.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         So what is a certainty for the minister is problematic for ANTA. It gets even worse for the doctor because ANTA then goes on to say:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         This experience suggests that, for most States, a baseline efficiency of 1 per cent per year has been achieved over the past five years. Nationally, annual average efficiency growth of 1 per cent—
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         that is, what they have done for the last five years—
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         would fund only between 9 and 20 per cent of the required growth . . .
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         that is, the doctor's growth. The doctor's growth is totally unrealistic. The doctor's claim in the public and parliamentary arenas of what the states and territories have been
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          doing in the last five years is totally unrealistic by any sensible measure. I can guarantee the minister that they have not been sitting on their hands. There has been substantial reform in the TAFE sector over the past five years. The document goes on to then say:
         </break>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">

         While the minister in his press release is saying there will in absolute certainty be another 500,000 places, his department is saying that the information needed to make that statement is not available.

The member did not say `deliberately misleading' and certainly, every time `deliberately misleading' has been used, the member using those words has been called upon to withdraw. However, the word `misleading' at other times—and there has been some inconsistency on this—has been regarded as unparliamentary and the member has been called upon to withdraw. I will refer this matter to Mr Speaker so we can come up with an absolutely ironclad definition. But in the meantime, since the minister finds it offensive, I ask the member for Werriwa to withdraw.

         There is no such analysis. I would challenge the minister in this matter of public importance debate to provide the analysis that he alluded to in his statement to the House of Representatives on Monday. The document that has been given to him by ANTA in the last two weeks provides no such analysis. They call it problematic. They say the information is not available. They cast all sorts of doubts over what sort of efficiency gains can be made by the state.

That was until this document lobbed on my desk—`New apprenticeships can work for you'. I opened the document and, all to my surprise, the first item that popped out was this. A photo of Dr Kemp.

He needs to tell the truth when it comes to giving the Australian people and the parliament of Australia an accurate reflection of what you are actually doing in the funding area for vocational education and training.

The Commonwealth is making a very significant offer to the states, which is to maintain funding in real terms for five years. It has called on the states essentially to match that offer and to produce growth in TAFE numbers by operating their TAFE systems in a way which will ensure that any efficiency gains go back into additional places for young people.

         Let me just look at the broader picture. We have before us an MPI which says that we have failed to provide sufficient post&amp;hyphen;secondary opportunities for young Australians. Nothing could be further from the truth. It was the Labor Party which restricted opportunities for young Australians across the post&amp;hyphen;secondary sector. It neglected TAFE for the
         <break page="7879" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          vast proportion of its period in office. It locked tens of thousands of students out of universities. Apprenticeships and traineeships declined as a proportion of the work force to their lowest level for three decades in 1995. In the last year of the Labor government, apprenticeships and traineeships were at a level only of 69,500 compared with 99,000 in 1996, the first year of this government.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The fact is that this government has expanded opportunities for young Australians in every area of post-secondary education. There are 55,000 extra places in TAFE in 1997, of which 43,000 have been funded by the Commonwealth. Again, I think one must make allowances for the shadow minister because he is relatively inexperienced, and I do not accuse him of deliberately misleading on this point. The fact is that total funding for vocational education and training has increased by some $144 million over the level of the last year of the Labor government. That shows this government's great commitment to vocational education and training.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Expenditure on vocational education and training is not the same as expenditure on TAFE. It is broader because it encompasses, for example, the Commonwealth's commitment to provide support for employers in taking on apprentices and trainees. The Labor Party neglected that whole area throughout its entire period in office, and it has fallen to this government to build it up to ensure that there are opportunities for young Australians.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The member for Werriwa went around the country last year saying that the budget decisions of the new government would restrict access to universities. The reality is quite the opposite, as the government intended. The government intended to increase access to opportunities for higher education. In fact, enrolments in universities this year are up 15,000 over the previous year. The university sector is better funded this year than it was last year. So the government has expanded opportunities.

         The growth in the apprenticeship and traineeship system is equally significant. I think it falls to me to point out to the House that the previous government completely neglected the apprenticeship system and the

          desperate need for reform. It even attempted to wipe the word `apprenticeship' out of statistics on employment based training. It introduced the traineeship, which was not well understood, and for 10 years tried to get it up and running. But because its partner, its close mate, the ACTU insisted on surrounding it with so many requirements, rules and regulations, it was unattractive to employers.

         In fact, we had the dramatic run-down of opportunities for many of the thousands of young people who would be in the member for Werriwa's own electorate. Like so many on the Labor side of the House, the member for Werriwa had his eye fixed firmly—as did his predecessor, John Dawkins—on the number of young people going into universities. There was a significant increase during the period of the previous government in the number of young people in universities, but only 30 per cent of school leavers go on to universities. What about the other 70 per cent? They were virtually utterly neglected. The member for Werriwa, along with all the other members of the Labor Party, went around giving the totally misleading message to young people that, if you were not going on to university, you were not going anywhere. It has fallen to this government—

In every sector, there has been an improvement. Let me say that this reflects the outstanding commitment of this government to redress the neglect of young people that occurred over the previous 13 years. When we came into office, for example, we found that some 30 per cent of 14&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds in year 9 in school could not read properly and that the reading comprehension level of boys had declined.

We do not start plans like Labor, which will say and do anything to make themselves look good. We all know what they do when they get into government.

Why not give people the opportunity to occupy those places? Why not give them the benefit of the wisdom and the tuition available from lecturers that are already being paid, that already have the resources that are required for them to deliver their programs?

We are all saying, `Cut, cut, cut—cut the rot,' but we will keep going for now. Universities in 1997 have enrolled more Australian students than ever before. You might not have understood that from what the member for Calwell was saying, but that is a fact. There are more Australians in universities this year than ever before. There are more opportunities for the young people of Australia. There are more opportunities to tackle the question of post&amp;hyphen;secondary education for young people.

         While I am on this subject, isn't it fortunate that the standing orders in this place are fairly slack when it comes to MPIs? Because this is so misleading that it would not have passed the test of almost truths. That is probably why

         The enrolment figures for 1997 indicate that enrolments of Australian students have increased by 15,820 effective full&amp;hyphen;time student places, which is 3.6 per cent on last year. That does not sound like a cut. That sounds as though 15,000 people are making use of the educational opportunities that this government is providing them.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In addition, Australian undergraduate enrolments have increased by over 14,350 or 3.9 per cent. That sounds like another increase to me, and further demonstrates that so much of what has been said in this debate today is just absolute, utter nonsense.

         In terms of funding levels for universities, the university sector is estimated to have some $33 million more of Commonwealth revenue in 1997 than in 1996. That does not sound like a cut to me either. That sounds like more resources. That is probably why we have more students in there. That is probably why, in Victoria, we have more than 120,000 students in government funded places. That is probably why students at RMIT, my old alumni, are so appalled by the student demonstration that was going on there that was talking about up&amp;hyphen;front fees. There is no obligation regarding up&amp;hyphen;front fees for more than 120,000 government funded places in Victoria. The people who are paying up&amp;hyphen;front fees at the moment are people who are not Australian citizens, who can buy places to pursue their dreams and who can pursue their post-secondary education vision for a better life.

         Everyone except Australian students can have that opportunity. If someone were to say, `I've just missed out very slightly with my TER score to gain access to a veterinary program, but that is something that drives me, that is something that is within me as I love animals and I'd like to make a contribution in that area for the rest of my career,' why can't they invest in their future? Everyone else has had the chance—but not Australian citizens. We have addressed that also.

University revenues from both these sources—that is, government funded places and overseas students and those who are paying up&amp;hyphen;front fees—have increased by $65 million over 1996 levels. Again, that does not sound like a cut to me.

         While we are on the subject of universities, let us talk a little bit more about what actually happened when people had the chance to enrol. You know the scare campaign that the Labor Party was going on about when it was said that people would be missing out on university places? As I have clearly demonstrated, not only has the number of government funded university places increased but they have actually overenrolled some 28,000 students against the undergraduate targets this year. There is an eight per cent overenrolment. That is more on top of more. I do not know how more on top of more becomes less, becomes a cut. Perhaps the member for Calwell could explain that or perhaps he has not confronted—

         In the tight budgetary circumstances that I have already outlined—that very heavy Visa card that this nation was carrying around, the debt that was left by those opposite for our young people—what has this government done? We have invested in those young people. We have said to them, `It is so important that we can provide you with future opportunities.' Dr Kemp has talked at length about the vast array of initiatives that has been introduced—all part of a plan to provide more opportunities for young people as they leave secondary education. Whilst that has been going on, we will put an extra $26 million over the next four years into universities to help them restructure, to take advantage of the opportunities that this government has provided them.

         With Dr Kemp, I was recently meeting with a number of careers teachers down our way, on the Mornington Peninsula, around the electorate of Dunkley. They were telling us about how overworked they are—and they are. They are working and working for the young people of this country. One of the challenges they are facing is that there are so many more choices for them, there are so many other alternatives that they need to explain and so many new opportunities that were not there under the previous government, that they are now spending more time talking with employers, talking with TAFEs, talking with the universities and working with the school community to make sure that those young people have a future and that the school is playing a valuable role in aiding that transition of a young person from the school environment to work. They want to have a stake in that transition.

         We have put an extra $560 million together for special programs, for literacy, for students with special learning needs and for languages so that opportunities are there for those people who, perhaps through some cognitive disadvantage that is not of their making, can be assisted.

It has done what the Labor Party's former minister said that Labor could never do, and that is to think about the 70 per cent or more of people who do not go on to universities.

The bill also streamlines the right to negotiate process, so reducing unnecessary delay; and, where appropriate, devolves greater responsibility to the states and territories to deal with these matters.

              While the right to negotiate will generally remain on vacant crown land, the bill will enable a state or territory to apply its own regime in relation to mining and relevant compulsory acquisitions on areas described as `non&amp;hyphen;exclusive or reserved areas'. These are basically areas of land or waters in relation to which, if native title exists, the native title holders do not enjoy a right to exclude others from the land or waters, and have, at best, only co&amp;hyphen;existing rights.

          The Mabo decision was a watershed in the history of this nation. After 200 years of European settlement we became belatedly the last of the so-called `new world' countries with a tradition of British common law to recognise the native title rights of our indigenous peoples. The decision was a milestone in the social progress that had already seen us abandon the White Australia policy, grant citizenship to indigenous Australians, address inequity in their education and many areas of active discrimination against them.

          The Native Title Act 1993 accepted the concept of native title and set out to address the attendant problems. It confirmed the validity of every previously issued title and set down a process for the expeditious and cost-effective handling of native title claims. The act introduced into this place represented the end product of negotiation and compromise with the key stakeholders. These were genuine negotiations, not just consultation and certainly not a crude sales exercise for a predetermined government position.

          With a range of common law cases already in train, and with entirely new structures set up to deal with a new and difficult range of problems, the implementation of the act would always be difficult. It was equally acknowledged that courts were yet to rule on critical issues such as the continued existence of native title on pastoral leases. That view was far from settled.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Back in 1993, the decision was to leave that view to the courts to decide. Wik had commenced in June 1993. That was the deal that was done with all the stakeholders in 1993. The High Court has now decided. The 1993 parliamentary record shows an interjection by me when the then Leader of the Opposition was asking a question of the then Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. That interjection indicates that I was one who believed that native title could coexist with pastoral releases at that time. So the issue was not settled, and it was not one way.

          Practical experience and subsequent court rulings have meant that it is inevitable, and it would be inevitable, that the act would need to be amended at a relatively early stage. The timing needed to be such that cases being heard were not compromised and that the teething problems that did not need to be legislatively revisited were worked through. In 1995, the then Labor government were moving to introduce amendments to deal with developments to that point in time. They constituted a measured response rather than an overreaction to sectional pressures. The initiatives lapsed, of course, when we left office. However, a transformation appeared to be taking place in the body politic.

          The noise of the bells is now deafening with what purports to be the government's legislative response to the Wik decision. The Wik proposition is that native title might, in theory, persist on some pastoral leases but that any such title was emphatically extinguished or suppressed to the extent that it was in any way inconsistent with a pastoralist's enjoyment of his or her title. Wik confirmed pastoralists' title yet, with the hysteria that went on after the Wik decision, one would think that it was the exact opposite.

It appears that the response from the government is to go for bucket loads of legislative extinguishment, and not just on pastoral leases. In a process where native title claimants have never had a right of veto, it removes the incentive for respondents to negotiate with claimants by giving Commonwealth and state ministers the right to intervene and make determinations for the respondents at the very beginning of the process.

          Creation of a new list
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          While the government considers that the broad structure of the system for taxing foreign source income is appropriate, it has become evident that there are problems with the list of countries used for providing exemptions.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          These problems have arisen because the current list of countries has been used for two distinct purposes that would have been best served by separate lists. The list has been used for the purpose of determining when income should be exempt from accruals taxation under the controlled foreign company and transferor trust measures. The list has also been used to determine when dividends and branch profits derived by resident companies should be exempt under the foreign tax credit system.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The current list, comprising over 50 countries, is unsuitable for the purpose of providing exemptions from accruals taxation because there are many countries on the list that do not consistently levy tax on a comparable basis to Australia.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          A more robust list of closely comparable tax countries is required for the purpose of providing exemptions from accruals taxation. The accruals taxation rules apply to amounts derived from investments that are likely to be significantly influenced by taxation considerations. Amounts derived from these types of investments are treated as `tainted' and include interest income, royalties and certain amounts derived from arrangements involving related parties. Accruals taxation of these tainted amounts is crucial to ensure investments offshore are not favoured over similar investments in Australia for purely taxation reasons.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          To address the problems with the current list, the bill will create a new list of seven `broad&amp;hyphen;exemption countries' for the purposes of providing exemptions from accruals taxation under the controlled foreign company and transferor trust measures. The list will comprise Canada, France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. These countries will be designated in the Income Tax Regulations as broad&amp;hyphen;exemption listed countries.
         </para>
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          <para first-indent="16">
           A shorter list will also make the task of designating tax concessions more manageable. Efforts to designate tax deferral opportunities in listed countries have had only limited success and are made more difficult by the large number of countries that must be monitored. The risks to the revenue associated with not designating a tax deferral opportunity are significant because tainted income by its nature can be diverted to take advantage of the opportunity.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The current list of countries is also to be updated and will continue to be used for the purposes of exemptions under the foreign tax credit system. The current list is still considered suitable for the purposes of providing exemptions under the foreign tax credit system because the exemptions apply to amounts derived from investments that are less sensitive to taxation considerations.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Countries that are listed for the purposes of the foreign tax credit system and not for accruals taxation purposes will be designated in the Income Tax Regulations as `limited&amp;hyphen;exemption listed countries'. Countries on either the limited&amp;hyphen;exemption list or the broad&amp;hyphen;exemption list will be treated as listed for the purposes of the foreign tax credit system.

           The bill will also modify the existing exemption under the foreign tax credit system for amounts derived by a branch in a listed country so that it can continue to apply to amounts derived through a branch in a limited&amp;hyphen;exemption listed country. The exemption will generally continue to be available for branch income other than tainted income.

         He went on to become an official of the printing union, culminating in his election as secretary in 1965. He was instrumental in the formation of the PKIU the following year. After federal intervention in the New South Wales branch, Bruce became the Assistant General Secretary of the New South Wales ALP in 1971.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In this position he broke new ground. There were no precedents and no&amp;hyphen;one to seek advice from in what was often a hostile environment. However Bruce, as he did throughout his entire political life, continued to take a principled stand and to earn the respect of all those around him, whether they agreed with his political position or not.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Bruce was elected to the Senate in 1981 and played a prominent role as a convener of the national Left and the parliamentary Left throughout the period of the Hawke and Keating governments. Bruce played a critical role in the positive achievements of those governments. Often in a minority position, he always took a principled view, always advo

        <para first-indent="16">
         Bruce has been throughout his life a genuine collectivist. He has believed that the movement is bigger than any individual. His values of democracy, respect, integrity, hard work, collectivism, modesty and loyalty are ones that humble those of us who see him as a role model. He is much loved by all of those who have been privileged to work with him and learn from him. Bruce has always been there to guide and support younger members such as me and others in the movement, even when we have not always deserved that ongoing support. He has particularly encouraged young women to advance themselves in the movement.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Bruce is a true believer in the principles of action embodied in the ALP's socialist objective—that progressive change comes not just through the parliament but through trade union action and through ongoing action organised by community groups. His leadership in organising the Palm Sunday peace marches of up to 170,000 people is practical evidence of his ability to unite and inspire often disparate groups in pursuit of common objectives. He is the ultimate democratic facilitator.

         He is, of course, retiring only from parliament, not from politics. I am sure that Bruce, as head of the Evatt Foundation in Sydney and convener of the national Left, has many more constructive years in politics. He has been involved in a broad range of issues in the party, in the trade union movement and in organisations as a parliamentarian, such as UNICEF and Parliamentarians for East Timor. He has been involved in a range of issues—often taking on issues that other people would duck because they were hard ones. Bruce has never squibbed it. Bruce has always been prepared to take up that principled position.

          —Tonight I rise to speak about the hypocrisy in the TCF debate. In the early 1970s, the TCF industry was flourishing in Australia. However, in 1974, when the Whitlam-Labor government oversaw the wages explosion combined with a 25 per cent tariff cut and currency revaluation, our competitive advantage was well and truly obliterated.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Imports began to flood in and jobs were lost. Analysts have stated that between 1972 and 1978 over 1,300 factories—32 per cent of the TCF industry—closed down. Fifty&amp;hyphen;thousand jobs were lost; that is, some three in 10 TCF jobs were lost. In other words, Labor instituted a TCF plan of 1989 which featured, amongst other things, the removal of quotas and the removal of jobs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I personally believe, as the Industry Commission states in its draft report, that the removal of quotas had a substantial impact on the local domestic TCF sector, greater still than the tariff wind&amp;hyphen;down. To add salt to the jobless wound, in 1991—in the midst of the most protracted post&amp;hyphen;World War II economic downturn—Labor revised this plan, accelerating the rate of tariff reduction and continuing the plan beyond 1995.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As a result of these poorly thought out plans, more jobs were lost and more industry went offshore, with the telltale figures between 1987 and 1994 highlighting the TCF factory employment falling by some 32 per cent, overall employment in the sector diminishing by some 20 per cent and manufacturing output down by 24 per cent. That is history. They are the facts. It was not helped along by the former Prime Minister, who stood up and proudly displayed the fact that he wore an overseas suit, a Zegna suit, instead of supporting Australian industry.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The reason I stand up here tonight to talk about the TCF industry is that I am surprised
         <break page="7901" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          by the hypocrisy. Today I have heard the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) called names such as the `battler for burgundy' and the `master of disaster'. I do not know whether they are true or not and I do not wish to call him those things in the course of this discussion, but I think he is a hypocrite because of the fact that he deserted the TCF workers. He was the person who put his foot on the accelerator in driving down the TCF industries and people out of jobs.

         If that is not bad enough, I draw the House's attention to a speech given on 26 March in 1992 by the former member for Hunter, who said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         `One step forward and two steps back.' If someone is 25 stone and wants to lose weight, he does not try to run a marathon and kill himself. If we want to make our manufacturing industries more competitive, we do not drive them at a pace which kills them stone dead. Our plan, which stages the reduction in protection for the TCF industries, is too rapid and too harsh. I admit it is no easy task to judge the pace of reform, but quite clearly we have failed.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         He was in government and he said, `We have failed.' Did his colleagues listen to him? No. As he came out to support the TCF industry, did his colleagues listen? No. What did they do? They accelerated the rate of winding back the tariffs. Then on 30 September 1993, that same member for Hunter came out and stated again that he was losing jobs—some 700 jobs throughout the Hunter in companies such as Depict Fashions and National Textiles.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If it is so important for the member for Hotham—the alleged `battler for burgundy', who cannot even be bothered drinking Australian wines and supporting that industry—to come out now and support the TCF industry, why didn't he listen to his own members? Why didn't he listen then and protect those jobs? The bottom line is that they deserted their union membership. All they wanted is their union dues. The only time they went into the factory was to collect union dues, never to protect jobs. So all of this screaming about protecting jobs is nothing more than wind.

         So the crying and screaming in this parliament is nothing more than a sham, but a sham is what they are on the other side of the House. They do not deserve to be in parliament. They do not deserve the support of the TCF industry. They got the barrel roll out at the last election because they could not deliver to those people who depended on them. They depended on them, but the Labor Party ignored them.

          —At a time when the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) goes about the country running down government schools and her junior minister is going around touting spurious figures for increased TAFE places—which even his own department describes as `problematic'—the nation is facing a crisis in education. There is no mystery about what has caused the crisis. It has been government neglect.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In Victoria, the crisis has been sharpened by the combined impact of state and federal funding cuts. A recent report on the resourcing of primary schools by the Victorian Primary Principals Association indicates that in 1981-82 the education budget in Victoria represented 31.2 per cent of the state budget. In 1996-97, it represents 18 per cent. Victorian government primary schools received the lowest government spending per student in Australia. In the two years to 1995, the Kennett Liberal government reduced in-school spending in primary schools by 11 per cent from about 4,300 to 3,800 per student.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When Jeff Kennett was elected, 39 per cent of classes had more than 25 students. Two years later, 60 per cent of classes contain 25 or more students. Cuts have seen a decrease in the provision of both curricula and extra&amp;hyphen;curricula activities. Victorian parents now pay an average of 30 per cent of a school's operating costs from voluntary contributions and locally raised funds. This is a scandal.

          As the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) indicated not so long ago, the Australian tragedy that a person's educational opportunities are dictated by their postcode is increasingly true. The savage cuts to the education budget have not impacted equally. The capacity of school communities to respond to the cuts is also unequal. Disadvantaged schools have been the hardest hit. The impact of cuts has been exacerbated by the reduced capacity of relatively disadvantaged school communities to respond.

          In recent times, matters have reached a high farce in Victoria. In 1996 Dallas North Primary School, which is in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, was selected to participate in an early literary research project, ELRP, conducted jointly by the Victorian Department of Education and the University of Melbourne. For participating, the school received additional resources—0.4 of an EFT—in the form of an experienced teacher to coordinate the project. The school was also given leave credits to allow those class teachers involved the opportunity to undertake regular professional development as part of the program.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The Dallas North Primary School ELRP team has achieved spectacular results by any standards. The University of Melbourne believes that during 1996 literacy levels at the school were improved by 20 per cent when compared with the reference group. In addition, the school has provided professional development for more than 300 teachers from all over Victoria and has also shown the program in operation to principals and teachers from interstate.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Based on these excellent results, Dallas North Primary School won the 1997 teacher of the year team award announced recently. This award acknowledges the professionalism of the ELRP teachers and highlights the value of the additional resources dedicated to the program.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          At this point, however, the story becomes a tragic farce. Despite these outstanding achievements and the critical need for ongoing resources from the Victorian government, the school council has recently been informed that the funding and resource provision given to the school for the program is to be slashed

         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          What a travesty it will be if the program ends next year. What a cruel joke. Dallas North Primary School has suffered successive cuts in funds. The school council rightly believes that it is unable to do more for less. Victorian primary principals estimate that it costs about $60,000 per year to operate a literacy program in a school of 350 students. In terms of the amount that has been ripped out of the education budget in Victoria in the last 15 years, this is peanuts.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Having proved that ELRP works, I call on the Victorian government to fund it. If Jeff Kennett will not fund it, I strongly urge the federal minister to stop bagging state schools and to provide the funds needed. Under the heading of economic rationalism, we cannot again allow Australia to be a place where only the wealthy have the opportunity to receive a quality education.

Across the parliament, in both houses, Senator Childs is greatly respected. Within this parliamentary party, the whole caucus also respects him.

         In a speech that was supposedly about forest industries, the member for Kalgoorlie
         <break page="7903" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          launched a savage attack on the territory. The member called the Alice to Darwin rail link uneconomical. He stated that the $100 million Commonwealth contribution to the railway was a stunt in light of the upcoming election campaigns in the Northern Territory and South Australia.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As most members would be aware, I have made many comments in this House in regard to the Alice Springs to Darwin railway. It has been on the drawing board since 1911. It is not a stunt. It certainly is a major project worthy of financial support from the Prime Minister's Federation Fund. The railway will turn Darwin into a major transport hub servicing Asia. It is a project that will provide jobs and investment for the whole country, not just the territory.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Northern Territory and South Australian governments would not have committed $200 million to the project as a stunt. The railway would not have bipartisan support unless it was a viable proposition. I always thought the member for Kalgoorlie was in favour of economic development. Certainly, when he was in government he extolled the virtues of government investment in infrastructure projects and industry. This makes his attack on the railway not only fanciful and unfounded but also out of character.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         His comments get worse. The member for Kalgoorlie then said, `Tasmania is much more important than the Northern Territory to the welfare of this nation.' What an outrageous statement. The comment shows a complete lack of knowledge of the economic contribution territorians make to Australia. I am happy to take the opportunity to educate him. Territorians are the most productive people in Australia. While accounting for only one per cent of the nation's population, we produce 1.6 per cent of Australia's exports. In 1996-97 this totalled more than $1 billion worth of exports.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is important to note that the population of the Northern Territory is less than half that of Tasmania. Despite this small population, the value of territory exports per capita last year was almost double that of Tasmanian exports. Let me repeat that: the territory has a population of less than half of Tasmania's, but
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          exports almost twice as much as Tasmania on a per capita basis.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The ignorance shown by the member for Kalgoorlie reminds me of the exploits of the former Labor member for the Northern Territory Warren Snowdon who would try to imply that the territory was a burden on the national economy. As we are all aware now, this is untrue. Perhaps the most offensive statement made by the member for Kalgoorlie yesterday was when he said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . what we ought to do with the Northern Territory is get realistic and whack it up amongst the surrounding states. That is the best solution for the Northern Territory. It would solve quite a few problems and, believe me, it would be much more economical.
        </para>
        <para>
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         That is an appalling statement made by a member of this House. I could forgive his comments if they were ignorant, but I am quite sure that they were not. Of course, we are aware that the member for Kalgoorlie is trying to set up a party called Australia First. I hope that he does run candidates in the Northern Territory, because with thoughts like that his party will not get one vote. It reminds me of comments made by a former Prime Minister of this country when he said that the best way to see Darwin is from 35,000 feet up in the air, flying to Paris, sipping champagne. And look where he is today.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I am very disappointed that the member for Kalgoorlie chose to denigrate the Northern Territory in the federal parliament. When he does get around to seeing the territory—I do not think he has been there for a while—I am quite sure that he will be very impressed with the productivity and the energy that territorians have in promoting Australia by way of tourism. I am not sure of this fact, but I think the Northern Territory gets more international tourists than Western Australia does. I understand the Western Australian government is now trying to promote Western Australia. We have been promoting the Northern Territory for a number of years, and our runs are on the board. The federal member for Kalgoorlie should come and have a look at what we are doing in the Northern Territory. Our mining industry is on the increase; our cattle industry is on the increase.

          —During the winter break my office sent out to hundreds of our pensioners and veterans their updated information kits. These kits are well received and in fact are anxiously awaited. They are able to inform our veterans and pensioners of their rights and also of their current entitlements. Many of these pensioners and veterans phone my office to express their appreciation after receiving their kits. This recent dispatch of kits was no exception. My office received many calls from our elderly citizens, but this year they had a sting in the tail—not for me or the opposition but for the Howard government.

         These important members of our community are extremely annoyed with the Howard government. Their major concern, of course, is the cost of pharmaceuticals and various cuts in benefits. These important citizens have given their very all to our community of Australia over the years. They have worked hard and have paid millions of dollars in taxes to the government. They have no negative geared or used family trusts, nor have they been paid a stipend by their company. They have in fact been the battling backbone of our nation, and they really believed John Howard when he seemed to be reaching out to them prior to the 1996 election.

         What a disaster it has all been for them. They find to their horror that their regular and often weekly visits to the chemist for their pharmaceutical needs are fraught with financial danger. They now seek advice not about the value of the treatment they need but as to which of several treatments they should get due to the cost increases. This means that they are not taking all of their prescribed treatments, only those that they can afford in a particular week.

         The phone calls and letters to my office are extremely critical, with people saying such thing as: `We think that such cuts to benefits on those pensioners who are ill and/or infirm and most in need of such care are disgraceful and contemptuous actions of economising by the government.' The ignoring of these
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          comments by the government will be done so at its own peril. I guess that, in my electorate of Greenway, when the election comes it will mean that my margin will grow substantially. However, for the government, despite its current enormous majority now, reactions of people such as the elderly and veterans will see these margins dramatically reduce, and in fact many seats will return to the Labor Party.

         It is indeed breathtaking to see the extent to which the Howard government has lost faith with the voters of this nation.

          —I wish to place on the public record my utmost concern, dismay and anger at the proposed closure of the Wynnum Medicare office. This office is part of our government's rationalisation process, as the number of daily account claims is only 147, not the 400 required as the minimum number. The fact that 38 of the 43 medical practitioners in the area bulk&amp;hyphen;bill was evidence also given by HIC as the reason for this regional closure. I am aware that the savings made by the closure will offset the regional and rural facilities, but the extenuating circumstances of Wynnum should be taken into account. Wynnum is a special case.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I call on the HIC to reconsider this closure, as the impact affects many of the elderly who have limited mobility. In the interests of supporting local employment and keeping valuable funds in the local area, I call on the HIC to reconsider the closure of the Wynnum Medicare office. Wynnum is an outpost. It is not a through suburb. Although public transport is available, it takes a bus change to get to Carindale, and to get to Capalaba is just not worth contemplating.

         If the closure is not able to be prevented, as the first option it has been suggested that a chemist claims facility be set up. The suggestion has been well received by some chemists. There would, however, be no cash refunds. A drop box for the Chamber of Commerce to service has also been suggested. However, again there would be a delay in receipt of the

          That is something that I have a lot of empathy with. A lot of constituents in my electorate have been working 12&amp;hyphen;hour days, seven days a week in their own businesses and do not qualify for any welfare payments. They are actually paying tax and meeting their responsibilities in the social contract and have little to hope for in the current state of things. I wish to reassure them that this government has this in the forefront of its mind and also has a vision for how they will prosper.

          There are a number of issues that have been raised here. Firstly, what is the future of retail trading? I believe that the future is in the plazas. It is where I, as a young female,  and possibly as a mother and certainly as an elderly female, would seek to shop. It is safe. It is secure. It is indoors. I have everything I need in the one plaza. It has some key shopping attractions, such as the large chains like Target or Grace Bros. I am assured that my car will be there; there is security. There are eating places and pleasant places to sit down while you are shopping. There is freedom from any hooliganism. It is the shopping of the future.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          With the massive investment required to establish that style of shopping that we as consumers all desire and demand as our living standards—especially someone as busy as I am, who enjoys shopping on a Sunday—and the investment required to go with that style of
          <break page="7908" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           shopping into the future, we need to guarantee the livelihood of those who are remaining in the actual shops in those centres. It is not like strip shopping, where, if the landlord becomes unreasonable, you can move your premises across the street and, with the same name and phone number, still be in business. It does not have the same landlord competitiveness and competition, which is what our government is all about.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We believe very strongly in strong competition. Small business is not afraid of strong competition and it is not asking to be protected from a tough trading environment. It simply wants a chance to survive. The committee's recommendations would give small business that opportunity. Really, you have to look at this in a holistic fashion. It is not a matter of just tweaking the edges; it is a matter of looking at where consumer spending is going in the future and how to address that vision for Australia.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In particular, the committee is recommending that a uniform retail tenancy code be underpinned in the Trade Practices Act; that specific franchising legislation be enacted by the Commonwealth; and that part 4A of the Trade Practices Act be strengthened to outlaw unfair conduct. That has a number of implications, not just in the plazas of the future but certainly in franchising legislation.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          A number of petrol stations and petrol station operators in my area have complained to me about the invidious position that they have found themselves in with regard to someone who has a strong grip on their industry. All they are asking for is the ability to compete, for there to be strong competition and for them to be able to get ahead on their initiative.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Fuel stations are the classic example. If you work very hard in your fuel station it is unlikely that you are going to earn any more than if you were a manager of one installed by one of the major petroleum outlets. Where does that leave the consumer and what is the competition for that? Do we then look at the competition in the future coming from Woolworths and being between Woolworths, BP and Shell? It is a matter of addressing those issues and the franchising issues and of seeing where we want competition in Australia and where it is coming from. With unemployment being the major issue in my electorate, I see it as addressing jobs.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Currently, in petrol stations right across my electorate, they are working seven&amp;hyphen;day&amp;hyphen;a&amp;hyphen;week jobs for incredibly long hours that take them away from their families. They would be more than happy, if the profit margins allowed, to employ other people on a part&amp;hyphen;time or even a full&amp;hyphen;time basis. Their standard of living would go up, the incentive for working so hard would be increased and competition would become quite fierce.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Employment is the major reason. If we can see an area in which we can secure employment, then that is probably the option we should be taking. Certainly, into the future, as things unravel and employment stabilises at a socially acceptable level, then we can look at various restructuring. You always have to look at things in a holistic sense. For example, as in the tariff debate, where it is no good lowering tariffs in isolation, if you are looking at it in a holistic sense in terms of other on&amp;hyphen;costs coming down as well, then you can tweak business here, you can tweak business there and you can make a holistic environment where small business can compete in a very strong competitive environment, they can succeed, and initiative and hard work are rewarded.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          That is the essence of the people from my electorate, not only in the petroleum service stations and the distributors, but in retail businesses in the large plazas and also in information technology. The business innovation fund has been a major step forward in that. It certainly
          <break page="7909" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           is looking like it is going to shape up to be one of the major employers in the future. Certainly in my area there has been a rapid purchase of the latest technology games and gadgets that this era has given us.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is important to look at three specific issues. One is security of tenure. A person who takes out a lease, or even when they are trying to get a mortgage for a house, needs to know that his business, if it is successful and thriving, is secure in those premises and that he will not have to move again and re&amp;hyphen;outfit another premises in the short term. That is a right to renewal of leases.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Another issue concerns disclosure statements. They are vital. If you are going to install a petrol station operator on one side of the road and you are aware of another petrol station or an independent operator going in on the other side of the road, then that information should be made available to your franchisee.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Again, franchisees want some independence to make money on their own initiative. It is a two&amp;hyphen;way street, obviously, because major franchisees who work in a self&amp;hyphen;regulated environment, such as McDonald's, have a high standard and require a number of protections of their own in order to reach that standard. People who have a good opportunity and good ideas for franchise should be able to make money on those and not have a black box attached to their till through which major landlords, or major franchisors, can measure their gross turnover and take a percentage of takings. It certainly needs to be underpinned.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The other issue was access to justice and education. This access is going to become available with things like the Internet. If we get all businesses on the Internet, we can regularly have management and business education courses to develop the skills, knowledge and ability of our small business people to take Australia into the next century.

          We have got a number of incentives that we can provide for small business. Some of the businesses in my area have, in fact, taken to employing people with disabilities. We get a holistic management of society where people who are on disability support pensions are now taxpayers. They come to me quite frequently complaining of how much tax they are paying and their ability to get ahead. In fact, we have with us today the members from my electorate who are nominated in the Prime Minister's award for the best employer of the year and that should be announced at 11.30 a.m. today by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard).

The particular aspect that I want to focus on relates to franchisees in the petrol retail area. I put forward for the consideration of the House the correspondence sent at the end of July from
           <break page="7910" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            the Shell National Action Group to the honourable Prime Minister (Mr Howard). This correspondence comes from Grahame Henderson, the National Chairman of the Shell National Action Group. He says:

          It is my melancholy duty to confirm to you that Shell has effectively declared war on its remaining single site franchisees by drastically altering their occupancy costs to the extent that many will be insolvent by the end of the year. These latest actions are directly opposed to Shell's written and verbally recorded assurances given to franchisees, politicians, federal and state governments and recent inquiries. These assurances related to our ability to remain for the balance of our terms, without pressure from Shell, even though their previous promises and commitments to renew our terms had been broken.

          We are aware, and Shell have confirmed, that they intend to imminently close a portion of their retail network and the balance of the remaining businesses currently being operated by single site franchisees are immediately required to amalgamate into their company&amp;hyphen;owned networks after the demise of the franchisees.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          Shell's dilemma in achieving this outcome has been the existence of contractual arrangements which are in place for up to six years with their remaining single site franchisees who have not accepted the meagre offers to exit. Shell's offers have been declining rather than meeting a fair market price.

          In his letter of 18 July to the Treasurer, the honourable Peter Costello, Shell's chairman, Dr Roland Williams states:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          The repeal of the franchise act would in no way diminish the existing contractual rights of franchisees which are embodied in their current long-term contracts.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          Yet, in their latest movement of the goalposts, Shell's letter of 7 July to franchisees has increased occupancy costs in the range of $1,000 to $5,000 per month for most franchisees and less than 20 days notice of this catastrophic restructure was given. Franchisees are unable to restructure mortgages and leasing arrangements, divest of personal assets or rearrange their children in education facilities at such short notice. Mr Henderson further says:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          If these unconscionable, and we believe illegal, acts are left unchallenged, Shell will effectively achieve their stated aim of taking complete control of their metropolitan retail network by the end of 1997, regardless of the contractual arrangements which are in place with their existing franchisees and previous written commitments given and received in good faith.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          This will be achieved at a profit rather than a cost to Shell when they walk in and pick up the remains of the retail businesses, after our members have been squeezed out by further economic duress, instead of receiving a fair market price to exit, or instead of continuing in the contractual franchise environment, including renewal of terms and enjoyment of the security and reward levels which they purchased at the commencement of their franchise. More insidiously, this will be at the cost of the financial and social demise of their previously necessary and dedicated franchisees, staff and families.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Shell's Dr Williams' remark and others in that correspondence of 18 July can now be seen in their true disingenuous form when Shell has once again breached their franchise agreements and the Trade Practices Act and have practised blatant discrimination. Shell and the other oil majors' passionate fervour to repeal the petroleum acts is now surfacing in its true colours. It has become abundantly clear that removal at any cost of their single site franchisees is a major portion of their hidden agenda. Prudent industry analysts will no longer be fooled by the Australian Institute of Petroleum's propaganda relating to restructure of this industry and repeal of the petroleum acts.

           Motor Traders Association and their affiliated bodies are attempting to assist his members with these serious and catastrophic actions by Shell. He further points out that Professor Fels will not be able to act in time to save these imminent insolvencies and that the removal of franchisees from their businesses drastically increases the concentration of retail marketing power in the hands of an overseas owned and controlled oil company which is not in the long&amp;hyphen;term interests of competition for the motoring public.

          Sadly, according to Mr Henderson, Shell have been allowing their members to enter into insolvency before these new draconian measures have been introduced.

          . . . we implore you to convince the Shell company of Australia that their latest unconscionable actions against their contracted franchisees are simply not the way we do business in Australia. They are not just, not right, nor fair to all concerned. Franchisees should be either offered a fair and reasonable price for their businesses, or they should be allowed to remain in compliance with the original contractual arrangements under which Shell and the franchisees entered when they purchased the franchise in the first place. Our hopes and prayers for survival and an equitable solution now rest with your government.

          That correspondence occurred back in July; we are now in September. We have a government, which claims to support small business, doing nothing while this disaster unfolds. They have had three months to respond to the fair trading report. That is the appropriate time to respond to reports of parliamentary committees. The three months is up. They have done nothing.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Not only is this situation outlined by Grahame Henderson bad for franchisees, it is also bad for the motoring public. We have had a situation just in the last couple of weeks where Shell has reduced its price support arrangements for franchisees in its desire to drive them out of business. Until recently, Shell franchisees have been receiving price support, so they can maintain a dealer margin of 3c per litre, even when they are discounting. Shell is now introducing an arrangement where the level of price support will be reduced if the franchisee discounts more than 3c per litre below Shell's wholesale price. For example, a Shell dealer who discounts 4c per litre below the wholesale price will only get a margin of 2.5c a litre, and one who discounts 5c below the wholesale price will only get a margin of 2c per litre. Certainly in Melbourne, this will just about kill off Shell petrol below 70c per litre. The service station retailers cannot afford to sell petrol for less than a 3c margin because they have to pay rent to Shell, they have to pay their staff, they have to meet all their other costs from this amount. This is simply the latest move by Shell in its campaign to get rid of its existing service station retail network in favour of multi&amp;hyphen;site franchisees whom it can control.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The next step is to occur on 1 October, when profit support arrangements will be reduced. That, in turn, will send a number of franchisees to the wall. Shell's actions, taken with
          <break page="7912" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           complete disregard for the welfare of both their franchisees and the motoring public, underscore the need to implement the fair trading report presently before the House. The Howard Liberal government must strengthen the protections for franchisees, so that Shell and other oil companies cannot put them out of business by stealth in the way that they are presently aiming to do.

          I have to say that the government's response and body language in relation to this report are far from reassuring. Indeed, I have heard reports from the National Federation of Independent Businesses that they visited the new Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) and that they were very discouraged by his response. He referred to this report as containing isolated incidents, as being over&amp;hyphen;emotional, as having to be examined from a legal perspective. He said he would have great difficulty implementing its recommendations. I further hear that the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business has refused to make himself available for a very important rally on 17 September in Melbourne at the Camberwell Civic Centre organised by the United Retailers Association.

This rally is being organised by the United Retailers Association, the premier body representing retail tenants in this country, a body which is most concerned to secure the implementation of this report. This might be Minister Reith's view from his 17th floor penthouse, but it is not the view that people who are on the ground, in small business, in retail tenancies are seeing. I have got to commend the statements made by a lot of government members, both those who were involved in this committee inquiry and also those who have been speaking in this debate. But the crunch question is: is the government going to implement this report? That is the thing that we need to get from the government, and we need it now—the three months has passed.

          We heard from the Property Council of Australia during the parliamentary recess. They produced a report from Access Economics which purported to attack the recommendations in the House of Representatives committee report. They said, `Well, we can't have a situation where there are, at once, both too much supply and also retail tenants being ripped off.' What this market theory that they advanced fails to take into account is the issue of plain, outright lying—all the misrepresentation to retail tenants that goes on before they enter these businesses in shopping centres and get trapped and locked into these arrangements.

A woman by the name of Olga Pappas set up a deli in Sydney Road, Coburg, right outside Coles. She was told by her landlord, prior to signing the lease—the landlord is also Coles's landlord—that Coles would not set up a cafeteria in competition with her.

          I was fortunate enough to attend a meeting in Brisbane a couple of weeks ago with some 350 small business people which was held particularly to address this issue. The member for Wills tried to engage in some cheap political opportunism today by saying that we had a situation where the retailers in Victoria had invited the minister to attend a rally. No government member is running away from this report or running away from the issues here. I remind him that this report was supported by all parties unanimously. The fact is that what it contains can do a hell of a lot to address some of the very important structural problems within business today.

          At the meeting that I attended in Brisbane, it was obvious that feelings run very deep. People are very concerned about their livelihoods. I think that comes down to the fact that we now

           have, in parts of Australia, some 85 per cent of the retail trade going to the two major players. That is not a healthy situation. That is not the case right across Australia, I realise, but it certainly is in some quarters.

            That causes a problem not just to the retailers. It goes right across the sector. It goes down to manufacturers, who are then forced to deal with one or two major players, and to producers, whether of small crops and the like or something else, because of the buying power of these large corporations. This problem is bigger than just retailers.

           Looking through the main recommendations, we see that the committee has first recommended the drafting of a uniform retail tenancy code by the ACCC in conjunction and cooperation with industry participants. This code would then be submitted to the Council of Australian Governments with a view to the adoption of a uniform retail tenancy legislation around Australia. Underpinning this code in the Trade Practices Act is an essential element of protecting and stimulating small business in Australia. A uniform national code with legislative protection, dispute resolution and, above all, security of tenure will be essential if the government is to restart an economy which will boost employment in Australia.

This sounds sensible, and I flag a warning by way of example from my electorate.

             —I will conclude by talking about a problem of fair trading. I am sure the honourable members from South Australia would agree thoroughly with me that it should provide protection for customers. Without it, unscrupulous traders may seriously damage the reputation of the industry sector in the eyes of the public and hurt even the most scrupulous of small business traders. An example can be seen by looking at the operators of two WA computer companies, Computer Warehouse and Jericho Computers—the latter is also in my electorate. This company is now in liquidation, with substantial debts to its creditors and a record of deceptive and improper dealings with customers.

            on 21 May this year as having been described by the WA government's Ministry of Fair Trading as WA's worst retailer. The ministry alleged that the two companies had breached the Fair Trading Act by attempting to mislead customers into believing contracts existed to buy computers when people had simply made inquiries about them, or sought quotes. The companies then billed the people between $2,900 and $6,000 for computers. In some cases, invoices or a letter of demand came months after people had sought a quote. People were led to believe that if they did not buy, they would be sued.

We have an instance there where people connected with the Liberal Party of WA have behaved outrageously. I make no reflection on the Liberal Party elsewhere. This is a peculiar problem in WA, as you would probably all know, and Mr Dale is a particularly unpleasant character.

           There is undoubtedly a major imbalance in the power relationship between the small retailer—who has often placed the family home on the line by mortgaging it, borrowing excessive sums of money and going into the retail business—and the major conglomerates who become their suppliers, competitors and landlords.

           The negotiations that take place to secure an agreement might be compared to the negotiations that David would be forced to undergo with Goliath if he did not have a slingshot to achieve the victory.

Perhaps the government's response to the report should simply be to issue slingshots to small retailers. But killing off the big guys is not the answer of course at any time. We simply need a more equitable playing field and we need to restore the balance.

            —Before the division I was saying that it is a similar spirit which, in the latter part of the 20th century, inspires people to throw themselves into their own businesses. It is most timely that this report has been produced when the federal government is seeking to address what has become, over the past 15 years or so, one of Australia's major diseases, unemployment. Small retailers not only provide goods and services to customers; they are also intensive employers.

           The Australian Bureau of Statistics provides information on the number of people employed per $1 million of turnover. An examination of the categories where small retailers tend to dominate the market, such as bakeries, shows that in 1991-92 there were 25.6 people employed per $1 million of turnover. In hairdressing and beauty salons there were 39.8 people employed. Pity help the hairdressers and Australia's unemployment rate if someone invents an automated hair cutting, colouring and perming technology! Comparing these figures with categories where large retailers tend to dominate the market, such as supermarkets, the figures show that only 6.9 people are employed per $1 million of turnover.

            Whilst these figures may be open to some interpretation, they do suggest strongly that employment is more intensive in the smaller retailing sector and that, for every $1 turnover transferred to the large retailing sector, jobs are lost. This is something that must be foremost in our minds as we respond to the fair trading inquiry report.

            What should we do to protect the smaller retailer to ensure that they get a fair go, that there is some equity in the power relationship between them and the owner of the premises they need to rent and their multinational competitor? One of the problem areas for small retailers is in the negotiations with landlords. The major conglomerates pour vast investment dollars into their centres, and they do not do it in order to receive a minimal return.

            Whilst these large centres provide customers with a great diversity of choice and the comfort of weatherproof shopping, little thought is given to what the customers are missing out on due to the vast social changes that have occurred in changes to retail shopping. The large centres have wiped out many of the smaller shopping centres and shopping strips.

            In my electorate, the small retailers outside the large centres have struggled to compete. The small retailers in the large centres have also struggled against the power of the large corporations who own the centres and occupy much of the larger areas of retail space within the shopping centres.

            There are many factors contributing to the problems facing Australians today, and changes to retailing can obviously not be blamed in isolation. But it is interesting to reflect on the loss of the role of the corner shop and its proprietor from neighbourhoods, and the consequent loss of contact with proprietors and neighbours. Undoubtedly, large regional centres have affected change in social patterns and have contributed to the isolation suffered by many people in contemporary Australia.
           </para>

            Small retailers not only provide goods, services and employment; in a small way they help fill the void left by the change in retail and other social and economic patterns.

He has such a good relationship with so many of his isolated customers—elderly people who could not walk the two kilometres up to the new post office—it helped me convince Australia Post of their plight, and we got extra postal services at his newsagency.

            The committee's report identified four areas where small businesses were vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. These are retail tenancy, franchising, the misuse of market power by large competitors and small business finance. The chapter on retail tenancy contains a number of horror stories. No&amp;hyphen;one in this place should be left with the impression that these are just a few horror stories that happened to find their way into the court. I hear similar stories from small retailers in my electorate and from other major shopping centres all around South Australia. Clearly, the states have not provided adequate protection to the small retailer.

            The committee made 12 recommendations to address the issues presented to them, which it described as plugging the gaps in retail tenancy legislation around Australia. One of the recommendations addressed the proliferation of shopping centres. There were suggestions that social and economic impact statements be lodged with development applications. This is
            <break page="7922" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
             perhaps one of the more innovative but obvious recommendations and one which I fully support.

            The report also addressed the issue of franchising. Franchising, it seems, can work anywhere between very well and very poorly. Concerns about problems in franchising resulted in the establishment of the franchising code of practice in 1993. Once again, the report recognises difficulties emanating from the inequalities in the power relationship between the little guy, the franchisee, and the big guy, the franchisor.
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            The committee made three recommendations on franchising. These were: the enactment of franchising legislation; compulsory registration of franchisors; and compliance with codes of practice. From the correspondence I have received, these are desperately needed by the franchisees. One of the other areas where the small retailers suffer at the hands of the big guys is dealt with in chapter 4 of the report, `the misuse of market power'.
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            The chapter covered issues such as price discrimination, where evidence was given to the committee showing that supermarket chains were selling products considerably cheaper than the wholesale price available to small retailers, and predatory pricing, where the large retailers undercut the small guys to eventually force them out of business. Section 46 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 is supposed to provide the protection that small retailers need against these practices, but it has been unremarkable in providing such protection. The committee has recommended amendments to the Trade Practices Act and a greater role for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to curtail the misuse of market power.

            One of my favourite liberal political philosophers, as I said in my first speech to the House, is Leonard Trelawney Hobhouse, because he was passionate about tackling inequality. Hobhouse saw an active role for government in levelling the playing field to protect the less powerful from the more powerful long before such terminology was ever used. Indeed, he saw it as the obligation of government to do so because, in a democracy, the elected government has an obligation to maximise freedom for all its citizens. At times, this requires government to limit the freedom of the more powerful in order to enhance the freedom of the less powerful. Given the beneficial contribution of small retailers to the Australian economy and social fabric, the government should do nothing less in responding to the report.

            I have great confidence that the report's recommendations will implement in a practical way the good old Australian expectation of a fair go for all, an expectation that this country was built on and an expectation that encourages Australians to give it a go. We will not survive and prosper as a nation and we will not provide jobs to Australians who want them if the little guys do not continue to give it a go. I do not think I want to live in a country where there are no more little guys. I commend the report and its recommendations to the House.

          It is incumbent on this government to respond to this particular report in a fair way, because there is an expectation out there. But it is also important not to give an expectation that the government can deliver on everything. It is very important that what we do should be there and should not suffer challenge from the High Court at some later stage. I am very supportive of the Reid report and people in Townsville and Thuringowa are also certainly very supportive of issues in relation to fair trading.

          The importance of small business to the Australian economy cannot be overestimated. This was the truth that was conveniently overlooked by the previous Labor government, which preferred to do deals with its big business mates. Since coming to office, the Howard government has initiated many reforms which will help small business to survive and, hopefully, to grow. Changes to fringe benefits tax and capital gains tax, reduction in red tape, simplification of government forms, and abolition of the job destroying unfair dismissal laws are but a few of the major achievements of this government in the area of small business policy. These measures have been welcomed by many in small business, but they also tell me, and I can see, that more needs to be done.

          When introducing the Trade Practice Amendment Bill in 1976, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, stated that `free and fair competition is a basic tenet of a free enterprise economy'. Unfortunately, the relationship between big and small business is, too often, not `free and fair'. In investigating the various issues relevant to its terms of reference, the committee received evidence which showed unfair

           practices in a number of areas—in particular, between retail tenants and their landlords and between franchisors and franchisees, as well as in the misuse of market power by large firms competing with small businesses and in the harsh conduct by banks and other financial institutions towards their small business clients.

          One of the major concerns is that, in many instances, small business is presented with a deal on a take it or leave it basis and does not have the financial resources to challenge the heavy&amp;hyphen;handedness of big business. The committee has recommended in its report that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission be more active in promoting compliance with the proposed new unfair conduct provisions to the Trade Practices Act 1974.

They feel that they are left in a helpless situation, particularly when they may be trying to sell their business close to the date of the expiry of their lease. Relations between many of these small business proprietors and their landlords are further exacerbated by the lack of clear information given by the landlord during lease negotiations and by the reviewing of rent during the term of lease.

          I am very pleased with the response of the committee to these problems. Its recommendation for the drafting of a uniform retail tenancy code by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in consultation with industry participants is a sound and fair response to the evidence it has acquired during its investigation of fair trade in Australia. I certainly would support the adoption of this recommendation and look forward to the drafting of such a national code.

          The committee further recommended that the uniform retail tenancy code provide for minimum lease terms of five years, with the option of lease renewal for a further five&amp;hyphen;year term.

          I recently had the pleasure of meeting Mr Richard Flashman, Executive Director of the Motor Trade Association of South Australia. He and two other representatives involved with the issue of multi&amp;hyphen;site franchising in the oil industry spoke to me about the problems associated with the operation of a service station. I am pleased to see that these concerns have also been heard by the members of the committee and that recommendations were made in this report.

          The move by Shell and Mobil to multi&amp;hyphen;site franchising has caused great difficulties for many service station operators. Multi&amp;hyphen;site franchising reduces competition by allowing the oil companies to control the price of oil in a particular area, whereas before, when the owner operators owned the oil in the tanks beneath their service station, there was the ability for the operators to set their own prices accordingly and compete with other service station operators. This is not the case in a multi&amp;hyphen;site franchise situation where the oil company owns the oil in the tanks and sets the prices.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Service station operators have little real choice other than to accept that which is offered to them by the oil companies or leave their business. They have very little bargaining power. This gives the oil companies great power over individual businesses; the cards are definitely stacked in their favour. The committee heard the concerns, such as the fact that there will be no payment of goodwill on the termination of an agreement between the oil company and the service station operator; that there is an inability on the part of the service station operator to negotiate a price at which products are supplied, with the oil companies dictating price; and that the majority of any liability has been shifted to the service station operator.

          Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware of the joint statement issued by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Moore) on 11 December 1996 in which it was suggested that the government may remove the Petroleum Retail Marketing Site Act and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act when the oil companies, the distributors and service station operators, have reached agreement on the new oil code and appropriate code of conduct.

          I would have to say that from my investigations into these issues such agreement is still a long way off.

The committee has noted the regulatory action taken in the United States in relation to this issue within that country and I express the opinion that something approaching that measure may be needed to be adopted here.

           —I would just like to take a couple of minutes to commend the committee on the work that it has done so far as reflected in the summary report into aspects of youth suicide. I have taken a particular interest in this inquiry for two reasons. Firstly, I was the first chair of this committee and I have always thought that it has chosen some pretty substantial topics, some very hard personal and social topics to deal with over time. The members of the committee who have been actively working on this particular inquiry will have come across many family situations that are both distressing and difficult to come to grips with. So I commend them for the work and the report to date.
          </para>
         </talk.start>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Secondly, I also had a particular interest because at one unfortunate time in the late 1980s in Kyneton where my office is in the electorate of Burke, the town was identified as Australia's worst location for youth suicide. At that time there were a number of unfortunate occasions when young people took their lives and, statistically, Kyneton topped the poll for a period of time.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          That led to a significant amount of money being spent on some research into that area by both the former federal Labor government and the Victorian state government at the time. But, I have to say that I do not think it took us very far because many of the questions are so difficult to answer. Then, as other areas suddenly became listed at the top of the poll, of course the attention moved elsewhere.

          The first recommendations of the committee should be carried through, and I would urge the government and the minister to adopt those findings.

         <para first-indent="16">
          At the first seminar, I was pleased at the extent of interest of federal MPs—at the number who attended and the presentations. I was quite taken by Professor Baume's presentation, which is in the report. One of his points was that the drug problem that we talk so much about in our community concerns illicit drugs, but that the drug problem at the heart of the youth suicide problem was primarily alcohol and some other forms of legally prescribed drugs.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          That gave the committee a fairly sombre note to work on. There is a popular notion that young people get themselves into trouble, for whatever reason, with illicit drugs, but the dominant drug that is prevalent in the medical research that analyses drug deaths is alcohol,
          <break page="7927" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           and that is a legally available drug. So society's defence against this has to be tempered by this knowledge and by understanding the best way to go about dealing with it.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I particularly draw attention to recommendation No. 3, which is rated priority 3. I think it deserves a higher rating than 3. I call on the government and the minister to give priority to all of these recommendations. The third recommendation comes to the heart of this. In nearly all situations, the people who commented—family members and so on—might have noticed some depression. They might not even have been aware of any symptoms. It is very clear that a lot of us do not know what depression is, nor can we recognise it in ourselves or others. When it happens, it seems to be a fairly normal thing; we just seem to be going through a bad time.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The recommendation places great focus on putting information in areas where young people go to read and find out things, including the Internet. That recommendation gives a very clear emphasis to the fact that, whatever the circumstances, we might get depressed. If we understand what is happening and what can flow from this, maybe we can put in the defence mechanisms to help not only young people but everybody face this depression.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I recount one situation that I have experienced. A close friend of mine took his life a week or so after talking to me. We were standing outside his house and he said to me, `Neil, I've got five television sets in this house.' He said, `What sort of a family is it that needs five TV sets.' I did not recognise that he was asking me: `Where have I failed? How has this happened that my family is so uncommunicative?' I did not recognise that. Of course, he was obviously entering a severe stage of depression that led to him taking his life.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          All I can say is that it is a hugely difficult task that the committee is trying to tackle. Members of the committee will have come in contact with some very difficult and moving situations on which they are trying to make policy sense and in circumstances where often it is impossible to make sense. Despite this, I commend the members of the committee for the work they have done, and the report that they have brought forward is a firm starting base for a national response to this problem.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I had some involvement during our last term of office with the national road safety strategy and it hit me at the seminar that we had either just a few more or almost as many young people taking their lives through suicide as were being killed in car accidents. We are taking many steps in various ways to try and overcome the problem of young drivers being killed in car accidents and since youth suicides are of the same magnitude, that too warrants a national response to the issue. That is what the committee is trying to come to grips with.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I urge the government and the minister to take account of these recommendations. They are a very good platform from which to launch a response, but I would urge whoever is working with this to give particular attention to priority 3, the depression awareness campaign, and particularly to the use of the Internet. We must make people aware that this can happen to them, that this is how it happens, that here is how they respond to it and all the ancillary offshoots of that, including training and recognition.

          We are mournfully aware that we have the fourth highest suicide rate amongst our 15- to 24-year-old males in the industrialised world. In 1995, the most recent year for which data is available, one&amp;hyphen;quarter of the total deaths of young males in our target age bracket were attributed to suicide. However, as the report warns us, these deaths can be seen as just the tip of the iceberg because there are about 10 times as many hospital admissions for suicide attempts. Alarmingly, there are about 35 times the number of suicide attempts by young females. These figures have struck alarm bells across the lucky country. We are faced with the tragic reality that there are many young Australians who are so desperately unhappy that they cannot bear to continue to live in our world.

          Professor Robert Kosky, director of psychiatry at the Adelaide Women's and Children's Hospital, put the question which taxes the hearts and minds of the nation: why do our young people kill themselves? The most vexing aspect of this tragic question is that there is not one clearly identifiable cause for suicide. It was shown to be a multifactoral phenomenon and hence demands a multifaceted approach for solutions. Professor Kosky's research showed that young people move into a dangerous situation when they experience emotional depression at the same time as chronic family discord. In effect, these young people feel that they are unloved, unwanted and worthless.

          How much of this is an unfortunate by-product of our modern high&amp;hyphen;tech society and its accompanied stress is a matter of anecdote and conjecture, but there are many of us who instinctively appreciate that the thrust of modern living leaves many of us bereft of the necessary time to nurture those special relationships in our lives. It seems to me that modern society is marked by an impoverishment of time, and yet many are unaware of how this impacts upon the quality and nature of the relationships which forge the inner worlds of the hearts and minds of our children.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There are two significant aspects suggested by Professor Kosky which are instructive in that they produce in the hearts of a depressed young person a sense of isolation which appears to be the one common identifiable factor manifested in each and every victim. It is instructive to consider one of the graphs presented by Dr James Harrison, Director of the National Injuries Surveillance Unit at the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, which showed a marked decline in the previous suicide rate during World War II. While he did say that there were many complex reasons for this, there are influences within communities in times of perceived common threat which we, again, instinctively understand.

           We are aware that there is a deeper sense of community spirit, a sense of being needed, a powerful instinct to stand together in our country's darkest hour, a personal feeling of sharing in a great effort, of belonging, of having a real social purpose. One aspect of suicide then, leaving aside those cases of the mentally ill, is a deadly crisis in one's emotional life. It is the lack of any perception by a vulnerable person of any sense of feeling valued or feeling needed or feeling worthwhile. This does not necessarily mean that such a person is not loved or not needed or not worthwhile but that they do not perceive that they are. When such a perception is coupled with a problem in their lives which they are unable to solve because of poor problem solving skills, or they are unable to share because of poor communication links, they find themselves alone, isolated and hopeless, and in terrible danger.

           We all know how to create a loving and loved, well&amp;hyphen;adjusted adult human being. It takes a loving and nurturing environment which allows the infant human being to grow in self&amp;hyphen;esteem and self&amp;hyphen;confidence, secure in the knowledge of who they are and where they fit within their families and within their neighbourhood. It is the natural consequence of growing up in a loving family network. I do not assume to define a family because they are like rainbows—they come in many colours. But, within a nurturing family, a strong sense of belonging and contented happiness grows within the self of the infant from the first days of its life. Babies just do not survive without love, affection and care.

           In my electorate of Hughes one of our church groups carried out a survey on the feelings of local young people in an attempt to find out how to assist them. To the question, `Do you consider that you live in a loving, caring home environment?' an unexpected 67 per cent said, `No.' I am sure their parents would be shocked because these children come from solid, middle&amp;hyphen;class families where hardworking mums and dads are endeavouring to provide the benefits of life for their offspring, and whose love for their children is their singular reason for working so hard.

           The problem is that the children do not perceive the strength and security of this love, and this signals to me that we have some very serious problems in the way and effectiveness by which we communicate the strength of our love to our children. One leading consultant child psychiatrist told me that he believed human beings need at least four seven-second hugs a day. Hugs say a lot, especially in the uncertain world of the adolescent. Hugs actually say, wordlessly but very powerfully, `I value you.' Loving hugs are the greatest expression of emotional reinforcement and personal affirmation that we can give our children: they cost nothing but time. But teenagers are not cute and cuddly and it seems very few receive hugs.

           It is difficult to believe that there is not a connection. Suicide is a complex and deadly confluence of circumstance and negative thoughts in the life of a young person. When it is understood, as research shows, that children listen to music over 30 per cent of the waking hours, the danger of negative and destructive thoughts turning into tragic action gets closer to becoming a tragic reality. Such violent, hateful, nihilist and doom laden music is freely available for our children to hear. Added to alcohol and drug abuse, it is a deadly cocktail. It is worth observing that illicit drugs appeared in any quantity on the Australian scene in the early 1960s, as did the beginnings of violent and hateful messages of death and destruction in our children's music. It was about this time that our suicide rate began to climb tragically.

           —Other than acknowledging and recognising the importance of the aspects of youth suicide summary report as further beginning a process in this country to address the appalling statistics of youth suicide, I found the report somewhat disappointing. Let me qualify that. I am appreciative of the fact that the seminar was just one day and that for personal reasons, I was unable to be there. Be that as it may, my disappointment is that only one major point, out of at least the four that are required, was identified and that was the national inquiry. For me, it simply reinforced the view I have held for many years now that, when children are concerned, this parliament is as ignorant as most other influential groups in this country. I will provide evidence to support that perhaps unpopular and minority contention a little later in my speech.

          The summary report correctly indicated that the rates of suicide per 100,000 of population show that, since the 1960s, the rate of young male suicide has almost trebled and the rate of young female suicide has doubled. The report also indicated that, for young males between 1979 and 1995, there has been a fivefold increase in deaths from hanging. The report also acknowledged the multitude of complexities that impact upon the circumstances that lead to youth suicide. But what it did not do was explain and identify the circumstances happening in this country affecting children and adolescents in the 1960s, the 1970s and the 1980s. The report stated that, for young males in Australia between 1979 and 1995, there had been a fivefold increase in deaths arising from hanging. The question that needs to be asked is: what circumstances in this country during this period changed that may have directly or indirectly contributed to feelings of depression, isolation and so on?

          In 1979, I was a principal of a primary school in Adelaide with about 900 students. I mark this particular year very clearly because in South Australia this was the beginning of the severe decline in the value South Australian society placed on the care and education of children, particularly young children. I soon became very aware that this was not just a South Australian problem. It was an Australian problem, an English speaking world problem and, finally, a developed world problem.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There is a given, in my view, in the care and education of children, that is steadily but ever increasingly being devalued in Australia and elsewhere in the world. That given is as follows: that between the ages of seven and 11, the quality of schooling is the most significant determinant of the future success of an individual. It is more important than gender, socioeconomic status, ethnic background or religion, which compared to quality schooling have received far greater priority than they deserve.

          The London Educational Authority after a four&amp;hyphen;year longitudinal study, one of the few ever done with children in primary schools, concluded exactly this in 1986. But state governments throughout Australia have ignored that given for the past 20 years. The age group five to 15 are the forgotten people in Australian society. The allocation of resources to this group that actually goes to supporting young people on the ground has seriously deteriorated over the last 20 years.

           Some will point to increases in funding. But I tell you, precious little of that funding went to kids themselves. The year 1979 saw the beginning of a `Primary means first' campaign in South Australia to increase resource allocation to primary schools. It failed. In the early 1980s, another campaign entitled `Into the nineties' commenced and received overwhelming support from schools and parents. Similar campaigns occurred in Tasmania.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           That campaign and the individuals who drove it, a group of 12 primary principals, was white&amp;hyphen;anted and discredited by no less than the education bureaucracy and the Secondary Principals Association, who, like some powerful individuals in the teachers union, TAFE and university, saw it as a threat to their favourite resource allocation and fought it tooth and nail. However, this campaign had some success in that the bureaucracy was forced to announce a primary review. Schools, however, are still waiting 10 years on for any substantive implementation of those recommendations.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The important point I make here is that advocacy for young people five to 12 disappeared. The separate bureaucracies for early childhood and primary education were dissolved. Individual after individual at a senior level who argued for a fair go for primary aged school kids was given redundancy, retirement or simply chose another occupation. Advocacy for young people aged five to 12 was gone.

           Can anyone in this house point to a group in Australia that effectively represents the needs of children aged five to 12? There is none. That is a major problem that needs to be addressed. It requires national leadership that up to the present time has gone missing. At the national level, it requires a ministry for children and youth affairs, a point made to this parliament several years ago by the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) and myself.

           I have already stated that educational leadership went missing. Political leadership has gone missing too, but it is even more widespread than that. The churches ignored the needs of young children. They were more concerned with dwindling membership, widespread child abuse which was coming to public attention at an alarming rate and looking after their particular sectoral interests. Mainstream structural and resource problems were just overlooked.

          <para first-indent="16">
           The unions ignored the needs of young children. Like the churches, they were too preoccupied with dwindling membership, as well as union amalgamations and rightly preserving the jobs of their members. They did not see children five to 12 in their ballpark of interest. The welfare sector forgot the link between the mainstream young and the special groups of adolescents and young adults they tried to represent. The needs of the very young were just ignored. The business sector, which had seldom shown any interest in the very young, simply continued their merry blind way on to what was going on all round them.

           The women's movement made us all aware of the legitimate needs of women. It failed miserably in recognising the needs of children aged five to 12. Ethnic and indigenous leaders, to the best of my knowledge, made little or no attempt to represent the five to 12 age cohort of children. Their commitment was on other fundamental and, for them, crucial issues. The green movement forgot about the needs of young people, even though these same young people greatly assisted their propaganda. The list of non&amp;hyphen;concern goes on.

           I state this not to slam these groups, most of whom were involved, in a period of great change, in fundamental and crucial issues highly important in our time. I simply point to the reality that, in addressing fundamental issues of change, there was no time and no energy for kids.

            In the 1980s, we saw a phenomenal growth in child care, recognising the increasing need for women to enter the work force. Instead of calling it parent respite, which it is, we called it child care. Now I defy anyone in this house to say that the rationale for this was the care of children; it was not. The rationale was to allow parents the opportunity to work and there is nothing intrinsically wrong with that. It makes good economic sense. Whether it makes good social sense for children is somewhat debatable.

            But again, to take the year 1979 as a starting point, other phenomena were occurring in this country. Unemployment was beginning to become chronic and endemic, and settling around a 10 per cent figure to which orthodox economics could do and would do nothing. As unemployment became entrenched and youth unemployment soared to around 40 per cent and higher in rural and regional Australia, another phenomenon was taking place. As people were getting out of work, overtime in this country soared to 20 million hours a year. That is the equivalent of 500,000 forty&amp;hyphen;hour a week jobs, from 1978. Note the time scale. For the 150 years prior to 1979, working hours in the English&amp;hyphen;speaking world decreased and decreased, yet in 1979, for the first time, the graph for working hours goes the other way. Overtime for males increased by 80 per cent and for females there was a 100 per cent increase.
           </para>
           <para first-indent="16">
            At exactly the same time, effective resources for primary schools were being reduced. Parent opportunities to be with their children were also greatly reduced. As more and more parents placed children in child care, parents became less involved in school and community activities, tired by long working hours, depressed by job insecurity. The other group in our community, teachers, who spend as much time with children, were being demoralised by what was occurring in primary education. Children were becoming more and more isolated. The two groups they relied on so heavily, parents and teachers, became preoccupied with their own very real problems. Marriage breakdowns, drug and alcohol abuse, violence and all the other negative issues of today's society all contribute to the isolation of children.

            Let us not forget the media's role in this. A Sydney study a few years ago recognised that up to 96 per cent of the print media's depiction of our children was negative, and the—precious little—positive depiction of children is not too flash either: pretty young girls, handsome young boys, presenting mostly non&amp;hyphen;achievable roles for other young people. Cute, but of no substance whatsoever. Yet we are confronted with an ever&amp;hyphen;increasing crisis with young people in Australian society. All of us are being shown as being quite impotent in dealing with the problem. Young people do not just commit suicide. It is a culmination of years of neglect, wrong diagnosis, wrong emphasis, wrong solutions, and lack of political will and community will, that makes particular young people just end it all. The report correctly identified the dearth of data concerning young people. This is another indication of neglect and wrong emphasis.

           <para first-indent="16">
            I have addressed thus far a failure in relationships with children by parents, teachers and interest groups in Australia, including government, and also the failure of an effective advocacy group for children in the age group five to 12. I would like to continue that theme of failure to relate to young people as it impacts on the age group 15 to 19. Rightly or wrongly, we all describe each other by occupation. Young people are no different. Yet dramatic change has impacted upon the opportunities to get a job. The teenage labour market has collapsed. Technology, especially in financial institutions, has removed entry level jobs for young people. Downsizing, outsizing and outsourcing, in both the public and the private sector, have removed entry level jobs for young children, young people. It is short&amp;hyphen;sighted policy but it is reality. Young people are more adversely affected by those changes than any other group.

             When young people are in the transition from 15 to 19 years of age, three institutions have a large impact upon them—schools, training providers, in which I include universities, and employers, both private and public. Do schools have a strong relationship with training providers and business or government? Do training providers have a strong relationship with schools and business or government? Does business or government have a strong relationship with schools or training providers? We all know what the answer is. It is a resounding no.

             The three groups in the real world have no real knowledge of each other. The dialogue that does occur between these three groups is noted for its infrequency and for the predictability that each one of the institutions will denigrate the other two. That is not particularly helpful to young people. One has only to talk to young people themselves who have sent off numerous applications for jobs, only to be rejected, to know the distress that causes.

             Government, business, training providers and schools can no longer operate in isolation from each other and expect young people to survive and this country to have a positive future. Children and young people need consistency—it is a basic human need. It is my experience with children that, whether their parents relate to them strictly—spare the rod and spoil the child—whether it is by family consensus or whether it is completely laissez&amp;hyphen;faire, the child is always well adjusted when the message they receive from their parents and teachers is totally consistent and is communicated to the child. It is inconsistency and lack of communication that destroys children's modes of behaviour. It is no different if these children see the same inconsistencies coming from schools, training providers, business or government.

             The setting up of a national inquiry will assist the database so sadly and irresponsibly missing. But this tragedy of youth suicide needs much more than that. In brief, three other matters need to be addressed. One is advocacy, one is resources and one is effective communication between groups that have an impact on children and youth.
            </para>
            <para first-indent="16">
             Firstly, the advocacy issue could be begun by the setting up of a ministry of children's and youth affairs at the national level and taking seriously not just youth suicide but all the problems confronting youth and children. We have never done this in this country.
            </para>
            <para first-indent="16">
             Secondly, the resources issue could begin to be effectively addressed again by national leadership, placing much needed accountability on state governments for the negligence—and village hall mentality on many occasions—regarding children's and youth affairs, particularly the issue of resource allocations that actually find their way into the school to benefit children.

            ages of five to 12 and 15 to 19. I see this essentially as a time factor. Parents are no longer willing to spend the time with their youngsters. The opportunity for child care is readily available. But the genuine need for nurturing is still there for the children to share their ideas, for parents to be there to listen, and for children to have the opportunity to talk and to have taken seriously what their place and space is.

          I met some young people at the recent youth forum conducted in Canberra and it was interesting that these 18&amp;hyphen; and 19&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds identified the need for parenting courses as a necessity for parents to have a mature approach to raising children. This is something that I feel we need to identify. Coming out of the mouths of babes, as one of a more mature age would suggest, is the identification of the flaws in perhaps their relationships with their own parents or the flaws they can see in other people's relationships.

          This is one of the critical pieces of information that has been received relating to this report on youth suicide. The identifiable causes, or the conditions that preceded a suicide, were often the lack of time—or the lack of effort—given by parents towards recognising the child's cry for help.

          This report should shock all Australians. Suicide, particularly where it concerns our youth, is a subject many would prefer not to talk about. It is a distressing issue and one which, all too often, gets pushed aside: it is put in the too&amp;hyphen;hard basket. But we are forced to face the realities of life at this time. Youth suicide is a reality. No&amp;hyphen;one in this house could deny that the current rate of youth suicide in Australia is unacceptably high. If just one person took their own life per year, that rate would be too high.

          We live in stressful times. There appears to be more pressure on our young to succeed, both at school and in the workplace. There are also more social demands on the youth of today, and the recent concerns over heroin trials and the easy availability of drugs within our community are ringing alarm bells for each and every one of us. The problem is coming closer every day, Mr Deputy Speaker. There is probably someone within your own personal experience who has either attempted to commit—or has succeeded in committing—suicide, who has had available to them drugs or illegal substances, including alcohol and other abuse substances. There are other options for our young, but these are not highlighted as much as the negative aspects of suicide and drug abuse are.

          Governments need all the help they can. They need advice, realistic advice. They need first&amp;hyphen;hand knowledge from people who have experienced these critical times in life and survived. It is the survivors who can mentor and assist others in the crisis that they are facing at this particular time. Quite frankly, what we found was that youth did not have anywhere to go. Often the peers knew of a child's attempt, and the uncanny disappointment, frustration or depression that was the critical factor, in many cases, that led to suicide.

          The report goes some way to addressing the needs of our young. It pinpoints the major factors that influence our young and suggests ways in which this and succeeding governments should deal with the problem. I am pleased to say that there are helpful associations out there. Community groups are willing to link and network and assist in the prevention of suicide.

           The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) recently launched the Lifeline Australia youth suicide prevention project. This service, which has received $3 million in funding, will extend the range and availability of telephone counselling services to youth. Youth need to share their concerns with someone who is easily contactable. If parents, carers, family members or peers are not there, that telephone link is essential.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           There are other measures and programs being introduced, totalling $31 million over the next three years. They include $6 million to the states and territories to improve access to counselling services in rural and remote areas, because this was where the need was seen to be critical, as more youth suicides occur in rural and remote areas. There will be $3 million to provide programs for parents—and I really feel that is probably not enough. Parents are everywhere, and they need to be able to access those facilities when they are facing troubled times, depression and financial concerns. So that they do not need to turn to drug or substances to ease the pain, they need friendly advice and assistance.

          <para first-indent="16">
           There is $2 million for education and training of health professionals. Recognising the symptoms of depression is critical. If a child presents itself to a GP, which is not always the case because they are usually accompanied by a parent, they may not be willing to express their innermost feelings and the doctor may not be able to identify depression as the cause. However, other health professionals and counsellors in schools should be able to pick up those critical points where a child is suffering, and suffering in silence.

          <para first-indent="16">
           There is $1 million for research into childhood mental health and factors which lead to adolescent suicide and attempted suicide. While young adolescent males are the most successful at youth suicide, it is disturbing to find that young girls attempt suicide at a much higher rate. This cry for help needs to be identified and assistance needs to be there at that time.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           On top of that funding, there is $19 million for the national youth suicide strategy. This includes the Here for Life program initiated by the former administration. The work and activities of that program have created a very positive community support network in areas where it is established. I am aware of one that is being established and is working very well in the Logan area. The networking of community workers is coordinated through the Royal Australian Society of General Practitioners. It has made significant progress towards bridging the gap between informed and trusted GPs and local youth so they can access and communicate with them through their personal interests.

           There is the opportunity for GPs to go in and talk about current issues. Where young people might not be able to talk about it with their parents if they are not there, they have the time allocated during their school routine to talk about critical issues. They might sound silly—I remember being asked for questions when I was at school and we had to write them down so as to remain anonymous. Quite frankly, some of the answers we got from our adults, who were not GPs, trivialised or did not really listen to our concerns. But I am assured that this program is critically listening and answering the needs of those youth in that situation.

           I am hopeful that the benefits and expertise of this program can be transferred and translated into my electorate through the Redlands Youth Network. The network has built up a strong support base for many young people in need of help in the area. They have introduced a wide range of programs to assist these people. The group also runs activities, particularly during school holiday periods, to give the youth something constructive to do with their time and not

           This government will continue to support such groups. In an effort to overcome the problems confronting our youth, we will endeavour to proceed and succeed. However, it is one thing for these programs to be set up. What we as federal members need to be doing is telling our constituents and health professionals what is available. All the money in the world is no good to the 18&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old in my electorate, or in other electorates around the country, who has been cut off and isolated from society. How is he to know what programs the government has put into place? Who he can call? Where he can call?

I will be taking them up on the offer, but I can say that what I have already heard about the homeless youth in my local retail shopping centre is disturbing. Having realised this was a major concern, I have met with the Wynnum and Redlands Youth Suicide Prevention Committee and Bayside Adolescent Boarding Incorporated. These groups, along with the Redlands Health Service Centre and the referral and assessment program, or RAP, are working towards achieving positive solutions for youth in my electorate of Bowman.

          The benefit for me in coming back into the debate at this point of time is the time that I have had since the issuing of that report to hold discussions, both formally and informally, with a range of people throughout my community on the subject of youth suicide. That is not to say that that had not been spoken of before, but the report has really jolted a lot of people into concentrating on it more and thinking more deeply about what we should, in fact, be trying to do to address this problem.

          As a member of this committee, I took advantage of getting in excess of 100 copies of that report and I sent copies to a very broad range of people within my electorate.

           There is absolutely no doubt that youth suicide is a serious concern for all of us, not only as parliamentarians, as members of particular political parties, but also as members of our community. Our community, holistically, collectively, has to start to address this problem as seriously as possible.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           However, we have got to keep the issue in perspective and face up to it with a certain degree of reality. We have also got to admit that it is not unique to this country. In fact, only last weekend or so I read in one of the weekend newspapers a very large article about the very issue we are talking of. It was a newspaper from Bangkok—the main daily major up there—that a friend had given me to read over the weekend. The very subject of youth suicide was being talked about there, and there was a very large article in the paper about how their society is coming to grips with it and what sorts of things they are starting to consider to address the issue.

          <para first-indent="16">
           So when we are talking about youth suicide, we need not necessarily get carried away with the Australianism of it, but focus on the problem itself. It certainly knows no borders in terms of ethnic or social bordering and it crosses over a range of people within our community.

          <para first-indent="16">
           There is no doubt that the suggestions coming forth in the committee's paper are important and I, along with probably every member of the House, am sincerely looking forward to government action on them. However, I believe that we also need to start looking further into the question of suicide amongst our young and start asking some of the more difficult questions. I think that these relate to the sorts of pressures that are faced by young people today in our society. Have we, as a community, actually thought about how we value our young people? Do we value them enough? Do we value them fairly? Do we put blame on them for difficulties that they may be facing today which are not necessarily of their making at all but are of the making of our generation and generations before us? I am using the word `blame' in a fairly light fashion. I am not saying that we stand there and throw it at them, but are we inferring it in some of our actions?

          <para first-indent="16">
           We are facing the severe and heartbreaking problem as a nation of unemployment. This issue is not being dealt with by our nation collectively. I believe it is the country's biggest issue, and one of the most difficult to solve. Should we be blaming our young people if they cannot find employment? Is that what we are doing? I am being very bipartisan in these comments. In some of our actions as a government, as parliamentarians, as business people, as leaders within our community, are we really imputing blame to our young people that is not theirs? Are we considering the impact of those decisions?

          <para first-indent="16">
           The pace of change in today's world is already frightening enough to many of us along the road of life. From our point of view, some of our polling in past years has indicated a particular fear, a hesitation or a lack of understanding in the community of the pace of life and the pace of change. A lot of people, both young and old, have difficulty in dealing with that and in keeping up with it.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           To sound a bit prophetic, when a young person starts out on that road of life, how do we know how these people feel about actually jumping on to that spinning disc of life? Are we actually giving them enough credit to understand the difficulties that they are facing in sorting out their lives in front of them? The age when youth suicide unfortunately occurs is when these decisions have to be faced by these very young people.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           How on earth can we support them at that time in their lives, given the pace of that spin? Is it their fault that they have trouble in working out where they fit? I sometimes sit and
           <break page="7939" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            wonder how difficult it must be. How often have we all said, `I wouldn't be young again for all the tea in China, given the difficulties in our world today.' When we talk about youth suicide, we really need to have this broad view about it: what is it and why is it?

          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           As a society, another issue that concerns me is our speed to judge. Only a few short years ago—probably in the last three to four years—within my own community, we had an unfortunate period when people were quick to judge groups of young people congregating in the community. There was almost hysteria in the local press at the time so that, if you were not a young person and you saw a group of them in the street, you actually walked around them and avoided them. They were to be feared because they were congregating, loitering—all of these new modern words. Yet what did we do when we were their age? We congregated and we loitered, for want of better terms. I can remember doing it many times on train stations.

          <para first-indent="16">
           In today's age of technical advancement, young people spend a lot of time on their own, or with a very small number of people, in front of computer screens or video games and other technology. When on earth are they going to learn to socialise? We have to promote that; we should not condemn them. As a society, we need to sit back and ask whether we are correct in judging in the way that we sometimes do.

          <para first-indent="16">
           It is very important to allocate dollars to the question of youth suicide. But as important as that is: what role do those other factors play? Are we giving due credit to considering those other things? Are we sufficiently addressing mental illness amongst the young? I do not believe that we are. In fact, if I hear one more time any government of any colour say, `We can't afford to do that', I will despair. There are certain things that we simply must afford to do. We cannot let our young people down, nor any part of our community for that matter, when we talk about `need of home'. Homelessness cannot be addressed without spending money. Mental illness cannot be cured, assisted or supported without spending money. This is an undoubtable fact.

          <para first-indent="16">
           While we create buckets of goodwill in terms of money towards youth suicide—which I do not for one moment denigrate—that on its own is not going to achieve a thing, if at the same time we have mentally ill, homeless young people roaming the streets with no support and no hope for their future. Without this holistic approach, we are really cheating our young people and putting ourselves under a delusion.

           Youth suicide knows no boundary, social or economic. You can have a youth successfully suicide from one of what we would judge to be the best or the worst of families, depending on how you make that judgment. You can have youths successfully suicide whether they go to church every weekend or whether they do not. You can have youths successfully suicide whether or not they have been in the child-care system or whether or not they have had a parent home at 5 o'clock every day. We have to get away from the categorisation of blame. We have to look at all of the underlying reasons why pressures upon our young people are driving them to this terrible choice.

           One of the things that frustrated me as a member of this committee, and I have said this before and I will say it again, is that whilst there is a lot of data around, it is not comprehensive. It is not good enough to tell me, as a parliamentarian and a decision maker, hopefully, that young men in rural areas succeed in suicide more than others—without telling me why, and we do not know why. Nobody has told me whether the young men in rural areas committing suicide are doing it because their parents' farm has been repossessed, or because they are homosexual and terrified to tell anybody, or because their girlfriend has walked out
           <break page="7940" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            on them. All we know is, and I am being terribly general here, that young rural men suicide successfully more often.

          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The other thing that we need to consider carefully is the fact that 60 per cent of those who succeed in suicide have attempted it before. If we know that, why are we letting that 60 per cent group do it successfully the second, third, fourth or fifth time? What is wrong with the counselling service? What is wrong with the follow up? What is wrong with the collation of data around that individual?

           Just after this report was tabled I had a lady from my electorate come to see me. This is a family with a lot of socioeconomic problems, a lot of pressures on the single parent. She had had two daughters. The elder daughter succeeded in suicide a few short years ago. The younger daughter, a month or two before the mother came to see me, had also attempted suicide, but had not succeeded. A mad, frantic phone call to the authorities had someone visit her that day to intervene immediately, but the follow-up counselling was 3&amp;half; weeks later. That is just not good enough.

           In a lot of cases, in 3&amp;half; weeks time a young person may not remember why they did it. Who knows the understandings of a confused young mind? I am not being critical of government when I say that. We have to demand that resources be put where they are required, and I do not think it is good enough for a family in that situation to be forced to wait that period of time. There should be an automatic scooping up of that family, and they should understand immediately that whatever support is required around them is there.

           Another reaction that has come to me from my community has been the need to demystify youth suicide because in some ways we are too scared to talk about it. If we talk about it too much we might put it up as a pretty good option. The people who have been talking to me—parents, members of the clergy, young people—have all said we need to get down to tintacks here. If youth depression is a problem then we need to understand how to recognise it and how to deal with it.

           As a result of those discussions, I am organising a forum on Friday of next week and Professor Kosky, who was one of the experts who came to our committee, has agreed to come over from Adelaide for this two-hour seminar.

           The reason why I am doing this is because the community demands that I give them an opportunity to hear a clinician, in very non-clinician terms, say what it is we are talking about when we talk about youth suicide.

           The reason for this is that I think these people need to be able to sit down at that level, hear the expert, discuss it with him, and amongst themselves, and go out, I believe, better armed, better informed and more confident in understanding what they are dealing with. This forum is only a very small thing that I can do. The bottom line for me in this whole subject is the consistency we require in approaching the subject. The Here for Life program did a lot of good. The current government's program is going to do a lot of good. But while young people remain homeless, suffering mental illness, unemployed, lacking direction in their future, lacking

        This measure was implemented by amendments to the Austudy Regulations. "Grandfathering" provisions were put in place so that students who received Austudy at the independent rate in 1996 because they were over 22 years of age could continue to receive Austudy at the independent rate.

        Some students were on the independent rate of Austudy in 1995 because of their age but, because their course required them to undertake a "work experience year" in 1996 rather than full time study, were not eligible for Austudy in 1996 and so were not covered by the grandfathering provisions.

        That is, they can be assessed as independent students free of parental means testing. Amendments to the Austudy Regulations to give effect to this change will be prepared as soon as possible.
