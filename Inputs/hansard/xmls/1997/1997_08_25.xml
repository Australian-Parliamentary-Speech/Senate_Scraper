           —Section 44 of the Australian constitution is known to all members of both this House and the other place. We
           <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
            may not know it in all its intricacies of meaning, but we do know to be aware of this troublesome section. I suspect that many members on both sides had some sympathy for Philip Cleary when the High Court, acting as the Court of Disputed Returns, found he was disqualified because he had an office of profit under the Crown, which is prohibited by subsection 44(iv). The office in question was that of a Victorian state secondary school teacher, although Mr Cleary had been on leave without pay for many months prior to standing for election to parliament.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The purpose of section 44 is to protect Australia's parliamentary system by disqualifying candidates and members of parliament who are at risk of allowing conflicts of loyalty to affect their performance as members. All members of the committee wholeheartedly support the purpose of the section. The risks have not become less immediate. We are convinced that, in a rapidly changing world, the importance of protecting the integrity of the parliament has become more rather than less urgent. However, the archaic language in which the section is expressed is a serious hindrance to ensuring that it will continue to protect this parliament and hence national sovereignty.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The committee's task was to report on the operation of two subsections—subsections (i) and (iv). Subsection 44(i) provides for the
          <break page="6666" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           disqualification of persons with a foreign citizenship or with various other attachments to a foreign power. Subsection 44(iv) disqualifies those who hold any office of profit under the Crown or any pension payable during the pleasure of the Crown.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams) also asked the committee to consider the exception to subsection 44(iv), which is set out in the last paragraph of section 44. This excludes certain classes of office holders, including ministers of state, from the disqualification in subsection 44(iv).
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The committee was asked to report on action, including constitutional amendment, legislative or executive action, to address any identified problems relating to the operation of subsections 44(i) and (iv). The wording of the terms of reference recognises that, given the difficulties of ensuring a favourable outcome at a referendum, all other avenues for alleviating the problems inherent in the two subsections should be explored. The committee is well aware of the difficulty of achieving constitutional change, even where one might expect bipartisan support for the proposal in a referendum bill.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The results of our explorations for administrative and/or legislative remedies were not encouraging. The report contains a short chapter on possible administrative approaches to some of the difficulties posed by the two subsections, but we recognise that administrative measures will not cure the essential difficulties.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The committee also considered that almost any legislative proposal to address the difficulties inherent in section 44 would run a serious risk of being found to be outside the spirit of the section by the High Court. While the committee addresses some legislative approaches, they are really complementary to constitutional amendment.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I will now move on to some of the detail of the report. We found that the most challenging aspect of the inquiry was dealing with the many difficult issues inherent in subsection 44(i). The problems include the archaic expressions used in the section, which was drafted before there was any concept of Australian citizenship. Unfortunately, we
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           found that the difficulties in subsection 44(i) cannot be solved by merely modernising the language.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          One of the problematic issues of the inquiry was the operation of subsection 44(i) in the context of a multicultural society—which Australia is today. The exclusion from federal parliament of persons who have dual or multiple citizenship caused a number of difficulties for the committee. Some members thought it morally offensive that the constitution excludes Australia's many dual citizens from full participation in the political process.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The number of people in the class of dual citizens is not known with precision but is estimated to be some five million Australians. They cover a wide range of circumstances. Many have no idea they are citizens of another country. They may have inherited a citizenship from a grandparent who they never knew came from another country. Others may have no interest in keeping a foreign citizenship, but the steps provided in the law of the relevant foreign country for renunciation of its citizenship may be difficult, protracted, uncertain or expensive.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Where no steps for renunciation are prescribed, the High Court has stated in the case of Sykes v. Cleary that candidates taking `reasonable steps' to renounce a foreign citizenship would satisfy the requirements of subsection (i). On the surface, this appears to make it easier for candidates where the foreign citizen is from a foreign country with no prescribed steps for renunciation. In fact, it may not be so simple as one might think because there is not yet any judicial opinion as to what constitutes reasonable steps. Members of the committee wrestled with this and other practical difficulties in relation to subsection (i).
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Our recommendation on subsection 44(i) is that there should be a referendum to delete the subsection and to replace it with a new provision requiring candidates to this parliament to be Australian citizens. The committee notes that this conclusion has been reached by others, including the 1988 Constitutional Commission and the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its report on the 1996 federal election. There would have to be
          <break page="6667" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           further constitutional amendments to empower parliament to enact legislation determining the grounds for disqualification of members of parliament in relation to foreign allegiance.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          On the question of whether dual citizens should be able to be candidates or members of parliament, committee members, not surprisingly, held a range of views. Some members who hold the personal view that dual citizens should be accepted as candidates and members considered that dual citizenship would, nevertheless, be considered an electoral disadvantage. While the report canvasses issues relating to dual citizenship and membership of the legislature, it does not draw any conclusion. Such a departure from the status quo should be debated, in the opinion of the committee, by members of this parliament. While the committee is convinced that only constitutional amendment can address the problems caused by subsection (i), we do make some recommendations proposing administrative actions. These are aimed at helping intending candidates to recognise some of the potential problems.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Turning briefly to subsection (iv), which deals with another type of potential conflict of interest or loyalty—office of profit under the Crown—the committee again recommends that only constitutional amendment can get to the root of the problems in this section. The committee recommends that subsection (iv) be deleted and replaced by new provisions which address uncertainties and perceived inequities in the current subsection. The key to the proposed new provisions is that there should be differing times at which various office holders should relinquish their office. The differences should reflect the political sensitivity and public profile of the particular office of profit under the Crown.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We believe there should be three categories of office holder. Because of the rapidly changing nature of public employment, the constitution should deal only with the most sensitive of the three categories of office holder—those holding offices which must be protected from political controversy at all times. The offices to be included in the remaining two categories should be determined by parliament from time to time. The
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           most stringent provisions should apply to persons holding a judicial office under the Crown in right of the Commonwealth or a state or territory. The committee considers that such persons should be required by the constitution to resign from office before nominating for election to the federal parliament.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          For other than judicial officers, the committee considers that there should be two categories of public sector employees. Members of the first group should be deemed to have vacated their offices should they nominate for election. This group should include those persons whose position is incompatible with being a candidate for the federal parliament. Such persons might include secretaries to Commonwealth departments, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Governor of the Reserve Bank. Other office holders should not be required to vacate their offices simply because they are candidates. They should be deemed to have vacated their offices upon election to the Senate or House of Representatives. Most public servants would fall into this category.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There are various other matters which have been raised in the report which I am sure will be of interest to all members. There is not time to address them all here today. Before concluding my remarks, I would like to thank the members of the committee for their contributions during the inquiry and production of the report. The best traditions of parliamentary committee work were evident during this inquiry, with members from both sides of politics working together to develop sensible solutions to problems. Our thanks also go to the committee secretariat, particularly to Kathryn Cole, the inquiry secretary, and to Judy Middlebrook, the committee secretary. I commend the report to the House.

           —The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has today tabled a report recommending that section 44 of the constitution be changed to allow dual citizens to stand for parliament. This is, of course, the provision under which the High Court disqualified Labor candidate, Bill Kardamitsis, and Liberal

          Having heard a great deal of evidence on this issue and having considered all the alternative options, we believe there is no satisfactory alternative to a referendum to change the constitution. The committee has recommended that the present subsection 44(i) be deleted, to be replaced by a requirement that all candidates and members of parliament be Australian citizens. The committee has recommended that at the same time parliament would enact legislation which would disqualify members of parliament who did not have a primary loyalty to Australia.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          While some people will take the view that this legislation should require dual citizens to take all possible steps to renounce their non-Australian citizenship, my view, and that of a number of other committee members, is that it is sufficient for the legislation to prohibit Australian MPs exercising any rights under the law of a foreign power or to advance the interests of a foreign power to the detriment of the Australian national interest.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We always talk about the way in which committees try to function in a bipartisan way, but I believe the lengths that the committee has gone to to achieve consensus on this occasion are truly extraordinary. To be candid, there is no doubt that some committee members believe that dual citizenship presents a problem for parliamentarians. Others believe, equally strongly, that it does not. But rather than getting down to majority and minority reports, which would certainly be no basis for achieving constitutional change, we have come up with a clear proposal for change—to delete subsection 44(i) and replace it with a requirement for Australian citizenship, with the problem of divided loyalties being dealt with by legislation, where we have also given the government very clear signposts.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We have also recommended that subsection 44(iv) be deleted and different provisions placed in the constitution. The basic intent of these provisions will be to allow public servants—teachers being the best known example in the light of the Cleary case—to stand for election without having to resign
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           their employment. If they are elected, their public service position is automatically declared vacant. If they are not elected, they can return to their former position. This proposal recognises that it is unfair that public servants should have to resign their positions merely to contest an election. In many cases they are not going to be successful, but that should not prevent them from standing.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Secondly, it observes that in some jurisdictions, such as Victoria and Western Australia, a similar problem has been resolved by similar deeming arrangements. For some positions, however, particularly judges, the committee took the view that something more was required and that a judge should not be able to contest an election without resigning his or her position.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I call on the Liberal government to put these issues to a referendum. It is regrettable that the government has squibbed the issue of a republic by calling off the vote for the national convention it promised prior to the election. It should reinstate that vote as a compulsory attendance vote—just as Australians usually vote—and use this opportunity to rectify outdated sections of the constitution which were revealed by the High Court's decision in Sykes and Cleary back in 1992.

           Aspects of section 44 of the Australian Constitution
          </emphasis>
          . The first is that, demonstrably, time and circumstances have changed and the concepts embodied in section 44 have a different bearing than they did at the time the Australian constitution was adopted, in particular that with respect to citizenship, which is embodied in 44(i). It has a different context
          <break page="6669" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           because of the degree to which at that stage there were aliens and there were others. The nature, however, of the obligation I think in the minds of most Australians continues. Predominantly, people want their representative in parliament to be an Australian citizen.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In our report we have attempted to provide for that. I disagreed totally with the concepts the honourable member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) mentioned in suggesting that in some way the government has squibbed in its obligation to conduct a constitutional convention. Rather, I think his remarks demonstrate the problems there are in constitutional change, for what we sought was to probe the degree to which there was support for constitutional change with respect to a republic. I think how the convention is constituted is entirely irrelevant.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          To my mind the important thing, however, in relation to section 44 is that there has been agreement within the committee and our recommendations attempt within the two principal questions referred to the committee—that on citizenship and, secondly, that on office of profit under the Crown—to come to what we believe are reasonable changes. The difficulty in the recommendations of course lies in the extent to which there would be unanimity in the community and the capacity to persuade the electorate at large to agree to such a constitutional change.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The recommendations that we have made with respect to citizenship need to be identified with the qualifications in recommendation 2; that is, we empower parliament to enact legislation determining the grounds of disqualification of members of parliament in relation to foreign allegiance. So many have dual citizenship and are not sure how to dispose of that dual citizenship. Indeed, as has been referred to by the chair of the committee, many are not even aware that they are dual citizens.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          With respect to recommendation 5, the number of members of parliaments who hold executive offices should be limited, I must admit I find myself in disagreement with the committee. I do not believe that we can set under the constitution a maximum of 20 per cent of the total membership of the parlia

           ment. I believe that to be outside the terms of reference of this particular committee, and I do not see any reason to lay down a prescribed percentage. The point is that the maximum laid down may be taken as the obligatory number, and I believe that a smaller government is better than a large one.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          With respect to the other recommendations, there is a real concern with respect to section 44(iv). We have attempted to cover that with recommendation 3. I worry whether or not the form we have now prescribed is adequate, although we must distinguish under the constitution a person holding a judicial office because to do otherwise would transgress the provisions for the separation of powers. It is recommended under recommendation 3, however, that certain other public offices specified by the parliament would be automatically declared vacant if the occupant of such an office were elected to the Senate or the House of Representatives.

            Aspects of section 44 of the Australian Constitution

           a constitutional problem and the extent of that problem. The committee was unanimous in appreciating the significance of section 44(i) of the constitution in that it protects our parliamentary system from those who have or might have, or even can be perceived to have, a conflict of loyalty between their country of origin and Australia. We were unanimous in the view that that potential conflict was not helpful at all and indeed could be damaging to our democratic process.
          </para>
         </talk.start>
         <para first-indent="16">
          At the same time, as has been noted, the language of section 44(i) is archaic and that in itself creates some problems. In 1901 there
          <break page="6670" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           was no such thing as an Australian citizen. We did not exist in a formal sense until 1949, with the introduction of the Australian Citizenship Act. The thrust of the committee's report in terms of recommending changes to section 44(i) is to fundamentally base the criteria on Australian citizenship and to recommend other legislative protections to exempt those who have the potential for a conflict of loyalty.

          At the same time we recognise the real problems that exist with the present structure and the fact that as many as five million people could be disadvantaged in seeking election to this parliament. I do not think any of us would say that a person's country of origin should deprive anyone who is genuinely committed to Australia of having a chance to have their say in the government of the nation.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Similarly, we were unanimous in recognising the principle behind section 44(iv), which is based on the concept of separation of powers and avoiding a situation where candidates for parliament are beholden to the executive as a result of their office or the remuneration they receive from the government quarter. At the same time, we noted that it could again disadvantage certain candidates. In my own circumstances in the last contest for the federal seat of Barton the preselected candidate for the Liberal Party in fact withdrew because of the complications that could have been created by his employment with the New South Wales State Rail Authority. That is regrettable because he would have been a very good candidate.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The other problem which we recognised is the hardship that can be caused to some, particularly senators, because of the period between election and actually taking office. My own father is a good example of that. He was elected to the Senate in 1961 and may not have achieved that office had it not been for a chance meeting with Sir Garfield Barwick in the men's room in the Commonwealth offices in Phillip Street. Sir Garfield Barwick, having noted that my father had preselection, said to him, `What are you going to do in the gap between election and assuming office?' My father said, `What's the
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           problem?' Sir Garfield Barwick explained the problem to him. Of course, my father obtained further advice, which proved to be absolutely correct in light of Cleary's case. It is not good enough to simply withdraw to an unpaid position. But, if it had not been for that chance meeting with Sir Garfield Barwick, my father's history may well have been different.

           —As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and as one who is affected by aspects of section 44 of the Australian constitution, I had more than a passing interest in this inquiry. We would all be aware of the troublesome sections relating to dual citizenship and office of profit. There is no disputing the intent of section 44. All Australians would agree that a member of parliament should have total and undivided loyalty to our nation and its institutions. In an open and democratic system of government, the challenge becomes one of how we ensure that our citizens all have the ability to achieve parliamentary office as well as to maintain the integrity of the parliament itself.

          In a number of recent cases, section 44 brought into question issues of allegiance, loyalty and commitment. The current problems stem from the archaic language used in section 44, particularly section 44(i), which I will principally address. It was written at the turn of the century when allegiance to God, king and country reigned supreme and we had only three classes of citizens: Australian born, British and the rest were thrown into a general classification entitled `aliens'.

          In the last 97 years the community has adapted, but the constitution has not. Unfortunately, the answer is not a matter of simply modernising the language. It stems from
          <break page="6671" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           problems of renunciation with those who are entitled to dual citizenship. The problem is that renunciation must take place in accordance with foreign law. However, there is no judicial opinion on what might constitute reasonable steps, as prescribed by the High Court in the Sykes v. Cleary case. These Australians are no less committed and loyal to their new country as those who come from countries who do not have dual citizenship. It may surprise many in this country, particularly those who espouse an Australian cultural cleansing policy based on race and now religion, that dual citizenship nations are essentially non-Asian—the United Kingdom and the United States to name just two.

          According to estimates, up to five million Australians are dual citizens—about a quarter of Australia's population. In this parliament alone we currently have 30 members of parliament who were born in a foreign country. Twenty&amp;hyphen;five of those members are from countries with dual citizenship. Each member is making their contribution—despite political affiliation, race or religion—to a better Australia. In saying this, the committee was firmly of the opinion that the intent of section 44 remains but the integrity of the parliamentary system must be upheld. First and foremost, allegiance must be to Australia. Candidates and members of parliament must be Australian citizens. Until such time as the recommended constitutional amendments—spoken about by previous speakers—can be presented to the Australian people, administrative steps which involve the Australian Electoral Commission, DFAT and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs are highly recommended.

We cannot allow the creation of a `fortress Australia', a fortress based on racial, religious or political considerations. Acceptance of these recommendations is our constitution's way of contributing to this fight.

I was delighted with the work of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. This is a modern report. It is a modernising report. The provisions of the constitution which were identified do require reform. The two key areas which have been identified relate to the disqualification of members of parliament in certain circumstances. This revises and puts in a simple way that which will be understandable to the Australian public and will be a more professional way of dealing with it. Also, the limitation on the size of the executive I think would be welcomed by the Australian public.

Both the phrases `office of profit under the Crown' and `allegiance to a foreign power' conjure up images of the English Civil War or a traitorous Black Adder type person in the Tower of London for treason. It would be a surprise therefore to many Australians to realise that these words and the powerful legal effect that they convey are contained in the Australian constitution. While they sound anachronistic, in the last five years they have resulted in the disqualification of two members from this House.

          At the present, the qualification provisions discriminate against those with dual nationality and against public servants. Surely in 1997 the only citizenship requirement for an MP should be that he or she is an Australian citizen. Clauses 44(i) and 44(iv) of the constitution have their origins in English statutes of the 14th and 18th centuries. Originally designed to prevent the Crown gaining control of the House of Commons using patronage, it now acts more as a constitutional trapdoor
          <break page="6672" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

          During the convention debates of 1897 and 1898, most of the discussion of the office of profit provision was concerned with the possibility of members of parliament being offered government posts. Isaac Isaacs declared, `The object of the clause is to prevent personal interest coming into conflict with public duty,' while Edmund Barton suggested, `I think it'—the clause—`is to prevent practical bribery.' It is worth noting that both of them resigned their seats later to accept government posts. Historically, during both world wars, members and senators did serve in the Commonwealth armed forces. Although they would have fallen foul of a constitutional provision—the obscure section 44(iv)—none of those members was disqualified. There were questions raised at the time, but the convention seems to have been very much to let that sleeping dog lie.

          The absurdity of the provision is shown when you see the exemptions that exist. For example, a commission in the RAAF will disqualify you; a commission in the RAF will not. The section can disqualify a nurse or a teacher but it will not disqualify Jeff Kennett or Bob Carr. At present 10 per cent of the Australian work force work in some capacity for the state and federal government. They all must resign before nominations.

          I support constitutional amendment of section 44(iv) suggested in recommendation 3 of this report. That amendment would still retain the original and important intention of the clause. The allegiance to a foreign power clause has been relied on in some vexatious challenges in the past. Two Catholics were challenged for their allegiance to the pontiff or the papal state and a Nuclear Disarmament Party senator's election was disputed on the basis that his protest against US warships indicated allegiance to an unnamed foreign power.

          This section does not protect Australians from a manchurian candidate, but it does discriminate against those with dual citizenship. A fairer solution is to delete the section and make Australian citizenship the criteria for MPs. Many constitutional lawyers believe

           that amendment of section 44 is overdue. The 1981 Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, the 1985 Australian Constitutional Convention and the 1988 Constitutional Commission all arrived at similar recommendations to those in this report.

          When it was signed it was a very controversial document. However, our inquiry received only 28 submissions. Perhaps the decision not to formulate a national action program had something to do with this small response. Interestingly, only one of the submissions was from a state or territory government. I must say that the small number of submissions surprised the committee a little, but we were aware that we had provided a number of organisations and individuals with an opportunity to express their views on this topic. Some of the groups and individuals had very strong views on the likely operation of this convention, and it is important that they had the chance to make their contribution to the debate on the document.

While the decision not to proceed with a national action program may have taken some of the heat from this issue, I doubt that it has been resolved.

In particular, most of the witnesses from the various departments and agencies were unable to answer questions on the implications of the convention in terms of the states' powers over land management, and that is very regrettable.

           —As has been indicated, the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties deals with a number of treaties in regard to Australia, Chile and the employment of diplomatic staff, the United Kingdom and Australia in regard to criminal proceeds, et cetera.

          Whilst the next speaker will talk about questions of consultation by government departments, it is worth noting that, when people talk about sovereignty and the states and territories, only one state, from recollection, responded to this particular inquiry. If one is putting forward a proposition, as some would, that there is a very great threat to states' rights through an extension of federal power in this field, one would expect these states and territories to take more of an interest in the matter rather than to come around perhaps in two years time to complain about how an outrageous extension of federal power will occur.

          That is not for a moment to say that I for one see any indication in this debate that there is that danger. It has been indicated that the submissions were not of the best quality. They were to some degree, without putting too fine a line on it, typified by perhaps an overreaction to fears of an international extension of powers. There are, from my point of view, reasons why we should go down the road of this treaty as regards international cooperation. The nature of this issue is vital to this country. We have to remember that in the last federal elections, for instance, there certainly were indications from the current government that they had a preoccupation and an obvious interest in getting something done about questions of landcare in this country. They are of crucial moment to us.

          There is no essential area of agreement between the government and opposition members in this report. I, for one, have not seen the onset of these great threats. I notice that, at the time of the report's compilation back in June, 68 countries had already acceded. That is an indication of broad international support. I leave my response there.

           <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
            Treaties is certainly one of the most interesting committees of which to be a member. It has looked at a great many issues since it was formed at the commencement of this parliament. As the chairman, the member for Groom (Mr Taylor), has said, next week will see the ninth report tabled in less than a year. It is therefore a good time to take stock of just where, as a committee, we have been and where we are now. In dealing with the eighth report, there is a matter to which I would like to refer which has implications for most reports we have tabled.

          One of the issues which has recurred in our discussions has been the issue of consultation—at least the lack of it—outside the process of the committee. In his statement to the  House on 2 May 1996, which led to the establishment of the Joint Committee on Treaties, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) said:
         </para>

          Consultation will be the key word.

          He also said the new treaty making procedures will:

         <para font-size="-=2">

         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          In our fourth report, we made a number of comments about this matter, including drawing attention to the need for greater consultation with the states and territories. I believe this matter has now been satisfactorily addressed, although I note the comments of the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson).
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I do have some real concerns about the amount of community consultation which departments and agencies at the federal level actually engage in. The government's response to the fourth report took a predictable line: there is no case where the states and territories have not been informed or where cooperation has been resisted. While this may well be so, it certainly misses the point which concerns us.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We have seen evidence of a number of different definitions of the concept of consultation. Changing the rather narrow view which has been taken by several departments and agencies has proved to be very difficult. Two examples serve to make my point. We dealt with a double taxation agreement where
          <break page="6675" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           the sponsoring organisation, the Australian Taxation Office, did not see fit to discuss the matter with professional accounting bodies. Worse still, they were resistant to repeated requests from the committee, exuding great arrogance in the process we put them through. They caused the committee to convene a second public hearing. If the ATO had put a decent effort into their original national interest analysis, NIA, this certainly would not have been necessary.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          More recently, we considered a bilateral agreement on economic trade and technical cooperation where there had been no attempt by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade itself to talk to any of the Australian business and commercial bodies which had direct links with the other country.

          The treaties process is new and working in the national interest. Various elements of the bureaucracy have had to change their approach as a result: they have a new level of accountability built into the system. As is the lot for bureaucracies, change can be resisted. As a committee all members—all sides of politics, both chambers—are determined to make the process work. We are serious about consultation and serious enough to force often conservative bureaucracies to conform to the new way.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The bureaucratic approach to consultation I have outlined shows a limited definition which is contrary to the committee's understanding and usage of the term `consultation'. More importantly, it is also contrary to what the minister said last year about the revised treaty making process.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As a committee, we believe, to be effective and play a worthwhile part in the important process of treaty making, consultation needs to be as wide as possible. We certainly do not believe this has always been the case. We have seen too many examples of insufficient consultation with even the most obvious interest groups. We would also hope it would not now be necessary to keep harping on this matter in reports and tabling speeches. It is very disappointing a fairly explicit series of comments on this issue in this place have so far been ignored.

           In the eighth report, the committee deals with a total of eight treaties of various types and descriptions. It is a good example of the number and variety of issues with which the committee deals on a regular basis and, as we have now been in existence for more than a year, we are starting to see the same type of bilateral treaty appearing for the second and third time, albeit with different countries. This certainly helps us to build on our expertise to ensure the central issues are much more closely examined each time.

          —I welcome this motion on Internet use, which was moved at a previous sitting by the member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron)—although it is interesting to note that he has not had too much influence on his party room going by some of the public policy outcomes related to this particular area. If he is such a supporter of the Internet, why is it that this government has reneged on its promise of maintaining public libraries electronic access funding of $11.4 million, which was cut in the first Costello budget to just $2 million—a funding cut of 80 per cent? That was a magnificent program designed to provide affordable access
          <break page="6676" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           for every single Australian to the Internet through their local library.

         There is no doubt that, in our information based society, as we move from industrial arrangements to the Information Age, information has become a very valuable commodity both for economic and social reasons—valuable for the economy and also valuable for good citizenship—so access to information needs to be regarded as one of the prerequisites of our democracy, one of the foundation stones of providing a fair and equal society.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is no doubt that there is a role for government with regard to access to the Internet—affording the hardware and the costs of use. Government needs to be involved in the provision of this particular service—not everyone can afford a personal computer in their home. I know members of parliament are now coming on line with the Internet and the like, but we are fairly well pampered in the public arena. We always need to remember during debates like this the deprivation in other parts of the community—the fact that some seven per cent of Australians do not have a telephone in their household; that is, there are 400,000 households in Australia without a telephone. So for those Australians access to the telephone is the first step let alone worrying about access to and meeting the costs of the Internet.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So, in terms of equity and access, we do need to use the public library network around Australia as a national network of affordable access points to the Internet. This was the point of the former Labor government allocating $11.4 million for that purpose—valuable seed funding so that every municipality in Australia could establish affordable access points to the Internet in each of the 1,600 municipal libraries around the country.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That was an outstanding program, which the coalition promised during the last election campaign to maintain but, as in so many areas, the promise was dispensable and it was broken in the first Costello budget. I would suggest to the member for Stirling that, in moving this particular motion, he should drag himself away from fighting Noel Crichton&amp;hyphen;Browne in the west and actually use his time productively in the parliament.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          One thing he might do at the next coalition party meeting is to stand up and say, `We're backtracking in so many areas of public policy—backtracking on tax all the way back to Fightback and backtracking on industry policy as we are thinking about reversing some of the cuts in the first Costello budget—so why not backtrack on the funding cut for the Internet? Why not restore the federal funding provided by the former Labor government for each of the 1,600 municipal libraries in Australia so the Internet can be provided in every suburb and every town of Australia and every single citizen can have an affordable access point?' That would be a useful contribution to make out of public policy.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The other thing that needs to be done is for the parliament to recognise part (3) of the motion and affirm `its support for untimed local calls for Internet users'. There is no doubt about the Labor Party position on that particular matter. We are rock solid in favour of untimed local calls for Internet users. It is one of the very sensible reasons of course why the Labor Party is opposed to the privatisation of Telstra. If we are serious about the talk of moving into the Information Age, what is the one valuable piece of public infrastructure for an Information Age? It is the cable. It is the pipe network that Telstra currently has in majority public ownership and which should always be maintained in majority public ownership because that ownership is the guarantee the Australian people have of equal and fair access to the cable network.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I am glad to see the member for Deakin (Mr Barresi) nodding. He should have spoken up in the party room as well. That should be the holy grail of infrastructure policy in the Information Age—full public ownership of Telstra's cable network. That is the other thing for these government members to usefully do in their party room: stand up for restoring the public library funding for Internet access and stand up for maintaining majority public ownership in Telstra and thereby holding the main infrastructure asset of the Information Age in public hands where its public interest can always be defended.

         As many as 2&amp;half; million Australians have accessed the Internet. Australians are continuing their tradition of being early adaptors of new technology. The Internet is a tool for inquiry, information, entertainment and commerce. It can be a significant contributor to the desirable national asset of a curious, informed, engaging and creative citizenry. Even by late 1994, almost a quarter of Australian households were regularly using a home computer. According to the ABS, the highest application of computers in the home was, for education, at 25 per cent; entertainment, at 22&amp;half; per cent; and general word processing.

         These major uses of home computers—education and entertainment—dovetail neatly into the strongest attributes of the Internet. This suggests a continuing high level of interest in the Internet by the home computer user. Not everybody, however, who connects to the Internet continues to stay with it. The research consultancy www.consult reported earlier this month that around one&amp;hyphen;fifth of Australians who connected thought the monthly access fees charged by Internet service providers were too high, or thought connection speeds were too low. Growth is now reportedly down to five or six per cent a month but this is still a staggering 60 per cent a year, or of that order, which remains a phenomenal rate.

         There are now 470 Internet service providers in Australia—quite an interesting number. It is easy to see why being an ISP is so popular.

I support the government's recently announced principles for a regulatory framework for on&amp;hyphen;line services under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. This should be introduced next year, with codes of practice to have legislative backing.

         Net supervision aids, such as the platform for Internet connect selection, may be helpful in attempting to weed out, through ratings organisations, undesirable content. Enabling parents to be confident that their children can access the educational and economic benefits of the Internet while not being exposed to undesirable material is another challenge we face. As helpful as NetNanny and other software sifting products may be in sorting out the muck from the mind food on the Internet, they are no substitute for parental guidance in the development of discerning young minds. I commend the member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron) for bringing this motion forward and support his motion.

The CIN, as it was known, provided free Internet services to many small communities which otherwise had very limited access.

         There were a number of success stories coming out of this program. I am aware of a farmer who, by going down to his local CIN site, was able to find information on irrigation schemes that saved him thousands of dollars. What a shame, therefore, that the overnight conversion of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to an information technology buff did not occur before his government decided to axe this wonderful program.

         In a society increasingly divided into the information rich and the information poor, the axing of the CIN put back by several years the ability of many Tasmanians to share in this emerging technology. Despite this setback, more and more people in my electorate are making the decision to go on line, mostly using one of the several very good home&amp;hyphen;grown commercial Tasmanian service providers. One of the hot issues they are having to confront when they do go on line is that of timed local calls. This is a threat that could see an increase in the cost of Internet use through either higher charges for calling service providers or through higher costs imposed on service providers which, in turn, would be passed on to the customers.

         Since the government's legislation earlier this year which opened up the possibility of timed local calls, Internet service providers and users have had to live with the threat of these increased charges.

         These results give an inkling of the views of rural Australia on this issue. People living in the country use the Internet for a whole range of things: for communication, information, weather reports and educational purposes. They can use it through their library services or through a community connection. It is a great tool for people in rural and regional Australia and they want to use it without the constraints timed local calls would impose on them. Internet access must be kept affordable. The best way to ensure this is to remove any temptation on the part of major carriers towards acquiring market dominance through the implementation of timed local calls.

         I conclude with reference to a recent report by the government's own Information Policy Advisory Council, which confirms the importance of the Internet to rural communities all over Australia. The report states that what will cause the failure of rural and regional communities to harness the advantages of the new information technology is `a lack of leadership, a failure of nerve, or a short&amp;hyphen;sighted alibi for inaction', which would sum up this government. I think most people on this side of the House would agree with that. Let us be guilty of none of these by supporting this motion fully.

         The global trend towards greater Internet usage is mirrored in Australia. AC Nielsen McNair has conducted several surveys on Australia's Internet usage between August 1995 and March 1997. The results show that the number of people 14 and over who had accessed the Internet in the previous month had risen from six per cent in August 1995 to 13 per cent in March 1997, while the estimated percentage of Australians over the age of 14 who had ever accessed the Internet was 22 per cent. That is one in five Australians who have already accessed the Internet. A further 17 per cent of those people had not yet accessed the Internet but said that they were likely to in the next 12 months.

         The immediate benefits of the Internet are substantial. Virtually anyone with a PC and a modem can tap into one of the most, if not the most, dynamic resource bases in the world. Educational institutions have been quick to take advantage of this new aqueduct of knowledge and the increasing use of the Internet at home allows Australians access to an unprecedented level of information. It is not hard to draw the link between greater access to the Internet leading to an increasingly technology literate work force. School children learning the basics today will be harnessing the full potential of our global village tomorrow. It is important that we remain amongst the most progressive countries to adapt and master new technologies.

          In Adelaide we know a little bit about the subject of timed local calls because it was Bob Hawke's intervention in 1988 during the Adelaide by&amp;hyphen;election, when he refused to rule out that Labor would introduce timed local calls, that probably saw Michael Pratt win a 6&amp;half; per cent Labor seat from the ALP with something like an eight per cent swing. Increasing Internet usage will continue only so long as local calls remain untimed. Telstra has confirmed that it will not introduce timed local calls in the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, it is important to spell out the reasons why timed local calls would be detrimental to Australians and to the Internet. Many households have taken advantage of cheap introductory offers with local servers and could ill afford to continue Internet access should timed local calls be introduced.

         Nowhere is the potential of the Internet more apparent than in our schools. Only this morning we read of the recommendations of the Goldsworthy report, which strongly supports the establishment of universal secondary student access for the Internet by 2000 as well as online computers in the libraries of all primary schools. The Internet is not a substitute for a highly trained, dedicated and caring teaching profession but it does have the ability to complement that profession in the classroom as a first&amp;hyphen;class learning tool.

         However, what needs to be understood is that more and more of the learning that is possible through the Internet is being done at home or is capable of being done at home. Last year a Bureau of Statistics survey recording the extent of computer usage in private households found that, in the two years to February 1996, the rate of computer usage in private homes increased from 23 per cent to 30 per cent, representing an increase of 600,000 computers. Today there are probably three million computers in private homes, the vast majority of which offer a potential connection to the Internet. That same survey concluded that a total of 3.9 million persons aged five years and over used the household computer and, after playing games, the most popular use of these computers was for educational activities. More than half of the million people who indicated the use of mainly educational products were aged 17 or less.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bureau's research found that 262,000 people used the Internet from home. The growth rate in Internet usage was not recorded, but during the past 18 months we would expect this number to have grown rapidly indeed. One of the research findings that I think ought to be particularly noted is that some 4.7 million Australian households neither own nor operate a computer, and 31 per cent of this group gave high cost as the
         <break page="6681" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          reason. The survey was limited in the links it created between computer usage and income. But it found that less than a quarter of those homes with computers had a modem or external link and that 27 per cent of those without this device cited cost as a reason against the purchase. So, without an external link, the Internet remains inaccessible to many Australian families.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is vital that we do not allow the Internet to exacerbate the substantial difference in opportunity which now presents itself in Australian families on either side of the wealth divide. If families in poorer areas cannot access the Internet outside of school hours, ultimately their children will find themselves underresourced in comparison to families who can afford a home computing environment.

         In recent days the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) gave public schools a backhander by implying that they contribute disproportionately to youth unemployment. I would have thought that any education minister who understood these issues or gave them any thought would realise that resources play an important role—an enormous role—in equipping students for the work force. So it is with the Internet. The minister can assist public schools in better equipping their students for employment by ensuring that the Goldsworthy recommendation of Internet access is supported. We shall see.

I myself wrote down the same statistics. But what the member for Wills missed was one interesting statistic which told us that 62.61 per cent of the Internet users are heterosexual. I thought that was a very interesting statistic. As to who is using the Internet, I think we can break the statistics down to almost anything we like. But that is not the point.

         The point is that this is one of the greatest revolutions ever. It is even bigger than the Industrial Revolution. The Internet is changing the face of the world. All those barriers that in the past have prevented people in different countries from communicating with each other have gone. With the press of a button connected to the computer, you can talk to anybody in another country. You can access the newspapers of another country. This is totally and utterly revolutionary. Just think, daily we can go into the newspapers of another country and see what is happening there.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But the member for Wills, in giving us all these statistics, did then get to something much more interesting. He mentioned the need to ensure that this great technology is available to everybody and that nobody, certainly not from want of income, is cut out. If they are, then we will create two classes in this country. Our country will be made up of the people who have access to information against the people who do not have access to information. We cannot let that happen.

        <para first-indent="16">
         So the member for Wills is right, as were the member for Boothby (Dr Southcott) and the member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron), who have spoken on this side: we must ensure there is open access for all Australians. In this way Australia will improve its own educational standards. Education is now one of the great movers in the Internet. Through the
         <break page="6682" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        <para first-indent="16">
         It is for this reason that the question of country access is so important. We cannot deny people in the country access to the Internet because of the higher charge involved. In the cities there are so many ISP providers that we can connect with them for the cost of a local call. But in the country, obviously you cannot have local ISP providers everywhere and the country people have to pay that STD charge to get into the ISP provider.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I believe that Telstra has given concessions to country people whereby, after paying $3 for calls after 8 p.m., there will be no further charge to the ISP provider that night. That is certainly moving in the right direction. But we have to guarantee that people in the country have full access—just as do people in the city—to the Internet without extra unconscionable charges. That is something we have to look at.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The third part of this motion suggests the horrible spectre of timed calls. At the moment, as I have just said, we have only to pay for the connection to the ISP provider. There was some talk earlier on that Telstra or the telecommunications provider, while being excluded by legislation from charging the individuals who are ringing the ISP provider, could decide to charge the ISP provider themselves on a timed basis. The ISP providers already pay for lines installed and for the amount of data transferred. If they also had to pay for the time, the many ISP providers that are out there would collapse. It would become uneconomic to have them there.

         Budget constraints applied by the City of Kingston have seen the centre's level of operational funding decline from $17,000 to $12,000 this financial year.

         Last financial year—and, I understand, again this financial year—the City of Kingston allocated $48,000 towards the construction of an extension, conditional upon the state government providing $100,000 from its community development fund, which is generated from gambling and general casino revenue.

Ivan is a legend at the Sandgate Yacht Club and, as the fleet sets off into Moreton Bay next year, I am sure Ivan will do all he can to provide perfect sailing conditions.

         The citrus industry has already met with members of the government. We recognise the degree to which frozen concentrated orange juice floating in from Brazil is providing a problem for the local industry. But we also need to recognise that there are opportunities for the Australian citrus industry in putting whole oranges into cartons for the export market rather than squeezing them and selling them in the form of juice. In fact, it is in promoting these export markets that the government has been very busy and very vigilant.

         It is very much to the citrus industry's credit that their export performance has risen so dramatically over the last three years with a policy that was actually introduced by the former government. But that effectively was misrepresented by the member for Batman when he rose. He pretended that in some ways the tariff policy of this government was providing the TCF industry with difficulties. The reality is that the tariff policies that the citrus industry and the car industry face and the TCF industry currently have are a product of the former government.

          Of course, the situation in Melbourne is worsened by the open-ended expansion of gambling, which has caused a large decline in local retail spending. The situation for small retailers, especially in the large centres like Greensborough shopping centre, which services the northern part of the electorate, is made worse by the attitude of landlords. Some big shopping centres and franchises think that they can push the small operators to the limit because they have so much market power. Overall, the situation is exacerbated by the Howard government's failure to carry out its promise to reduce red tape for small business—like small retailers.

          There is also a lack of direction from the government, leading to a lack of certainty and a crisis of confidence in the community. The only answer seems to be the magic bullet of the GST. Small retailers know what a GST would do for them. In fact, the GST is going to turn them into unpaid tax collectors. They will have to register with the Australian Taxation Office and remit GST on a regular basis. Many will also face the additional costs of new hardware.

It will house Thredbo's only year&amp;hyphen;round preschool facility; be a venue for social, sport and recreational groups; and generally offer the residents an informal, personal place to hold meetings and other gatherings.

        It was a tragic event, bringing immense personal sorrow to many Australians and to many people in the Australian community. Tragic though the event was, it did once again create a situation where the Australian tradition and the Australian spirit of working together unselfishly in difficult circumstances to help one's fellow Australians was demonstrated to the full. I do not think any of us could have been other than profoundly moved by the dedication, the commitment, the sheer hard work and, I am sure, the fatigue&amp;hyphen;inducing circumstances in which the men and women of the emergency services of Australia worked.

Some of those, as he rightly pointed out, were foreshadowed by the previous government, but a number of those initiatives that he referred to are new. They are all welcome.

        We have had a number of bad tragedies as a nation over the last 15 months—Port Arthur, the Black Hawk disaster, Gracetown, Thredbo and the bridge collapse at Israel in recent times. They have been situations where that spirit that is there in Australia of common goodwill to each other as Australians has been exercised absolutely to the fullest. It is a sad thing that it is often those tragedies which produce that sense of community spirit and that sense of communal endeavour. But it is absolutely necessary when those tragedies occur that that sort of public response follows.

They would have been absolutely staggered, too, at the good fortune that the tragedy was not even greater than it was, so precariously balanced was the landslide. Had that balance been upset, particularly on the night itself, how much greater the list of casualties would have been. One of the rescuers who was responsible for the coordination told me that as rumour ran rife and confusion obtained on the night of the tragedy on 30 July at 11.30, he had no idea how many had been killed but he had received estimates going up to 150 as they looked at the potential disaster in terms of the slide which had occurred. Of course, thank God, it was considerably less than that, but it was bad enough.

When you actually saw the logistics of keeping the huge gathering of rescuers promptly supported in that endeavour, you appreciated that it was a logistic exercise of a most extraordinary kind.

But it did rapidly become apparent—and nothing I have heard since from anyone on the site contests this—that nothing could have been done differently, except to put at even greater risk those who might have been still trapped and certainly to put in very grave peril those who were embarked upon rescuing them.

It was almost as if they never slept. Unfortunately, I didn't catch them on that Saturday. They were either sleeping or just having a good ski.

For many people here in Canberra it had an extra element because it was a case of there but for fortune go you or I. After all, Corinya Lodge was essentially the home of skiers from here in the ACT. It is no comfort, I suppose, to recognise how much worse the tragedy might have been not only for the reasons outlined by the Leader of the Opposition earlier but because, if the landslide had occurred on the weekend, Corinya lodge would have been packed and the tragedy would have been so much deeper.

        It was by any measure an awful tragedy for the individuals and their families, for Thredbo, for the region, and for the nation, a tragedy played out in our lounge rooms every night. It always appeared on television like one of those things that only happens somewhere else. We in Australia are very fortunate. We see on television the unfolding tragedies of the world but we do not think it is going to happen on our doorstep. But it did enable us to see and to appreciate and to give extra feeling to our tribute to the rescue workers from the SES, the police, the fire brigades, the ambulances, the hospital teams at Canberra Hospital, to all those other people from departments and agencies, and to the voluntary and paid workers who turned out and worked so magnificently. They were not just courageous and dedicated and committed but also well prepared. They were geared up in the hope that what they were trained for would never happen but in the recognition that such things inevitably do happen in every nation and that we need people ready and able to respond quickly.

         That this House expresses its deep regret at the death on 13 July 1997 of the Right Honourable Sir Garfield Edward John Barwick AK, GCMG, Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia from 1964 to 1981, Member of this House for the Division of Parramatta from 1958 to 1964, Minister for External Affairs from 1961 to 1964, and Commonwealth Attorney&amp;hyphen;General from 1958 to 1964, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.

         The death of Sir Garfield Barwick on 13 July 1997 at the age of 94 removed from the Australian scene a person who had played a very distinguished role, indeed a dominant role, in the legal life of Australia for close on 40 years, and also removed somebody who, in a short period of service in this House of only six years, had made a remarkable contribution to the government of this country.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Garfield Barwick was born on 22 June 1903 at Stanmore in New South Wales. He was educated at the famous Fort Street Boys High School, which has long been a distinguished element of the New South Wales public education system. He was then educated at Sydney University, where he won the University Medal for Law and the Dalley Prize.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         From the relatively humble circumstances of Sir Garfield Barwick's background, he not only aspired to and achieved the Commonwealth Attorney-Generalship, became minister for what was then called External Affairs, and also led the Australian bar for two decades, but was also regarded as the stand&amp;hyphen;out advocate in Australia when he entered parliament in 1958—a fact attested to generously from
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          both sides of the parliament at the time he entered. The fact that he could, from those circumstances, reach such heights and achieve so much says a great deal for the egalitarian character of Australian society. It is a reminder to present generations of Australians that that egalitarian spirit and those egalitarian opportunities for those of ability, no matter what their circumstances, have been around in Australia for a very long time.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Before he entered federal politics, Sir Garfield had already established a remarkable career as a pre&amp;hyphen;eminent barrister and advocate, and as an undisputed leader of the Australian bar. I doubt that, in the period since World War II, anybody has so dominated so completely the Australian bar as did Barwick at the time of his entry into federal politics in 1958. You can reel off any other names you like but none would go within a bull's roar of the ascendancy that Barwick had established within the legal fraternity of Australia at the bar when he entered parliament in 1958.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         On a personal note, I remember as a university student attending Sir Garfield Barwick's inaugural campaign meeting in Parramatta in 1958, which was attended by the then Prime Minister, Mr Robert Menzies.

        <para first-indent="16">
         He very quickly entered the ministry. He held two vital portfolios, for a period of time together. He was responsible for major reforms in the area of matrimonial causes. He was the first federal minister to pioneer the notion of competition law in this country, although the model which he advocated of restrictive trade practices was not entirely followed in the final form of the Murphy legislation and the now Trade Practices Act. The fact remains that Barwick was the first person in Australian political history at a federal level to put down a model for pro&amp;hyphen;competition law in this country.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         He was also a very distinguished representative of Australia's interests abroad. He was Minister for External Affairs at the time of some of the difficulties surrounding the Indonesian confrontation. He was very directly concerned in the diplomatic manoeuvrings that led to the formation of Malaysia. I well remember that, in discussions I had with him and from many meetings that he addressed, he
         <break page="6695" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          had an unambiguous view of the importance of the Asia&amp;hyphen;Pacific region to the future of Australia. In that, of course, he was following the tradition that had been begun by Menzies and McEwen in the work they did in their respective responsibilities and not least, of course, in the Japan-Australia Commerce Agreement of 1957, for which Sir John McEwen quite correctly deserved such credit.

         Before entering parliament, Sir Garfield Barwick had been involved in some of the most famous of constitutional cases. He went to the bar in 1927. He was appointed King's Counsel in 1941. He practised extensively in all jurisdictions. He appeared before the Supreme Court of New South Wales, the High Court of Australia and the Privy Council. In a string of cases before the High Court in the 1940s, most notably the airways case and the bank nationalisation case, Sir Garfield Barwick successfully espoused in court the rights of private enterprise against the authority and the power of the state. It was a guiding principle of his public life to champion the rights of private enterprise against the power of the state. He was President of the New South Wales Bar Association from 1950 to 1952 and he was President of the Law Council of Australia from 1952 to 1954.

         In 1964, after only six years in federal parliament and after cramming into that period service as both Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs, Sir Garfield Barwick left politics. He was appointed Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, a position he occupied for 17 years, and in fact he became the longest serving Chief Justice in the history of Australia.

         His chief justiceship saw many significant events affecting the court and the law in Australia. He presided over the permanent establishment of a home for the High Court of Australia here in Canberra.

It is worth reminding the parliament that it was really the joint actions of Commonwealth Attorneys&amp;hyphen;General, such as Nigel Bowen and others, and the High Court Chief Justice, Sir Garfield

          Barwick, that were the driving force behind making the High Court of Australia the final court of appeal on all matters coming within the federal jurisdiction. Sir Garfield was also responsible for the divesting of less important matters from the High Court's jurisdiction to allow it to concentrate on its role as the final court on all Australian constitutional issues and the final court of appeal in Australia.

         He made an immense contribution to public life outside the law and outside politics. For example, he was the President of the Australian Conservation Foundation for five years. He had a very close association with the conservation of Australia's natural wealth. He served as a trustee of the Kosciuszko State Park for 20 years. He demonstrated his compassion for his fellow Australians by his service as Patron of the Australian National Council for the Blind and as President of the Royal New South Wales Institute for Deaf and Blind Children.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In reflecting upon this remarkable life of 94 years, a number of things should be said. The first and foremost is that his life was a message to all Australians that, if you have ability, tenacity and determination, no matter what your circumstances are you can with a reasonable share of fortune aspire to very great success. Anybody who argues that Barwick had a privileged background, anybody who argues that Barwick was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and anybody who argues that Barwick was from the elite of Australian society and achieved what he did because of that good fortune would demonstrate his or her total ignorance of political history in Australia. He was a remarkable lawyer. He probably dominated the bar of his nation in a way that nobody has quite dominated the bar of their nation in the 20th century.

        <para first-indent="16">
         He was not without controversy in his public life, and I want to say in that respect that—whatever views were held, continue to be held and are still held about the circumstances of 1975—the way in which he was pursued by some of his erstwhile political opponents until his 90th, 91st, 92nd, 93rd and 94th years, when he was in failing health and almost totally blind, demonstrated a meanness

         Sir Garfield Barwick was a person of substance who had a significant impact on Australian public life over three decades; first, as an outstanding advocate, then as Attorney&amp;hyphen;General and Minister for External Affairs and, finally, as Chief Justice of the High Court.

         The Prime Minister made the point several times in the course of his remarks that Sir Garfield Barwick's life exemplifies the possibilities in Australia for people of humble origins rising to the very top. I would have to say this: if the qualification is the sort of legal expertise and the intelligence that Sir Garfield Barwick had, not a huge number are going to make it through. I would say that Sir Garfield Barwick was one of the exceptions that proved the rule, rather than the other way around. His eminence in that regard was noted by many people on both sides of politics well before he actually got into the parliament. He was, in fact, knighted prior to his parliamentary service—indeed, five years prior to his parliamentary service, in 1953. That followed both his presidency of the bar
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

         There is no doubt at all about his very substantial legal abilities. There is no doubt that he was, in that sense, a unique Australian. There was a widespread anticipation prior to his arrival in parliament that he might even rise further than he did, to eventually become Prime Minister of this country. He was a minister for virtually the entirety of his service in parliament, including a period as Minister for External Affairs. Indeed, it was his period as Minister for External Affairs which basically saw the end of his parliamentary and ministerial career. Though he was an able Minister for External Affairs, internally—as is quite evident from the histories—he was not in agreement with the government at the time in some of the courses of action that he took. He nevertheless was important in intervening at a crucial moment in Australian&amp;hyphen;Indonesian relations, at a time when policy seemed atrophied, in being able to bring together a range of possibilities to settle what was a growing dispute between Indonesia and its neighbours and between Indonesia and this country. In breaking through, he did not necessarily earn himself the joyous endorsement of his Prime Minister. Nevertheless, he was effective as he did so.

         As member for Parramatta from 1958 to 1964, he made, through the luck of timing and his own personal efforts, a huge contribution to the federal parliament during that period. Those amongst us who might argue for term limits, as apply in some parts of the world and notably in the USA, might like to reflect that Sir Garfield Barwick would have fitted well within the term limits and still made that huge contribution. He spent just six years as a member of this parliament. Of course, during that period he was also Attorney&amp;hyphen;General and, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has mentioned, a great reformer, including the abolition of appeals to the Privy Council.

         On behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and on my own behalf, I salute his particular contribution as Minister for External Affairs to the carrying forward of Australia's foreign affairs policy during that period and would mention one thing. Very early on, in the early 1960s, his pattern of travel as Minister for External Affairs reflected a deep commitment to engagement with Asia. The one priority trip that he took during that period was to India, Pakistan, Thailand and Laos, as a particular commitment he had to building our relations with our region. That was also brought out by his policy decision with regard to Indonesia.

         That this House expresses its deep regret at the death on 6 August 1997 of the Honourable Lance Herbert Barnard, AO, Member of this House for the Division of Bass from 1954 to 1975, Deputy Prime Minister from 1972 to 1974, Minister for Defence from 1972 to 1975, Minister for the Navy, the Army, Air and Supply from 1972 to 1973,  Postmaster&amp;hyphen;General and Minister for Labour and National Service, Immigration, the Interior, Primary Industry, Repatriation, Health, National Development and Social Services in December 1972, and Ambassador of Australia to Sweden, Norway and Finland from 1975 to 1978, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         The death of Lance Barnard ended the life of a person who was well liked on both sides of politics. Lance Barnard was born at Launceston in Tasmania on 1 May 1919. He came
         <break page="6698" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          from what one might loosely call a traditional working class background and, like many others at the time, had to leave school during the Depression. He worked in a timber yard for two years but went to night school and started training as a teacher.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         During World War II, Lance enlisted with the 2nd Australian Imperial Force and served with the Australian army in the Middle East from 1940 to 1943. He took part in the famous Battle of El Alamein and sustained permanent disabilities affecting his eyesight as well as his hearing. After his discharge from military service in 1945, he went on to become a school teacher.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But it was almost inevitable that Lance would turn his attention to politics. His father, Claude Barnard, was the member for Bass for 15 years and served in the Chifley ministry as repatriation minister from 1946 to 1949. I think he held that portfolio rather longer than did his son. Lance was reared in politics and, to his credit, he was able to follow in his father's footsteps in 1954 when he won Bass for the Australian Labor Party.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         His maiden speech to the parliament was characterised by his concern over a diversity of issues, ranging from social issues such as housing and the impact of high interest rates on home&amp;hyphen;ownership to issues affecting the prosperity of his home state of Tasmania. He went on to become the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party. Even as a political opponent of the Labor Party, one can recognise the immensely stabilising effect that Lance Barnard had on the Labor opposition as it worked towards winning government in 1972. I think Gough Whitlam, in his public tributes to Lance Barnard, has quite properly and accurately given to his late deputy a very fair and proper share of the credit for building the strength of the Labor Party in the lead&amp;hyphen;up to the 1972 election. Lance was, of course, along with Gough Whitlam, involved in that—I will not say famous but I will say unusual—two&amp;hyphen;man ministry which governed Australia after the election of the Whitlam government in 1972.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I found Lance Barnard, in the personal contact I had with him in the 18 months between 1974 and 1975 that we were

          parliamentary colleagues, to be a likeable, courteous and decent man who had strong and true Labor values and a very deep affection for Australia, and who had served his country with great effort both in war and in peace. He tried to do the right thing by his state and he tried to do the right thing by his native city of Launceston. He contributed immensely to the rebuilding of the Labor Party in the 1960s. Without him, who knows what might have happened in the lead&amp;hyphen;up to 1972.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When Lance left federal politics in 1975 he became Australian Ambassador to Sweden, Norway and Finland. In 1979, in recognition of his service to politics and to government, Lance Barnard was appointed an Officer in the General Division of the Order of Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am sure Lance will be warmly remembered by men and women on both sides of politics as a quiet, unassuming man—a great achiever whose unswerving loyalty and personal integrity earned him the respect of those with whom he worked.

          —I join the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in his expression of condolence. Lance Barnard's death was unexpected and very sad. He was a humble, modest and great man. Those of us—and there were many—who attended his recent funeral on a cold and bleak day in Launceston were moved both by the suddenness of his departure and by the extraordinary eulogy delivered by his friend, colleague and former leader, Gough Whitlam. His tribute is one that neither I nor anyone else could possibly better in this place. Nevertheless, we must all try.

         Lance Barnard's service to this nation has been an extraordinarily distinguished one: in the armed forces, as a private citizen, as a member of parliament for a very long period of time from 1954 to 1974, as Deputy Prime Minister of this nation and as a man who served in more ministerial portfolios than anyone else in the history of this nation, though there is only one that I think he would
         <break page="6699" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          lay claim to in terms of any ownership of policy—his beloved portfolio of defence.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         He came into parliament, as the Prime Minister indicated, on the heels of his father, who had also had a distinguished parliamentary service and a distinguished ministerial service. He rose to prominence as Gough Whitlam's deputy. He was described by Max Walsh as `Sancho Barnard, Don Whitlam's sheet anchor'. I think that Gough's description of him, though not as brief, is better. He goes on in his remarks here to talk about his role as a deputy:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I want it to be understood—
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         this is Gough—
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         in the most positive way. Lance's role went far beyond that of the loyal deputy, great and rare though the quality of the loyalty he gave undoubtedly was. What his colleagues and I valued most was his deep understanding of the needs and hopes of the Australian people, his instinctive feeling for the Labor Party and the Labor movement in all its moods and manifestations. Combine this with a deep Australian commonsense and an innate decency and integrity and you have no man's lieutenant but a prince among men.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         Lance Barnard of course served in that two&amp;hyphen;week Whitlam government, as the Prime Minister has referred to. Gough modestly took 13 portfolios and gave Lance 14, and therefore Lance has the record. It was a distinguished government that achieved a deal in the two weeks in which it was in office.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But one of its public presentations—indeed, its only public presentation—was for its members to attend a passing out parade at Duntroon. As a result of their attendance at that, it is the only occasion on which the entire cabinet has attended the passing out parade at Duntroon, and the only time the entire cabinet have been members of the Returned Services League. The whole event and the irony entailed within it would have struck Lance Barnard, a humorous man—a drolly humorous man—to its fullest conceivable extent.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It would have also been for himself an amazing experience, the fulfilment of a lifetime's ambition after that formative period of his life spent in the desert with the AIF in the 9th Division and subsequently back in Australia. He fought through the war with that
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          division and, as a result of that experience, he was wounded and partially deafened. His family suffered universal damage in that war—all three of the brothers: one died, and the other two were wounded, including, of course, Lance himself.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So war, wartime experience and the defence of the nation resonated within Lance's soul in the entirety of the time that he was a member of parliament. It gave him that sense of commitment in politics which was, for the Labor Party, of extraordinary benefit in an era in which the Labor Party was struggling to cope with the consequences of foreign policy being at the centre of Australian political debate in the course of the 1960s. At a period of time when the Labor Party's expertise in the area of defence was heavily under challenge, he brought to it an experience, a wisdom and a knowledge—an intimate knowledge—that did much to enhance the party's credibility generally.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When Gough Whitlam established the modern system of shadow cabinets when he assumed the leadership of the Labor Party, he signalled what was the advice that Lance Barnard gave him on what ought to be the structure of the defence department by appointing him to the shadow responsibilities in the area of defence, army, navy, air and supply. As Gough Whitlam pointed out, Jim Killen, never one to miss an opening, greeted Gough's announcement by saying, `My honourable friend's idea of defence planning is to say, "Lance, take five".'
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Lance took five, he took 14—but he took ultimately, of course, the Defence portfolio. As defence minister he firmly set in place what has been the substance of national strategy since then, which is defence self&amp;hyphen;reliance. He set in place firmly the administrative coordination effectively of the Defence portfolio and was ably assisted, of course, in that regard by the secretary to his department at the time, Arthur Tange.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Lance was a prominent member of Gough Whitlam's government until the time of his diplomatic appointment. Gough revealed something at that eulogy which I had not known and I do not think anybody else knew. At the time Sir Paul Hasluck left the position
         <break page="6700" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          of Governor-General, he made recommendations on who his successors might be to Gough Whitlam, and one of those recommendations was Lance Barnard. When Gough Whitlam put that to him, Lance Barnard turned it down and continued his parliamentary service. History may well have been different and somebody else may not have been giving advice to the Governor-General too at the time, had history been a little different on that front. But the point of his service which I have already mentioned is that he would have been an appropriate appointment as Governor-General because he would have enjoyed support, I think, on all sides of politics. He went on to become an ambassador and his service was distinguished in that regard.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To amplify the point I made earlier on, Malcolm Fraser appointed him to an official position in 1981. That was as Chairman of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, a tribute to the enormous strength of his sentiment in regard to service personnel, his appreciation of those who had suffered the supreme sacrifice in the service of this nation in war and his own considerable organisational and administrative abilities.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For myself, though I had met Lance many times when I was a youngster, I only got to know him really well when I was Minister for Defence. I was obliged, as I believed I must, to repeatedly pay tribute to the fact that the contemporary military strategy on which we operated was effectively laid down by Lance Barnard, and he watched very carefully the progress we made on implementing it in terms of practical detail. I was not surprised by that. What I was surprised by was the fact that I kept getting correspondence from Lance Barnard well after I left the portfolio.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I only came to understand the depth of the man's commitment to the community when I realised that these letters which kept arriving on my desk were a product of a continuing constituency work. The moment he came back from overseas and entered back into life in Launceston, he would immediately buttonhole the nearest Labor senator, secure a desk and continue, virtually five days a week, the constituency work that he had been used to in
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          the 20&amp;hyphen;odd years he was actually a member of parliament. Hence, I was not unique, as I thought I might have been because of the defence connection; all ministers were getting letters from Lance Barnard with the concerns that his constituents raised with him.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Then, when I was Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Lance Barnard turned up on my doorstep again, on this occasion as an organiser of a group training organisation, as he committed himself to the service of his constituents in a more formal way as a person actively organising training and utilising Commonwealth funds for the benefit of all.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Our condolences go out to his wife, Jill, his four children, Tricia, Suzanne, Nicholas and Jacqueline, his grandchildren and other members of the family. His death came as a profound shock to them. Though he had been ill, it was a death that was most unexpected, and a sense of unfairness and loss even deeper than normal prevails among them all. Their sorrow is shared by all of us in the Australian Labor Party. We have lost a great Australian Labor figure, a great Australian, a man whose life in many ways encapsulates all the conceivable experience an Australian might have had in the last 50 years of this century.

         Obviously Lance Barnard, coming as he did from his military service and perhaps therefore from a more conservative element of the Labor Party, had much to contribute in the defence and foreign affairs area and to carry forward that agenda in the early days of the Whitlam government. As defence minister from 1972 to 1975, he brought the three services under the one defence department, introduced some reform of retirement benefits for service personnel, promoted defence cooperation with South&amp;hyphen;East Asia, including Indonesia, revamped the CMF to become the Army Reserve and initiated the concept of an all&amp;hyphen;service defence academy, which was gradually followed through by successive governments and, of course, is ADFA today. I hope that at the next graduation at ADFA an appropriate reference might be made to the contribution made by Lance Barnard all those years ago.

Over the same period, it will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by over 100,000 tonnes annually. It will lower transport costs to and from the Northern Territory, being linked to the new port in Darwin and mineral developments in Central Australia. It is a great national project. It is a project that my government is proud to support in cooperation with the governments of South Australia and the Northern Territory.

The fund has been established to raise money for the relief of relatives and survivors of the disastrous landslip which occurred on 30 July 1997. This has been an initiative in order to financially assist those who were contributing to the rescue and providing support to the village.

The Deputy Leader of the Opposition wants the states not only to bring in death taxes, but you want them to bring in double income tax because you are arguing that they should impose a state income tax. The truth is that you do not have any credibility on tax.

          —The fact of the matter is that the personal income tax system cuts in at Australia's very low margins of average weekly earnings. Australia's top marginal rate of 47 per cent cuts in at the low level of about 1&amp;half; times average weekly earnings. What that says is that, if you are on 1&amp;half; times average earnings in this country, you will be on the top marginal income tax rate. Back in the 1950s you had to be on 19 times average weekly earnings to be on the top marginal tax rate. So obviously the personal income tax system is crying out for reform.

         The fact of the matter is this: as has been conceded by Australian Labor Party spokesmen when they have been honest enough and been given their head to speak their views, in Australia today in a modern economy if you want to reduce rates you have to broaden the base. We believe that you should broaden the base. You should broaden the base in relation to the indirect tax system and you should broaden the base in relation to the income tax system. That is the best way to ensure people pay their fair share. It is also much fairer than the Australian Labor Party.

          —The financial year ending 30 June of this year saw an all-time record export figure for Australian exporters. I congratulate the companies and businesses, large and small, the primary producers and many others involved. The figure was $104.4 billion, up 6.4 per cent. For the first time ever there is a surplus in both goods and services. Rural exports were up 6.7 per cent, non-rural exports were up 6.4 per cent and services were up 6.3 per cent. More significantly, to be fair in judging trends on these matters, Australia's market share was up as well, to a level not reached for several years, climbing to 1.16 per cent. This does reflect an outcome of positive policies to drive forward on the

         I accept that there is a great deal more that needs to be done, as the member for Parkes, the member for Mallee and others well know. There are many industries which are having great difficulty in obtaining true and fair market access. We are pushing ahead with our efforts through the market development task force to enhance market access and to have it on a fairer basis. A cable this morning confirms further progress with the Philippines and Thailand in relation to dairy products and a reduction in tariffs into Thailand from 25 per cent to five per cent on a particularity of exports from Australia to Thailand. The citrus industry is hard pressed at this time. Fifty-two per cent of the citrus industry's dollar effort each year is now being exported—full credit to the citrus industry as it seeks to engage with the region and with the world by expanding its export effort.

         Above all else, this figure of $104.4 billion represents a lot of jobs right here in Australia. To quote the ABS: 345,000 jobs in Australia are underpinned by our exports to Japan, our largest market. It makes a great deal of sense for the government to provide continuing assistance, especially to greenfield exporters and small businesses getting into exports for the first time. Hence, the export market development grant scheme continues to provide allocations to companies, large and small, to get on with the job. That will be continuing to put our exporters on the front foot. Congratulations to our exporters on an outstanding performance.

My quote is short enough. I will tell you in eight words what taxation reform is about: less tax, fairer tax, more trade, more jobs.

          These very straightforward and significant facts for Australian young people illustrate the absolute falsity of the campaign of misrepresentation that the Labor Party and the member for Werriwa, in particular, are undertaking around the country. The Labor Party ran down Australia's apprenticeship system as every member of this House knows. In 1995 the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the work force was the lowest for three decades.

          Last week I launched the government's national campaign to promote the new national apprenticeship system to employers and young people. Employers, students, job seekers and parents can ring a 1800 number to find out about the benefits of new apprenticeships. Already there have been more than 3,000 inquiries to this hotline. The message for employers is a very clear and straightforward one: new apprenticeships are easier to access, they are more responsive to the needs of your business and they will help your business become more productive and competitive. They are a key component of this government's visionary strategy to prepare Australia for the 21st century. They will give young people a valuable head start. It will enable them to earn while they learn and will lead to a rewarding career based on industry recognised qualifications.

         Of course, this overwhelming response makes the Leader of the Opposition feel very uncomfortable indeed because, as we remember, he led his party into a complete dead end on work for the dole and had to perform the biggest backflip that this parliament has seen.

         This is a pretty fair measure. If you are an employee and you are saving for your retirement, there are tax advantages through superannuation for you to do so, and that is fair enough. We support that; of course we do. If you are in small business, though, you cannot afford to put money into superannuation, and the reason you cannot afford to put money into superannuation is that you are putting all your last dollars into your business.

         As a parliament we support people who are prepared to take a punt, to take a risk, to invest in their businesses and to give other people a job. We reckon, therefore, it is only fair enough for a person who has built up their nest egg, which is their small business, that when they retire there should be some equity of treatment in the capital gains tax system for those small business people. And so it was. It was a great tax reform announcement when the Prime Minister announced
         <break page="6715" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          that, as from 1 July this year, small business owners will be exempt from capital gains tax on the first $500,000 of proceeds from the sale of a small business if those proceeds are to be used to fund retirement.

         I say to the Labor Party: we will fight tooth and nail this decision of yours to effectively scrap that program by cutting the benefit down to $250,000, or to do a deal with the Democrats for $150,000. And, I'll tell you what, we will have the whole small business community of this country out against you, because it demonstrates that you are not interested in small business; in fact, you stand in the way of a decent deal for small business, and we will not let you forget it.

          —Mr Speaker, on a point of order: there is a clear&amp;hyphen;cut provision here for matters where you have been personally misrepresented. What the Treasurer has just done is to say blatantly that he intends to enter a debate on that point. He has not identified that he has been misrepresented. He confirmed that fact in the statement he made when he claimed that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had called for death duties, and he now wishes to explain why he said that. The point is, therefore, that he has confirmed that he has been misrepresented.

        There are two forms of benefits for ex&amp;hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&amp;hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&amp;hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.

Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&amp;hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.

         The Petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that under the Quarantine (Animals) Regulations of the Quarantine Act 1908, approval is given for the importation of free ranging exotic animals such as lions, tigers, bears, elephants and non&amp;hyphen;human primates to be used for entertainment purposes in circuses and mobile displays. The issue of circuses using animals is very complex and includes: Transportation of animals, where the animals are kept in tiny cages, often travelling in extremes of temperature over long periods; stressful training techniques, often based on fear, deprivation and brutality and often inhumane living conditions, which do not allow any display of instinctual behaviours. We also believe that inappropriate messages are put forward by forcing wild animals to perform circus tricks. It is certainly not consistent with the focus on environmental awareness for people, especially children to learn that it is acceptable to exploit wild animals for human entertainment. We therefore humbly ask that the House prohibit the importation of all animals including those listed under CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) for use in both international and Australian circuses. We ask this based upon the inhumane conditions that the animals are kept in, the conditions under which the animals are transported, the often cruel training procedures, and the inappropriate messages conveyed to children by forcing wild animals to perform circus tricks.

         It was thought that we would have to wait until the follow-up spring testing program for a decision to be made on the presence of fire blight.

         Over the last 18 months they believe, and so do I, that that reputation has been questioned with a number of near miss pest incursions. The Nairn report, which was brought down recently, was looking into some of the problems faced by primary producers when dealing with AQIS, but this government is not prepared to address the fact that AQIS has tended to take the law into its own hands. One of the findings revealed that, over the last 25 years, the rate of incursions of plant pests and diseases was about 10 times more than that of animals; further, that there was a lack of confidence in the process of risk analysis.

         Earlier in the year it was found that, by some mysterious means, fire blight had somehow been introduced to the Melbourne and Adelaide botanical gardens. Tests on samples by Victoria's Institute of Horticultural Development, Macquarie University and Germany's Max Planck Horticultural Research Institute showed that the disease detected in the gardens was fire blight. The question which has not been answered is how the devil it got there. Are we to think that another nation is trying to sabotage our disease&amp;hyphen;free status and reputation; and why? Who would gain out of this?

         On a recent trip to New Zealand the question was raised—and I did not get any satisfactory answers. I was disappointed with some of the dismissive responses. A thorough investigation of the major fruit growing regions of Victoria and South Australia found no further trace of the disease. They were finally given the all clear in June.

         A media release on 19 June from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) said that he `regretted that fire blight had now finally been confirmed as present on a very limited number of ornamental host plants'. He continued:

         In the meantime producers had to suffer a three&amp;hyphen; or four&amp;hyphen;week ban on the interstate movement of fruit. Tasmanian growers who were just about to launch a trial shipment of Fuji apples to Japan had to abandon the attempt this year. Japanese buyers were so concerned at the reports of the disease they ordered one of their inspectors down to Tasmania to inspect the orchards thoroughly for evidence of fire blight. But they found nothing that would give them concern and gave the orchards a clean bill of health.

It has also delayed the entry of apples into the Japanese market by a year at the minimum because of the very strict controls they have there and the fact that we have another period of testing to come in spring. Tasmanians are also uncertain on what would happen should the spring testing discover some new evidence of fire blight on the mainland. Would they then be exposed to imports that could cause our industry in Tasmania to be threatened?

         There was a credibility problem because of the possible  actions of another country. Compensation should be given, but it will not replace the doubt now made in an emerging market.

We need much stronger controls at points of entry into this country and strong penalties for those caught.

         The government has decided to formalise and upgrade AQIS disease risk assessment processes for imports, but whether this works properly in practice and whether this is enough remains to be seen. I believe that this botanic gardens incident needs to be settled. The only way that this can really be answered is to have a full and open inquiry. I do not think we can risk our industries by not having such an inquiry. We need to clean the air, and we need to have an open inquiry to do that.

         In the meantime we must be constantly vigilant to ensure that this country keeps its market edge by being disease free. It is not good enough to give lip-service to quarantine measures and then find they are not working. Growers want certainty, they want security and they want to be able to expand without fear of another country sabotaging their work.

         I hope that the final report on the importation of New Zealand apples will recommend a definite no. I am also concerned about the reports of apple juice concentrate coming in from China. It may also have a consequence for our growers here, but that will be another battle. I ask all sides of the House to support this motion to give the growers of Australia some faith in the political system.

         For many, especially for those across the Tasman, this issue may seem to be simply about a trade dispute, but nothing could be further from the truth. This issue is all about the rights of an industry to be protected from exposure to a disease that would financially ruin it; a disease that has never been eradicated once it has taken hold in orchards or nurseries. It is also about the rights of rural communities dependent on pome fruit to continue to exist. They need to exist with populations big enough and with enough financial freeboard so their schools, churches and service centres can survive.

         This issue is about the rights of populations and the natural environment to be protected from unnecessary levels of chemical application. It is about managing the water tables in the Goulburn and Murray valleys so future generations can continue to farm and the natural environment does not experience worsening salinity. This is also about giving our industry some means of defence when confronted with unfounded disparagement, which turns consumers away from their products. In short, this issue is not about trade. It is about minimising the risk of the virulent Erwinia amylovera bacteria crossing the Tasman on fresh apples and infecting our very healthy and disease&amp;hyphen;free pome fruit industry.

         When I was in New Zealand in June with the member for Lyons, key New Zealand industry spokesmen defended the extraordinary action of their scientists, the first of whom stole cuttings from the Melbourne botanic gardens before he announced that we had fire blight in this country. They argued in New Zealand that Australia had nothing to fear from fire blight infection. They said that
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          their apple industry had grown since the disease had first become established in the early 1900s. That is in fact true. Their apple industry is in pretty reasonable shape right now.

         Having heard the New Zealanders express their amazement that we would be worried about this disease incursion, I asked the New Zealanders to comment on the condition of their pear industry. The New Zealanders had little to say about their pears. The problem is that pears are highly susceptible to apple and pear fire blight. Because of this susceptibility New Zealand has a very small pear industry.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In my electorate of Murray, we have the only substantial pear production in Australia. We grow 86 per cent of Australia's pears. Of those, most are Packhams and Bartletts, and those are the varieties that are most susceptible to being infected with apple and pear fire blight. There are seven major apple growing regions throughout Australia and only one region with a pear industry—and that happens to be my electorate of Murray.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Goulburn and Murray valleys have two canneries, Ardmona and SPC. They depend to a very large extent on the pear industry. They use the juices as the base for a lot of their products, and they are forever finding more innovative ways to use the pears that we grow that are sent to our domestic and export markets.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         ABARE has calculated that, while 20 per cent of the apple industry would be lost if orchards were infected with apple and pear fire blight—and 20 per cent, of course, is devastation enough—the loss to the pear industry would be well over 50 per cent. This would mean the end of the small fruit growing and manufacturing communities in the Goulburn and Murray valleys. It would have multiplier effects on the transport, manufacturing and service sectors.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In effect, it would mean an impoverishment of the industry in the short term and then years of establishing alternative industries across our Goulburn and Murray valleys. Of course, all of this is totally avoidable if we make sure that we minimise the risk of exposing our industries to fresh pome fruit

         We are especially vulnerable in Australia, and in particular in the Goulburn and Murray valleys, because we have the climate and the humidity levels that are optimal for the spread of apple and pear fire blight. We have the clay soils, the rainfall and the warmth that apparently this bacteria thrives in. We have been protected so far because we are an island continent, and we hope that protection would go on forever. We would be insane to invite that protection to be willingly violated by importing thousands of tonnes of fresh apples from a country that is well and truly infected with the disease.

         The way that we irrigate in the Goulburn and Murray valleys makes us vulnerable to the disease spread should it reach our shores. In these valleys we have very high watertables.

         We have moved from furrow, or flood irrigation of the orchards, to first drip and now aerosol sprays. Unfortunately, we have been told by the experts that the aerosol sprays, by setting up turbulence in the air, are one of the best ways to spread this tiny micro&amp;hyphen;organism. So we are advised that we would have to go back to the more damaging irrigation practices of earlier eras if this disease became established.

         We have to be low cost producers in Australia to compete domestically with low cost product that comes into this country, and to export.

These twigs were also to test positive for some bacterial infection. The jury is still out about exactly what it was that infected those twigs. It seems that there may have been some non&amp;hyphen;virulent strain of apple and pear fire blight.

          —Developments since the motion on the importation of New Zealand apples was presented on 3 March have seen parts of this motion outdated. However, the specific issue it deals with—namely, fire blight and the opening up of our markets to New Zealand apples—remains of vital importance to Australia.

         Fire blight—the scourge of any apple and pear industry—is the horticultural equivalent of foot and mouth disease. This bacteria thrives in warmer months and reduces yields by infecting individual fruit, blossoms and trees. In extreme cases, the disease destroys entire orchards.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Once established, fire blight is almost impossible to cure. Its symptoms are treatable only by an expensive antibiotic which is not available in Australia and is not wanted because it adds another unknown dimension to the artificial control of disease in our primary industry and has obvious impacts on the environment—even by the secondary route of the need, as the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) pointed out, to incredibly increase our water regime once more and contribute to, in her case, the further salination of the Murray-Darling Basin.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If fire blight takes hold in Australia, it threatens to devastate our apple and pear industries and contribute more to the degradation of our environment. On one estimate, the disease would cut output in these industries by $922 million over the next six years, interfere with interstate trade, damage our growing export markets and lead to thousands of job losses directly and to many more in associated industries.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         While 34 countries in the world are fire blight declared, until earlier this year Australia was thought to be free of the disease. I believe it is still essentially free. But it all changed with the coincidental and, dare I say, controversial discovery in May of the dreaded disease in Melbourne and Adelaide botanic gardens. It was coincidental because the discoveries were made just as AQIS was in the throes of recommending rejection of a
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          New Zealand application to export apples to Australia; and it was controversial because the discoveries were made by two New Zealand scientists—supposedly in Australia on holidays—who happened to stumble across the disease in these popular public gardens. Since this discovery, the disease has been confirmed as fire blight, but perhaps not the most virulent strain, by Australian and German scientists.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         At this stage—and luckily—the outbreak is thought to have been confined to the two botanic gardens sites. The fruit growing regions of Victoria and South Australia have been given the all clear, but not before suffering greatly from bans being placed on their produce by their northern neighbours while, as the member for Lyons (Mr Adams) indicated, the Tasmanian Fuji export opportunity to Japan has been lost for this year at least.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For the sake of the industry, and especially for the hundreds of apple and pear growers and nurseries in my electorate of Calare, I sincerely hope AQIS is correct in predicting the disease has been contained or eradicated. But we will not know that until well after spring. However, in the meantime, the question remains: what is to be done about the importation of apples from New Zealand? According to AQIS, no final decision will be made on New Zealand's application until the full extent of the disease in Australia is confirmed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are three possible outcomes: firstly, the survey will confirm the disease; secondly, it will find that the disease remains in the botanic gardens but has been contained; or, thirdly, it will show that the disease has in fact broken out. Undoubtedly, New Zealand is now in the process of compiling its response to our refusal, pending AQIS's final decision, and anxiously—if not maliciously—hoping that the spring survey confirms the disease has not been contained so they can argue that their apples should be let in.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Regardless of the outcome, the government's preliminary decision to reject New Zealand's application should remain as is. Even if the disease has not been contained to the botanic garden sites, fire blight is not widespread in Australia. At most, it will be
         <break page="6731" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          restricted to some areas of Victoria and South Australia. Because of this, our internal quarantine measures should be able to restrict its spread.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I do not envy the government's position but trust that, with the Nairn review and the botanic gardens scare, measures will be put in place to ensure fire blight is eradicated and kept out of Australia for good. We must not allow this to be interpreted as a chink in our quarantine wall, with the wall therefore having to be demolished. That would suit New Zealand and other countries determined to infect the mythical level playing field with every disease under the sun. AQIS's decision to reject New Zealand's application was the correct one. Under no circumstances should the government allow New Zealand apples into Australia. I commend the member for Lyons's motion to the House.

Ever since the legendary garden of Eden story, it would seem that the apple has been a fruit surrounded in controversy—and never more acutely than in 1997 when the whole question of what would happen to the Australian apple industry emerged, as the member for Calare (Mr Andren) and the member for Lyons (Mr Adams) have said, following the alleged finding of fire blight in botanic gardens in both Victoria and Adelaide.

         I rise as a member of the government because the one thing I fear out of the motion by the member for Lyons is that it implies that in some way the government is going to take a more relaxed view of quarantine following this discovery of what may or may not have been fire blight in the botanic gardens of Adelaide and Melbourne than it did prior to that. I want to reassure the member for Lyons and, if necessary, the member for Calare—they have both been very objective in their remarks—and the entire House that there is no way in which the government considers quarantine and quarantine standards negotiable in order to achieve particular trade outcomes.
        </para>

         The government's record on quarantine is an excellent one. The very fact that the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          government rejected the 1996 New Zealand application for the import of New Zealand apples into Australia indicates how serious the government is about quarantine. The government sees its quarantine standards as non&amp;hyphen;negotiable. We all do the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) a gross disservice if we run any sort of debate that suggests that he is relaxing his view on quarantine. Quite the contrary is the case. He is the minister who has committed an additional $76 million to tidying up and strengthening the role of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. The government will not be sacrificing its conservative approach to quarantine for any trade reasons at all.

        <para first-indent="16">
         What the House has to realise is this: the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has no choice in whether or not New Zealand apples or any other apples come into Australia. The determination as to whether or not our country is open to the import of apples is entirely pivoted on the outcome of the scientific evaluation of risk. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is caught in that scientific evaluation. We have already declared the import of New Zealand apples, on two occasions at least, as posing a risk and, to the credit of the ministers of the time—including the present minister—said no on those grounds.

In Townsville and Rockhampton the operations have been progressively wound down over the past 15 years. A lot of the facilities are still there these days, but in the case of ABC television facilities they are essentially mothballed, and they have been for years—for 10 years that I can vouch for.

         Essentially, what we have from the ABC's senior management is a Sydney&amp;hyphen;Melbourne&amp;hyphen;centric approach. To them, Brisbane is a regional area and anything outside of Sydney and Melbourne is regional Australia. In fact, there is an acronym within the ABC called the BAPH states, which stands for Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Hobart. They are put into one box and Sydney and Melbourne are put into another. All of these cutbacks have nothing to do with any additional budgetary

The ABC TV journos and camera crews work just as hard as those in the commercial stations do. These ABC stalwarts, in a lot of cases, look on with anger and envy at the way Sydney and Melbourne arrange things.

Certainly the same is true for the ABC, particularly the Sydney and Melbourne people, while all the other states suffer. Places like the regions, including all parts of Australia except Sydney and Melbourne, get cut. The moguls in the Ultimo Centre make the decision to bravely sacrifice everyone else and anything else apart from themselves.

         It is very important that this motion is discussed today because it does put the pressure on the government to put the pressure on the ABC to look more closely at regional Australia to make sure that regional issues and regional programming are back in focus at the ABC. While networking may be the way of  the commercial operators—they too have started to realise that audiences are starting to turn off—they have had to start to focus on localism as a commercial operation. It is certainly the buzz word in every market around Australia as commercial operators try to prove their local credentials, but not so for the ABC, especially television and even now, unfortunately, metropolitan and regional radio.

         If the ABC is to continue to play a prominent role in providing regional dwellers with information and news services and a whole variety of services, it must be resourced sufficiently. We note that before the last election the then opposition, now the government of the day, made a very specific commitment: to maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the ABC. They have betrayed that particular commitment to the Australian people, and it is this betrayal that has caused so much concern and so much consternation for people in regional areas of Victoria and Australia.

They have been to speak to me on two occasions and have expressed their deepest concerns about the future of the ABC and its role as a national broadcaster in the wake of the funding cuts that have been announced by the government. They have asked me to bring to the attention of this parliament at every opportunity—and I am doing so here today in the context of this motion—their concern about the poor levels of morale in the ABC and the manner in which the funding cuts are eating away at the ABC's opportunity to provide the wide range of services that they have been used to in the past and have come to expect from their national broadcaster. They are extremely concerned about the capital funding cuts, which are effectively running down the ABC's capacity to deliver those services.

The show was cut by the ABC after 18 months. That suggested that there was no talent in South Australia, no expertise worth encouraging and promoting, and that all the talent and expertise was in Sydney. I am sure you, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, as a Victorian member of parliament, and the minister at the table, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), as a Queensland member of parliament, are both well aware that not all the talent in media is focused in Sydney. Sadly, many of the Sydney members of parliament believe that it is, but we know that that is not the case. No consideration was given by Professor Armstrong and David Hill to a different timeslot for

         Importantly, there are two reasons why the ABC charter should be regional. The first, of course, is that we recognise there is expertise well beyond Sydney in this area of production of media and entertainment. The second reason is that there is real talent that is worth fostering. If there is not a regional focus for the ABC, then that talent might go elsewhere. It may just dissipate and go into other forms of jobs. Unfortunately, we will lose that talent from the media and entertainment industry. So I very much support the motion moved by the member for McMillan and ask for its support in the House.

         The capacity of the ABC to serve regional Australia is predicated on the resources which it has available to it. That is the bottom line. That is why, in my view, the coalition made the solemn commitment in its document `Better communications' before the last election that it would maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the ABC. The coalition knows that, to conservative voters, the ABC is very important. It is very important to regional Australia in particular. But, despite that solemn promise, $209 million got carved off the ABC amidst all sorts of outrageous allegations to do with political bias and the like. In my experience, that was the driving agenda behind the backflip over funding to the ABC. There was an apprehension of bias, despite all of the available evidence to the contrary that the ABC is religiously balanced in its reporting of debates in this place and elsewhere.

         I believe the ABC should be sufficiently resourced, at least to the tune that the previous government resourced the ABC, so that those services to regional Australia as well as to the cities can continue to be provided. To my mind it is a little bit odd to attack the ABC and reduce its resources and then to complain bitterly when some of the services which are provided from those resources are withdrawn from areas which are likely to give rise to criticism from conservative electorates. I think it is quite strange.

         This is a motion with which I am sure no member would disagree. The ABC's charter is an outline of the purposes for which the ABC has been established and is set out under section 6 of the Australian Broadcasting Act 1983. Whilst the ABC is fully conversant with and provides for the needs of rural and regional Australia, there is no specific obligation on the ABC to cater for those needs outlined in the charter. As has been mentioned, Mr Mansfield's recommendation stated that a revised charter emphasised the importance of providing services to regional Australia.

         Of all the submissions made to the Mansfield inquiry, 19.9 per cent considered that services relevant to rural and remote communities are an important part of the ABC's operations. Given the tyranny of distance we face in Australia, many people in regional and remote areas of the country find the ABC their link to the rest of Australia and their only means of receiving regular and accurate news about their community, their state, their nation and the wider world. I note that the charter states that the corporation quite rightly
         <break page="6737" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          takes account of the multicultural character of the Australian community, and I say that is a necessary clause, given our multicultural society.

         My electorate of Stirling is a fine example of the diverse mix of cultures within our nation. It takes great pride in both the ABC and SBS. Given that we are talking about the services provided by the ABC to regional Australia, SBS also needs to be considered for extension to major regional centres in Western Australia such as Geraldton and Albany, which are not provided with the luxury, if you can call it that, enjoyed by similar centres on the eastern seaboard.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, given that the charter provides a specific clause for the corporation to take account of the nation's multicultural character, there is no reason why it should not include a specific reference in the charter emphasising the importance of servicing regional Australia, to reflect  Australia's regional and cultural diversity. Our nation and our nation's character are not just built in Melbourne or Sydney or Canberra; the real character of Australia is found in our regions, where our nation fully developed. Our regions—I include Perth in that term because Perth is too often neglected by those living east of the rabbit-proof fence—are the pillars on which our nation's character is built. It is essential, therefore, that the nation's broadcaster specifically emphasises in its charter the importance of servicing regional Australia and ensuring that the services of the ABC reflect Australia's regional and cultural diversity.

For example, its science programming, its science reporting, is of particular significance to the ABC.

But this government is no friend of the ABC. One only needs look at its recent budget decisions to draw that very obvious conclusion. The amount of money which has been taken from the ABC's budget in the two budgets of this government speaks volumes for this government's commitment to the ABC. It simply is not there. Indeed, leaked cabinet documents imply that the only
         <break page="6738" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         When the Mansfield inquiry took place, the public response was so strong—I think even Mansfield was overwhelmed by it—that the importance of the ABC to Australia came home very firmly to this government and, instead of withdrawing the $100 million or so that it intended to withdraw, it ended up removing somewhat less. The ABC ended up below the adequate threshold of funding which even Mansfield recommended. That has ensured that the ABC has had to gradually withdraw some services. The funding is simply not there.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Mansfield had some important recommendations about the ABC being an independent news generator. I think they are vital. He also, though, unfortunately, recommended the ABC should get out of programming and should cease on the whole to produce programs for domestic consumption. I think that is a grave mistake. It withdraws cultural input from this country which we will not get from the commercial stations or from pay TV and it removes a whole creative infrastructure from the public sector which otherwise would be able to provide a very substantial lead to those in the Australian community who want to follow that.

         One other vital thing which I would like to talk about in the minutes remaining is the proposal to virtually close down Radio Australia. When the Mansfield report first came out it was very clear that Radio Australia was on the chopping block. It has now been partially saved by decisions of the ABC board—not by decisions of this government, which was prepared to stand by and watch Radio Australia effectively close down. For some $13 million this government was prepared to sacrifice a vital link that Australia has not to regional Australia but to the region in which we live in the world—a vital region for us culturally and in trade terms, and very much a region where the ABC and voice of Radio Australia are well respected.

          —I rise in the grievance debate today to bring to the notice of the parliament the public split between the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) over cabinet's decision to withdraw federal funding support for the ACT heroin trial. I believe it mirrors the indecision, the confusion and the deep differences which exist among Australians about how best to combat the nation's tragic heroin problem.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Now that the Prime Minister has extinguished all hope of a trial going ahead, the question which now must be asked is: where to from here? Whichever direction the government decides to proceed in, whatever proposals the minister for health is considering following the recent review of the national drug strategy, for the sake of this nation's battle against heroin and for the sake of the public's confidence in that battle three steps must now be taken.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         First, the minister for health must tackle cabinet for an increase in the amount of money spent on the national drug strategy. I am not so naive as to imagine that every drop of money obtained from Commonwealth taxes and excise on alcohol and tobacco could, or even should, go on anti-drug education, treatment or law enforcement. However, spending only $33 million on the national drug strategy out of the roughly $4 billion collected from these avenues every year is an insult in the present climate—just as it was under the previous government.

          I hope members on the government side heard that last comment. We on this side of the House are not attempting to suggest, as the Prime Minister today at question time tried to indicate we were suggesting, that the heroin problem began on 2 March 1996. It is a problem that governments at all levels and of all political colours have wrestled with. It is simply now your turn, Mr Prime Minister, to deal with the matter, complete with all its associated unpleasantries.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Secondly, the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) has to win a few battles of his own. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has pointed out, the Australian Federal Police budget has been cut by $37.6 million over the last two years. The force is expected to lose over 100 agents between now and the year 2000 as a result of these cuts. Despite the Prime Minister's denials today, these are the facts.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          A number of other departments under the Attorney-General's responsibility have also had their budgets slashed—the National Crime Authority, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and AUSTRAC, the agency responsible for targeting money laundering operations. What do we hear from the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General in defending them? It is up to the Attorney-General to win that funding back so that these departments can operate efficiently.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Thirdly and finally, if the failure to get the ACT heroin trial up and running has taught us anything it is the crucial importance of getting broad public support for something as delicate and as significant as devising new and better strategies to combat the current heroin plague. To my mind, the best means of achieving this—as I have said countless times before in this House—is to start by holding a national drug summit. Whichever direction we take in our fight against heroin we need to keep the public thoroughly informed. We all know with how much cynicism and suspicion the Australian public regard politicians and the decision making process.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In relation to the ACT heroin trials, many people had the feeling, whether valid or not, that they were having the legal prescription of heroin thrust down their throats—and this by
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           politicians who had spent the last 30 years stressing to them the associated evils of the heroin trade. I suggest that many may feel the same frustration about the Prime Minister's faceless and nameless `task force', to which he referred in question time today. The Prime Minister is in danger of making the same mistakes as those in charge of the ACT heroin trial if he does not somehow involve the Australian people in the search for solutions.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          A national drug summit is all about keeping the public up to date with whatever new strategies are on the table and thereby shutting out that cynicism and suspicion. It is about making any discussion or decision making process completely transparent. It is about bringing the public along with the policy makers when they choose the new steps we need to take to carry our fight against heroin into the 21st century.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The Prime Minister and the minister for health would, of course, set some parameters for the summit to work within. Those who lobbied for the ACT heroin trial should face the fact that, for better or worse, the issue now seems to be well and truly off the agenda; to discuss it any further at the summit would be a waste of time. Let those assembled discuss other options—options that perhaps could prove even more effective than the heroin trial may ever have been. Let those attending channel their energies into these areas and we may find that some level of consensus is actually possible.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Once again let me make it clear to this House: a national drug summit is not about hollow gestures. It is not about political grandstanding. It is not about trying to make one side of politics look more decisive or convincing than the other—a crime the Prime Minister, I might add, would like to smear the opposition as being guilty of. Nor is it something that private individuals or organisations, however well intentioned, can organise off their own bats. It is something that must enjoy the active participation of this country's Prime Minister if it is to have any real meaning.
          <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
           It is about making sure that the public feel confident that not only are society's leaders—politicians and non-politicians alike—coming up with more effective means

          This being the case, one question demands answering: why have the Prime Minister and the minister for health previously been so ready to reject the idea of a national drug summit? When I was the first person in this parliament to put a summit to both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Family Services, their responses were immediately dismissive. It was a knee-jerk reaction to a suggestion they cynically suspected as springing from ulterior political motives rather than genuine concern. The language they used to describe a national summit was indicative of this—`wasteful of resources,' they called it; `unnecessary'; `a cheap stunt'; `window dressing'—yet state Premiers as diverse as Bob Carr and Richard Court have now been giving their support to a summit.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Why? It is my belief that it is because the Carr and Court governments are on the front line of the heroin tragedy. Over half the heroin related deaths in Australia last year were in New South Wales. In Western Australia, the heroin trade has exploded out of all proportion with that state's population. Both the New South Wales and Western Australian governments are fighting a losing battle with limited police numbers and even more limited health resources. I am sure both have different views on the ways to tackle heroin, but they both see the need for a sea change in this nation's approach to the drug and the role that a national drug summit could play in bringing this about.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          What of the Prime Minister's continued indifference, despite his comments today in question time? I suspect the Prime Minister's reticence springs from the fact that perhaps he still sees the heroin problem as something happening on only a limited scale in some outlying suburbs of metropolitan Australia and therefore is not worthy of such a national response. Such a view is misguided in the extreme.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Let me repeat my position again for the Prime Minister's benefit. My area of Sydney,
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           like others around Australia, is experiencing a heroin plague which I do not think he or any other member can fully appreciate or comprehend from pictures merely carried in the morning newspapers or on the evening news. It is a tragedy that can be fully digested only after visiting in person an area like mine. The statistics on the number of heroin related deaths each year do not tell the whole story, however distressing they may be. Read the numbers and they are forgotten the next day, but talk to a 16&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old kid on the street who is already an addict and it is a haunting moment that cannot help but spur you into action.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I noticed the Minister for Health and Family Services, while in damage control mode last week, attempt to draw the focus away from the heroin problem and place it on the far greater number of people dying from tobacco related causes in Australia each year. To this I say to him: yes, Health Minister, tobacco does cause more deaths but, to be blunt, I don't see tobacco destroying and dividing families in my electorate beyond repair and turning out kids of 11 and 12 who, once you look into their eyes, you realise aren't kids any more.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I have invited the Prime Minister to join me in visiting Cabramatta and Fairfield to see for himself the effect that heroin has had on the area—I heard him talking about drug workers `at the coalface' today—but I still have not received a reply from him. I extend the invitation to him again publicly in this House. I will be happy to show the Prime Minister the real war on drugs first&amp;hyphen;hand, and it is a depressing sight. As members on the other side who have seen it with their own eyes know, it is a battle that we are losing. If the Prime Minister would prefer not to visit with me, I can accept that, but the important thing is that he goes—and soon. If he cannot go to Cabramatta and Fairfield, I suggest he goes to Collingwood or Footscray in Melbourne, Inala in Brisbane or Northbridge in Perth. I can almost guarantee we will see some quick action after such a visit. Should he go, I am sure the Prime Minister would not need a task force to convince him of the merits of a national drug summit.

           I do not doubt the Prime Minister when he says he is as concerned as the next Australian about the evils of heroin. To a degree, I share his reticence about the ACT heroin trials. I am also glad to see that now he is at least open to the suggestion of a national drug summit. I wonder what could have changed his mind? But, that said, it is simply not good enough for the Prime Minister to knock the heroin trial on the head without putting forward any alternative suggestions on reinvigorating the nation's fight against heroin. It is simply not good enough that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Family Services continue to respond so coolly and with such detachment to something as positive as a national drug summit. It is a proposal with enormous merit.

         One of the gravest mistakes that has affected many Western governments in the post&amp;hyphen;war period is the elevation of economics from a discipline into an ideology with all the immutability of a closed religion. The implications of this error have been most evident in the 1980s and 1990s—years which have seen governments in the Western world embrace, to varied degrees, a doctrine called economic rationalism.

         Australia has been badly served by economic rationalism, on two levels. Firstly, in terms of policy, economic rationalism is responsible for major errors. What we must remember is that markets fail all the time and yet economic rationalism decrees that everything should

          be governed by the marketplace. In large part as a result of the doctrine of economic rationalism, Australia in 1997 is less equal, less socially just, less tolerant, less compassionate and less well&amp;hyphen;governed.

         Secondly, the doctrine of economic rationalism has had an insidious effect on political debate in this country. As many commentators have pointed out, the very name economic rationalism defies dissent because to oppose economic rationalism implies that one is acting irrationally.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Like most ideologies, economic rationalism is nothing more than a set of propositions that are based not on evidence but on faith. People have been given few choices—far fewer choices than there actually are—and they have been convinced, erroneously, to accept a grossly restricted definition of the role of government. Economic rationalism has obscured our sense of what government ought to be about. People must again be convinced that governance is about the creation and maintenance of a healthy society, not simply the hands&amp;hyphen;off oversight of the economy.

         Economic rationalism is a form of extremism. At a time when other forms of extremism are discredited, it appears that economic extremism is being allowed to go unchecked. Political or social extremism is not tolerated in this country; why is it that bodies, such as the Productivity Commission, that continue to preach economic extremism are allowed to do so seemingly unquestioned by government? Why are they allowed to give their economic advice as if the economy were separate from and unrelated to the society in which it operates? It appears that employment and the effects of decisions on employment are not considerations when the economic rationalists tender their advice.

         In the run&amp;hyphen;up to the much vaunted but underperforming jobs cabinet meeting a few weeks ago the suggestion that the economic rationalists gave for reducing unemployment was to cut the minimum wage. It is pleasing that, over the last couple of months, economic rationalists' advice like that coming from the Productivity Commission is being questioned by an increasing range of parties.

A representative from a company that appeared before the Industry Commission inquiry into the TCF industries told me recently that he was concerned that the commission seemed unaware of key pieces of information concerning capital expenditure in that industry. It is not too much to expect that the Industry Commission do its homework properly and to demand the same level of efficiency from it that it demands from industry.

          How can it be that the Industry Commission is so out of step that it arrives at conclusions that are so fundamentally opposed by the vast majority of players in the industries under review and by the community at large? Even more astounding is the fact that the Industry Commission, after having its automotive recommendations so savaged, has learnt nothing from that experience and continues to make the same mistakes all over again with the TCF industries. The reason for this is that the Productivity Commission adheres to the philosophy of economic rationalism, even when the facts suggest that there needs to be an urgent rethink.

          of 7 July this year, under the headline `Economists lose sight of the real world,' commentator Tim Colebatch refutes the claims of the economist Alan Moran of the Institute of Public Affairs that low tariffs lead to low unemployment. Low tariff countries do not have lower unemployment and faster income growth. The European Union has low tariffs and average unemployment of 10.8 per cent, as Colebatch indicates. Average wages are not 50 per cent higher in the United States than Australia, as Moran has suggested; Colebatch says that they are only .25 per cent more. Average wage levels in
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           Singapore are not considerably above those in Australia; Colebatch states that the average Singaporean manufacturing worker earns about $A131 less a week than his or her Australian counterpart. Unemployment in Britain is not six per cent measured on the same basis as Australia, as Moran suggests; in 1996 the average was 8.2 per cent, and seven per cent in April. What these points demonstrate is that in economics, as in all other fields, there are facts and there are opinions.

          In the Productivity Commission Bill 1996, under its general policy guidelines, the commission is supposed to recognise the interests of industries, consumers and the community that are likely to be affected by measures proposed by the commission and also to recognise the social and environmental consequences of measures proposed by the commission. I do not believe that the commission is adequately fulfilling these sections of its general policy guidelines. These guidelines seem to indicate that the commission is required to consider many aspects other than just dollar terms when making its recommendations. However, the automotive and TCF recommendations of the commission indicate that the commission has failed to live up to the guidelines set for it. It failed to consider the future of these industries and the employment effects on thousands of individual Australians.

          Just as it is of great concern that the evaluation of industry sectors is undertaken purely on an economic basis it is also of great concern that government programs are evaluated only on unit costs and dollar costs to budget. This neglects the social implications and benefits of the programs.

          There needs to be development of a formula which takes into account the social benefits and costs of decisions in other portfolio areas. For example, studies show that unemployed people have a greater reliance on the use of health services when they are unemployed. When axing programs like labour market programs that give unemployed people hope, the implications for the health budget are not taken into consideration. Alternatively, the positive financial implications for the health
          <break page="6745" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

Therefore, the existence of this blind faith that `the market can cure all' does not take into consideration that the types of markets that operate in those regions will not have the ability to recover from great job losses in the TCF industry.

          Since that speech in the parliament, I have been the recipient of much correspondence from the Cash Converters group, which is the self&amp;hyphen;confessed largest player in the industry. Together with their spin doctors, Cash Converters have sought various meetings with me and challenged the validity of my claims. They have organised letter campaigns by their franchisees and generally pulled out all stops in attempting to cause me to back off in my push to clean up the industry. They have gone so far as to have my own colleagues contact me, telling me that it would be `politically unwise' to continue with this issue.

          I subsequently received a letter from the managing director of Cash Converters which purports to be a response to my criticisms. The contents of that letter should not, and cannot, go unchallenged. The statements made in my previous speech and in the Donnelly report, which I tabled, demonstrate a good comprehension of Cash Converters Pty Ltd's accounts, despite the statement by the directors that my report displayed ignorance of Cash Converters' accounts, and their statement that the `whole business comprises a franchise chain of independently owned stores'.

          Cash Converters claim that they have nothing to hide. To the contrary, they have a great deal to hide. On 9 March 1997, in the Perth

          newspaper, Brian Cummins stated that Cash Converters made `more than 60,000 transactions per week in Australia alone', and that `about one per cent of these involve stolen goods'—that is, 600 stolen goods transactions per week, or 31,200 stolen goods transactions per year. The value of the stolen goods transactions processed by Cash Converters, allowing a conservative valuation of $500 per stolen item—based on the value of the item, not the Cash Converters purchase price—is $300,000 per week, or $15 million per year.

          In addition, a very conservative three per cent of Cash Converters transactions are unreported stolen goods—that is, goods stolen by family members and not reported to the authorities; these amount to an approximate $45 million per annum.

          Neither I nor Mr Donnelly ever stated that the 135 completely independent franchise stores were involved in money laundering. Even on the evidence of disclosed accounts, huge amounts of cash have been injected into Cash Converters businesses, always provided that they have been stores in which Brian Cummins has had a personal financial interest. This happened systematically during the company's expansion in Victoria during 1991. As happened then, the managing director of the trading company, Brian Cummins, lent or invested cash sums totalling not less than $634,043.62 in Cash Converters stores at Dandenong, Moonee Ponds, Preston, Clayton and Forest Hill—all of them stores in which he was financially involved. Cash Converters have said that these were his own funds and not the company funds.

         <para first-indent="16">
          You then have to ask the question: how did the cash injections by Brian Cummins in the Forest Hill store become a loan from Cash Converters Pty Ltd? In relation to this store alone, I also want to know: why are there significant differences in the treatment of the cash outstanding, as well as the cost of goods sold, and the baseline profit between the cash books and the prepared accounts for the period to the end of February 1993? Why also have the cost of goods and the purchases been manipulated to reflect 50.5 per cent of sales? Actual purchases through the cash books indicate a difference in costs paid for purchases that varies by some $45,000 over an eight-month period. And why are there discrepancies in the taxation return for 1992—which was also prepared by the `associated' auditing and accounting firm; namely, why was the taxable profit less than the accounting records?

          I believe the process of stripping Cash Converters public facade to reveal their true face has begun, and that it is time for their franchisees, their investors, as well as the authorities and the government to stand up and eliminate cancers in our society, like Cash Converters, by ensuring the introduction of proper corporation laws regulating franchises and fully protecting franchisees. In the document which I will seek leave to table in just a few moments, I have gone through some background on this fairly extensively. In the House earlier this year I made the statement that 70 per cent of Victorian franchisees have failed.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Cash Converters have responded, in response 5.1, which I have detailed in all of the documents I have to table, that this is simply false. Out of all the stores opened in Victoria since Cash Converters started in that state, two were closed by consent because they were located in small towns whose population could not support a franchise store. A further two were closed by reason of serious breaches of the franchise agreement by the franchisee. These too were replaced with new stores. Three were closed as part of a settlement of litigation in which Cash Converters terminated the subfranchisor agreement for Victoria so that it could manage that state directly. There are 23 stores open and trading, including all the stores opened there save for the seven mentioned.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Now for the facts. My statement `nearly 70 per cent of their Victorian franchises have failed' made in parliament on 5 March this year is correct. CCIL's statement that there are 23 Victorian stores open and trading is incorrect. In June this year another Cash Converters store in Victoria—namely, Ferntree Gully—was placed in the hands of the receivers leaving 22 stores in Victoria. `Open and trading' does not mean the Victorian stores are successful.

           Before exemplifying my statement, according to the Collins Australian Gem English Dictionary `fail' means `be unsuccessful; stop operating or working; be below the norm; become bankrupt'. In addition to the seven stores already mentioned, in the last 12 months three Cash Converters stores went into liquidation. Prior to this, six stores controlled by Tony Cummins—who is now bankrupt—were sold at basement prices or for no consideration. One store is refusing to renew its franchise. Eight stores are struggling to break even. A minimum of 78 per cent of Victorian Cash Converters stores have failed.

           In New South Wales the position is similar. Five to six Cash Converters franchisees are in dire straits, 10 to 13 Cash Converters franchisees are breaking even; two Cash Converters franchisees are doing well; and the position is unknown for approximately eight to 10 Cash Converters franchisees. Many franchisees in New South Wales and Victoria have been endeavouring to sell their stores for many months without success.

The sad fact is that that is the case but there are a few people who gain employment through a variety of United Nations employment, health and educational programs on the camp site.

Finally, the unfortunate decision of the PLO on the Gulf War led to significant assaults on Palestinian workers who had been working in Saudi Arabia and other parts of the Middle East.

The United Nations has recently detailed that the restrictions on the work rights of Palestinians in Israel last year led to a jump in unemployment amongst Palestinians from 19 per cent to 32 per cent; a deterioration of the gross national product in the Palestinian area of eight per cent; and the reduction of the Palestinians' average wage from $411 a month to $370 a month.

         Again, on 15 July—more recently—there was a resolution condemning Israel for failing to comply with ES&amp;hyphen;10/2 and deploring Israel's lack of cooperation. It involved recommending to member states that they `actively discourage activities which directly contribute to any construction or development of Israeli settlements' and also demanding that Israel make available to member states the necessary information about goods produced or manufactured in the illegal settlements of Israel. The vote was 131 in favour, with 14 abstentions. What we are seeing is a very sad deterioration of the credibility of this country in regard to a crucial junction in the peace process.

There are a number of arguments as to why this organisation should be the unquestioned representative of the Palestinian people. It is essentially the parliament. Support for it at this stage would act as a further encouragement for the Israeli government to understand that the world wants a solution to this problem and that the world wants a solution to the conditions of the Palestinian refugees throughout the region.

          —In the past few weeks two studies have been completed in my electorate of Murray in northern Victoria which have evaluated the health related services available to our population. The first was commissioned by the Goulburn Valley Division of General Practice and the second was a report on the support needs of

           teenage mothers in Shepparton. Both of those reports were government funded.

         The health professionals shortage in rural Australia has been well understood and acknowledged by this government, and there are policies in place to try to redress the maldistribution of health professionals. At last we have a government that understands the issues and is moving beyond the rhetoric to on the ground action. But I want to remind the House tonight of the realities of the everyday struggle of too many country people as they try to access health services. Metropolitan populations, living five minutes from a choice of clinics, may have little idea of the frustrations of the young mothers, the elderly and the poor, who have to overcome the impacts of the shortage of doctors and the lack of competition for medical service provision.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let me begin by reminding you that the electorate of Murray is not in remote Australia. The largest city, Shepparton, is less than two hours drive from Melbourne. The region is growing in population, size and productivity, but incomes are low—as in most of rural Australia. There are 6,000 Kooris in the community, and 45 per cent of the population is of non&amp;hyphen;English speaking background.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the City of Greater Shepparton, the most affluent part of the electorate, nearly half of the households have incomes below $25,000. In the census figures just released, nearly 23 per cent of all Shepparton men, aged between 25 and 44, earned less than $15,600. Despite this, there is virtually no access to bulk&amp;hyphen;billing in the electorate of Murray to cover the up&amp;hyphen;front costs of visits to a doctor. As well, after&amp;hyphen;hours GP service is virtually non&amp;hyphen;existent.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Each summer, some 10,000 fruit pickers pour into the Goulburn and Murray valleys to harvest the season's fruit. Many of these workers also have minimal disposable incomes. They, too, are confronted with up&amp;hyphen;front payments for GP visits and only the local hospital emergency outpatients option for after&amp;hyphen;hours treatment of their sunburn, cuts and sprains.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is estimated that 70 per cent of the Koori population is not accessing medical services at the moment, despite the near universal
         <break page="6750" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          problem of diabetes in the adult male population, the low birth weight of the Koori babies, the incidence of heart disease and asthma, and the rates of Hepatitis B and C and so on.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I have already said that over 50 per cent of the region's families have annual incomes below $25,000. Most of the small towns in the electorate do not have a Medicare office, and it takes up to three weeks to claim a rebate. If two or three children in your family need medical attention at once, and each is charged in the order of a $30 fee, this creates a significant cash flow crisis for families. The poor sometimes have to weigh up whether they can afford to go to the doctor when they also have an immediate need to buy a child's shoes or winter clothing, or to pay for school excursions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is one doctor in the Shepparton area, which includes some 40,000 people, who bulk&amp;hyphen;bills, but a substantial up&amp;hyphen;front fee is still required at the first visit. Thus, those with a crisis, who lack money or who are not regular patients of a GP have difficulty in accessing health care, so they go to the public hospital. Nine&amp;hyphen;hour waits at the accident and emergency care department at the Goulburn Valley Base Hospital are not unknown. The survey found that much of this demand could be categorised as general practice medicine, but the lack of bulk&amp;hyphen;billing and the restricted access to GPs on the weekends divert these cases to the local public hospital.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         By attending the accident and emergency centre instead of a GP, patients are treated by young interns trained in crisis medicine rather than general practice diagnosis, and there is little or no follow&amp;hyphen;up treatment or monitoring of the patient's ongoing condition. Both the GV Base Hospital and the Shepparton Private Hospital are more than aware of this dilemma and are concerned. They have discussed the need for out&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;hours clinics but have the difficulty of finding GPs to support this concept and to do that work. Given that some 80 per cent of all GP consultations in Australia are bulk&amp;hyphen;billed, obviously country people are experiencing a vastly less equitable service, in particular when you consider their incomes.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          While a key community issue nominated in the GV general practice division survey was that lack of access to bulk&amp;hyphen;billing, the GPs responding to that survey stated that bulk&amp;hyphen;billing was not compatible with maintaining a profitable practice, in particular when it came down to after&amp;hyphen;hours service. Most of the GPs interviewed were in fact moving to reduce and limit their services even further. GPs felt their consultation charges had changed little in the past 15 years while their costs had escalated and, therefore, their real incomes had progressively declined.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          To compensate, the GPs in the survey area had reduced some of their free community work and increased patient throughput by reducing consultation times. In the Goulburn Valley region, many GPs now see six to eight patients per hour and many consistently see 40 patients per day. Ten minutes is the most time you can usually expect with your doctor.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is common for rural practitioners to work significantly longer hours than their metropolitan counterparts and to have much longer hours on call and not worked. Many of the doctors in our region work solo or in pairs and yet some GPs have calculated that a profitable practice needs from four to six doctors working together—this is without taking into calculation the need for adequate time off, professional development and so on.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is little wonder that the under&amp;hyphen;supply of GPs in the survey area was also listed as a key problem. The consequences of this—the lack of bulk&amp;hyphen;billing, rushed consultations, long waits, exhausted doctors, lack of after&amp;hyphen;hours access—are inevitable but can lead to tragic results.

          It is not surprising, given the above scenario, that women—and young mothers in particular—bear the brunt of inadequate provision of health services in regional Australia. In the second health services survey completed just weeks ago, it was found that the Goulburn Valley teenage birthing rates were 31 per 1,000, or roughly double the Victorian rate and significantly higher than the national figure. This did not include the Koori 15&amp;hyphen; to 19&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds and it is estimated that their inclusion would have further in

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As we know, young single girls who become mothers in their early teens are very likely to experience poorer health, poverty, poor housing, interrupted education and often a lifetime of dependency on social welfare. One-third of the girls who participated in the Shepparton survey were under 17 when they had given birth. Nearly half had been early school leavers. Most of the pregnancies were unplanned and contraception was not used. Only half of the women surveyed were still in touch with the child's father at the time of the interview. The survey referred to a number of factors influencing the so much higher than average teenage pregnancy rates. They included low socioeconomic status, inadequate reproductive health education, peer pressure, low self&amp;hyphen;esteem, poor access to contraception and, as I said before, simply poor ability to pay for medical services.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Young pregnant women are often reluctant to seek medical advice in the early stage of their pregnancies, in particular, and the cost is one of those factors. Another one of the realities confronting those who live in small, stable, conservative communities is that there is little opportunity for young people to obtain confidential reproductive health information or contraception. Condoms, for example, continue to be sold as an under&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;counter item in pharmacies. There are virtually no condom vending machines, although we do have needle disposal bins in some toilets. It is little wonder then that we have double the state average for teenage pregnancies and a growing problem with STDs.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In a city as large as Shepparton we do not have a women's clinic where women of all ages can access female staff offering information about family planning, mammographies, Pap smears, testing of various other sorts and menopause advice. Our large Muslim population, in particular, is concerned at this lack of access to women medical practitioners. Meanwhile, the women GPs we do have practising in the area have virtually closed their books on new patients, so overwhelmed are they with work.

          <para first-indent="16">
           Thus, we are in the downward spiralling situation seen too often in health service delivery in rural Australia. Our GPs are overworked and many see diminishing returns for their efforts. In seeking to survive physically, emotionally and financially, they direct their service delivery to the areas that pay best. This inevitably disadvantages the poor and the powerless. We must do better. I know that our government wants to do better. In a place like the electorate of Murray, which is not remote, we have to make sure that in the future there are no 16-year-olds facing motherhood alone and that all have an opportunity in Australia to thrive and grow. In particular, I look forward to the establishment of the federally funded University Department of Rural Health in Shepparton. That will certainly help to make a difference.

          —In this grievance debate I would like to make reference to the recent Thredbo tragedy, something which was spoken about earlier today in this place. I know that all of us here grieve for those who lost loved ones and also for those who, unfortunately, are going to carry the trauma of this tragedy with them for a long time.

         I want specifically to refer to the response from our Canberra community, acknowledging the role of our region as well. Canberra had, in fact, suffered a tragedy of slightly smaller proportions in some ways only very recently before the night of 30 July, where I personally witnessed the response of our emergency services personnel in fairly extraordinary circumstances here in Canberra. There was no delay and no hesitation at all when that first call from Thredbo was received very shortly after that time.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That first request came to our emergency services here at 1 a.m. on the night of the disaster. Within five hours our teams had arrived in Thredbo. That first request included needs for ambulance support, urban search and rescue, which included a number of volunteers, and the Australian Federal Police. Included in the initial ambulance response was a triage team from the Canberra Hospital. Our initial team went to Thredbo within that
         <break page="6752" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          five-hour period fully equipped and self&amp;hyphen;contained and ready for whatever they found, although I am sure that until they got there, they did not quite realise what they were going to see.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Eventually our full response from this area included: from the task force management, three at the commander level and seven assistant task force commanders; 45 urban search and rescue team members; two hazardous materials and breathing apparatus personnel; five critical incident stress managers; eight communications personnel; 30 people from ground support; four people from ACT Electricity and Water; 12 people from the Ambulance Service; and 23 officers from the Australian Federal Police. In all, 139 personnel from all of the abovementioned agencies were involved in the rescue operation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The principal resource required was specialist staff to perform urban search and rescue techniques. The Emergency Services Bureau provided support and resourcing to the operational staff functioning under the New South Wales Fire Brigade's control. The majority of Australian Federal Police personnel were members of the AFP search and rescue team.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As we all know from the constant pictures on our television screens, the rescue site remained in a state of constant instability. As a result of the landslide, there was a pancaking of reinforced concrete slabs at various angles on a very steep slope where a further slippage of the slabs was a definite possibility and, as we know only too well, Mr Deputy Speaker, spoken of frequently in the media coverage.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The urban search and rescue teams provided to the New South Wales Fire Brigade were incorporated into rosters of two, eight&amp;hyphen;hour shifts and a 10-hour shift. The ACT Fire Brigade provided five members to each team, of which there were three teams, rotating each task force onto this roster. The task force management teams, of which there were four, consisted of an ACT Fire Brigade superintendent and two district officers.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The support functions to the task forces and the incident consisted of welfare, medical, communications, stores/logistics and ground
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          support, which were provided by volunteer personnel. These support functions were provided by the Ambulance Service and volunteers from the ACT emergency service. In addition, personnel from the Canberra Hospital, ACT Electricity and Water and a private surveying company were despatched to support the task force and incident.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, there was another level of assistance from the Canberra community which I would like to put on record. I understand that as the needs of the rescuers developed and as teams returned to Canberra to be replaced by others, supplies were constantly in demand. Those local businesses involved in some of that supply certainly responded generously in every sense of the word. They were known to open their businesses at any hour of the night, most often at two and three in the morning, I understand, to supply gas for LPG heaters, to supply cutting blades for the cutting machines and to supply the need for cold weather clothing—the specialist clothing that was being used, particularly during the night&amp;hyphen;time rescue period. All these people needed was to be made aware of the need of the teams at Thredbo, and they responded at times, I understand, at no cost.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When the magnitude of the task became more evident, more offers of help were made. For instance, the ACT Electricity and Water people made optical fibre camera equipment available as soon as they realised the assistance that could possibly offer, and many others offered advice, information and encouragement.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There were other aspects to this as well. As Queanbeyan, our very near neighbour over the border, had also sent teams to Thredbo, our services then offered to help cover their needs in a local sense from here as well—in other words, to backfill their local requirement. At the same time, New South Wales helped cover our firefighting service needs while the numbers we had from this area were at Thredbo. The ACT community also responded through the role of Canberra Hospital.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The heroism displayed in this rescue is almost unbelievable. I have had the opportunity to chat informally with some of the people who were working from our emergency
         <break page="6753" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          services headquarters in Curtin. From the sorts of stories I have heard it is hard to understand how people can have so much courage. For instance, when rescuers who were digging in tunnels nine to 10 metres in length would suddenly hear the cement slabs above them move, they would say into the small microphones they had that that was the case, they would hold still, they would not retreat, they would pause long enough and then they would just simply keep going—digging with a determination, a courage and a dedication that some of us can only admire.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is no question as to the magnitude and the horror of what happened at Thredbo. The Canberra community is very proud of and thankful to our emergency services—the personnel and everyone involved in that tragedy. They, like other emergency services around the country, train to this level, hoping of course that they would never need to use that expertise, but when it is needed there is absolutely no hesitation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We saw a very professional multi&amp;hyphen;service response from all sectors of our emergency services and also from our community, not connected necessarily in a direct sense but indirectly, who very quickly, warmly and humanely offered to do whatever could be done to assist those people. On behalf of the ACT community, we thank them, we congratulate them and we thank God that we do have them here.

          —I rise to join in the condolence motion in relation to Sir Garfield Edward John Barwick, former Chief Justice of Australia. Most of his principal biographical data has been offered in the House today. I, without reiterating the course of his life, want to make a couple of comments from a personal point of view.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) indicated, Sir Garfield achieved pre-eminence as an advocate. His reputation as an advocate I think has been unsurpassed by anybody in my lifetime—certainly my professional lifetime. He never ceased to be an advocate even when he was on the bench—a fact that was sometimes noted when his interjections in argument were extensive.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Sir Garfield was, as has been pointed out, a representative of his profession, and I am privileged to have shared with him the position of President of the Law Council of Australia—he, as I understand it, in the years 1952 to 1954 and I much later. He continued his interest in the profession throughout his professional life on the bench and took a keen interest in meeting members of the profession on the occasions when the High Court travelled to different jurisdictions to hear cases.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As an Attorney-General, Sir Garfield is probably best remembered for his reforms in the marriage and divorce area. Some landmark legislation that was enacted during his time included the Marriage Act and the Matrimonial Causes Act. He was also instrumental in establishing the model for what is now our Trade Practices Act. He had prepared a draft which became a model for the 1974 legislation.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As a chief justice, Sir Garfield is best remembered perhaps for his role in presiding over hearings. He was inevitably deeply involved in the argument right from the beginning. In fact, his perception and intelligence were such that he had identified the issue very early on in the debate and often sometimes better and more quickly than the advocate who was putting a case had done. This did not always win him friends, particularly from advocates who liked to develop their own argument, and his role in the conduct of proceedings before the court was the subject of some contention.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I appeared before the court presided over by Sir Garfield, although I do not recall that I was ever on my feet. I was only ever junior counsel when he was on the court. I have vivid recollections of my leader in one case being berated somewhat by Sir Garfield for
          <break page="6754" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

          He made a very significant contribution in his time as the longest serving chief justice. He presided over the court for 17 years. At a ceremonial sitting of the High Court held in Canberra on 5 August in memory of Sir Garfield, the current Chief Justice, Sir Gerard Brennan, gave an appreciation of Sir Garfield's role. The judgments which he wrote, Sir Gerard pointed out, can be found in over 40 volumes of the Commonwealth Law Reports.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Sir Gerard also pointed out something that was obvious to all those in court: some of those judgements were drafted while argument was continuing, indicating that Sir Garfield had quickly identified and decided points, although the argument on them had not necessarily finished. His judgments are not, I respectfully suggest, models in that he was always the advocate, even as a judge, and he argued for the case that his judgment would end up at rather than putting both sides of the issue as other judges might do. Sir Gerard, in his appreciation, indicated that inevitably the judgements which Sir Garfield wrote have affected the development of the law. He said that sometimes they settle the law for the future and sometimes they form part of that great reservoir of ideas on which the courts draw day by day in the refining and evolution of legal principles.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Sir Garfield also made a significant contribution in relation to the High Court in securing from the government of the day the passage of the High Court of Australia Act 1979. This was pioneering legislation in Australia and gave that court administrative independence from the department of the Attorney-General. It provided the capacity for the court to administer its own affairs and to control the precinct on which the building stands. It enabled the budget process, as far as the High Court is concerned, to be converted to what is referred to now as the one line budget. He was instrumental in the abolition of appeals from the High Court to the Privy Council. Even before legislation effected that, he had laid the groundwork in judgements of the court.

           He was a giant of a figure metaphorically, although in stature he was quite small. I can remember on a social occasion when the court was sitting in Western Australia he made what to me seemed to be the unusual assertion, which I think has deeper meaning than I appreciated at the time, that there are only ever seven people capable of fulfilling the role of justice of the High Court of Australia at any time. What he meant by that, I think, was that the court should comprise the seven best persons to constitute the court at that time. He certainly set a very high standard in his work, he set a very high standard in public life and he deserves the appreciation of the public for the role he played in the development of the law and in other areas. I extend my sympathy to members of his family.

          —My knowledge of Sir Garfield goes back to my days as an articled clerk. I knew him in several phases of his career when I, as a very subordinate and junior lawyer and subsequently as a member of the backbench of the other house but of this parliament, saw him as a giant—although, as the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) has just described, he was a little man.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are several facets of Sir Garfield that I think are worth remembering. One of the most significant issues that concerns me in this parliament, at a time when there have been criticisms of the role of justices—and the Attorney has made some comments at a convention involving many chief justices about the degree to which politics and the law interact—is that I think there is a role for politicians in the judiciary. To my mind, one of the great attributes of so many of those who have served as chief justices has been that they have also served as Attorneys in this place. I am not tonight setting up an advocacy for the Attorney-General, who currently represents us so ably, eloquently and effectively, but rather saying that it concerns me that, in relation to the doctrine of the separation of powers, there are those who suggest that politicians should not subsequently rise to legal office.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It perhaps concerns me more than other stages of Sir Garfield's career. As was said
         <break page="6755" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          earlier in this condolence motion, the interesting aspect of Sir Garfield was that, as the undoubted leader of the Australian bar, he was an extraordinarily effective and eloquent advocate. He had already been knighted. He had already been recognised as a person of some extraordinary ability, and I want to talk a little bit about that. But I think it is terribly important that, at a time when people look critically at members of parliament, we do not deny people who make a success of their careers outside this place the opportunity of serving in this place.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is a great pity that we seem more and more to be criticising members of parliament—certainly members of this House, certainly members of the ministry, certainly members of the other chamber and also members of other parliaments. As a result, it becomes increasingly difficult for those who, like Sir Garfield, have had extraordinary success in their own chosen, preferred profession to then translate into politics. It is important that all those who criticise parliamentarians and who, rightly, condemn some of those abuses which have tragically—and I say tragically deliberately—appeared in recent times know that there is no more significant, sensitive and important responsibility in Australia than serving as a member of this parliament. It is important that we have people who, like Sir Garfield, distinguish themselves in their careers and profession and are prepared to set that aside in order to serve here.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Equally, it is important that people who have served here—I am thinking of men like Sir Garfield—can then go on and become chief justice, and in my view he was a very distinguished chief justice. They should be able to move into another career and contribute to the advancement of this country. Sir Garfield always thought highly of this country. He always believed himself very much an Australian, served as such, acted as such and spoke as such.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are several aspects of Sir Garfield's career that I want to address. I was not quite so conscious of his role, although it was important, in developing a united federal approach to the matrimonial jurisdiction but
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          I was certainly very conscious of his approach to the introduction of a unified trade practices law. There are few occasions, sadly, in the changed modus operandi of this parliament where we have, in my view, an adequate debate on anything. The parliament itself, regrettably, for a raft of reasons is no longer as effective as it once was.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         On the occasion when Sir Garfield introduced his trade practices legislation into this place we sat most of the night. Two members in this place, Sir James Killen and Mr Bate, the member for Macarthur at that stage, contested almost every clause in the bill. Jeff Bate and Jim Killen between them did not agree with the nature and character of the trade practices legislation. But that was not as significant as the fact that Sir Garfield within the House advocated it clause by clause and pursued it clause by clause. We had one of the best committee stage debates that I can recall in the old House. That is important. In talking of Sir Garfield, first you have a very distinguished Australian, a leader in his profession and Attorney at the time and, secondly, his use of the parliament. Neither of those characteristics, I suppose one could call them, necessarily exists today.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think it is a great pity that today we cannot get people like Sir Garfield so easily elected into parliament, from whichever side. Nor can we have debates in a committee stage which are meaningful and where the minister at the table, the Attorney at the table or whoever, is able to engage in worthwhile dialogue. In my recollection that was probably one of the most distinguished movements in terms of his contribution as Attorney that I can remember Sir Garfield making.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I wanted to talk about a couple of aspects of Sir Garfield. I regarded him highly. I knew him perhaps not well but certainly I can remember briefing him as an articled clerk. In other words, I would take up a brief from my firm of solicitors and we would have some discussion. Certainly in his contribution in arguing the individual rights theory of section 92 of the constitution, which was the basis of his successful contention of the bank nationalisation case, he pursued not only an interesting cause but moved away from what a lot of
         <break page="6756" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          people saw as the product of his interpretation of the constitution as chief justice. For there he was very much said to be a conservative literalist, yet as an advocate and certainly in the banking nationalisation case his victory was rather in extending the view of section 92 in a way that few have seen fit to apply in recent years.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In every way we should remember Sir Garfield as we are tonight, certainly as a very effective advocate. I thought he was a very good minister for external affairs. As one who in the last few weeks has conducted a seminar on ANZUS through my committee in conjunction with Senator Dave MacGibbon, I think it is important that we remember that at the time of his leaving his post to take up the position of chief justice he was calling on the United States to join with Australia because of the application of confrontation to the extent to which we were then involved in Borneo.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other thing that one should say about Sir Garfield was that as minister for external affairs he was very often understated and undersold. I thought he was a very effective minister for external affairs. He certainly looked towards those international obligations which we had with the United States. As I mentioned, in the case of confrontation he was seeking to involve the United States in a way which was then contested.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As chief justice he appeared on many occasions, swore numbers of us in, was a person who saw very clearly the distinction between his judicial role and his role as an officer of this House, as a minister and as a member for those years before. I think that in every way Sir Garfield distinguished himself. While people have spoken much of his involvement, one role that has not been mentioned was his role as chancellor of Macquarie University. He contributed towards making that university what it now is. I think it is an outstanding university. It has risen largely because of the contribution of men like Sir Garfield.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Personally, professionally, as a minister, as Attorney, and certainly as Chief Justice he rendered a great service to this nation. I find it sad that people would condemn one small

          episode in the role he played as chief justice. Without wishing to advert to it or argue it today, it is always going to be important if we move to a republic, and certainly in whatever role the person who is Governor-General—who has the prime executive role within our monarchical republican constitution—plays, that there should be a capacity for the person in that office to consult the only independent, dispassionate person there is. The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition inevitably have their political views. The chief justice, on the other hand, is the head of the judiciary and is an appropriate person to consult. I find it sad that as a result of the affairs of 1975 there are those who suggest that that consultation should not be available.

I say that with some consideration in view of the fact that the seat has been held by such illustrious figures, likewise themselves distinguished lawyers, as Nigel Bowen, Sir Howard Beale and our present Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the member for Berowra, Phillip Ruddock, who I understand will be in the House tomorrow evening.

In terms of an enduring personal contribution to the quality of public life in this country, Sir Garfield is certainly in that pantheon, and in my personal estimation he is very high up in the rank.

         Being one of the more junior members of the House, my personal connection with Sir Barwick is very limited. I am told by my mother that in 1968 she attended a meeting at the Devlin's Creek Reserve in Beecroft as the wife of the state member for Northcott at that time. Sir Garfield was speaking on an environmental matter. She was sitting at the front of the meeting with me on her lap. I am told that I, with perhaps typical lack of propriety or consideration, crawled out to Sir Garfield's feet and became somewhat absorbed by the laces of the brown suede shoes he was wearing. I am told that he was unperturbed by that attention and continued his remarks without interruption or apparent irritation. I am not sure what the moral of that story is, but certainly those shoes were filled by a man of extraordinary stature.

         Sir Garfield's son Ross was a candidate for the federal seat of Parramatta in 1990. He was unsuccessful in the general election, but he ran for preselection against, among others, my father. Ross Barwick was successful in that contest. He and my father were very close friends throughout the preselection and beforehand. Ross was also active in my father's campaign for the seat of Northcott on a number of occasions.

         David McNicol referred to Sir Garfield as a `colossus of the Australian legal system'.

He made his reputation not just here but in other parts of the world—in the Privy Council, notably, for his argument for the banks in the bank nationalisation case in which his argument carried the day.

         I want to refer to his experience in the Dennis Hotels case, which I think is particularly poignant for us in the House this evening. That was the case in which Sir Henry Bolte, the then Premier of Victoria, had imposed a liquor licensing fee on the hotel industry, as had several other state governments, and several hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue were being derived from the liquor licensing fees. The fee was challenged by Dennis Hotels as an excise. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware that under section 90 of the constitution the power to levy an excise is exclusively in the hands of the Commonwealth. The situation was that if the challenge by Dennis Hotels had been successful the state finances would have been plunged into chaos.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It was fought all the way to the High Court. The High Court in a bare majority—four to three—upheld the case of Victoria by holding that the liquor licensing fee was in fact a fee and not an excise. Dennis Hotels, believing that they had a strong case, appealed for leave to go to the Privy Council. At that point Bolte, as Premier, came to Menzies like Oliver Twist with his cap out begging for assistance saying, `Can you please help us because we cannot afford the catastrophe of losing this case?'

         It is an extraordinary statement about both the times in which the parliament existed then and also the stature of Barwick himself that Menzies then said to Barwick, `What is your attitude towards the High Court's decision in Dennis Hotels?' and Barwick said, `Frankly, I agree with the minority judgment,' which,
         <break page="6758" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          as I recall, was led by Dixon J who said that the liquor licensing fee was in fact an excise and should be struck down. Menzies said to him, `What do you think the attitude of the Privy Council will be if they hear the case?' and Barwick said, `My view is that they are likely to uphold the minority judgment and strike down the liquor licensing fee as an excise.'

         I would be fascinated to hear what the diary secretary to the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams), who is in the chamber with us this evening, would say if the Prime Minister asked the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General to go to the Privy Council for a month to personally argue the case of the Commonwealth before that tribunal, but that is exactly what happened.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So Barwick set off personally to argue the case for the Commonwealth before the Privy Council, and the clerks of the Privy Council allocated a month for hearing, such was the complexity of the argument. Barwick got there, put together the casebook, which was described by their lordships as one of the most eminent pieces of argument they had ever seen, and carried the case within seven days. Judgment was entered not on the question of whether or not it was an excise, on which Barwick knew in his heart he would lose, but on the question of whether the Privy Council had jurisdiction to hear the case under section 74 of the constitution, which prohibited appeals to the Privy Council on matters that had to do with disputes between the Commonwealth and the states.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There you have it: Barwick in his heart believing that the minority judgment was correct, and here today the High Court, in the case of Ha a couple of weeks ago, specifically refers to the case of Dennis Hotels, overturns the majority judgment, throws the whole of state finances into chaos and provides what I regard as a much needed impetus for the fundamental reform of the tax system, which the Treasurer and the Prime Minister are now embarking on.

          reverence for the rule of law and for a philosophy that was entirely coherent, entirely consistent and, in my view, entirely correct.

         I would have to say personally that I would depart from the comments of the honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) in the sense that I deeply appreciated Sir Garfield's role as Chief Justice in resisting the adventurism that I regard as a defect of some of the recent judgments of the court in that he saw the court's role very clearly and very specifically as the interpretation and upholding of the acts of this place. It was not the province of the court to correct some defect in Commonwealth political, but to strictly limit its operations to the interpretation and upholding of the acts of the legislature and likewise to keep the legislature in check when it exceeded the proper bounds of executive authority.

         Such was his reputation that he was frequently briefed while at the bar by Labor figures. Dr Herbert `Doc' Evatt, as Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, briefed Barwick in relation to the Commonwealth Censor. In one particular case, the

He gave that advice to Evatt, much to Evatt's displeasure, and Barwick assumed he would never be briefed by Evatt again but in fact he was, consistently.

         So there was a very pleasing spirit of bipartisanship this morning in the recognition of the contribution of Sir Garfield Barwick. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) was most eloquent, but I want to refer with some irony to Sir Garfield's maiden speech after which he was followed immediately in the chamber by the then young member for Werriwa, Mr Whitlam. I will quote a couple
         <break page="6759" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          of paragraphs of the remarks that Gough made immediately following Sir Garfield's maiden speech:

         Honourable members have listened to the maiden speech of the greatest lawyer to enter this chamber since the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt), and the greatest advocate to enter it since the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies). Mr Chairman, every member who serves in this place has gained satisfaction and status from the fact that a practising lawyer who has probably no equal in this country and no superior in the English&amp;hyphen;speaking world has, at a not inconsiderable sacrifice, similar to that made before him by the two leaders whom I have mentioned, come to serve with us here. His maiden speech was, as one would have expected, disarming, polished and demure. One can well believe, after the first two characteristics that I have described, that there is great truth in the axiom, which has been followed every since the war by all the principal commercial interests in this country, that if you had a good case at law it did not very much matter whom you briefed to appear for you, but if you had an unmeritorious, an unsympathetic and an unlikely case, your only hope was to brief Barwick.

        <para style="Para">
         There is some irony in that fulsome and generous praise from the member for Werriwa at that time as history subsequently unfolded. Nonetheless, I would entirely defend Sir Garfield's role as Chief Justice in the so&amp;hyphen;called `constitutional crisis' of 1975. This is perhaps not the place to reopen the merits of the decision by the then Governor&amp;hyphen;General, but the one thing I will say is that the whole character of Barwick's life was one of an unqualified commitment to impartiality and to the rule of law. On whatever side of the case he was appearing, you see this relentless commitment to judicial impartiality and independence. If you had to rely on someone's judgment in a situation such as that, I cannot think of anyone whose judgment I would prefer to rely on than Sir Garfield Barwick's.

          —I am certain that I speak on behalf of all my Tasmanian colleagues and, in particular, the parliamentary Labor Party when I say that we will all miss Lance Barnard very greatly. He was one of a generation of great Tasmanian Labor leaders. In a small state, one would expect that the ability to generate people with some capacity to cast a national shadow would be slight. But, in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, Tasmania brought forward a series of men and women who collectively represented the Tasmanian Labor Party in such a way as to give Labor the leadership of Tasmania for many generations and to allow them to play a part on the national stage.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Lance Barnard followed in that tradition and was a most honourable and exceptional man. The Tasmanian Labor tradition goes back through people such as Cosgrove and Ogilvie, Eric Reece, Merv Everett, Roy Fagan and Justin O'Byrne—leaders at a state and federal level. The legacy of the work which that generation of Labor leaders put in was that, at the time when Lance Barnard first served as Prime Minister, the Australian Labor Party occupied all five seats in the Tasmanian House of Representatives.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Lance Barnard had as his colleagues the Reverend Gil Duthie, who served as the member for the seat of Wilmot—it was later called Lyons—for the entire period of his service, for over 20 years; Ron Davies, who served an equally long period as the member for Braddon; and people such as Ray Sherry and John Coates in Denison and Franklin, whose terms, although shorter, were the culmination of work which had come forward over a long period. Labor was extraordinarily strongly represented in the Senate, with people such as Justin O'Byrne, who served as President of the Senate and later, Ken Wriedt, who was the Labor leader in the Senate and Minister for Primary Industries. All this
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          welling forth of talent is quite unusual. It is no mark of disrespect to me and my colleagues to say that collectively we would not yet see ourselves in the same order of weight as so many Tasmanians who were brought forward to leadership positions in those times.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Lance had an extraordinarily committed life. He went to the war when he was a young man, was wounded and came back to serve in the Australian parliament following his father, who had served as the member for Bass. He served for a great many years, slowly becoming a person whose counsel was listened to within the Labor Party. He later became Deputy Prime Minister and deputy leader of the Labor Party. He held 14 portfolios when the Whitlam ministry was first formed and then held the portfolio of Defence for the rest of his period in office.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         He was a man who gave great loyalty. I think a mark of his loyalty, for example, is what he did when he was defence minister when the Whitlam government wanted to make cuts to expenditure. There was a plan put forward by the then Prime Minister that defence would be identified as one of the key areas for cuts so that it might serve as a marker to all colleagues that they had to take an equal degree of responsibility for the revenue restraint that the then Treasurer, Frank Crean, was seeking to impose. Playing his part, Lance Barnard accepted that responsibility and took the weight of some criticism in the area of defence. Quite properly, those cuts were well balanced.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The unfortunate thing, given the way in which history records the fate of the Whitlam government, is that there was little equal willingness on behalf of Lance's ministerial colleagues to bear the same restraint. We did face a period where there were substantial criticisms of the wont of financial management within the Whitlam government, which I think ultimately corroded its electoral support. Certainly no responsibility for that should be sheeted home to Lance Barnard, who played an extraordinarily honourable and straightforward role as Gough's loyal deputy there and in all other circumstances.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As Whitlam himself said, the mark of Lance Barnard was not simply that he was a
         <break page="6761" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          loyal deputy but that he was a man whom anyone could meet and find that he met them on equal terms. He took them forward, he took them into his confidence as being worthy of respect and he treated all people who came into his embrace as people whom he would listen to, advise and assist.

         I was at his funeral the other day where one of Michelle O'Byrne's campaign workers—Michelle is now the endorsed Labor candidate for the seat of Bass—said that he had first met Lance Barnard when he volunteered as a campaign worker for the then member for Bass, Silvia Smith. He had walked into a room and saw a man sitting in the corner, working quietly doing some paperwork. He asked what he might do to assist and he had a long conversation with the man. It was only three or four meetings later that he realised that the man who was working away in the corner, providing quiet advice and assistance, was none other than the person who had previously served as Deputy Prime Minister in the Whitlam government.

         Lance Barnard was not a man who had any front. But he was not a man who, for the lack of front, could be seen as a person who did not have a natural dignity. That natural dignity was with him all the time. He was never a person who confronted you with a sense that he was an important man to whom you had to pay respect; rather he offered himself to you if you wished to take advice from him. If you did not, that was to your loss.

         All of us who knew Lance Barnard knew a man who had a simple dignity and who, after he had completed his period of service as a parliamentarian, did not retire from public life but rather continued it in a quiet, backroom and determined way, serving the people of Launceston. The number of boards, committees, charities and public works that Lance was associated with is enormous. Anyone who knew the heartbeat of the city of Launceston knew that Lance was very much integrated into that city. He loved it. He was fiercely parochial in the best sense of the word. He rarely sought to travel outside of Launceston; he lived there contentedly and quietly as he aged, surrounded by his family

          and friends, with the highest respect of all those who knew him.

          —I too would like to be associated with this condolence motion in memory of Lance Barnard. I knew Lance well in his role here. As the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) has just described, he was a quiet achiever—an unexpected personality in many ways. His sincerity and obvious commitment went without question. In so many ways, I guess because of his personality and because of who he was, he made an enormous contribution to the Labor Party.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The remarkable thing about Lance Barnard was that he constantly pipped Jim Cairns, who was at that time without any question the doyen of the Left of the Labor Party, through his persistence and quiet sincerity. Ultimately, in 1974, it was Lance who lost the deputy prime ministership to the same Jim Cairns. I know Gough Whitlam, in his contests with Jim Cairns, also owed a great deal to the commitment and support of Lance Barnard. I gather the first time Gough Whitlam contested the leadership of the Labor Party he won it by only three votes, and then largely on the basis of the support of Lance Barnard.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are a number of aspects to Lance's career of which I did want to make brief mention. The first is that, as Deputy Leader of the Opposition and Deputy Leader of the Labor Party, on so many occasions he was of course overshadowed by the mercurial personality of Gough—and in the old place more than this the personalities were just so significant. There we were closer together, we were in far more of a debating forum, and Gough Whitlam was one who was seen. It was he
         <break page="6762" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          who participated in the major theatre of the place, and Lance was so often the quieter supporter whose rhetoric and whose utterances never had quite the dramatic impact. Yet in his own way he made a tremendous contribution to the Labor Party.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think it is important for those of us who look at Australia in trying to measure our place in the world to also recognise the shortness of our history. It is remarkable to think that Lance's father—Claude, that is—was himself a member for 15&amp;half; years for the same seat. He was a minister, I believe, for about three years in one of the Chifley ministries. So, in this motion tonight, we really are thinking back almost to the war years, and how short our history is, and how few there have been who have served in this place and who have served their state and nation as Lance.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Certainly that period after 1972 when he held for that brief time those 14 portfolios was a remarkable period. I can remember so often sitting opposite him at the table. It fell my lot on many occasions to be the spokesman for the opposition at that time on matters for which Lance was responsible. While on most occasions I guess I disagreed with him, certainly I always respected the honesty and integrity and forthrightness with which he approached his own administration. I think not only in that period but subsequently, particularly as Minister for Defence, his contribution to the Labor Party and to the Labor government was always one which one respected, even though one may not have agreed with some of his policy approaches.

         Lance Barnard was a significant politician. He was a major contributor to the Whitlam government. He was certainly, in his private and public life, a great contributor to Australia. As an ambassador, as a citizen and as a parliamentarian he is one who did enhance the name and traditions of the Australian Labor Party. I pay my respect to him and his memory. I, along with my wife, would like to extend my sympathies to Jill, his children and their families.

         Politically, Lance Barnard came from a very great traditional Labor family. As has been mentioned by the previous speaker, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), his father, Claude, was the member for Bass for 15 years and a minister in the Chifley government—the Minister for Repatriation. I served in the state cabinet in Tasmania with Lance's nephew Michael Barnard, who was the member for Bass in the state parliament from 1969 to 1984, was elected deputy leader of the party and, of course, went on to become Deputy Premier while I was in that cabinet. His other cousins and family members have played a big part in the Labor Party in Tasmania.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Lance Barnard was born in Launceston and educated at state schools and technical high schools in Launceston. The outbreak of World War II interrupted his training as a teacher. He went off to war where he served in the Middle East, taking part in the defence of Egypt against the tanks and armies that had been assembled by Rommel and the Eighth Army's offensive against El Alamain where he was wounded. One of his brothers was killed during the Second World War, and the other was also returned home wounded.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         After leaving the army, he took up teaching again. He was very active in the Labor Party around the Bass electorate in the Launceston area. In 1954 he won the federal seat of Bass and held it for 21 years, becoming deputy leader of the party in 1967. In 1975 he resigned and became Ambassador to Sweden, Norway and Finland. But that is only about a third of Lance's life. Returning from his role as ambassador, he continued to be a part of Launceston and to work with his constituents—which he had done probably since he had been a boy in his father's office—right through until his death.

          A week before Lance died the Launceston City Council had a ceremony for him to thank him for his dedication not only to northern Tasmania but to the island as a whole. His interests continued to be for young people and for jobs. He was involved in a group training scheme. He was trying to find jobs for people right up to the last of his life. He was well loved by veterans and pensioners. He helped so many people over the years just by putting their problems together in letter form and being able to get that to a department to sort out—sometimes a very simple problem.

          I myself as a young man can remember seeing Lance at Monagan's cafe, a very ordinary cafe in Brisbane Street, Launceston. Lance would often be there taking tea with all sorts of people—sometimes the businessmen of Launceston, and sometimes the railway workers from across the river. If you wanted to talk to someone, Lance was always available to be talked to. He gave me advice before the 1993 election and he gave me further good advice before the 1996 election in predicting that I would retain the seat of Lyons—and he was spot on in that regard.

          When I thought back on Lance's life, I tried to think of when I could not remember him, and that is impossible. He was always a part of the Labor Party for me in Tasmania. In my memory of the party and of the Labor movement, he was always there and always has been there. With that, the gap he leaves is huge: his experience and his knowledge of history, his dry humour and his willingness to fill in any time you needed a speaker. Any time someone was late or someone could not get there, Lance was always up and always on top of every issue that seemed to exist. He could give you 10 minutes off the cuff.

         Gough often discussed issues of the day with him on the phone and in each other's offices. Given Gough's renowned impatience and reforming zeal—the crash through or crash approach—the Labor government was fortunate that in the Deputy Prime Minister they had someone who could exercise a moderating influence when that was needed, which was not infrequently.

         Lance also played the role of repairing relationships with ministerial and caucus colleagues who had been trampled on or had their egos bruised by the prime ministerial intolerance for procrastination, delay or even opposition. Lance would often invite such offended parties to his office for a chat and a drink and try to smooth things over. In this way he played a valuable role in achieving as much harmony as possible in the midst of the Whitlam whirlwind.

         He was not just a loyal and effective lieutenant. As Minister for Defence, he recorded major achievements. His first ministerial act and the first decision of the famous two&amp;hyphen;man interim government he and Gough formed after the 1972 election was to end conscription by suspending the National Service Act. He also ended our military involvement in Vietnam and carried out the major task of combining the five defence departments into one defence department.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Defence issues were his abiding policy interest and, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said earlier today, he established the defence policy on which Australia has long relied. In seeking to pull the five defence departments into one department, he was opposed by the service chiefs, who feared a major loss of influence within the government and also were concerned that he intended to put together a Canadian style single defence service. Lance overcame this resistance and saw the reform almost through to completion. It was in fact passed through the Senate a couple of months after Lance's resignation from the parliament.

         Although Lance was utterly committed to the Labor Party, one decision he made that turned out not to be in the party's interests was his decision not to accept the governor-generalship when it was offered to him in 1974. Had he done so, the Bass by-election would have been in mid&amp;hyphen;1974, when the government was in much better shape than it was in mid&amp;hyphen;1975, which was when Lance resigned from the parliament, so requiring a by-election which resulted in a landslide against Labor.

         Had the by-election for Bass been in 1974, Labor may well have held the seat, or at least it would have avoided a result which emboldened the opposition to block the budget in the Senate. If, however, they had blocked it, it is hardly likely that Lance as Governor-General would have sought advice from the Chief Justice, sacked the government and called an election, as John Kerr did.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         His refusal of the governor&amp;hyphen;generalship was hardly a surprise. He was a very modest man. He liked to keep his feet on the ground, to stay in touch with the common people.

         Why then did he resign to become Ambassador to Sweden, Norway and Finland in mid&amp;hyphen;1975? Although he was certainly hurt by the loss of the deputy position after the 1974 election, his reason for leaving in mid&amp;hyphen;1975 had much to do with his hearing difficulty, which was getting worse. He had to strain to hear questions in the House, which sometimes required him to ask for questions to be repeated and which brought the inevitable catcalls from the opposition. He eventually was told by his doctor that he risked losing his hearing altogether if he stayed in parliament. So he did not deserve the criticism he received from some quarters for destabilising the government by his resignation.

         Such actions by the coalition parties in government demonstrated fully the regard in which he was held by his political opponents. Yet he remained completely committed to Labor.

         Whenever one as a minister went to Launceston to any Labor function, one could bet that Lance would be there. He worked five days a week for Silvia Smith in her three years as member for Bass, dealing mainly with constituents and veterans issues but also providing political advice when required. For a man who by this time was in his mid&amp;hyphen;70s, this was devotion to the party indeed.

         He also maintained a great concern for ex&amp;hyphen;service men and women and helped them mightily in his electorate and elsewhere through his role as member and for many years after he ceased to be an MP.

         By any standards, this was indeed an altruistic man—one who sought high office but never forgot his roots, never forgot his electorate or his fellow ex&amp;hyphen;service men and women and never forgot the party that gave him the opportunity to serve his country well in peace time as well as in war.

         One final insight into Lance's personality that I would mention came with the ending of the Australian involvement in the Vietnam War. At the same time, he adopted a Vietnamese orphan baby girl. Whilst this was clearly fulfilling a family need, it also was surely symbolic of a perceived need for Australia to now play a caring, compassionate role in Vietnam, not just to walk away from the devastation of war. This was indeed the action of an admirable man. I give my sympathy to his wife, Jill, and his family.

Like the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), when I had those opportunities to visit Launceston in a ministerial capacity, Lance Barnard was always there pursuing the interests of that city he loved.

It is interesting to ponder how different Australian history would have been if either Frank Crean or Lance Barnard had taken that offer.

The funeral ceremony at St John's, Launceston, was a very moving community tribute—a packed church, a deep sense of community loss and a deeply emotional panegyric from Gough Whitlam.

         As so many people have said—I do not want to keep repeating what others have said about him—he was a man of complete integrity. His loss of the deputy leadership in 1974 after seven years in the job was a very great blow. As we all know, what followed was a change in the way in which the then Labor government was operating the then Bass by&amp;hyphen;election, leading ultimately to the events of 11 November 1975 and the following very heavy election defeat. It is quite possible that, if Lance Barnard had remained as the deputy leader throughout that period and there had been no Bass by&amp;hyphen;election, the 1974 government might well have continued and not faced an election until 1977.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Lance Barnard was extraordinarily unselfish. The role that I remember very much—this is very similar to what my colleague the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) was saying—is that he had an extraordinarily calming effect in that period between 1967 and the election of the Labor government in 1972. This was the period when the name of Gough Whitlam was a kind of boo word inside the Victorian Labor Party. Unlike the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party, we really do play politics in Victoria as a blood sport. We lack that effete quality associated with the New South Wales party.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         During that period Lance Barnard did play an extraordinarily important role in seeing people, talking to them, listening to them,

         There was a period when there is no doubt that it was the staunch support of Lance Barnard that kept Gough Whitlam in the leadership. There were a number of attempts made to persuade Lance to run for the leadership himself. If he had done so, Gough's position would have been quite untenable. He took the view—it was very realistic; he had no illusions about himself—that Gough Whitlam was the person to bring the Labor Party to victory, that he had the broadest grasp of policy, the most encyclopaedic mastery of detail. He saw his role as being a loyal deputy and he fulfilled that role extraordinarily well until 1974.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Gough Whitlam always said that the two&amp;hyphen;man ministry of 1972 was the first two&amp;hyphen;man ministry since that of the Duke of Wellington. But it is one of those very rare occasions when he is wrong. The Duke of Wellington's ministry was a one-man ministry. He held every portfolio for a brief period in November-December 1834 when he was waiting for Peel, who was then overseas in Italy, I think, to come back in order to take office. He did not want to hand out portfolios to anyone else; he took them all. Lance Barnard was particularly proud that in his role as Minister for Defence, at the time of the winding up of the Vietnam War, he was able to play a decisive role.

         People did not quite grasp how seriously he had been injured in World War II, serving with the 9th Division at El Alamein. It affected his sight, hearing and lung capacity. But he was a very uncomplaining person. I did not serve in parliament with him but I met him very often. Every time I went to Launceston, which was quite often in the 1980s, Lance was always there to provide support. He did not seem to feel that he had to play a starring role. He was very keen to be part of the support mechanism in the party. I see him as a very lovable person who devoted himself to the party, his nation and his city with great dignity and dedication.

          from his service as ambassador to Sweden, Norway and Finland, for a time he was director of the Office of Australian War Graves. As Gough Whitlam pointed out in his panegyric, Lance was offered a knighthood, a KCMG, which he declined. We will always remember Lance Barnard with love because of his absolute commitment to our nation. He enriched the parliament, and we are all diminished by his passing.

Those of us who are involved in the Tasmanian branch of the ALP are always very conscious of the huge debt we owe this wonderful man.

Unlike the opposition, we believe that Australians deserve the opportunity to have the issues involved in the republic debate discussed in an open forum. Many in the community want to learn more about the issues and opinions and options to allow them to make up their own minds before they are asked to vote on the issue. The convention of half elected and half appointed delegates will serve as a forum to engage the wider community and to increase awareness of both our current system and options for change.

         The voluntary postal ballot proposed by the government to elect half of the delegates to the constitutional convention is fair and convenient for electors. It is also cost&amp;hyphen;effective. We do not agree that a compulsory vote is appropriate for this election because, unlike parliamentary elections to determine governments, this ballot will not confer powers or obligations. It is an election for delegates to attend a 10-day convention to discuss the republic issue, not a definitive vote on the republic.

         We are not prepared to propose a law which would make Australians guilty of an offence if they chose not to vote in the election for delegates to the convention, particularly when many Australians have not yet come to grips with the complex and difficult issues in this debate. Electoral systems need to be designed with these circumstances in mind, and we are confident that, if this proposal is considered on its merits, it will be supported. Contrary to the opposition's assertions, this bill is not the first time Commonwealth legislation has provided for voluntary voting. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 provides for voluntary voting in regional council elections.

         The Australian Electoral Commission, which has an international reputation in the conduct of fair and open elections, advises us that a postal ballot can provide a secure and creditable system and that there is no evidence that fears of wide scale tampering have been borne out in practice. The estimates

          prepared by the Australian Electoral Commission indicate that a voluntary postal ballot would cost $35.6 million—$13 million less than a voluntary attendance ballot, at approximately $49 million.

          —We oppose the motion strenuously, as we did suggest the amendments that the Senate ultimately came up with in the course of the debate here in this chamber some time ago now. At the last election this government did not go to the Australian people and say to them, `Oh, by the way, when we put in place this constitutional convention, what we will be doing is overturning the Australian secret ballot and overturning the compulsory attendance at the polls that has served this country well since the 1920s and the Australian ballot for a lot longer than that.' They went to the electorate and said, `We will have a constitutional convention.' We are fully prepared to support that proposition. We are perfectly happy for the government to have their constitutional convention, even though we think the government ought to be presenting to the Australian people immediately the question as to whether or not there ought to be an Australian head of state.

         This is a matter not to be tinkered with by politicians any more; there has been enough public debate on this. Any reasonable reading of any of the opinion polls and any of the debate that has occurred to date would show that you could not sensibly stand up and say that these matters have not been given due consideration by the Australian electorate. They are prepared to vote. The government are not prepared to permit them to do so. The government want to produce with this constitutional convention a flawed process that serves several of their ends. The first of their ends is a convention with plausible denial, a convention that does not necessarily represent
         <break page="6771" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          the full articulated view of the Australian people. They may choose then to accept the outcome or reject it and have their argument around that particular point.

         The second thing is that they always like a little bit on the side. The little bit on the side is to work out a mechanism for starting to introduce the public to the notion that perhaps what we do not need is a compulsory ballot. When you take a look at their performance to this point, you see that there is no question at all that very substantial numbers of the members of the government side no longer wish a compulsory ballot to obtain. They believe there is political advantage in that. Whether or not there is political advantage for the Liberal Party, for the Australian community to have that situation obtained would be extremely bad indeed. The capacity to develop from that process a representative parliament would be virtually non&amp;hyphen;existent.

        <para first-indent="16">
         This compulsory ballot was not put in place by this side of politics. The compulsory ballot was legislated by the other side of politics and strongly supported by them when it occurred, because in the election prior to the act being passed there was a turnout of something like 57 per cent. With voluntary voting in Western Australia, where it occurs in local government, you are lucky to get a turnout of 15 to 30 per cent in those ballots. We would be lucky to get a turnout of 50 per cent in our elections. We would get very quickly to the US situation, where about 75 per cent of those entitled to enrol do so and about 50 per cent of those who subsequently enrol end up voting. The consequence of that is that invariably the American President and the American Congress are representative of very much a minority slice of American public opinion. We do not want to see that process begin in this place, when no indication before the last election was given that that was the intention of the government.

          whose kitchen table it finally arrives on, there will still be that plausible denial that I referred to earlier. A representative vote will not emerge from them.

The government know that and I suspect strongly that the government would welcome that, were that to occur.

         We will go to the next election as the only political party putting forward a proposition to the Australian electorate which says this: `If you wish to have your constitution properly reflect your civil polity, if you wish to have your constitution properly reflect the fact that we are a mature democracy, if you wish your constitution to have a fully&amp;hyphen;fledged Australian head of state, then there is one party that will put an honest vote before you.'

         It will be a vote that will include no overthrow of the Australian secret ballot, the one mechanism that is now universally recognised by an Australian title. When you go and talk about secret ballots at conferences of politicians in other countries or at constitutional and electoral conferences, you will hear people refer to the Australian secret ballot, which is to be overthrown by this particular proposition. The Australian secret ballot is not good enough for an election of an Australian constitutional convention. That is the position of the other side. An Australian secret ballot is not suitable for the election of a convention to deal with matters pertaining to the Australian constitution.

Despite the strong support of large numbers in the community, despite the strong support of Liberal Premiers and of others in the Liberal Party, despite the strong support particularly of young Australians seeking a bit of adventure, a bit of an opportunity to grasp their constitution, their civic polity, to express their view, they can all go and put it in their pipes and smoke it as far as this government is concerned.

What a load of old codswallop we have just listened to. Simply, we put forward an honest proposition and you revel in dishonesty. What a load of old rubbish to say that the only thing you want to put to the people is whether or not we will have an Australian head of state.

         We are putting up a proposition that says: `Here is an opportunity for you to speak, to come and debate the only two questions that matter'. Those people who want a change to our constitutional arrangements have to tell us, first, precisely what it is they propose and, second, how it will benefit the people of Australia. They are the two questions that need to be answered. The convention we are proposing will give the opportunity to those who want change to come and answer those two questions to the satisfaction of the people.

That means that there will be a

The real answer is that, if you are serious, you will support it. But if you are not serious and you just want to argy-bargy for the sake of it because you have nothing to better to do, then you will do what you are doing and will vote against it.

         Senator Minchin has said that if we fail to support the bill the convention will not proceed. This alone shows that the government is not serious about the republic and constitutional reform. The history of our constitution shows that proposals for reform succeed only when they are supported by both sides of politics and when the politics is inclusive. But the government have sought to deliberately divide debate on this issue. They have asked the Labor Party and other parties to make an unpalatable choice between our pursuit of the republic and our support for compulsory voting, one of the pillars of our democratic system. We do not want to choose between two issues we hold dear. We are simply not prepared to play the government's silly game.

If the government are not prepared to accept a voting system that has served this nation well since 1924, then they can explain that decision to the Australian people. In the meantime, the government can be assured that the issue of the republic will not go away. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is trying to use this issue as a convenient excuse for the republic to go away. It will not go away. The Labor Party will ensure that the Australian people continue to have an opportunity to discuss this important issue.

The government has refused to reveal that the reason the House is voting on the bill tonight is that the government forgot to return this bill to the House at the end of the last sitting. The effect of that mistake is that the time period required by section 57 of the constitution between the first and second rejections of a bill by the Senate has not started to run.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Let me tell the member for Banks, if I can gain his attention for just a moment, that I happen to hold compulsory voting dear as well. I have no particular interest in a non-compulsory ballot. I have no reason to run a non-compulsory voting agenda. I have never agreed with my colleague Senator Minchin on the question of non&amp;hyphen;compulsory voting. But, so far as I can determine, what we are dealing with tonight has nothing to do with the legal framework that affects this parliament in Australia. We are not electing a parliament. We are electing effectively the representatives to a constitutional convention. No law in this country will change as a result of any decision made at the constitutional convention. Tell me if I am wrong, but my understanding is that the only way that a law in Australia changes is when the people who represent electorates around Australia—148 of them—vote in a particular way, and those people,
         <break page="6775" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         What we are dealing with here is a non&amp;hyphen;compulsory vote merely to elect some of the delegates to a convention to make recommendations to the people. Before those recommendations become law there will be a compulsory vote. What on earth is the opposition on about? I heard the Leader of the Opposition refer to what he called the arrogant contempt of the government. `Why,' he said, `Australians will be silenced and denied the right to vote.' I ask the member for Banks: tell me who will be denied the right to vote? What Australian loses the opportunity to vote as a result of this procedure? The answer is none—not one.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Every Australian, I remind the member for Banks, gets the opportunity to vote. More than that, every Australian, given the extensive card that they expect to be considering, gets the opportunity to cast a vote over which they have had time to deliberate. But for some strange reason, some mystifying reason, those opposite see this as some sort of threat and some sort of agenda for a non&amp;hyphen;compulsory vote. It is absolute nonsense. All that the parliament is considering is the right for people to be elected to a convention to make recommendations to the people of Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Having made those recommendations, the people of Australia will determine via a compulsory vote called a referendum or via a compulsory vote called an election what changes occur in terms of the way Australia is governed. In South Australia—and I am not well enough informed to know what happens in the other states—South Australians deliberately choose to elect the people who govern them at local government level by a non&amp;hyphen;compulsory ballot.

         I conclude where I began. I am not someone desperately anxious to have compulsory voting. This is not an exercise in changing the law of Australia. It is an exercise in selecting the delegates to a constitutional convention, and a non&amp;hyphen;compulsory vote is entirely appropriate.

So much of this debate about a proposal for a constitutional convention is simply that: the intention of concluding where we begin—that is, defying the very strong will of the Australian people by putting forward spurious proposals that are really set up to fail. These are critiques that are not new in this debate. We made those critiques when this bill was introduced, and this legislation has come back again, unamended and destined to be defeated, because the government is not willing to grapple with the fundamental questions that it ought to. The honourable member who last spoke said he did not come into this debate with a predisposed agenda towards a new form of voting, but we do not accept the blandishments that the government puts forward in this regard.

         There is no doubt this proposal is a Trojan horse. It is designed in order that a new system of voting be trialled in Australia. It is also designed in order that the process be established to make certain that, whatever the outcome of the convention, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) will be able to say that, because of the mix of representation, the low voter turnout, the uncertainties of the process, the fact of appointed representation and the essentially unrepresentative nature of the process, you cannot discern a clear will of the Australian people to move forward.

         We should simply move to the simple question of whether Australians wish to have a republic or not. They know what they wish to have; they wish for us to proceed to a republic. These stalling, delaying, sleazy avoidance tactics that the government is putting up so that it can appear, in some way at least, to address the very strong will of the Australian public—but do nothing in substance to meet the needs that it recognises exist—do them no credit whatsoever. The opposition will continue to reject this foolish stalling tactic. We will ask that the government bring forward some more appropriate mechanism in line with that which we have constructively suggested so that this debate can move away from tokenistic posturing to allow the Australian public to have a say, as it wishes, on the future of this democracy.

He cited three main reasons for this growth: firstly, the fall in interest rates have encouraged people to re-enter the housing market; secondly, as Bendigo's population has increased, so has building activity; and, thirdly, a slowdown in the new home market because the recession which we `had to have' and which had created a backlog in the past few years was now clearing up. This is all very good news and all very clear evidence of the economic path that the Howard government is proceeding along and the positive results that have been achieved over the past 12-month period in the City of Greater Bendigo.

         Emergency service workers worked together as the nation waited for the outcome. We all waited, watching on television as workers pulled victims from the wreckage. Each moment as news of another victim came through, our community mourned their loss. The rescue of Stuart Diver was a miracle which came when many people had started to give up hope. It showed that even in the midst of such a tragedy we could not give up hope. I pay tribute to Mr Diver who put aside his own grief and mourning to work for the families and friends of the victims in starting an appeal. His actions, coming from someone so personally affected by the tragedy, were completely selfless. I join with the families and friends of the victims in thanking him for his efforts.

         The Thredbo tragedy was a terrible event. Yet out of these kinds of events, people in a community are able to work together for a common purpose, to achieve a goal—in this case, that of saving lives. The ACT has long held the tradition of working with the rest of the community within our region. Canberra is not only the nation's capital but also a very significant regional centre. Our emergency service workers are well used to working with teams from other states to rescue people all over the region. Canberrans are always ready to help out those in our region who are lost, hurt or suffering. People throughout the region rely upon services provided in the ACT for health and other care.

          —The member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) invites me to respond to the rather fatuous comments he has made. Unfortunately, every time the member for Perth speaks in this House, he seems to read from the newspapers. He always has a series of news clippings—not one original thought of his own—which some journalist has put together, which he gathers and puts forward as his own information. I want to put on the record tonight that federally the Labor Party in Western Australia have only three members out of 14: the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, the member for Brand; the member for Perth; and the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence). Let us go through them one at a time.

         The member for Perth said, `We won't talk about the senators because they don't count in this House.' But I will say exactly what he said. There is one new Labor senator in Western Australia; he is new and finding his feet. Also, there are three old lags who are not making much of a contribution; they are waiting for their superannuation. But we will start from the top.
        </para>

         The member for Brand, Mr Beazley, is the one who ran away from the seat of Swan. He is the one who hoisted the white flag. During the last federal election campaign, I ran across a lot of the Labor Party faithful in Swan.
         <break page="6780" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          They were saying things to me like, `You wouldn't have wanted to be in the trenches with Beazley. He would have hoisted the white hanky out of his pocket and run.' That is the impression he left after 14 years in the seat of Swan—a runner, somebody who would not stand up and fight. He is somebody whose contribution to this parliament at the moment is not seen as great leadership. Somebody from the Labor Party state executive called at my office just last week to tell me that they do not think Beazley will last till the end of the year. Time will tell.

         Let me turn to the member for Perth. Here is a man who was the state secretary of the Labor Party during the corrupt WA Inc. years. He was the state secretary of one of the most corrupt parties during the Burke WA Inc. era. What is happening to those former WA Inc. people? Burke has just got out of gaol. Parker has just got out of gaol. There are a number of others who have been to gaol and who have been investigated—Julian Grill, for example.

         The member for Perth is the man who ran the party while all this was going on. This was the man who ran it like a sideshow. He is also the man who runs around terrifying people in the electorate about things that are just not true. He is talking about things that will not happen, such as the extension of the runway. He has been out to the airport and the new management of the Perth airport has told him that there will not be an extension of the runway for 25 years.

         What does he do? He gets in the paper and misleads the public. He involves a very decent person, John Dorazio, the Mayor of Bayswater, who is somehow infatuated with this young, craven opportunist and who has obviously promised him a seat somewhere. He tried to get him a seat in state parliament. The bloke could not get over the line. He is obviously promising him a seat somewhere in federal parliament, and poor old John is going along blindly, getting behind his old schoolmate and trying to get him a seat in parliament. He is making a fool of his mate John Dorazio and he is leading him astray. I hope John wakes up one day.

It is on the public record. It is no secret; it is no great deal: here is a person who has been found by a royal commission to have lied. Here is a person who has been found to have given misleading evidence to a royal commission. As I said, if she gets any further back in this House she will be out in the lounge.

          —In the debate tonight I would like to focus on the government's recently announced special needs subsidy scheme; a program designed to provide funding to integrate severely disabled children in community based child&amp;hyphen;care centres. I would like to be able to say that I find the scheme admirable, and of course in essence it is. However, when you start sifting through the fairly thin details of the program, it soon becomes apparent that what we really have here is an expensive sham. It has been designed to fool Australian parents into thinking they have a federal government sensitive to their needs and the needs of their disabled children.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <break page="6781" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          The first problem with SNSS relates to the supplementary services program or SUPS—an integral part of the overall scheme. It is the responsibility of those SUPS employees to source local agencies for disabled children who meet the SNSS guidelines eligibility criteria. The SUPS agents must then place the children in Commonwealth funded child&amp;hyphen;care centres before applying for one of the SNSS funding and then determine a management plan for each child.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As the SNSS guidelines stipulate, `SUPS services are an integral part of the provision of SNSS support.' However, what the government appears to have forgotten is that, prior to initiating the SNSS, it has changed the SUPS funding which has now resulted in Australia&amp;hyphen;wide retrenchment of rank upon rank of all these SUPS workers.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In the case of Fairfield City Council, the local council which covers the majority of my electorate, over $60,000 of its SUPS funding has now been cut by the Howard government resulting in the loss, council tells me, of something like five SUPS officers. There are currently no SUPS officers working for Fairfield City Council, one of the largest councils in Sydney. The government, on the one hand, declares the vital role that the SUPS workers play in this SNSS program and yet, on the other hand, by its own actions it has reduced their numbers hand over fist. What is the sense in that?
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          That is not the only inadequacy of this special needs subsidy scheme. Next we uncovered the fact that the SNSS guidelines only allow for a casual wage of $13 an hour for an extra child&amp;hyphen;care worker for every disabled child placed in Commonwealth funded care. This is despite the fact that in New South Wales an unskilled child&amp;hyphen;care worker's casual award rates are $14 an hour and a TAFE accredited child&amp;hyphen;care worker's casual award rates $17.70 an hour.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Surely the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) is not seriously suggesting that the cash strapped, community based child&amp;hyphen;care centres should now make up the difference in the wages. Surely that is not so. I went further because, as a matter of fact, that is what she is now suggesting. Just how child&amp;hyphen;care centres
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           on the brink of financial collapse are meant to do so only the minister knows.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Information about and access to the scheme are also under question. According to Fairfield City Council, of the 61 local agencies which may have clients eligible for the scheme, not one has approached the council for replacement in any of their child&amp;hyphen;care services. Agencies on the whole are unusually keen for their clients to be integrated in mainstream child&amp;hyphen;care centres, so why the lack of action? My guess is that it is because of the government's less than enthusiastic attempts at communicating the structure of the subsidy scheme.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Agencies within my electorate have now complained to me that the government has not provided any information to them regarding the SNSS, despite being launched in July. As late as this month—the last phone calls I made were last week—they still had not received any information about it. There is also a great deal of confusion amongst the agencies as to when the funding will be released and if the child&amp;hyphen;care centres will have to wait until January next year before they can access money from the scheme.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Many agencies in my electorate now believe that the money for the program will just sit in government coffers and not be used, giving the government the excuse to axe the program in the next budget. Agencies do not know how to access the SNSS and are currently relying on our SUPS workers to provide them with the information about the scheme. Here we come to our own catch&amp;hyphen;22. With no SUPS workers in my area thanks to the Howard government's cuts, how is the information going to filter through to the agencies in my electorate? The answer is obvious: it just won't.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I also am extremely disturbed at this government's treatment of one of the most highly respected disability organisations in my state—the Spastic Centre of New South Wales. In researching this issue, I discovered that a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Family Services said:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          The Spastic Centre of NSW is not in favour of schemes such as the SNSS. This is because they prefer a specific approach to helping children with
          <break page="6782" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           disabilities as opposed to the mainstream/inclusive approach that is encompassed in the SNSS.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          What hogwash! I can assure members that nothing is further from the truth. The Spastic Centre of New South Wales encourages the integration of disabled children into society. If the New South Wales Spastic Centre has any qualms about the program, it is not because it does not want disabled children integrated; rather, it is because of a lack of information from the government about the scheme and about ensuring that funding is secured after a child is placed in care.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There is a definite need in Australia for a funding scheme to help integrate our disabled children into mainstream child-care centres. But the Howard government has well and truly dropped the ball with its special needs subsidy scheme. If the government is sincere in wanting to make a difference for these kids and for Australian families in this situation, it had better look at the issues again and this time address them properly.

        (1) &amp; (2) Department of Administrative Services' records show that since entering the Ministry Senator Vanstone has undertaken only one overseas trip. That trip was to Malaysia, Indonesia and India between 18 and 26 October 1996, and the cost to date is $35,720. This cost covered accommodation, meals, telephone and fax calls, airfares, passport costs, health vaccinations and trip associated medication, baggage insurance, car hire, ground transport, incidentals and official hospitality.

        (3) Not at this point. Consistent with Government policy, Senator Vanstone, will look to the opportunity to use frequent flyer points to offset the cost of official travel wherever possible. The opportunity to redeem points, however, is restricted by the airlines' conditions, e.g. not all flights have seats available for frequent flyer use, not all destinations can be reached using a specific carrier and their partner airlines, and there are `block out' periods by the airlines (peak times) when no seats are available.

        The advice of the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's Department is that ILO Convention No. 29, Forced Labour, 1930 and the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966, (ICCPR), do not contain a specific provision indicating whether a penalty is to be defined as a penal sanction as well as the loss of rights or privileges. The answer depends upon the interpretation of the term `forced or compulsory labour'. The view of the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's Department on whether any particular circumstances might comprise `forced or compulsory labour' for the purpose of the Convention and the ICCPR will depend upon the nature of those particular circumstances.

        (7) As a result of the concerns raised by the Chiorny case, I have asked the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to undertake a review of procedures for recording interviews. However, the nature of interviews carried out by departmental officers at airports varies greatly, and may be as simple as asking one or two questions to clarify a person's personal details in order to ensure that they are processed rapidly. Tape recording interviews at airports may not always be practicable, and could inconvenience passengers unnecessarily. Other means of recording interviews, such as taking notes and producing written reports, will continue to be used where appropriate.

         The grant entitlement for councils is calculated according to the provisions of the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995 which broadly provides that the grants are adjusted in line with movements in the State general revenue assistance which in turn are subject to a rise/fall adjustment for inflation and population growth. As a result, the actual entitlement cannot be finally determined until the end of the financial year when these variables are known. Because of this, councils are paid on the basis of an estimated grant entitlement. The grant actually paid to a council in a particular year reflects the estimated grant entitlement and adjustments for under or over payments from the previous year.

Grants Commissions are required to use methodologies for distributing grants that are consistent with the requirements of the Act.

        (1) No. Australia presently has no such treaties with the countries mentioned. However, I am pleased to advise that the International Transfer of Prisoners Bill 1997 was passed by the Senate on 29 May 1997. This is the first step towards facilitating Australia's participation in international transfer of prisoners. Before such transfers can begin, the participating Australian States and Territories will first have to enact complementary legislation, appropriate administrative arrangements between those States and Territories and the Commonwealth will have to be made and Australia will have to enter into transfer agreements with the other countries involved.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (2) Yes. Preliminary negotiations have commenced on a Prisoner Transfer Treaty with Thailand.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (3) The scheme will be based on the `receiver pays' principle generally favoured in most international prisoner transfer schemes. In practice that will mean that the participating State and Territory Governments will meet the costs of transferring prisoners to Australia and maintaining them while they complete their sentences. The Commonwealth will meet the costs of administering the scheme. When a prisoner is transferred out of Australia to another country, that country will meet the relevant costs.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        No precise estimate of the costs involved in the scheme can be given at this stage as no firm prediction can be made about the numbers of prisoners who will be transferring to and from Australia. Such matters will only become apparent
        <break page="6804" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         once the scheme has been operating for a while. It is considered, however, that overall it is more likely to result in savings to the Australian taxpayer as it is likely that more prisoners will be transferred overseas than will be returned to Australia. If that happens there will be a net reduction in Australia' s prison population and hence reduced costs overall.

        (1) There are no official forecasts on employment by firm size. However, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) collects data on employment intentions through its Business Expectations Survey. Employment intentions are expressed in full-time equivalent terms and therefore, the number of expected jobs may be underestimated. According to the latest results from this survey, businesses are expecting full-time equivalent employment to rise by 0.5 per cent between the March quarter 1997 and the March quarter 1998. All sizes of businesses are expecting a rise, with
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         the greatest increase of 0.6 per cent in full-time equivalent employment being expected by large businesses. Small and medium businesses are both expecting an increase of 0.4 per cent.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Care needs to be taken in interpreting the results of the Business Expectations Survey. The survey reports expectations only, not actual outcomes. The survey also measures employment growth in existing businesses only and does not capture employment growth resulting from the creation of new businesses.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (2) It is not possible to provide data on layoffs in business since December 1996. However, the ABS collects limited data in the monthly Labour Force Survey on persons laid off from work. These data are not restricted to businesses, ie they include layoffs from the public sector and only cover persons who are unemployed, and who worked full-time for two weeks or more in the past two years.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        In May 1997, there were 162,700 persons who were currently unemployed and had left a fulltime job that lasted for two weeks or more sometime in the previous two years as a result of being laid off or retrenched.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        The ABS also conducts a Labour Mobility Survey as a supplement to the Labour Force Survey once every two years. The latest of these surveys was conducted in February 1996. According to the survey, 417,800 persons were laid off in the 12 months to February 1996. Once again, the data are not restricted to layoffs in business.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (3) The ABS has no immediate plans to collect additional data on layoffs. However, the next Labour Mobility Survey is due to be conducted in February 1998 and this will provide data on the number of people who were laid off in the previous 12 months. Results from this survey ae expected to be released in June 1998.

        (1) (a) The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) introduced an enhanced inspection program for livestock carriers because of two specific incidents involving livestock carriers that had loaded at Australian ports:

        During the inspection, the specialist team can now pay more attention to the closing arrangements associated with bow and stern doors, cargo ports and similar openings and make sure the ship complies with the AMSA approved Livestock Capacity Plan as specified in Marine Orders Part 43. Under the enhanced inspection program, a ships' Livestock Capacity Plan Certificate of Approval, which permits livestock carriers to trade in Australia, can be withdrawn by AMSA if defects revealed in inspections are not rectified by the dates stipulated.

        2 (a) Three vessels have been inspected under the enhanced inspections program and it is too early to come to any conclusions about the results of the new program. However, AMSA considers that the newly formed team has enabled more thorough examinations of livestock carriers and has ensured that those carriers are complying with relevant international conventions and Marine Orders Part 43.

        Requests from serving members for service and medical records are generally processed quickly, as the member normally provides the necessary information (number, rank and name) to speedily locate the records.

        The processing of requests for veterans medical records generally takes longer as veterans medical records are held by the Australian Archives and must be called for when a request is received. In some cases, a medical record may be held by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, in which case the Service must request the records from the State office of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Again, this process may take a few days to several months and is determined by the number of requests received and the staff available in the medical records sections of the three Services. However, when it is known that a veteran has an urgent need of documents, the Services will provide that request with a priority.

The figure for summonses issued for multiple voting at the 1996 general election are as at 20 June 1997. The difference between these failure to vote figures and those shown in answer to (1) above is that these are the total numbers of summonses issued and include summonses which could not be served and prosecutions which were discontinued.

        There is no single fuel efficiency target for the OECD, and there are currently no formal fuel consumption or carbon dioxide limits for motor vehicles within the European Union. However, a proposed target for 2005 of 5.0 litres per 100 km for petrol cars is currently being considered. In Japan, there is a voluntary system of targets which are set for six different weight classes of passenger vehicles. The average of the six targets set for 2000 is 7.4 litres per 100 km. In both Canada and Germany, a voluntary system of targets is in place. Table 3 shows fuel efficiency targets (and proposals) for a range of OECD countries.

        (1) Defence will sell bases or establishments which become surplus to its requirements. In the case of RAAF bases, the Defence Efficiency Review identified bases at Richmond, Wagga, Fairbairn and Point Cook for consideration for possible disposal in the medium term (2001&amp;hyphen;2006). The disposal program is driven primarily by the requirement to achieve operating cost savings through consolidation of similar functions and rationalisation of bases. The Government will make a decision in the future on the disposal of individual bases following detailed studies of the feasibility, costs and benefits of the various functions and base activities. RAAF Fairbairn will also be considered in the context of the sale of Canberra airport under Phase 2 of the Federal Airports sales process.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (2) The RAAF bases at Richmond and Williamtown have the capacity to handle domestic passenger jets although ground facilities are rudimentary. The capacity to service civil air traffic is lacking, apron parking is minimal, and ground support and refuelling facilities would require upgrading. Williamtown has a civil terminal for commuter&amp;hyphen;type aircraft. Any proposal to operate domestic jet aircraft from either base would be subject to military operations and airspace considerations.

        Charges for directory assistance are not prohibited under the Telstra Corporation Act 1991 introduced by the previous Government in 1991. In passing the 1997 telecommunications legislation, the Parliament debated the question of charging for directory assistance and decided not to rule it out as a possibility.

        Because of their significance to the community, possible directory assistance charges are, however, subject to notification and disallowance under the Telstra Corporation Act 1991. This means that Telstra is required to formally notify the Minister for Communications and the Arts of any proposal to introduce directory assistance charges. The Minister has the power to disallow proposed directory charges. The Minister may only do so, if, after receiving and considering a report from the independent regulator, the ACCC, the Minister

        On 2 July 1997, Telstra made a formal submission to the Government proposing a charge of 50 cents for 013 directory assistance inquiries. The charge would only apply to numbers already in the customer's local White Pages and would not apply to customers who cannot read, hold or use a directory or to inquiries from payphones. Amongst other things, the charge would be balanced by a $5.40 reduction in the annual basic line rental charge. The charge would commence from 1 January 1998.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Telstra has proposed the charge because of the significant and increasing cost of providing directory assistance, currently around $210m, in the absence of any user charges. The majority of inquiries relate to numbers already listed in the White Pages.

        In accordance with the notification and disallowance procedures under the Telstra Corporation Act 1991, the Minister has referred Telstra's proposal to the ACCC for its report. The ACCC must report to the Minister within 30 days. Telstra's proposal will receive the closest scrutiny.
