           —The recommendations contained in this report represent another development of the Main Committee to meet the needs of members. In 1993 the Procedure Committee first recommended the establishment of a committee to consider a second stream of business and provide more time for members to contribute to debates on government legislation. Since then a number of changes have been made to make the Main Committee more flexible and to expand the opportunities for members to express their views on all the matters which come before the House. Debates on committee reports and government papers have proved successful innovations.

         </talk.start>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This report recommends a further extension of the type of business conducted in the Main Committee. It proposes that each Thursday in the Main Committee a 15&amp;hyphen;minute period of members' 90&amp;hyphen;second statements be held at the
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           beginning of the meeting and a half hour adjournment debate take place at the end.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The recommendations are the result of an inquiry into whether members need more opportunity to make short speeches on unspecified matters of concern to them and, if so, whether the Main Committee could be used for this purpose. The inquiry was prompted by a letter from a member which noted the limited opportunities for members to speak in the adjournment debate in the House.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The committee gathered the views of members on the issue through a questionnaire. The responses to the questionnaire indicated support for an expansion of opportunities to raise matters in short speeches and showed a preference, among those responding, for an adjournment debate style procedure. The committee also saw virtue in using a well&amp;hyphen;tested and familiar procedure and in maintaining a degree of consistency between the procedures used in the House and the Main Committee.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Under the proposal, an adjournment debate would take place only on Thursday for a maximum of 30 minutes. The flexibility to commence the debate earlier or to negative the adjournment to complete an item of business would be retained, as in the House. Ministers would also have the same opportunity to extend the debate for up to 10 minutes to respond to matters raised. The committee recognised that the introduction of an adjournment debate would represent an extension of the type of debate which has been conducted in the Main Committee so far.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The guiding principle of the Main Committee is cooperation. Only business on which it is hoped agreement can be reached is referred to the Main Committee. However, this does not mean that debate in the Main Committee should not be lively or spirited or that members cannot introduce controversial matter into their speeches. The standing orders governing the operation of the Main Committee ensure that real disagreement on how its business should be conducted effectively stops its operation. This principle has been upheld by the proposal that any disagreement on the
          <break page="9178" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           question of the adjournment would automatically close the committee down.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Despite the risk of introducing this different style of procedure into the Main Committee, the committee saw a number of possible benefits apart from increasing the opportunities for members to raise issues of concern to them and relieving the pressure on the adjournment debate in the House. This step would help to mitigate the perception that the Main Committee is of lower status than the House. It might also encourage livelier, more spontaneous debate, especially given the smaller, more intimate nature of the Main Committee seating arrangements. The more members who participate in the proceedings of the Main Committee and the more people who watch or listen to it, the greater its level of effectiveness and acceptance will be.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          At this stage it is recommended that the adjournment debate be introduced into the Main Committee on a trial basis so that its effects can be assessed before instituting a more permanent arrangement. The recommendation for a period of 90&amp;hyphen;second statements in the Main Committee is also proposed on a trial basis. There was some disagreement among committee members as to whether members' statements would be as effective in the Main Committee but we agreed that the best way to assess the demand for this procedure was to give it a trial.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is proposed to have the Main Committee meet 15 minutes earlier at 9.45 a.m. on Thursdays and allow 90&amp;hyphen;second statements until 10 o'clock. Both the proposals contained in this report were prompted by representations from members, both formally and informally. They are an opportunity to make better and different use of the Main Committee. I hope that, should they be implemented, members will support them in the right spirit. I commend the report to the House.

           , from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure essentially brings together two different elements of parliamentary practice and procedure. The first relates to the opportunities for ordinary
           <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
            members of the House to raise issues of concern to them—frequently, although not exclusively, matters concerning issues in their own electorates or concerning their own constituents.

          </para>
         </talk.start>
         <para first-indent="16">
          For a long time there has been difficulty in providing adequate debating opportunities for members to raise these issues. The opportunity which most members take advantage of is the adjournment debate. As a member of the opposition, I know that there is usually quite a keen contest for opportunities to speak on the adjournment debate. Indeed, I dare say that from the government side—certainly government members of the Procedure Committee indicated this—the situation is a good deal worse: for government members the opportunity to raise issues from their electorates does not necessarily arise as frequently as they would wish.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The Procedure Committee had approaches from government members and was also mindful of the comments by the member for Chifley (Mr Price), who had previously proposed that the Main Committee meet between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. on Monday and Tuesday to discuss constituency statements. We have endeavoured with this proposal to allow for additional adjournment debate opportunities so that more members than presently do have the opportunity to raise adjournment issues in the House via the Main Committee. The specific proposal is that each Thursday in the Main Committee a 15&amp;hyphen;minute period of members' 90&amp;hyphen;second statements be held at the beginning of the meeting and that a half&amp;hyphen;hour adjournment debate take place at the end. So this is about giving members additional speaking opportunities.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The other thing that needs to be noted is that it involves a broader role for the Main Committee. The Main Committee has been established only in the last few years and its role is still an evolving and, to some extent, experimental one. It has been confined to matters which are not controversial or not contested. It is not possible to have a vote in the Main Committee, so clearly that is a place where we cannot move amendments and the like. Nevertheless, it has proved to be a worthwhile debating forum, and what is being
          <break page="9179" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           proposed here involves an extension of the role of the Main Committee.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There is an element of experiment or trial and error about this because it is clear that the Main Committee can function only on the basis of cooperation. For example, if either the government or opposition members leave the Main Committee, they deprive it of a quorum and it cannot continue to function. It is possible that, in certain adjournment debates or other circumstances, members will get upset about what is being said and will deprive the Main Committee of a quorum. So the Main Committee will have to continue to function on a consensus basis, and in putting forward the report the members of the Procedure Committee are mindful of that. We are keen to see that consensus basis continue. Nevertheless, we do feel that the Main Committee may be able to do more work than it is presently doing. The addition of the 90&amp;hyphen;second statements and the adjournment debate opportunity will provide scope to do this.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This is a move which has been the subject of a survey on opportunities for members to raise matters. The overwhelming number of members who were surveyed on this issue did feel that they needed more opportunities to raise issues and did support the idea of additional adjournment debate time. From our survey we got back 57 responses from MPs and of those some 45 members or 79 per cent said that the present speaking opportunities to raise constituency matters were not adequate. When we asked them the next question—whether they would support an extension of the sittings of the Main Committee for a half&amp;hyphen;hour debate of an adjournment kind—some 86 per cent or 49 of those who responded said that they would like such an opportunity, and a majority of those believed that it should be a five&amp;hyphen;minute opportunity so that it mirrored the present debate which takes place in the House of Representatives.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Similarly, the majority of responses—some 63 per cent of those surveyed—said that they would support additional discussion in the Main Committee enabling opportunities for constituency statements or 90&amp;hyphen;second statements. So, with that level of support from members of parliament, I would hope that the

          Each of these reports results from seminars held by the joint standing committee. I think the seminars are a very useful way to look at a foreign policy or defence issue. We conducted these over the winter and, while the seminars do not necessarily provide the same opportunities for detailed scrutiny as a full inquiry, the seminar process certainly enabled us to bring together a diverse range of individuals and groups to discuss the significance of each of the issues.

          The dialogue between all of the participants is extremely constructive, and one of the major benefits at each of the seminars was the interchange of ideas between people from quite different backgrounds and points of view. The committee has held a series of these seminars since July 1996, and I think all of us feel that not only has it been worth while from our point of view but I am glad to report to the House that we have had very

          I would like to make some brief comments on each of the reports, and hopefully will have a further opportunity in the Main Committee to debate each of the subjects as I believe they deserve. The first seminar dealt with a review of the Australian aid program by the committee chaired by Mr Paul Simons. The seminar was held at the request of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The report itself, as members will remember, was released in early May. At that time the minister undertook that there would be a period of wide public consultation before the report was considered by government. Our seminar was one of many seminars and conferences on the subject held around the country.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The committee was very pleased to have all of the members of the Simons committee present at the seminar, and indeed they all participated fully—Paul Simons, Gaye Hart and Professor Cliff Walsh—and also the Director&amp;hyphen;General of AusAID, Trevor Kanaley, and a significant number of his staff. We were also pleased that the Head of the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD, Mr James Michel, who was visiting Australia at the time, was able to join us and contribute to our discussions.
         </para>

          The Simons review is the first major review of the development assistance program since the Jackson report of the early 1980s. It was the general feeling that reviews of this kind need to be done somewhat more regularly—a 13&amp;hyphen;year gap is too great. One of the recommendations of the Simons committee endorsed by the joint standing committee was for the establishment of an advisory board to assist AusAID management in the direction of the

          The seminar did not set out to cover all aspects of the Simons report. Anyone who has examined that report will know that it is an extremely comprehensive examination of the aid program. However, the seminar did look at issues such as overseas trends in development assistance; refocusing the aid program, taking into account geographic and sectoral factors; soft loans and concessional financing; the question of whether Australian aid should be untied; and the whole issue of NGOs and their role in the Australian aid program.

          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           One clear objective: Poverty reduction through sustainable development.
          </emphasis>
          The joint committee supports the concept that a prime motivation for a development assistance program is humanitarian. But the committee is concerned that too narrow a definition of poverty might be adopted. Development assistance encompasses a range of activities designed to improve the standard of living of people in developing countries, through infrastructure projects, educational activities or assistance to micro enterprises, as well as immediate assistance to those suffering from hunger and homelessness. The committee agrees that assistance should be through sustainable development activities. The committee also acknowledges that other policy objectives may be met through the aid program, without detracting from its fundamental purpose. After all, a fundamental purpose of aid is to satisfy the taxpayers that the expenditure of those funds is to the advantage of Australia.

          The joint standing committee has made 15 recommendations in all regarding the Simons review and the general running of the aid program. The committee remains concerned about the obvious resource implications, both staffing and budgetary, for AusAID should all of the recommendations of the Simons review be instituted. This will obviously be a matter of great importance for the government at this time of budgetary restrictions, but will have

          The second report deals with the ANZUS alliance. The seminar on the ANZUS alliance, held in August 1997, assembled some of the most pre&amp;hyphen;eminent and authoritative speakers from Australia and the United States, and of course some from New Zealand, to share their views on the current status, relevance and future prospects for this security treaty. The alliance with the United States continues to be fundamental in Australia's defence agreements. Few dispute this. The previous government's defence white paper accepted the value of the US alliance as a key element of Australia's defence policy, and this government's recently released foreign and trade white paper reaffirms the importance of this relationship.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The seminar sought to inform the parliament, and the wider public, through open discussion of all the provisions and implications of those provisions of the treaty. The one great internal change in ANZUS since its inception has come about because of the adoption by New Zealand of its prohibition of ship visits by nuclear powered vessels. Discussion took place on current New Zealand defence policies, regrettably without official representation from the New Zealand government. As I mentioned, there were participants from New Zealand there. New Zealand's suspension from trilateral activities is an unresolved issue for the alliance, although this apparently is of greater concern to Australia than to the United States or New Zealand.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The committee, in reporting its views of the seminar, chose to keep its remarks brief. In so doing, the words of the individual speakers have been allowed to stand by themselves. While individually noteworthy, these presentations collectively provide a comprehensive overview of the alliance and of its continuing value not just for Australia but also for the United States, and for regional nations. Following two days of discussions, the consensus emerged that there remains for Australia distinct advantage in maintaining the ANZUS relationship.

          <break page="9182" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Edinburgh, it is particularly relevant. The committee was interested in examining whether the Commonwealth remains quite as relevant in the post&amp;hyphen;apartheid era and in the post&amp;hyphen;Cold War period and, indeed, whether it is of even more relevance given the momentous changes in the international arena that have occurred over the last decade. The Commonwealth has changed in many ways since it was called the British Commonwealth, and it was quickly apparent to the committee that a number of misconceptions still exist about the organisation.

          I conclude my remarks by thanking once again all those who gave their time to participate in these seminars. In particular, I would like to thank the secretariat of the joint committee, Joanne Towner and all those who were contributors to this process. The committee has found the seminar process to be a most useful means of exploring issues in a comparatively short time frame, and believes the reports contain a number of issues that merit full consideration by government. I regret that I have so little time to deal with them, but I do commend the three reports to the House.

           Sharpening the focus

          , that one needs to consider that this was done against the backdrop of a disastrous initiative by the new Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) in abolishing DIFF and a number of other funding mechanisms for our region that caused an absolute uproar. As has been pointed out, the Simons committee is the first review of overseas aid in 13 years since the Jackson report.

          When we think of overseas aid, it really is an investment in humanity. It is a small contribution that we make but if we wish to be good world corporate citizens, as I would hope all Australians would want to be, it is a very small investment in humanity. I know that my party is reconsidering a couple of the important issues addressed by the Simons committee and they include the quantum, or level, that we should really set in terms of overseas aid. Like the chairman, I have difficulty with just one focus for overseas aid. I certainly believe, although I commend poverty reduction of course, that sometimes overseas aid should have a broader focus than just that.

          The seminar on ANZUS was very important because there is no more fundamental agreement or arrangement for our national security, and it is really interesting, as has been pointed out, that it has survived New Zealand dropping out of what was a tripartite arrangement because of its objection to ships visiting with a nuclear capability. I thought the seminar certainly benefited from lots of illustrious contributions and, indeed, even the chairman's
          <break page="9183" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           illustrious contribution in one session, but I would also like to commend to people the contribution by the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, who gave an excellent overview of the Labor years and the future. The present government suggests that it has already, in 18 months, improved the Australian&amp;hyphen;American alliance. I have got no doubt that it has put a great emphasis on that, but it is very false to suggest that there was somehow not a pre&amp;hyphen;existing, excellent relationship contributed to by a number of defence ministers.

          We do not do enough to publicise the importance of the ANZUS treaty and the benefits that accrue to all Australians through it. I am one of those who believe that into the future we need to be looking at new and different ways of strengthening it. If I have one particular fear it is that the treaty is far more important to Australia than it is to America. I believe, without in any way denigrating the strength of the current relationship, that in defence and strategic terms we probably need to move to become just a little more self&amp;hyphen;sufficient than we currently are and perhaps not quite so dependent on the United States of America, but the US is the last remaining superpower that we want to move closer to. I do not dispute that we want to have the joint operations and interoperability, and I see all these things as beneficial.

As none of the treaties dealt with in this report raised particular issues of concern to the committee, in each case we have recommended ratification as proposed.

In a number of cases this was the only consultation which took place, in spite of the fact that there are well&amp;hyphen;known bodies which should have been given the opportunity to put their views forward.

          The treaty and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, CITES, was one of the more interesting groups of those tabled on 26 August. There were a number of wide&amp;hyphen;ranging amendments that Australia supported. One that attracted some media attention was a decision not to support amendments which would have downgraded and down&amp;hyphen;listed the species in three African countries. Under that convention, Australia could have lodged an objection but to do so would have made us effectively a non&amp;hyphen;party for trade in the products of that species; that is, the import of ivory and the products mainly of elephants. The minister indicated that he thought that we would have weakened our position rather than strengthened it and I think the committee agreed with that in relation to that treaty. Accordingly, Australia will retain its ban on the trade of ivory and on elephant products under this treaty. While this is unlikely to have a significant effect, tourists may seek to bring souvenirs and small items made from elephant hide into the country.

           The issue of consultation that the chairman dealt with needs to be addressed. It keeps coming up in the committee's work that consultation does not seem to be occurring. The government structured this joint house committee because of the view, under the Labor government, that there was not enough consultation on the treaty making process. I concur. It is very important that there is more consultation with state governments, industry groups and community groups that are interested in various treaties by the government departments dealing with these treaties, prior to their ratification. There is certainly a major lack of consultation and it needs to be rectified.

           I am sure the committee will be looking at this issue. As the chairman said—and I agree with him—the committee should not be a rubber stamp for the executive but should be acting as a house committee to make sure that those groups have access to consultation.

           Many people would be aware of the role the AEC plays in conducting federal elections approximately every three years, but few would realise that between those federal elections they undertake many hundreds of elections on behalf of trade unions and employer organisations.
           <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
            The bulk of those elections are conducted without much fuss or controversy, although there have been some notable exceptions over the years.

           To many people it may seem quite remarkable that my committee has been able to produce a unanimous report on such an inquiry. It is one of the unfortunate aspects of politics that the general public does not get to hear often enough of the cooperation that does occur between all political sides a lot of the time. This report is one of those occasions. I believe that the committee has put together a number of recommendations that will further improve the electoral processes in industrial elections.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The inquiry attracted 39 submissions and we held six public hearings. The report includes 18 recommendations. I would have to say that part of the reason there was agreement within the committee was that there was considerable agreement between the various organisations making submissions. The ACTU and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry were not at loggerheads on the terms of reference, for example.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           One of our recommendations is that the rolls should be cut off 30 to 60 days before the opening of nominations. We have made this recommendation primarily to allow the returning officer ample time to put together the best possible roll. Few would disagree that many rolls in years past have left a lot to be desired. The ACTU agreed that something should be done and felt that a cut&amp;hyphen;off date between one and three months was reasonable.

           I mentioned the 1994 CEPU election, on which we received some evidence. It was expected, as it was a recent example of an election invalidated by the courts. However, we were not swayed to recommend attendance ballots as a result of the obvious fraud that took place in that particular election. We are of the view that a number of our recommendations will assist in overcoming some of the illegal activities that occurred.

         It was Graham Richardson, a former Labor minister for health, who said that if private health insurance fell below 40 per cent the health system had a big problem, because it put extra pressure on the public hospital system. Today the number of Australians covered by private health insurance is 31.9 per cent, nearly 10 points lower than the level which Mr Richardson said was the danger point. In 1983 when Labor was elected the level of private health insurance was around 63.7 per cent.

         This motion urges the House to acknowledge a number of points and take action to improve our health system for the benefit of the Australian people and the generations of Australians to follow. No doubt some decisions that need to be taken may not be politically expedient, but it is time for politicians and electors alike to acknowledge that decisions need to be taken in the context of what is right and necessary, and not what will win or lose the decision maker votes.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is no doubt that Australia's health system is reliant upon both successful private and public health insurance sectors. Graham Richardson acknowledged that, as I mentioned at the commencement of this debate, and it is imperative that the policies of government provide for and encourage the development and success of both private and public health insurance. If one of them falls apart, then the whole system will start to fall apart.

         Therefore, I believe it is essential that there are changes made to Medicare which need to

          be taken to provide for its long&amp;hyphen;term sustainability. Further, we need greater incentives for private health insurance so that the industry is confident also of long&amp;hyphen;term sustainability such that both systems complement each other to provide Australia with the best health system available.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is the basis for this motion: to get the House to acknowledge that what is needed are policies which will ensure the viability of private health, policies which will reduce the burden that is presently on Medicare and policies which provide a safety net for those who can least afford to look after their health.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I have recently surveyed my constituents on a number of issues, including health. The vast majority support the concept of and want private health insurance; however, they want a greater incentive to join. They have told me they want incentives such as gap insurance, full tax deductibility or a reduced or negated Medicare levy for those who join private health insurance.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When two-thirds of people drop out of private health insurance because of price and 13 per cent drop out because of the inability to get gap insurance, then these statistics should be addressed. These matters need to be taken into consideration in the context of health policy formulation and all options need to be considered by the government and the opposition. Ignoring them will see the continued exodus from private health insurance and an increased burden on Medicare.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I shall state at this stage that I applaud the establishment of Medicare. It was a good policy in 1983-84. Now, however, I fear that Medicare in the form in which it was established and the purpose for which it was established has just about reached its use&amp;hyphen;by date. Unfortunately, one reason for its having reached its use&amp;hyphen;by date is that, after its establishment by the then Labor government, the health policy of the Labor Party was to sit back and do nothing.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         After Medicare was established we literally had from 1984 to 1997 an exodus from private health insurance which placed an ever increasing burden on the public health system. During that time, despite acknowledgments from the then government that private health
         <break page="9188" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          insurance was important for our health system, nothing was done to stop the exodus. Nothing was done to provide for the long&amp;hyphen;term sustainability of Medicare. We have had their former ministers acknowledge—Brian Howe had and Graham Richardson has—that they should have done something. It is too little, too late, I am afraid. Now is the time for action and that is what this motion calls for.

         While Medicare perhaps catered for the health needs of our nation in the early 1980s, it is insufficient to adequately cater for our nation's health needs as we approach a new millennium. While my motion supports the private health insurance initiative of the Howard government, I am not so naive as to believe that it is enough, but a step in the right direction is better than taking no step at all, or indeed even walking backwards.

         Today's debate is also an opportunity for members opposite to enunciate the health policy of the Democrat Labor Party, or at least the principles of a health policy and, in particular, the extent of its commitment to private health insurance. The Democrat Labor Party must today tell Australians whether it supports a health system where the public health sector is complemented with private health, or does it believe that Australia's millionaires and rich should be subsidised by Australia's battlers? I note the shadow  minister will not be speaking in this particular debate, which is a shame, because I am sure Australians would like to know what Labor's health policy is and how they intend to fund it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It cannot be denied that aspects of Medicare are akin to welfare. For example, the provision of bulk&amp;hyphen;billing to all Australians is an extension of welfare to Australia's rich, even though they do not need welfare. If we only bulk&amp;hyphen;billed those who required it—pensioners, unemployed, low income earners and for the treatment of children under two—there would be more funding for public hospitals. Doctors have been vocal of late about withdrawing bulk&amp;hyphen;billing across the board. That would only hurt the battlers in the community. That is why, as with every other form of welfare, bulk&amp;hyphen;billing should be means tested. All of us
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          here can be bulk&amp;hyphen;billed just like pensioners, but we do not need bulk&amp;hyphen;billing, whereas pensioners do.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is the farce of the system. Those who can afford to cater for their health needs are using scarce public health money, restricting those who desperately require the services of our public health system from getting their much needed treatment. Where is the incentive for those to go into private health insurance? The incentive is to use and abuse the public system. Medicare provides free treatment to those who can afford to pay. Certain aspects of Medicare are basically health welfare and as such should be provided on the same terms as other welfare in this country, that is, the provision should be means tested.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I do not believe that our health system is sustainable without private health insurance. That is why we need policies that encourage membership of private health insurance. It was the ideological bankruptcy of the previous government which prohibited the progress of our health system. I say to the Democrat Labor Party: do not let your ideology stop your supporting something that is essential for the survival of our health system—that is, the private health insurance industry.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I will quote from a speech made by the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) last year. He said that the support of private health insurance `is not an ideological end in itself; it is a simple, practical, commonsense way of ensuring that state public hospitals survive'. A rejection of the necessity for private health insurance in our country will be a rejection of our battlers, who require the public system so desperately.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Accordingly, I call on the House to support the incentives provided by the Howard government for people to maintain private health insurance. While it may not see people start rejoining, it will at least start to put a base on the exodus from private health insurance, which the former government deliberately and negligently ignored.
        </para>

         Furthermore, it is essential for private health insurers to do all they can to minimise any premium increases which may force Australians to reconsider their membership. The insurers know as much as anyone their im

          portance to the national health system, and they will increase premiums at their own peril. However, the ultimate burden is on the government to maintain a health system which is rock solid and fulfils the need of Australians. Our health system has not done that for some time. Notwithstanding the measures of the last two budgets to improve our health system, it seems that more needs to be done.

         Following the election of the Labor government in 1983, a tax summit was held to attempt to find a consensus to improve the tax system.

Perhaps it is now time for something similar for our health system, with an eye to ensuring the sustainability of the system based on the public health system being complemented with a private health system.

           the member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron), came forward with absolutely nothing in the way of suggestions which would solve the kinds of problems that he was referring to. I and other members are happy to support any motion before the House which recognises the intrinsic value of the private health insurance system in Australia. Quite clearly, Australians want choice in health insurance. Labor governments have given them that choice—first through the establishment of Medibank under the Whitlam government and, a decade later, through Medicare under the Hawke government.

         Choice means the capacity to realistically choose one of a number of alternatives. If people cannot afford private health insurance, then they do not have a real choice in private health insurance. Indeed, my recollection is that, when the Hawke government came to power, some two million Australians were without health insurance of any kind at all. They were uninsured. The choice was entirely meaningless so far as they were concerned.

         That is one of the reasons why Medicare enjoys very widespread public support in Australia. It is something that political conservatives in Australia are not anxious to admit, but it is beyond dispute. It took them a long time in opposition to recognise it. After their 1993 election loss—their most serious election loss—opposition leaders were coming out and saying, `We have to recognise what people want. People do want Medicare, so we are no longer going to put up a policy of scrapping, dismantling and whittling away Medicare.'

         The government committed itself to bolstering private health insurance rates by offering a rebate. It is a fact of history that the value of that rebate has vaporised in the space of just a few months. What we have seen is $1.7 billion of taxpayers' money being hosed up against the wall, disappearing in a stampede of premium rises. What is fascinating about all this is the new language of the minister for health. Until last week, the government was happy for the success of its health policy to be judged by its success in stopping the decline in private health membership.

         What the Labor Party wants is more affordable private health insurance premiums, and affordability is affected by two things. First, and most obviously, it is a function of price.

          prices. For example, at the end of last year I was approached by a distressed constituent who was having great difficulty affording a premium rise of 18 per cent.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Affordability is not only a function of price, it is also a function of income. This is a point that I do not think has been sufficiently understood by the government. Recently, there was an article by Ted Waters, general manager of Mercantile Mutual Life Insurance, entitled `Aging and health care costs: who pays the piper?' I would recommend that article to all members. Over the next 50 years, health costs in this country are likely to double—mainly as a consequence of our ageing population and also as a consequence of advances in medical technology—from under nine per cent of GDP today to 17 per cent in the year 2041. Referring to the National Commission of Audit, Ted Waters contends:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Based on current projections health expenditure will rise from the current levels of 15% of the federal government budget to 30% by 2041.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         There is an overwhelming probability that government thinking on health care will have to change dramatically before then because I do not think any member of this House would honestly believe that the federal budget could sustain 30 per cent outlays on health for any period of time. The increase in health services expenditure is closely related to the ageing of the Australian population. Waters wrote:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         The weighted health service consumption rate of males are doubled for an 85 year old compared with a 70 year old and in turn the 70 year old consumes twice the health services of a 50 year old.

        <para style="Para">
         Currently, 13.5 per cent of health fund members are aged over 65 with a projected rise to 23 per cent by the year 2010. It goes without saying that older people, as the highest consumers of health services, are the group in Australia most interested in maintaining the coverage. At the same time, many in this group on fixed incomes are the least able to afford that cover.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I indicated earlier that private health insurance coverage is determined in part by affordability. Older people are encouraged, through a greater incidence of ill health, to take it out but discouraged to take it out because of their fixed incomes. The challenge for government is to look at ways of ensuring that retirement incomes are adequate to permit older Australians that choice of health insurance. So the issues of private health insurance and superannuation policy are inextricably linked.

         <para first-indent="16">
          This parliament makes decisions that will affect the retirement incomes of Australians well into the next century and no discussion on the future of health insurance can proceed without, at some point, having regard to the likely retirement incomes of Australians into the next century.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The country's concerns about the private health insurance system are predicated on a notion of static retirement incomes, but what we really need to do is boost retirement incomes. Private health insurance has to be more affordable in future. How affordable depends in part on the efforts made by the government to boost superannuation.

          In Australia today we have direct payments by individuals accounting for 17 per cent of health services, which equates to $335 per man, woman and child in Australia. Waters postulates that this burden is going to rise dramatically in today's dollars in the years ahead. Where is this additional income going to come from?

         <para first-indent="16">
          Unfortunately, we see here not what the government can do, but what the government has chosen not to do. Last year, in a monumental backflip, the Howard government abandoned its election promise to match Labor's superannuation co&amp;hyphen;payment. Under Labor's scheme, employee contributions to superannuation are going to three per cent by 1999, a valuable addition to the nine per cent employer contribution being phased in. The government was committed to moving towards a 15 per cent superannuation payment rate by the year 2002. The Liberal Party, prior to the last election, endorsed Labor's plan for a government payment but, once in office, chose to scrap it and replace it with a mickey

Under the coalition plan, an employee who contributes $1,000 per annum to their own superannuation scheme receives a $150 rebate which they may or may not choose to put into the scheme. This means less being put aside for employees in their retirement. What we are going to have as a consequence is retirement incomes substantially lower when they need to be higher.

          —When Medicare was first established in 1984 it was designed to complement a strong private health system. When Labor were first elected in 1983 levels of private health cover stood at about 66 per cent. When they left office in 1996 that had fallen to 34 per cent. The actions of the previous Labor government directly led to the explosions in premiums in the mid&amp;hyphen;1980s and to the decline in private health coverage. Policy decisions, such as the abolition of the Commonwealth bed day subsidy for private hospital beds and the removal of the Commonwealth's contribution to the private re&amp;hyphen;insurance pool led to an explosion of premiums between 1996 and 1998 of over 40 per cent.

         As well as those two actions, changing the Medicare rebate from 85 per cent to 75 per cent for in&amp;hyphen;patient stays and the 1993 Medicare agreements which encourage public hospitals to increase their throughput of public patients at the expense of private patients—which push the private patients into the private hospitals—all led to rising premiums. Access Economics has estimated that those four policy decisions led to an increase in premiums of 39 per cent. Without those decisions, premiums today would be $30 a month lower.

         The government, in recognition of that, introduced two sides to its private health insurance policy. It has a carrot by way of incentives—$450 for a family, $250 for a couple, $125 for a single person—to take out or continue to hold private health insurance. It is worth pointing out that those incentives are available as not only a tax rebate but also a cheaper premium. Those people who do not pay tax just have to sign a statutory declaration saying they have private health insurance and they will be able to get a cheaper premium.

         Local unemployment in my electorate is already shocking, but the latest figures show that there are 20,500 people in my area looking for work—almost the number on offer nationally from the government's work for the dole scheme. We have a local unemployment level of 9.8 per cent. In the first 20 months of this government, the number of young people in full-time jobs has dropped by 73,000. With more than 200,000 young people looking for work, the Howard government should not be adopting strategies to destroy jobs.

         The technology associated with the Orbital Engine Corporation may well soon be lost to us. Better known as a Sarich engine, this technology includes a revolutionary fuel injection system and is applicable, at the very least, to power packs in cars, motor cycles and scooters and marine engines. The recent small production run of Ford Festiva vehicles fitted with the Orbital engine shows a reduction of 30 per cent in fuel consumption and a dramatic drop in greenhouse emissions to levels much lower than the toughest emission targets in the world.

          —In South Australia we just had the state election on 11 October 1996. The Australian Democrats recorded 16 per cent of the vote, which was their highest ever. Four days later, Cheryl Kernot, the Leader of the Australian Democrats, left that party to join the Labor Party—a decision that she apparently had reached two weeks earlier.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Normally, the decisions of federal leaders and what happens in state elections are unrelated. Why they are important here is that the Australian Democrats made ample use of Cheryl Kernot in their television advertising and in their posters. Cheryl Kernot was actually given a speaking part in their television advertising when their local leader was not. Kim Beazley also visited South Australia in the last week of the campaign. He already knew that the person the Democrats were using in their advertising was going to join the Labor Party.

         What Cheryl Kernot and the Leader of the Opposition need to explain is why they deceived the people of South Australia when they knew that the leader of the Australian Democrats was going to be joining the Labor Party. As Richard Alston said yesterday, if it had been a federal election she would have contravened the Commonwealth Electoral Act. She may well have contravened the state electoral act, but it is unlikely that will be prosecuted because it would only damage the Australian Democrats.

In Greenway there are over 120 different ethnic groups and over 25 per cent of the population was born overseas. Australia is built on the shoulders of people from every country. A majority of us have only been here for one or two generations.

We see the deep desire of these groups to fit into the Australian community. I am extremely proud to support these desires.

          —My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. Minister, have you told the Prime Minister that to pay the equivalent of a $100,000 up&amp;hyphen;front entry fee, older Australians would have to get $450 a week in rent for their homes? Is the minister aware that houses in Wollstonecraft may well rent for $450 a week, but what about those in Launceston? When is the government going to back down on these nursing home entry and daily fee arrangements?

I might take this opportunity to table it so you can have a look at your own figures and you can go away and come up with some answers. The member for North Sydney asked a reasonable and very sensible question. Let me make the point that the aged care legislation that tries to address this fundamental problem has passed the parliament with the support of the Democrats. Your newfound ally—she supported this legislation. What did the Democrats say? Let me quote

         And I must point out that there is general agreement throughout much of the aged care sector that the lack of capital care funding, in particular, for nursing homes, estimated to be approximately $800 million, identified by Professor Gregory constitutes nothing less than a crisis which must be urgently addressed.

         This bill was passed to deal with a crisis. John Ireland of Aged Care Australia, only last week, on 15 October, said:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         Aged Care Australia supports and has always supported the general thrust of the reforms. If we are to meet the growing numbers and the increasing expectations at this point in time I see no other option. There are other options in the longer term but we have a crisis in effect now.

         We do have a crisis. The former Minister for Finance knows that we have a crisis. The member for North Sydney knows we have a crisis. Until we can deal with these issues effectively, that crisis will get worse because

         Here are a couple of key points: 13 per cent of nursing homes have fire hazard problems; 11 per cent failed to meet health standards; 75 per cent failed to meet Australian design standards. That is why there has been a wholesale change in the approach to aged care in this country. That is why the former minister set up a committee—this is probably not well known—with all segments of the industry represented. Together they had a major impact on the development of this act. Furthermore, it passed through this place and it passed through the Senate, to the benefit of elderly Australians.

         What is important here is to recognise that, if we want to deal with the tidal wave of the change of demographic in this country, we have to have an upgrade in facilities. And this cannot be done by doing what you did: neglecting the issue. You cannot neglect this issue. You cannot neglect elderly Australians and hope just to run around as you have in the last couple of days and try to scare them. They deserve far better than that. This is why the aged care sector themselves recognise the problem. They recognise the crisis that is there and they know that we are the only ones that have the capacity to do something about it. And we will do it fairly.

         Let me outline again to the House the critical importance to Australia of the stance that my government is taking in relation to this issue. I repeat that there is a potential risk to up to 90,000 jobs in regional areas of

          Australia, that if the proposals of the European Union, which are absolutely unreasonable and are absolutely selfish and are absolutely indifferent to the interests of Australia, are adopted then there will be significant damage done to vast areas of regional Australia. What is interesting on this issue is the virtual silence, the deafening silence, of the Australian Labor Party on the issue of the national interest. Once again, when you have a choice between identifying with the mainstream Australian commitment to the national interest and siding with minority groups, the Australian Labor Party has chosen the latter.

         I would say to the critics of my government's policy both domestically and internationally that Australia has been in the past, is now and will be in the future willing to play her fair share in participating in achievable, realisable outcomes in relation to greenhouse gases. But one thing that Australia will not do under the leadership of this government is to accept an unfair share of the burden. That is what we are being asked to do, particularly by the Europeans, and that is what I am against, and that is what the vast majority of the mainstream of the Australian community is against. What the Australian community is against is any government selling out to the noise of a protesting minority. It is against any government surrendering to anything other than the national interest, and I can assure all members of the House that the policy that we will pursue in this area will continue to be exclusively dedicated to the national interest of Australia and not to the national interest of any other part of the world.

Your past in this area is that you deliberately, systematically, cold&amp;hyphen;bloodedly and calculatedly withdrew, year after year, capital support and you ran the nursing home infrastructure of this country into a dilapidated condition. When you were expelled from office by the Australian people in March of last year, we were faced with the responsibility of doing something long&amp;hyphen;term about this problem. Instead of putting it under the carpet, instead of running a scare campaign, we set about introducing a policy.

          The simple truth is that our nursing homes policy was almost a direct steal of their hostels policy. The only difference between the circumstances is that in 1989 when their policy was introduced the then opposition did not run a deliberate campaign of fear and loathing amongst the elderly of Australia. Our spokesperson at that particular time did not go to every nursing home telling lies about the policy of the then government. Our spokesman did not go around the rest of Australia dishonestly representing what we were going to do.

          Having introduced an accommodation bond and having introduced higher fees for residents of hostels, the Labor Party then proceeded over a four&amp;hyphen;year period to systematically and cold&amp;hyphen;bloodedly cut by 75 per cent the money going into nursing homes in Australia. That is why, when we came to office, we faced what the minister quite correctly described as a crisis. Instead of running away from the problem, we have faced up to the need of imposing a policy similar to yours for hostels, which is designed to get capital back into nursing homes, designed to address the fact that around 40 per cent of residents in nursing homes in Australia share wards of four or more people and that 11 per cent of facilities do not meet fire standards—that is after 13 years of your

          —I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge that many of his constituents are facing real difficulties in this area. The government is well aware of competitive pressures affecting the profitability of growers supplying in particular the processing sector of the citrus industry. We are committed to working closely with the industry to secure its long&amp;hyphen;term viability and the future of the people who work in it. It is the case that a lot of the debate centres on tariffs. I make the point that tariffs have fallen from 35 per cent in 1988 to five per cent in 1996 under the schedule put in place by the previous government.

         I do note with some interest that in a recent media release the spokesman for primary industries on the other side mentioned that there were several things that ought to be done, such as the strengthening of anti&amp;hyphen;dumping measures—I notice that they had 13 years to do that and now they want to go back and revisit it; legislation and funding for stronger product labelling and a resourced Australian&amp;hyphen;made campaign—they had 13 years for that; and a review of taxation policy, but they are against taxation reform. It is significant that they do not propose the re&amp;hyphen;introduction of tariffs or protection for this industry.

         The key for an industry which is in real difficulty and where people are facing adjustment pressures is export. Export growth is the key because returns to growers can be 30 times more from exports than from fruit sent

          to domestic fruit processors. In 1996&amp;hyphen;97 exports made up just one&amp;hyphen;fifth or 20 per cent of total production but they earned the same income as the remaining 80 per cent of the domestic crop. The industry is now earning, as the member for Wakefield well knows, five times more from exports than it was in 1990.

         Another concern that is frequently heard is that imports are flooding into Australia. I think it is worth making the point that imports actually fell by 25 per cent in 1996&amp;hyphen;97 compared with last year and that the imports that are coming in are very much at the lower price end of the market. Many in the industry are responding by changing tree variety or production mix on farm and that is helping them capture export earnings. Some are moving into alternative crops—for example, grapes.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I want to say too that the government is backing industry by enhancing market access for our fruit overseas, particularly into Asia and also into high&amp;hyphen;value American citrus markets. Exports are now earning $156 million a year, which is treble the value of imports at $47 million a year, and export income is growing at 25 per cent a year. It is interesting to see that those exports are going particularly into Asia—in Hong Kong they have gone from 11 million a couple of years ago to 30 million now; Malaysia: 23 million per annum; Singapore: 22 million; Japan has doubled in two years to 21 million; Indonesia is up from 15 million to 18 million; Thailand and the Philippines are all opening up and all have significant marketing opportunities.

We are also supporting development of similar arrangements for Riverland and the MIA. This is in addition to the $8.4 million citrus market diversification program introduced in 1994 and carried forward by us. We are providing a range of assistance—dollar&amp;hyphen;for&amp;hyphen;dollar assistance—for research and development: the tri&amp;hyphen;state fruit fly strategy, initiatives through supermarket to Asia and

         There are benefits from the rules based approach to trade that has been adopted for agriculture. The beef and dairy industries have recently been very forcefully making this very point to me: they want Australia to stay with the rules based system because we are winning out of it. But this is not a government that walks away from those who face adjustment pressures. We will continue to work with that very important industry, including the constituents of the honourable member who asked the question, to do what we can to secure their future.

         Already the government has released papers in relation to accounting standards, fundraising and, today, directors' duties. They will be followed by papers on electronic commerce and the securities and futures market. The proposals which we released today for public discussion have been drawn in consultation with the government's business regulation advisory group. They are proposals which will enhance the opportunity for shareholders to be protected in relation to their company's activities and they will give directors of corporations the opportunity to have a safe harbour under a business judgment rule. This provides the opportunity for shareholders to increase their control over corporations whilst directors behaving with all due care and due diligence will still be protected in the exercise of their decision making duties. These proposals also have the opportunity to clarify the rights and obligations of directors and other company officers and to encourage continuous monitoring of stock exchanges by the Australian Stock Exchange, and relevant industry and professional bodies to promote best practice in corporation regulation in Australia.

This is big structural change in relation to the way corporate Australia behaves and is expected to behave, and takes its place as part of the economic objectives of this government. It is an economic reform program going into the area of corporate law, making it possible to get our law and our economics harmonised and right. I commend this discussion paper to the directors, officers and shareholders in Australia.

The government received an overwhelming response of 630 applications for work for the dole projects. I have announced 178 successful sponsors, particularly in areas of high youth unemployment in regional Australia. One of the very interesting features of the support that the government has got for work for the dole has been the strong support from many of the country's peak welfare and charitable organisations, who have declared their willingness to support young people. The successful sponsors include Mission Employment Australia, the Salvation Army, the Sydney City Mission, the ACT Cancer Society, the Council on the Ageing, Open Family Australia, the Queensland Baptist Community Service, Centacare Catholic family services—and, indeed, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Perth—and Anglicare.

          —What does my wife say about it? I declare an interest, Mr Speaker. None of your business! But the honourable Independent member for Curtin does actually raise an interesting point and that is that there is tax deductibility in relation to political parties, but not in relation to Independents. I think the reason for that, as I judge public opinion represented by the two sides of this chamber, is that there seems to be more support for tax deductibility for political parties than Independents.

         On 2 October I launched `Plantations for Australia; the 2020 vision' and it is a framework setting out what needs to be done to achieve an internationally competitive plantation growing and processing industry which is commercially focused, market driven and market orientated. Very importantly the target is to treble the effective area of the plantation estate in this country from 1 million hectares to 3 million hectares between 1996 and the year 2020, just 23 years away.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The plantation rate when we came to power was about 20,000 hectares a year at a time when New Zealand—not a very big country by contrast with Australia—was managing about 100,000 hectares a year. We need to achieve an average annual planting rate of 80,000 hectares per year to achieve the target. Certainly in terms of what has been achieved in this country before, that is ambitious but it is achievable. The key to it is an appropriate vision and a partnership between the Commonwealth government, the state and territory governments and the plantation growing and processing sector, in other words the private sector.

         That is something the previous regime was utterly and totally unable to achieve. It seem
         <break page="9207" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          to have been largely forgotten in the last 18 months of peace in the forest industries as we have taken them forward, but they had total gridlock up there. It was the commonwealth versus the states and territories, with industry meanwhile dispirited and walking away from the process to the great cost of the national economy, in particular to the economies and jobs of rural areas in Australia at the same time as we developed something like a $2 billion annual deficit in timber and paper products.

         Mr Speaker, the achievement of the 2020 vision will have many benefits indeed. Firstly, investment of somewhere in the order of $3 billion is expected in this process. It will be mainly private sector of course, but it is always been the private sector that has done the best job of these things. Secondly, it will revitalise rural economies. Farm, forestry industry and high rainfall zones could contribute over $650 million a year to farm incomes in this country. There will be a significant increase in jobs in rural areas—which are very much needed—in plantation, forestry and logging from an expansion in domestic processing of wood and from jobs in transport and other downstream industries.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Also there will be major environmental benefits. Achieving this vision will make a real difference in terms of the net greenhouse gas emissions in this country and the sequestration rates will increase from some 4.7 megatons annually to well over 15 megatons a year which would be a very valuable contribution indeed.

         Governments, of course, can play their part by making sure that the policy settings really support plantations, for example, by removing regulatory impediments for plantation developments. At the commonwealth level in just 18 months we have succeeded in lifting controls on the export of unprocessed plantation wood—a significant impediment to investment in plantations. So far they have gone in Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia, and they will shortly I am sure go in the remaining states as we deliver on what you were never able to deliver—a coherent, forward looking, visionary policy for plantations and forestry in this

Perhaps you should sit there and take notes about the fundamental facts of this policy and relate that on the radio programs, rather than going onto the radio programs and saying that people have to sell their houses, when you know categorically that over 50 per cent sell their homes now. Some 93 per cent of people who go into nursing homes and hostels are single people and over 50 per cent of them sell their homes now. This policy takes account of all the hardships that can possibly arise—and I have said that I will monitor it; I will watch the implementation and I will take action where there is any injustice visited upon anyone. And if you have got examples, like so many others in this place, then you come and let me know.

         When it comes to consistency we have been of the view for a long time that an exemption for small business would be a good idea in respect of the unfair dismissal laws. What people perhaps do not appreciate is that last year, after we signed the agreement with the Democrats which secured eventually the passage of the legislation, a few days later I got a phone call from then Senator Kernot who said that she had been approached as to the consequences of the agreement that we had entered into—and members might remember that it was a very detailed agreement which attached to it every amendment. We had dotted every `i' and crossed every `t'. She rang and said that she had some concern about it. I went to see her about it and it turned out that, in fact, she wanted to change the agreement.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I have said on the public record that as a part of those discussions she was in favour of the exemption for small business. She was reported in the

          negotiations with the Democrats to ensure that there was a proper record of all of the discussions that we had. I have here the minutes of a meeting, minutes which were taken as a result of discussions between then Senator Kernot, representatives of my department and me. It included the following words:

         The opportunity was also taken to discuss the substance of the regulations for unfair dismissal.

         That is exactly the policy position we have now. It is true that she supported it. I actually made a written note at the time—careful, wasn't I—which, under the heading 11.45 p.m., states:

         So not only did she support it, not only did we agree, she agreed to take that matter to her party room.

         Since this government came to office, we have been very concerned about the situation in Bougainville and have been prepared to do all we possibly can to try to bring about peace in that troubled province. There is not any doubt that the Sandline crisis was a low point in the whole of what one could describe as the Bougainville saga, and the House knows only too well the strong opposition that came from the Australian government to the plans to hire the Sandline mercenaries.

        <para first-indent="16">
         But at the end of the Sandline crisis, as I said at the time, there was an opportunity to strike out for peace on Bougainville. With the election of the Skate government, that government has taken the view that there is no military solution to the problem on Bougainville, that there can only be a negotiated and peaceful solution. And that is very much the view of the Australian government. So, as things have unfolded, that opportunity for peace brought about by the end of the Sandline
         <break page="9214" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          crisis has, in turn, led to what we now call the Burnham process, where the Australian and New Zealand governments have been providing assistance with the getting together of the parties to the Bougainville conflict.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I have said before, the Australian government does not support a blueprint for a solution to this problem. But what we have said is that we are prepared to assist a peaceful solution. Recently we have been doing that in a couple of ways. First, we have been prepared to offer substantial development assistance for Bougainville somewhere in the vicinity of $130 million over the next few years; and, second, we undertook the transport of nearly 100 delegates to Burnham, which is just outside of Christchurch in New Zealand, and returned those delegates safely to their homes.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Those talks in Burnham are part of what I would describe as an evolutionary process. I do not think it is wise to try to push the Bougainville peace process too fast. I do not think it is wise for countries like Australia to be out there demanding that blueprint plans be followed. But I do think we should be encouraging this evolutionary process. Indeed, so far the Burnham talks have led to a truce between the parties to the Bougainville conflict—and that, I think, is a very important confidence building measure. There is a mood of both hope and dialogue in the Bougainville process and we will be continuing to encourage that.

        <para first-indent="16">
         One policy change we made as a government which I think has been beneficial to this process—although I accept it might be a somewhat controversial change of policy—is that we have been prepared to make direct contact with the Bougainville Interim Government and the Bougainville Revolutionary Army. I myself met Moses Havini in Sydney not very long ago and my department has had quite extensive contact with people from the BIG and BRA, including before, during and after the last round of talks in Burnham.

           —I take a further point of order, Mr Speaker. I have been a member of this House for about 18 years and I think this procedure—for the senior law officer of the Commonwealth to use the House to maybe give you guidance—is wrong for him to do. It is a wrong precedent for you to allow the House to adopt. If at some stage in the future you come back and find that there is a prima facie case, then that is for the Attorney to canvass then. If indeed you come back and find that there is not a prima facie case, that might be for some other member to canvass. But I think that the Attorney does himself, yourself and the House an injustice in attempting to canvass this matter before you have given the House the benefit of your thoughts. Indeed, if you are going to allow him indulgence, the member for Banks might want some indulgence and many others of us may wish to have some indulgence. It might be better if this were terminated right now.

           —If the Attorney-General does have a matter that he thinks he ought to put before you, maybe on this matter it might be more appropriate if he discussed that with you in your office and then it might suit you to give him indulgence. The Attorney thinks this is rather funny, too. I guess everyone in the government thinks these privilege matters are all frivolous and funny, but I can remember members on that side taking a lot of interest in these things in the past themselves. If the matter is something the Attorney is concerned about, maybe canvassing it with you in your office first might be a good idea. But to have a matter of privilege canvassed before your being willing to give the House the benefit of your judgment is a bit of a difficult position for all of us. We all might want to canvass something else. The member for Banks might wish to. Maybe the Attorney could talk to you in your office; I don't know.

It would not be common in the proceedings of the House to have situations where potentially the actions

          I do not think it is appropriate, as suggested by the member for Watson, that there be a private conversation with you. There is no reason why all of these matters should not be transparent. The reason we have a process for indulgence is to cover a lot of, shall we say, abnormal circumstances for members to bring matters to the attention of the House and also, in the privileges proceedings, essentially the person who is concerned about privilege does have an opportunity to present a case. Here we have the rather peculiar circumstance of where the person against whom the case is being put, it seems to me, should have some opportunity not to argue the case necessarily but to present before the House the necessary and relevant material which can allow you to make that judgment so that you do not make a judgment entirely in a vacuum.

           back. In those circumstances, before this proceeds any further, it would be wise for you to consider the question of your indulgence and make up your mind on it and then seek some clarification from the Attorney-General later in the day as to what he intends to raise.

          —Mr Speaker, the proper procedure in this case involves what is the proper way of raising a question of whether there has been a prima facie case made out for a breach of privilege. If you look at the procedure, there may be a means of presenting a complete set of documents that have an unarguable case. That is not often going to be the case. On the other hand, there may be a situation in which a case can be put which can be completely answered if further material is provided. There is nothing in the procedures of this House to  prevent that issue being considered at the prima facie stage. There is nothing in the rules of the House—the standing orders of the House—that prevents me seeking your indulgence to raise a complete response.

You would be aware, Mr Speaker, that before a breach of privilege can proceed a committee has to investigate the breach itself and report. So I strongly disagree that the reference in practice, and particularly the reference quoted by the Leader of the House, provides any precedence for this unique occurrence today.

The issue that should be examined very carefully is that if, as a matter of precedent, you were to now rule that the Attorney in these circumstances should not, by leave, be allowed to put further material to the House and to you before you come back with your considered view as to whether a prima facie case exists or not, you will then have a precedent which would not be worthy of the House or yourself, sir, with respect, because it would mean that any person in theory could raise a point of alleged breach of privilege against a minister or a sitting member on either side of the House and the Speaker would then be precluded, it would follow, from examining any further material from the person who had been accused of being involved in alleged breach of privilege. That in itself is undesirable practice.

Other parliaments have very careful procedures laid out to avoid this very situation. I will not go into those. This House for various reasons has never done that. It has left open the opportunity for someone to get up and say, `What you have just heard, Mr Speaker' or `What you heard last week is not exactly what the position is. Here is my view of it. Before you go back to your chambers to consider it I have the right, at least as a matter of common justice, to put it to you.'

It invites the contrary case to be presented and you will therefore be subject, if you allow fairness to both sides of the House, to an extensive debate on matters that really should be questions for your private consideration.

           —I say that for your information, Mr Speaker. The second thing is that this is the next sitting day after the matter was first raised, so it is quite appropriate. Thirdly, it is constantly said that this provides for a debate. It does not provide for a debate; it is not a precedent about anything. It is simply the exercise of your discretion to handle the matter as you see fit. Under those circumstances, I have to say that I think the opposition are making a mountain out of a molehill. The matters are currently before the chair and it is not unreasonable for you to have these matters before you. I do not think it adds anything to have a big debate about this particular matter. The Attorney should be allowed to complete his remarks.

           —Mr Speaker, just briefly, in reference to the contribution of the member for Watson, he keeps stressing what is the practice of this House. The practice of this House is recorded in this book, our bible. It says that parliamentary practice is that you can grant indulgence in these circumstances, and it is specific to a matter of privilege. That
           <break page="9220" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            is the practice of this House, but we are into the business of not letting the facts get in the way of a good story. Quite clearly you can grant indulgence, and that is the beginning and the end of it. Having granted indulgence, it is then up to the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, in this case, to put what I presume are the facts as he knows them, not the facts according to the member for Banks. They are both members of this House and both have the same rights within this House. They are the facts. But, in terms of the practice of this House, it is clearly shown in

           —I can get by without your cackle. Mr Speaker, it is the duty of a member when he first is apprised of what might be a matter of privilege to draw it to your attention as the presiding officer. The discretion as to whether or not it is a matter of privilege is yours and yours alone. If it is a difficult and complex matter, your predecessors have from time to time gone away, conferred with the clerks and come back to announce whether there is in fact a matter of privilege. If you find that it is, you refer it to the Privileges Committee. It is then a matter for them to go into the detail, and quite often they simply come up with the proposition that there is no breach of privilege or they do not feel there is a prima facie case even established. That is the process. We do not want to get into a situation where that process becomes the prerogative of anybody but you as Speaker. That is the process, and I suggest it should be followed. If you need more time to consider any of these arguments, I suggest that you take it. But to go on canvassing it in this way is unprecedented.

I must admit that the essence of transparency is going to guide my decision in the multitudinous array of points of order that we have had taken today. The Attorney&amp;hyphen;General has not been in contact with me in any way, shape or form since the matter was originally raised two weeks ago and, as the member for Watson mentioned, we have had a recess in that time. The Attorney approached me during the concluding moments of question time and asked me whether he could seek my indulgence to make a statement, and I was happy to grant that. As everybody quite rightly reflects, the indulgence is mine. In the interests of transparency, and it is certainly not unusual for more than one member to speak on a privileges matter, it is my intention to allow the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General to make some comments.

The Attorney&amp;hyphen;General is asking you to perform an arbitral or judicial function, which is not your function at all.

           —Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I put it to you that it is only a matter of natural justice that the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General be able to put certain information before the House. As he puts that information, it will contain assertions by him as to the facts of the matter. We had the member for Banks doing exactly that on the last sitting day of this parliament. It does not in any sense compromise your position; in fact, it allows you to make a decision based on a reasonable array of information.

          It is incredible that these people have been baying for the head of the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General on the basis that we have not had full disclosure of certain arguments and legal opinions, yet when he comes before the House to do the right thing we have had nothing but interjections, interruptions and irrelevant points of order to prevent him from giving to the House an explanation and the supporting material. Mr Speaker, this has gone on far too long. You gave the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General indulgence. When you gave him indulgence he was entitled to proceed in accordance with the request, which he quite properly put to you in the normal way at the end of question time.

           It is incredible. These guys are claiming a cover&amp;hyphen;up and now, when the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General comes to present full information to the House, they are trying to prevent it. It is absolutely absurd.

          I have gone over the two precedents. One of the precedents does not help because in that case it was decided not to proceed with the privilege matter. That does not help you much. The other precedent—I was not the manager at the time, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was—gives you some semblance of support in what is otherwise a unique situation. In that particular case, the matter was raised a month later. The members of the committee, which was allegedly the source of the leak or the foundation of the leak, then got up on indulgence and provided further information to the House. On that basis you do have a precedent for this particular set of circumstances. It is not unreasonable, just as a matter of commonsense, that there be a proper presentation to you of the relevant information. It does not require anything of you; it simply ensures full public disclosure of the relevant matters.

          These people reckon it is important. If they reckon it is important then it is time the matters were on the public record. That is what the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General proposes to do. He is not asking for any more than was given to the member for Banks in the usual course—not a skerrick more. He simply wants an opportunity to present the facts, including his own assertions as to those facts. That is not debating the issue; that is presenting information to you upon which you can then make a balanced decision.

          When all is said and done, this is a pretty simple matter. The Attorney&amp;hyphen;General is asking for an opportunity so that the public can know—the public have a right to know these matters—and the information is on the public record. Given that these people have been claiming a cover&amp;hyphen;up, it should only reinforce the commonsense of the decision that you have already made, which is to grant indulgence.

            by pointing that fact out, but in that barrage of nonsense you got from the Leader of the House you might have forgotten it. The point of order is that you suggested to the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General that the appropriate course of action, the document having been tabled, was to correspond with you if he wished to make any further points. If the Leader of the House had read the propositions put forward by the member for Banks he would know that the honourable member did not argue his case at all; he simply presented the fact that, in his belief, a breach of privilege had probably occurred because of A, B and C, and he then tabled documents. That was it. What you had lined up here was an explanation of document after document. There was no explanation by the member for Banks for the various documents he tabled—he simply tabled them.

I would raise with you the precedent of a member who is not a chair of a committee raising a matter of privilege on behalf of a committee. The traditional practice of this parliament is that the only person within a committee who has right to raise a matter is the chairman unless the matter has been deliberated upon by the committee, in which case, there being a dissent, the chairman of the committee normally rises in his place, advises the parliament of that fact and then that other member can raise the matter. I would suggest to you that this issue should first be returned to the committee and it would be for the chair of that committee to initiate any response in this place.

Nowadays the microphones are turned on only when you give the call. While we stand and try to get your attention, you are occupied looking at somebody else, and the capacity to take a point of order is lost. Can I suggest that we return to the system where the people watching the whole room and who are not engaged in the debate turn the microphone on when we seek the call so we can actually get your attention?

          The petition of certain residents of the State of New South Wales draws to the attention of the House changes to the programme which is heard on ABC Radio 2KPTR on the Mid North Coast on Saturday mornings between 5am and 10am. This was a very popular radio programme which included local pioneer interviews, local recording artists and country music as well as `adult contemporary' music. The country music segment was popular with many listeners tuning in only for that part of the programme between 9 and 10.

          Since the changes were made there have been many complaints to both ABC Radio in Sydney and the ABC office at Kempsey about the content of the new format. Replies given to these complaints have been highly unsatisfactory. We think it is unfair to have relayed interviews and very `different' music content. We would expect that proper surveys would have been carried out on the Mid North Coast so people have some chance to express their interest.

         Put simply, older cars cause unnecessary death and injury and too much pollution. I was motivated to move this motion as a result of a reply to a question on notice which I received from the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill)
         <break page="9232" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          on 17 June 1997 advising me that the government did not have any policy or program directed towards removing older vehicles from the road.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The average age of the 11 million motor vehicles on the Australian fleet is now 10.6 years, which is one of the highest in the developed world. Clearly, something needs to be done about the scrapping of old cars. In the late 1970s, around 25 per cent of cars on the road were more than 10 years old. Today, more than 55 per cent of cars are more than 10 years old. It is more than twice that of the situation in Europe, and in Australia it is growing at two per cent a year.

         Carbon dioxide emissions, which are the single largest source of greenhouse gases from transport, rose from 51.7 million tonnes in 1980 to 68 million tonnes in 1993. World Bank figures show that one&amp;hyphen;fifth of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere arising from human activity arises from motor vehicles as do one&amp;hyphen;third of fluorocarbons and half of nitrogen oxides. Research by the University of Melbourne has shown that more than half the pollution arising from cars is caused by just 12 per cent of cars. British research suggests that a 10&amp;hyphen;year old car, even if it is well maintained, is four times greater in its pollution than a newer car.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Newer cars have been fitted with catalytic converters since 1986 as well as other fuel use restrictions. In my electorate of Barton I have a firm—one of the industry leaders—called Johnson Matthey, which is at the forefront of developing this technology. The technology is the reason that newer cars are far less likely to pollute. The fact that older cars are on the road means that 1.7 billion litres of fuel is used each year above that which is necessary, worth about $1.2 billion every year. In addition to carbon dioxide, road traffic causes lead pollution together with nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons, all of which cause significant health problems, including asthma. There is evidence that they contribute to the development of cancers and, of course, lead pollution is a very significant issue among our children and our youth.

         In terms of lead per capita, Australia has the worst levels in the industrial world and
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          has done the least about it. There are 400,000 children in Australia who have unacceptably high levels of lead in their blood. In New South Wales alone, more than 100,000 children state wide have lead contaminated blood levels above the national safety level. Some 40,000 children under the age of four in Sydney and up to 71,000 children state wide have lead contaminated blood levels above the national standard of 10 microns per decilitre.

         To repeat, just 12 per cent of mainly older cars cause more than 50 per cent of motor vehicle exhaust pollution. That represents a major environmental and health problem which cannot be underestimated.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In terms of safety, according to recent research, the chances of a fatality are twice as great in a car more than 13 years old than in a car which is less than six years old. A study by the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority has found that 17 per cent of road fatalities, equating to 250 lives and 3,000 injuries every year, could be prevented; that is, they would not have occurred, if older cars were as safe as newer cars. Those fatalities and injuries represent not only personal tragedies but a tremendous drain on the health resources of our nation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the period from 1989 to 1995 significant gains in the crashworthiness of cars have occurred. Accordingly, there have been significant reductions in major injuries and deaths, by about 30 per cent since 1989. That represents an annual saving in pure health costs of $2 billion per year. All cars today must comply with numerous design rules which contribute to their safety. There is no question that unnecessary and preventable death and injury are occurring every week, indeed, every day, because of unsafe older cars on our roads.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The cost burden, let alone the human tragedy, more than justifies taking action. In terms of incentives to remove cars from our roads, there have been numerous media commentaries of steps being taken in many European countries to provide cash for clunkers as a means of inducing people to turn over their older motor vehicles. It is a matter which a number of newspapers have
         <break page="9233" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          taken up and it is pleasing to see that issue being raised in such an informative way.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But I favour a reduction in sales tax rather than a cash return for clunkers primarily because it may well be that only those who have sufficient cash resources would be able to take advantage of the cash for clunkers return because it is only those with the surplus cash or savings who would be able to go out and purchase a new vehicle. The reduction in price which would flow from the overall reduction in sales tax would have a trickle down effect, whereby the lower price of newer cars would trickle down through the overall market, making better cars and newer cars more affordable for low income earners.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries is also arguing strongly for a reduction in sales tax, together with some other measures such as safety inspections and the like in states other than New South Wales. They are strongly arguing for a reduction in the present level, which is 22 per cent. By inflating the price of vehicles, sales tax obviously reduces affordability. For instance, with respect to a Ford Falcon, I understand that the 22 per cent sales tax adds about $4,000 to the total price.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Productivity Commission recently estimated that sales tax, stamp duty and registration combined make up about 17 per cent, or $5,271, of the cost of an average new Ford Falcon. Rover Australia has provided me with information that suggests that a reduction in sales tax from just 22 per cent to 12 per cent would expand the demand for cars by about 120,000 to about 150,000 units per year—a very significant increase indeed. In 1992, the federal government, primarily as a result of the recession in manufacturing in that period, reduced sales tax from 20 per cent, as it was in 1992, to 15 per cent. That appeared to have a significant effect in increasing new motor vehicle sales despite the inflationary pressures. That sales tax figure was increased again in May 1995, as the economy started to pick up, back to 22 per cent. I am arguing that it should now be reduced not just for economic reasons but for significant environmental and safety reasons.

         By increasing the turnover of new vehicles, additional revenue would flow from increased
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          volumes, and state governments would also receive additional funding through stamp duty and registration fees. Indeed, it may well be that the federal government should negotiate with the states to share that burden across the board. There is no doubt that increasing new vehicle sales would give a substantial boost to the vehicle and component manufacturing industry with a substantial impact on employment in those industries. Similarly, it would substantially induce employment in the vehicle distribution, retailing and wholesaling industries, which contribute significantly to the national economy.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         On balance, the increase in revenue due to the greater turnover of vehicles would substantially offset the revenue loss which would result from a reduction on sales tax on motor vehicles, and the measure would have obvious and significant benefits to the environment, to public health and of course significantly to reducing road casualties.

          —Any actions by this House to improve road safety and the quality of the air we breathe has my support, but I question whether the call by the member for Barton (Mr McClelland) to simply remove older motor vehicles from our roads is the answer. Many people simply cannot afford new cars. In fact, I find it a sad commentary on Labor's link with people that the member for Barton could seriously propose such a coercive measure, a measure which would impact most heavily on the poor.

         Drivers cause accidents, not cars. And accidents are certainly not restricted to old cars. Department of Transport and Regional Development figures show that brand new cars have roughly the same fatality rates as others. There is no doubt that new vehicles come with higher safety standards, but a modern vehicle in a head-on collision at 65 kilometres an hour, even with air bags, will provide little hope for survival for the occupants.

          Car owners can also make a dramatic change to the levels of air pollution and emissions. The Federal Office of Road Safety has conducted a survey exactly on this subject. This report reveals we would reduce air pollution and emissions by up to 50 per cent simply by ensuring all vehicles are subjected to regular and simple engine tuning. By simple engine tuning, I refer to the regular service as laid down in every car manual. If every car owner maintained their vehicle to the required standard, the savings in fuel alone would be up to $200 million a year.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This national study examined 650 vehicles and found that, indeed, cars between 10- and 16-years-old made the greatest contribution to total pollution. But—and there is a big but—high polluting vehicles were found in cars of all ages. Therefore, caring for our existing car fleet would have better results in reducing pollution in the short term than so-called zero emission vehicles.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The member for Barton will no doubt argue his party stands for social equity. I argue that this government has done more to facilitate entry of new vehicles into the market by providing a record low interest regime than Labor ever did. When interest rates rocketed to more than 17 per cent under Keating, upgrading the family car was put on the backburner by thousands of Australian families.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The member for Barton calls for a reduction in wholesale sales tax on motor vehicles. This government has made it clear: we are not in the business of sticking even more patches on a tax system that needs to be dismantled and totally rebuilt. The opposition acknowledged this nation needed total and complete tax reform but typically did nothing about it.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This government is set on a course to establish a fair and equitable system for all Australians. This includes programs to get young Australians off the dole queues and into work. As we have seen since we took government, 9,000 apprenticeships went begging last year and among the hardest vacancies to fill were as motor mechanics. It is not drawing a long bow to say that we literally have to teach our young people to

          Therefore, in answer to the member for Barton's move to remove older vehicles from our roads, I say it is a typical Labor simplistic solution. I do not believe it would make a dramatic change to either safety or pollution levels. Improving the standard of living for Australians on low incomes is far more likely to achieve these goals, and this is what this government is all about.

          —I would like to take up some of the points that have been put to this House by the honourable member for Griffith (Mr McDougall) in this debate. He cites the low interest rate regime at the moment as a potential stimulus to the consumption of cars. I remind the honourable member that that low interest rate regime could be achieved only because the previous Labor government broke the back of an inflation rate of 10 per cent which was left to us by his leader when he was Treasurer.

         The honourable member makes the suggestion that what the honourable member for Barton (Mr McClelland) is proposing is a simplistic solution to the problem of the ageing car fleet in Australia and the safety and environmental issues that stem from that. Let me point out to the honourable member for Griffith that, if he would take the opportunity to read the submissions by major car companies to the recent Industry Commission's inquiry into the motor vehicle industry in this country, he would know that almost all of those mentioned this particular proposal of lowering the age of the Australian car park as a key proposal.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I commend the member for Barton for bringing this matter to the attention of the House today. Matters relating to automobile use and the car industry are of particular interest to me as the member for Corio. I have a major car manufacturer, Ford Australia, in my electorate with around 2,700 people currently employed in that facility and another 1,000 employed in car component production.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In a highly competitive international and domestic car market, there are many factors that contribute to the survival of automotive manufacturing in not only my electorate but
         <break page="9235" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          the nation as well. Factors include a continued investment in new technologies, investment in training and education to improve the skills of the automotive work force, increased expenditure on research and development by the major car companies, and reductions in costs. These are all important to the competitiveness of individual firms.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But there is one factor external to car manufacturing companies that has a direct bearing on their costs and their profitability, and that is simply demand for cars. One overall factor contributing to this demand is the decision of consumers as to when to trade in their older cars for new ones. Therefore, the age of the Australian car park is important to any consideration of the future of car manufacturing in Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The statistics tell us that Australians are holding on to their cars for longer. The average age of cars in 1971 was 6.1 years; in 1997 it is now 10.6. We are a nation in love with, and very dependent on, the car for our everyday economic and social needs. Australia ranks fifth in world car ownership: there are around 10.6 million vehicles on our roads and over 12 million drivers who collectively travel more than 164 million kilometres each year.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The importance of the motor industry to the economy cannot be overstated either, with 215,000 people employed in 37,600 establishments with a turnover of $143.7 billion and an average annual wages bill of $3.6 billion. But our dependence on car transport, the level of car usage and the age of the car fleet bring with them considerable social and environmental problems, as outlined by the member for Barton. For example, road accidents remain one of the most common causes of preventable death in Australia, and older cars tend to be less safe than new ones. So the age of our car park is important to this broad issue of road safety and road trauma. The ageing of the car fleet is a matter of environmental significance as well. Older cars tend to be less efficient in their consumption of non-renewable fossil fuels and cause greater air pollution in congested urban environments.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So the honourable member's motion is a timely one indeed. It echoes sentiments I
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          expressed to this House in a recent speech on the Australian car industry in which I outlined the industry's problem with the ageing of the car fleet and recommended, as has the honourable member for Barton, a lowering of the wholesale sales tax as a means of lowering the price of new cars and bringing them within the price range of ordinary consumers. Stronger overall demand for locally produced cars will also deliver cost benefits in the way of better economies of scale which, in turn, will translate into reduced prices for consumers.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In conclusion, once again I express my support for the proposal put to this House by the honourable member for Barton to lower the age of the Australian car park. It will lower the price of vehicles to consumers and stimulate demand, address key elements of safety issues relating to cars and also go a long way towards addressing environmental issues.

A member who purports to support the views of the battlers and the people who are struggling has put forward a fairly simplistic view: just remove the older cars from the roads of Australia and let everyone buy new cars and reduce sales tax in order to make those new cars cheaper. But new cars are still very expensive and far beyond the reach of many of those battlers whom the Labor Party supposedly represents, and that is why many of those battlers have chosen to support us over the years.

In addition, as with any vehicle, if older motor vehicles are tuned and maintained correctly, as I have said, to makers' specifications, the potential for environmental and safety problems is reduced.

         The government is also committed to the phasing out of leaded petrol. This will certainly be done in a gradual and constructive way, giving those people who are driving older vehicles that run on leaded petrol the opportunity of gradually being able to upgrade to a vehicle that runs on unleaded petrol, rather than just saying suddenly that all leaded vehicles have to be removed from the road. The gradual removal of lead fuelled vehicles from our roads is a process which requires extensive community consultation, when you consider there are a number of factors that have to be considered.

         In Australia the average age of the car fleet is about 9.8 years, and about 52 per cent of all our vehicles are over 10 years of age. It would be very simplistic just to say, `Well, we'll remove all those older cars from the road tomorrow.'

Running interest rates of 17 per cent, sometimes up to 22 or 23 per cent, on a hire-purchase agreement for a vehicle made it impossible to upgrade to a newer vehicle, and that certainly reflects on some of the vehicles still on the road today. In some areas it might be that only about 13 per cent of the vehicles are under 10 years of age, the majority of which are still running on

         The honourable member for Barton (Mr McClelland) mentioned in his motion that a reduction in the sales tax would make new vehicles cheaper and would enable people to upgrade to new vehicles. The government does not deny that there would be environmental advantages in lowering the age of Australia's vehicle fleet. We would be very pleased to see that done and the subsequent reduction in the number of vehicles on leaded fuel. But a possible reduction in the wholesale sales tax must be considered in the light of the government's intention for tax reform. The opposition obviously does not recognise that the tax system we have now is outdated and unworkable.

At no stage have I advocated in my motion a compulsory acquisition or authoritarian order directing people to turn their old cars in as if they were firearms. That is not the thrust of my motion at all. My argument is to make vehicles cheaper by reducing the wholesale sales tax on those vehicles. That would not be an advantage only to people who have the funds available to purchase a new car; by reducing the cost of new cars, in particular for business fleets, those cars would be turned over in much the same way as DAS cars are turned over every two years, or at 40,000 kilometres, and they would be available on the market for people

         Sales tax of 22 per cent adds about $4,000 to the cost of a new Ford. If you roughly halve that and you are taking $2,000 off the cost of a new Ford, it is going to have a similar effect on the cost of used vehicles, albeit newer used vehicles that have been made since 1986, at which time, I mentioned, catalytic converters became compulsory. But I should have added that at that time all new cars are required to run on unleaded fuel. So there is a very significant environmental reason for getting people in cars, certainly from pre-1986 to post 1986—

We should remember this: about 13 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions from human use in Australia come from motor vehicles, be they trucks or cars. About four per cent is due to the commercial fleet and about nine per cent come from cars. If just 12 per cent of cars are causing in excess of 50 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions and you halve that percentage—that is, by taking the bulk of

         I move this motion because I feel very strongly about the impact that gaming and gambling are having on our society. I was told only last week of a lady who lost $600,000 over a weekend. The effect that this had on her family can only be imagined by those of us who do not suffer from or have a member of our family who suffers from compulsive gambling problems. While living in Western Queensland I saw among rural workers men working incredibly hard for very large pay packets. People would say, `They'll be wealthy men soon,' but so many of these men would work year after year and still have very little in the way of financial reserves. Some spent the money on alcohol but for others it was the races or some form of gambling.

Now, some 20 years later, I have met with some of the grandchildren. These people are still struggling against poverty and an unmanageable life.

         To help correct this situation, I believe that state governments should offer support to their gaming machine licence holders by making five per cent of gaming turnover available to assist gambling problems. One per cent of this should be used for counselling and 1.5 per cent should be used for community education and advertising. This advertising would include warnings for people who have a problem with irresponsible gaming and gambling so that they would be able to identify themselves and make it easier for them and their families to find help. A free help line should be available for problem gamblers, and the community must be educated about responsible leisure and responsible gambling.

          —I think it is important that we recognise that Australia has been for a long time a nation of heavy gamblers. This is not something that has just happened in the last few years. Indeed, Australia is the world leader—it is not something we can be proud of—in gambling expenditure per capita. At the turn of the century, a visitor to Australia described Australians as `devoted to gambling and
          <break page="9239" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           incapable of hard work'. I would have to say that I do not agree with the latter sentiment, but certainly devoted to gambling we are and have been. Gambling has always occupied a fairly equivocal position in our national life. It attracts massive public participation but there is also, I am pleased to say, continuous criticism on moral, social and economic grounds.

         Earlier, gambling taxes were used to finance essential social services and community infrastructure. That is still largely true in my own state of Western Australia. But recently there has been a change from that position. It has also been used as a method to control illegal gambling. In most cases in the past at least governments owned and operated most gambling outlets. As I have hinted, since the 1970s and particularly the early 1990s, we have seen a change. The paramount social concerns which guided Australian gambling policy in the past have been replaced by more `pure' economic considerations.

We have also seen increasing competition between the states and regions for their market share of this new `industry'.

         Gambling is still highly controversial economic activity, it is susceptible still to crime and corruption and, as we have heard, it really does confront core social values of thrift and reward for effort—and it always has.

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         There is a substantial economic case to be made against gambling. It involves simply sterile transfers of money or goods between individuals, creating no new money or goods. Although it creates no output, gambling does nevertheless absorb time and resources. When pursued beyond the limits of recreation . . .  gambling subtracts from the national income.

         A sentiment that can be endorsed from the evidence. It is important for us to recognise that gambling taxes have risen from nine per cent of total states' own revenue in 1991&amp;hyphen;92 to 10.7 per cent in 1995&amp;hyphen;96. It is a significant and rising share of states' revenues. All states except Western Australia have had an increase in the ratio of gambling taxes to revenue since 1991&amp;hyphen;92. Victoria and the ACT have depended on gambling taxes for 20 per cent or more of the increase in revenue over that time. Victoria, as many have commented, has the highest dependence on gambling taxes at present. Rises in gambling taxes have far exceeded other tax increases in recent years.

         While I endorse the sentiment in this motion, I do see some hypocrisy in the government member trying to discourage state governments from expanding gambling as a means of raising revenue. One of the reasons they are put in this position is that they have had big cuts in financial assistance grants to the states—some $1.5 billion at the last turn—and big decreases in special purpose payments and programs have been cut back. So they have had to rely on gambling taxes to a greater extent, although some have done it with a great deal more enthusiasm than others, particularly in Victoria.

         The important thing to note is that expenditure on gambling as a proportion of household expenditure has been growing, with most of the growth attributable to gaming, particularly in casinos. `Total gambling expenditure', as it is politely called—in other words, losses—by individuals and families reached $9.6 billion in 1995&amp;hyphen;96, of which $1.8 billion was in casinos. Most of this money comes from people in blue&amp;hyphen;collar occupations and on low incomes. It is a transfer of wealth from the poorest in our community to the richest.

It is important to recognise that we have not yet properly assessed the cost of gambling in this community. If the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and others are really concerned, I urge the government to ask these questions: how much
         <break page="9240" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          is the increased call on welfare services costing; how much are the crime related costs; what is the cost to family members whose breadwinners stop bringing home the essentials due to gambling problems; what is the cost of the increase in suicide rates? And so on. We need a decent social impact statement from this government.

This has been the case in New South Wales where the clubs have been set up to legitimately operate poker machines and other forms of gaming. They are entitled to spend their revenue in one of three ways: to widen facilities, to put into reserves to be spent locally or to make donations to local sporting and community organisations.

They seem to be supporting and promoting an interest in gaming from shareholders, where the profits from gaming can be returned overseas or, as the previous speaker—the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence)—stated, go back to the wealthier in society rather than be redistributed amongst the blue&amp;hyphen;collar worker who contributes mainly to gambling.

          A number of clubs in our area have been hit very badly by the Bob Carr poker tax—not just Panthers but the St Mary's Band Club, the Emu Plains Sporting Club, the Rooty Hill RSL, the Katoomba RSL, the Glenbrook Bowling Club and the Wentworthville Leagues Club have all been harshly cut. It is not 30 per cent of their general revenue that has been cut; it is 90 per cent of their profit. The Bob Carr government is demanding 90 of the community's profit from these gaming establishments.

          of 7 June 1997 that, on average, Australians are spending $708 per person per annum on gaming, an increase of $67 in the past year and a doubling in the past decade. In fact, a total of almost $10 billion was spent in 1996 on all forms of gambling—between three and four per cent of disposable household income. And we certainly have larger disposable incomes in Western Sydney because our rent is cheaper, and our lifestyle tends to include clubs, cigarettes and alcohol. We pay our fair amount of tax in that area, and for the Labor government in New South Wales to be demanding further tax in this instance seems to add insult to injury.

          I certainly support the Panthers in their endeavour to have this ridiculous tax revoked, which would allow them to go back to their primary goal of supporting their community and providing facilities in an area where government has failed to provide them in the last 13 years. It will allow them to be a ready sponsor of and contributor to the local community in supporting sporting efforts. It is something the clubs will be reminding the state government in New South Wales about at the coming state elections.

          —This private member's motion on gambling ought to be strongly supported by this House. It is particularly apt that it should be discussed in a Victorian context, because my state of Victoria under Premier Kennett has developed a gambling addiction. The state's finances are now heavily dependent on gambling revenues. Taxation revenue from electronic gaming machines, which has only commenced in the past five years, now amounts to $509 million, and is rising at such a rate that by the year 2000 gambling taxes will account for 15 per cent of the state's revenue base.

         There is scarcely a community in Victoria that has not felt the impact of Premier Kennett's gambling mania, and my electorate has seen some of the worst effects. The City of Moreland is deluged by machines, which grew in number from 690 last year to 800 this year, with more to come. For example, the Carlton Football Club, led by John Elliott, who does not live in the City of Moreland, is one of the culprits. Their avarice knows no bounds. They want to establish an 85 poker machine venue in Glenroy Road, Glenroy. That would have the effect, if successful, of putting the Glenroy RSL, which is situated directly opposite the road and has a few poker machines of its own, out of business. That would have a very adverse effect on the local community which the Glenroy RSL serves and has served very well for many years.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Not content with the indirect threat, they are, I now learn, behind moves to have the Glenroy RSL's liquor licence revoked because the Glenroy RSL has had the temerity to challenge them in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and in other places, as I have done also. That is the kind of response we have had from Carlton to moves by Glenroy RSL to protect the local community.

         The net income per electronic gaming machine is currently in excess of $1,000 per week, which means that in the City of Moreland each year over $41 million is being run through these machines. It is not just Labor electorates that are suffering, although they get it worst. Liberal members in this place and in the Victorian parliament are feeling the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          rising heat of local discontent. At a recent Liberal Party state council meeting in Shepparton a number of backbenchers, backed by a substantial number of branch representatives, put forward two resolutions which rejected state Liberal government policies. Those resolutions concerned not only the independence of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General but also the number of gaming machines in Victoria.

         The Premier has laughed off any suggestion he has been rebuked. Previously backbench revolt has been nipped in the bud by Jeff Kennett through sheer intimidation. I can recall the occasion when the state member for Tullamarine told his electorate he was going to stand up to the Premier on City Link tolls, but he left the party room a week later with his tail firmly between his legs. I am not so sure, however, that the Premier will be able to bluff and bully his way through this time. I have had it relayed to me that those within the Liberal Party who are appalled at Victoria's ever increasing gambling addiction under Premier Kennett are getting a better hearing from Deputy Liberal Leader Phil Gude, and that a certain amount of head counting is now proceeding.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Discontent within the Liberal Party has emerged because the Premier refuses to acknowledge the Victorian community's concerns about the impact his gaming policies are having on their lives. Only last Thursday more than 600 people attended a public meeting in Mount Waverley and, along with the mayor—a Liberal Party mayor—talked of how they will protest at the state's planning laws, which allow a 105&amp;hyphen;machine gambling extravaganza to be established in a former supermarket, despite thousands of written objections. Imagine the disbelief of residents in that area, most of whom are lifelong Liberal supporters and voters, when they pick up their daily paper to read that the state government, not content to foist on them unwanted gambling developments, plans to introduce a procedure in which gaming licences will be granted even before a venue is selected. What have we got next for Victoria: poker machines in public toilets?

US gaming officials are absolutely staggered to hear that Victoria has no restriction on casino operators being involved in political parties. What they say is that that would mean the casino would end up running your government. Tell us about it! Furthermore, major poker machine operators Lloyd Williams and Bruce Mathieson, of Guangdong shares fame—the man who mysteriously ended up with more poker machines than anyone else in Victoria—should not have passed the probity test.

          —The mover of this private member's motion on gambling, the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), is extremely concerned about the social impact of gambling upon our society and spoke out on this issue in the House in February. On that occasion the member for McPherson described gambling addiction as a family destroying affliction, and I believe many of us have seen evidence of this. He, along with many of his colleagues, including me, are convinced that gambling revenue, which is supposed to be raised for use to the benefit of the community, is a negative benefit when all the costs are added up. As gambling opportunities proliferate, more people gamble, people spend more on gambling and more people become addicted to it, some with disastrous results.

He gambles his money and then when he can't repay it he borrows off someone else. Then when he can't repay that he borrows off someone else. He is continually being belted up and he can't provide for his family,' et cetera. The sad thing about it is that, although I got my £5 back, two months later this gentleman hanged himself.

         In the end, apart from the personal or family suffering, small business also suffers. Statistics reveal a huge increase in the money being spent on gambling. If the additional money that is being spent on gambling is not being spent on other goods and services, that has a negative impact on employment. The National Institute of Economic and Industry Research and Spiller Gibbins Swan Pty Ltd prepared a report for the Victorian Casino and Gaming Authority on the impact of increased gambling expenditure in Australia on the retail sector with particular emphasis on Victoria.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The key finding is that increased gambling expenditure, along with expenditure on other retail goods and other services, contributed to a significant decline in national savings over the 1990s. If, as this report suggests, increased gambling expenditure contributed to the rundown in the savings ratio, the long&amp;hyphen;term impacts on the retail sector and other sectors are much more severe than previously indicated. Total Australian expenditure on gambling increased from $4.5 billion in 1990 to $9.4 billion in 1996—in other words, in six years it doubled. Per capita gambling expenditure nearly doubled from $226 in 1990 to $517 in 1996—imagine that: $517 for every person in Australia spent on gambling. Gambling expenditure's share of total household expenditure in Australia increased by one per cent over the same period to 3.1 per cent in 1996.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In Victoria, total gambling expenditure rose by $1.8 billion between 1990 and 1996 to reach $2.6 billion. Per capita expenditure on gambling in Victoria rose from $198 in 1990 to $581 in 1996 while the retail sector's share of total household outlays fell by 0.5 percentage points during the same period. You can see that someone is suffering in that equation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The report also revealed people are digging into their nest eggs to finance their gambling habits. The decline in household savings between 1990 and 1996 funded increased outlays on gambling, retail goods and other services in Australia and Victoria. National savings as a share of total household income
         <break page="9243" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          declined from 6.7 per cent of income in 1990 to 2.5 per cent in 1996. The report shows that 18 per cent of gamblers used savings to gamble while almost 20 per cent had changed their spending patterns, especially on clothing, footwear, recreation and Tattslotto.

This exposure occurs within the family environment and within the context of family relationships with parents, grandparents, other relatives and sometimes family friends.

          —The irony of all this is that the biggest addicts to gambling are governments—state and federal. One of the problems that pushes state governments in particular into more and more gambling revenue is the vertical fiscal imbalance between the Commonwealth and the states, something which, in the past, drew the attention of members of the government who were critical of that when they were in opposition.

         For instance, I mentioned in a speech recently that I had listened with great interest to the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) talking about the problem of vertical fiscal imbalance faced by the states. She showed then that the past decade had witnessed a dramatic decline in payments by the Commonwealth to the state and territory governments. Commonwealth own purpose outlays rose by 11 per cent from 1983 to 1996 while total payments to the states and territories dropped 22 per cent as a proportion
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          of government outlays, and this cut in revenue share was exacerbated by an increase in the proportion of tied grants. Under the circumstances back then, Labor had reduced the states' share of funding and simultaneously removed their flexibility in determining how their funds would be spent.

         The irony is that we have seen in that time an explosion in gambling, particularly in casino gambling, which is the largest form of gambling in Australia—and, of course, legal casinos are a relatively recent phenomenon. The interesting thing about casinos is that we have seen a conflict of interest between the states as the revenue beneficiaries, the people who are responsible for the supervision and also the licence granters for casino operators—virtually a licence to print money in some instances.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I can recollect from the WA Inc. royal commission—and it was ironic listening to the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) because the government of which she was a minister in previous times had granted a casino licence to the Burswood Trust—that the subcommittee of cabinet that was given the responsibility of assessing the licence applicants was considered to have been heavily compromised. One of the people actually making a submission to that subcommittee said that he felt it was a waste of time because they had already made their mind up and they were just going through the motions, and the then minister responsible for gaming, Peter Dowding, who later became the Premier of Western Australia and who had his feet under the table at the time, said, `Compromise? You try being in this government!' He was in the then government of Brian Burke.

         The interesting thing is that that is not limited to Labor governments. We have seen instances in more recent times where that conflict of interest between the responsibility for supervision and the fact that the state government is a beneficiary of gambling revenue has led to situations where local police forces have made statements that they were handicapped in their attempts to identify some of the gamblers who were using the casino, in their view, to launder money.

That, in my view, was clearly revenue from drug dealing which had been down to the casino, circulated and brought back.

There should be no place in our community for these people.

         The American judicial system handled Kalejs and it is, frankly, a matter of deep embarrassment to me that they did not deport him back to Latvia, rather they deported him back to Australia.

         At the outset, I want to pay tribute to the Hon. John Sharp, the previous Minister for Transport and Regional Development, who had the foresight—and we enjoyed his cooperation—to make the Calder Highway a road of national importance. This was a significant move by the former minister which recognises the importance of that major highway which links Bendigo to Melbourne, runs through to the northern part of Victoria and subsequently meets up with the Sturt Highway, which is linked into Adelaide and is a very important link to that city.

         The reason I wanted to raise this is that the October 1997 issue of the RACV publication,
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         , had a very important article about the Calder Highway. The article was pressing the case for the continued upgrading of the Calder Highway, which is very dear to my heart, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I know very dear to your heart, as the member for Mallee, and I know that it will be particularly well received in our electorates.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The article, which was written by Professor Ken Ogden on behalf of the RACV, was very well researched; however, I believe that there are additional funds that have been made available at a federal level to supplement the
         <break page="9246" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          funds that are provided by the Victorian state government. I refer to the commitment by this government and by the former minister, John Sharp, to an $80 million upgrade for the Calder Highway, 50 per cent of which is being provided by the federal government and 50 per cent by the Victorian state government. The upgrade provides for a 13&amp;hyphen;kilometre, four&amp;hyphen;lane bypass of Woodend, which, as you would understand, Mr Deputy Speaker, is a very important aspect of the road improvement.

         There is also a $6 million state and federal contribution for an interchange at a very dangerous intersection at Diggers Rest. That is now well under way. It is progressing at a very rapid rate and will add significantly to the safety of that particular interchange. There is a commitment by the federal and state governments to a $51 million four&amp;hyphen;lane freeway through the Black Forest, south of Woodend. This is an area that has required attention for some years, and some work has already commenced on that program.

         There have been a number of other initiatives by the federal government, including the reintroduction of the black spots safety program.

         The black spots program was a program that had been in place under previous governments until it was dumped by the Keating government.

         The extensive work that is being carried out on the Calder Highway, particularly in the Mount Aitken and Diggers Rest areas, will bring a divided highway—mostly up to freeway standard—right from the heart of Melbourne and, of course, that includes access to ports and airports. These improvements are
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

         The freeway standard will extend from Melbourne through to beyond Gisborne and, after the works have been completed on the four&amp;hyphen;lane bypass at Woodend and the four&amp;hyphen;lane freeway through the Black Forest, the four lanes will extend from Melbourne right through to Malmsbury, which is a significant part of the highway. It will certainly add to the safety of the highway and to the convenience, efficiencies and economies that are required by primary producers, tourists and other users of the Calder Highway.

         I commend the RACV for this article. It is bringing more attention to the Calder Highway, and that is to be commended.

         There is an issue with one important section that I want to raise before the House today, and that is the section of approximately 40 to 45 kilometres between Malmsbury in the south and Ravenswood in the north. That is a particularly dangerous section of roadway—a very narrow, winding road of two lanes with a very bad history of serious accidents. It is important that the federal and state governments concentrate their attention on bringing this section of the Calder Highway up to four&amp;hyphen;lane, divided road, freeway standard, so that the link from Melbourne to Bendigo is incorporated as a four&amp;hyphen;lane highway, with significant improvements to the north of Bendigo so that the quality of the Calder Highway right through to Mildura is kept at a high level. This would add to the efficiency of the highway right through into the very productive Sunraysia district and other rural sectors to the north. It is important that that be continued.

         And I add my rider: the Calder Highway provides access to the ports and airports which are so extremely valuable to us, particularly with the recent announcement by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) of the supermarket to Asia program. A lot of the vegetables and fresh fruit that are much in demand in Asia can be transported from the Sunraysia district via the Calder Highway to air freight facilities and to overseas shipping through the port of Melbourne. It is a very important link in primary production and the supermarket to Asia program which the Prime Minister introduced.

          —My grievance today concerns the attacks that have been taking place in relation to multiculturalism in this country; unfortunate attacks on the philosophy and the policy of multiculturalism which have stemmed or have been given a big boost by the statements of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and her supporters in the One Nation Party. The One Nation Party makes no bones about the fact that it is totally opposed to multiculturalism in all its forms.

          the need to encompass all of our cultures and traditions in a multicultural policy. I notice that former senator Cheryl Kernot made that comment.

         I have been involved for a number of years in this debate on multiculturalism. The interesting thing about the maiden speech of the member for Oxley and her subsequent attacks on multiculturalism is that there was nothing original in it at all. It was simply a repeat of the same old hackneyed arguments against multiculturalism; the same old arguments that we had previously heard from Professor Geoffrey Blainey. They were then repeated in 1988, unfortunately, by the now Prime Minister, and in particular he described multiculturalism as an aimless and divisive philosophy.

         In the book that I have written on this topic, I document the extent of the damage that was done at that time to multiculturalism and multicultural philosophy as a result of those statements by Mr Howard. Unfortunately, having had that damage, at the end of 1995, when he was seeking to become the Leader of the Opposition, he made the following statement in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         said, `Let's consider him as a Leader of the Opposition and as a future Prime Minister on the basis that his commitment and the statements that he has made on this matter are true, sincere and valid. We can then move on to consider his policies in other areas.'

         This is a very serious question. In fact, it is such a serious question that even Mr Williams of Victoria, a conservative, made the statement the other day that he would prefer that Paul Keating were back as Prime Minister. He said that Paul Keating would have dealt with the Hanson phenomenon in one day. What was required of the Prime Minister when the member for Oxley made that dreadful speech—irrespective of whether she had the right to make it—was for him to get up and say very clearly that he did not agree with it, that it was wrong and that it was fundamentally flawed. It took him nine months to say things like that about that speech.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In that period of time, there developed overseas an image of the Australian Parliament, the Australian government, agreeing with these views. That has done us very extensive damage, which has been documented. As I have said, this unfortunately is not a matter of conjecture on my part. It is a matter of truth. The damage that has been done has been documented.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It has also done damage in our society and amongst our communities in Australia. In the last four or five weeks, I have had occasion to talk about multiculturalism in various conferences around the country organised by different forums. What has become clear to me at each of those conferences is that an overwhelming proportion of Australia's ethnic and Aboriginal people is very concerned about the attitudes expressed through the inactivity of this government on multiculturalism and, as I shall document a bit later, through some of their very negative actions.

          It is quite clear that, as to the Prime Minister's firm belief that there is something wrong with the philosophy and policy of multiculturalism, he has not had the guts to come into this House and say what he thinks is wrong with it. Instead, he has attacked multicultural programs and cut out most of the resources that defend multicultural programs at the same time as saying that he does not agree with Pauline Hanson.

          Mind you, it has been noted by many people that he never uses the term `multiculturalism'. Even though we have a so&amp;hyphen;called Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. the Prime Minister does not use the term `multiculturalism'. The Prime Minister does not talk about the philosophy or policies of multiculturalism. I will tell you what we do have: we have actions which clearly show where the Prime Minister has been coming from in this matter. For example, we have had the abolition of the Office of Multicultural Affairs under the Prime Minister. The role of the Office of Multicultural Affairs was a very important one. Not only did it play a role in promoting multicultural programs and promoting an understanding of multiculturalism in Australia but it also had the very important role—I know because I was parliamentary secretary to the former Prime Minister in that role—of pursuing an access and equity program as part of a multicultural Australia.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In the access and equity program the former federal government attempted to show that it was genuine about multiculturalism by actually implementing a program where government departments were required to report on their progress in achieving multiculturalism and in achieving access and equity for people of non-English speaking backgrounds and people of indigenous backgrounds. The access and equity program has virtually disappeared because the Office of Multicultural Affairs has been abolished.

         Labor could not make it work before. When they were managing the store, Labor cut capital funding for nursing homes in the last four years of government to less than half. Now I have to explain to a constituent from Norman Park, Mr Harvey, why his mother has to share her nursing home room with two other ladies. Of course, hostels have faired quite well thanks to Labor's introduction of accommodation bonds, which were then called entry contributions. But some nursing homes are appalling. I have just been through the nursing home scenario with my father. He lives in a small town in New South Wales near Taree. Since my mother died 16 years ago, Dad has been living in the family home.

He is selling the family home so he can pay for his new lifestyle—and why not? Should I have that house, should I get the cash benefit of my father's assets, while my constituents

         Another concern of this government is the fact that so many young Australians have not been taught how to read and write adequately. This does not help them when they are trying to get a job. Fortunately, not all the schools in Griffith have needed to take advantage of this government's massive input of funding for literacy and numeracy programs. But more than one principal has told me they are relieved the situation is finally being recognised and addressed.

         I will be as fascinated as the rest of Australia to see how the Labor Party copes with its newest member. The former Democrats leader supported our tough new laws to reduce the power and membership of unions. Yet as recently as 1994 the Labor members of this House were reminded that they are required to be a member of a union. Is the former Democrats leader going to feel comfortable supporting motions such as the recent one by the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown)? He asked this House to applaud the Maritime Workers Union in Cairns after they had used blackmail tactics beyond the reach of Australian law to get their way. The maritime workers who used international thuggery to stop a small international shipping company from hiring its own staff have a lot to lose. Their so&amp;hyphen;called 35 hours, with breaks, is actually 28.9 hours a week. Then the number of weeks a year they work is reduced—with sick leave, public holidays, long service and, of course, idle time—to just 27&amp;half; weeks a year.

          —I rise in the grievance debate today because in my electorate at the moment there are thousands of people, thousands of ordinary Australians, who are fast losing faith in this Howard government. There are thousands more, I believe, throughout Australia whose faith has already been tested and has disappeared for good.

         One issue among many which have led to this drain of confidence away from the coalition has been the lack of action by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) —indeed, their complete incapacity to act—in regards to premium increases by private health funds. Over the past few months I have received a steady stream of letters and constituents dropping into my office, full of frustration and anger regarding the behaviour of the private health funds to which they have been loyal members, some for over 30 years, and which are now pricing them out of membership, supported all the while by this very servile and weak&amp;hyphen;kneed Howard government.

         In the last 18 months we have seen many of the Howard government's initiatives go belly up. That has certainly not surprised us on this side of the parliament. It is what we on this side of the House expected from an administration so unimpeded by the `constraints' of imagination and intelligence. However, one of the more spectacular has been the government's health fund incentive scheme. Not only has it gone belly up big time but it is certainly starting to bear the distinct smell of a proverbial bucket of prawns going off in the sun.

          Since the Howard government began publicising its health fund incentive scheme more people have left private health insurance than in any other half year since 1991. In the last quarter total health fund membership fell by 1,000 people per day. Most dramatically of all, the private health funds have shown complete and utter contempt for the government's plans by increasing their premiums—and seeking to increase them even further still—to such a level as to make the so&amp;hyphen;called `incentive' worthless.

          Shortly after the government announced its incentive scheme, the Medical Benefits Fund, known as MBF, the nation's second largest private health insurer, announced its intentions to increase its premiums by 15 per cent. It now wants to increase them by a further 15 per cent, complete with a $50 bed tax slug to members who have the `temerity' to expect that private health cover should give them at least a place in a private hospital.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          MBF was not alone. Medibank Private also increased its premiums by as much as 23 per cent and is now seeking to increase them even further, by another 20 per cent. The government's private health fund incentive scheme was obviously not even given a second thought by either of these private health giants, nor by any of the minor players, who have also now increased their fees.

          It has therefore become all too clear that neither the Australian public nor the private health funds have any confidence in the scheme. Unfortunately it is the Australian public which will bear the brunt of the government's failure. It is the Australian

           public who have had $1.7 billion of their tax dollars wasted on this folly—money which could have gone towards keeping 6,000 public hospital beds running for the next four years, money which could have been used to reduce hospital waiting lists, money which could have been used to keep the Commonwealth dental health fund operating, money which could have been injected into the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, money which has now been thrown into the wind.

          Those constituents of mine who are members of private health schemes are also paying—more than figuratively, I might add—for the government's mismanagement on this issue. Mr O'Hara of Prairiewood, for example, who lives in my electorate, wrote to me about the Howard government's failure to get to grips with the private health funds. Mr O'Hara is bitterly angry about the private health funds raising their members' premiums, including his own, seemingly, as he said, at whim. I would like to include part of what he wrote to me. He stated:

          Then we have Mr Bartlett from Greystanes, also in my electorate, a member of MBF for over 37 years, who cannot understand the Howard government's failure to act against the outrageous premium increases by the private health funds. Mr Bartlett writes:

          I have a lot of questions about the way this matter was handled by MBF, but also questions about why the government allowed them to make such changes so easily, and so soon after we were given an incentive to remain privately insured.

          Magnified across the rest of Australia, I would think that now presents this Howard government with a very serious problem. However, judging by the actions of the Prime Minister and the minister for health so far, there seems to be little recognition of this fact. The minister for health postures at the dispatch box and says he is `very, very angry' about the conduct of the private health firms but he does not actually do anything about it. The Prime Minister flexes his muscles and says:

          Well may the Prime Minister remember saying those words but, like his minister for health, he does not actually do anything about it. Meanwhile, those companies which make up the private health system in this country increase their premiums whenever they feel so inclined and all the while with the implicit support of this spineless Howard government.

          Australians need the government to come up with a better solution than its failed private health incentive scheme for the sake of health care in this country and more particularly for the sake of those taxpayers who are paying those premiums.

          Whatever the level of disquiet in my electorate, I imagine that in some of those marginally held coalition seats there is perhaps an even greater number of people with private health cover who are becoming increasingly disgruntled at this government's form on private health insurance. The government, I believe, ignores them at its own peril.

That has not happened.

           The policies of this government have failed. What it needs to do is have a rethink and look at the direction in which this country can go—and most particularly it must do this for older constituents. The older people in my electorate, who are now in their later stages of life, are starting to need the urgent care, which is a lot more expensive than they had bargained for, and the extra cover, which was the sole reason they had remained in these private health insurance schemes. They are the ones who now are in that thousand a day who are leaving health funds. They are the ones who are putting an increased burden on the public hospital system. But, more importantly, they are the ones who were fooled by the Howard government when prior to the election it said, `Vote for us and we'll look after you.'

           I say to Mr Howard, and I say to his government, `The Australian taxpayers, and particularly those people who were fooled in the past, will not be fooled in the future.' I condemn the government in this grievance debate for taking money from a health budget which was sorely needed to be placed in other directions, for not allowing a better plan to come into place and, more importantly, for going to bed with big business and allowing health funds to put their premiums up at will.

         Scientists estimate that the total number of species of animals, plants and micro-organisms on earth is somewhere between 10 million and 30 million, yet amazingly only 1.4 million species have actually been given scientific names. Unfortunately, the world is experiencing an increasing loss of biodiversity. Edward O. Wilson, one of the great biologists of the world, calls the loss of species worldwide `the silent haemorrhage'. This stark metaphor highlights the increasing pace and magnitude with which species are disappearing from the world. Much attention has been focused on the destruction of tropical rainforests, and this is because they harbour so many species. However, many other ecosystems are equally or more threatened.

         Madam Deputy Speaker, you would be aware that the coastal zones of the world, for instance, cover eight per cent of the surface of the earth; this is greater than the size of Africa. These zones include continental shelves, coral reefs, kelp forests, mangrove swamps, seagrass beds and intertidal marine platforms, most of which harbour exceptionally high levels of biodiversity. Unfortunately, the proximity of coastal zones to very large human populations has meant major threats to this biodiversity from urban and industrial pollutants, oil spills and, more recently, invasion by non-native species released with ballast water of ships. Other ecosystems with high diversity or whose biodiversity is composed of many rare species include those on mountain tops, oceanic islands and semi&amp;hyphen;arid and arid areas.

          Illawarra districts share much. Both regions are a symbol of the fight for jobs and job security. Newcastle, on that fateful day of 29 April this year, showed what has been blindingly obvious: the Howard government has no vision and no sense of obligation to the responsibility of governing. The Howard government has failed regional Australia. Last Friday it attempted an apology. The government, through its announced projects for work for the dole, sought to apologise for cutting jobs, cutting labour market programs, cutting government offices and services and for creating a crisis in regional areas. The apology extended is meek.

We share a diverse population, we have recognised the need to change, we have diversified our local economies, we share a sense of community and our values remain the same. In every sense of the word, the Hunter and Illawarra share a close and historic relationship. The Illawarra, with our strong Labor movement, has followed, supported and continues to support the struggle waged by the striking Rio Tinto coal miners. I was particularly pleased a fortnight or so ago to be able to express solidarity on behalf of my region to the important motion moved by my Labor colleagues the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) and the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) concerning the Rio Tinto industrial dispute.

The Illawarra feels the impact of these job losses in Newcastle. We have been through it too. Importantly, we are going through it with Newcastle again. It appears to be a little recognised fact that just as Newcastle has lost those 2,500 steel&amp;hyphen;producing jobs, so are we in the Illawarra facing job losses of the same magnitude, given our comparative district wide work force, the same impact, the same feeling and the same consequences.

I, and I am certain my regional colleague the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), tried to explain the harsh and brutally frank fact that if the steel plant at Port Kembla had also been announced for closure, we would also have been receiving attention. I want to make it clear though that the only attention I refer to is the media attention because this government has just meekly accepted BHP's 29 April announcement. It has done nothing more and nothing less. The Port Kembla steel facility emerged from the BHP steel operation's review fairly positively but not unscathed.

          is publishing a three&amp;hyphen;part special series charting a decade of job losses, changing workplaces and the end of job security in Australia. The lead article highlights the decision in Newcastle and mentions that Port Kembla will lose about 800 jobs. I actually personally believe that it will be higher than this. The BHP Port Kembla steel facility in the heart of my electorate is world class. Ron McNeilly, during his 29 April press conference, said as much when he said:

         <para style="Para">
          Port Kembla can claim this distinction because of the steel industry plan introduced by the Labor government and the commitment of BHP's work force and the steel trade unions. We would not have a steel industry left in Australia today if Labor had adopted the `we were not told but the decision has been made' attitude of the present government.

          Nobody in the Illawarra is fooled by the world&amp;hyphen;class and world&amp;hyphen;scale labels attached to Port Kembla. We are proud of it, but we know what it means. Despite the flattering label, Port Kembla will produce its quota of job losses and savings for BHP.

          BHP management at Port Kembla hosts a briefing session for community leaders twice yearly to keep us informed of developments and the performance of its operations. We had one of these briefings just prior to the 29 April announcement. I was among a couple of

Two things were made clear to us: BHP had decreed a 15 per cent return on its capital investment and job losses would be the major parts of identified savings. The Illawarra has and is facing its quota of steel industry job losses but also over the last 18 months the region has seen jobs disappear in the coal industry, in other manufacturing industries and in services.

          On top of these 200 jobs, a further 860 jobs from Illawarra coal mines are to disappear over the next three years.

          I do not begrudge the media attention that Newcastle has received. The attention is justified. The point I make is that, like Newcastle, the Illawarra and other regional areas of Australia face the same problems.

          Australia's regional areas are in trouble. The see no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil response by the Howard government is only contributing to job losses and the threats to job security.

The Illawarra and the Hunter have each developed regional strategies which are actively being

          I well remember back in 1982&amp;hyphen;83 when we were faced with the threat of the closure of the steelworks at Port Kembla because BHP had decided that there was more profit to be made in the gas production of the Bass Strait. They had decided to get out of steel making and despite the fact that Port Kembla had contributed massively to the wealth of BHP they were going to walk away. It was when the Hawke Labor government came into power, and within 100 days it produced a steel plan that saved the steel industry in Australia.

          I have recently been on a committee which has prepared a report on the steel industry in Australia for the current minister. It seems to me that governments cannot walk away from important industries like the steel industry. Given the resources that we have here, it would be unthinkable to ship those raw resources out of Australia to contribute to steel making production in some of our neighbouring countries. It is essential that we have a viable steel industry in Australia. It is also vitally important that we have a regional plan for Australia. We must have an industry plan and part of that  industry plan must be a plan for those vital areas of Australia—the regions of Australia.

         The waterfront is a classic case of what is wrong. While the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics is quoting a conservative world benchmark of 25 crane lifts per hour, our five main ports are averaging only 17.4 lifts per hour. That is 43 per cent lower than a modest world average benchmark. Imagine. If four minutes was a modest goal for our country's top athletes to run the mile in, by wharfie standards our best athletes would be plodding over the line in 5 minutes 43.2 seconds. In a fair dinkum race, where the record is well under four minutes, our guys would be almost lapped not once but twice—unprecedented in a four&amp;hyphen;lap race. In a 100&amp;hyphen;metre sprint, instead of recording about 9.8 seconds, our nation's elite would be straggling home in 14 to 15 seconds. Primary school girls could beat our country's best.

         Before I commence my remarks, I would like to congratulate you, on your new position Mr Deputy Speaker Forrest. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), representing the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) has asked me to make a number of comments on his behalf tonight on these amendments, as he is absent from the parliament tonight. This bill gives legislative effect to the commitment given by
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          the government in the last election to preserve the social security safety net by maintaining pensions at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. It also gives effect to an undertaking given by the government during the 1996 spring sittings of the Senate to legislate early in 1997.

         The Senate recently considered the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Male Total Average Weekly Earnings Benchmark) Bill, and referred it back to this House with requests for two amendments, which will affect DSS and DVA recipients. The Senate requested that the government remove the five&amp;hyphen;year sunset clause provision in the bill. At present there is a sunset clause that states that these amendments only apply for a period of five years, ending on 21 September 2002. This clause would give parliament an opportunity to review these provisions in five years time to ensure that fiscal dollars are being appropriately targeted. It will be up to parliament at that time to again decide whether this legislative provision is appropriate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is a reasonable approach for any government concerned with proper financial management. The budget cost of fulfilling the average weekly earnings commitment may change markedly in the future if there is a divergence in movements in the average weekly earnings and the CPI figures. The sunset clause ensures that in five years time the government of the day will review this commitment to ensure that it is the best method of maintaining pensions at a rate that will preserve the social security safety net. The government considers that it is not desirable that there be an indefinite budget commitment without reviewing the commitment at a later date.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The sunset clause is in line with the policy that the community should not be locked into expenditures which may not accord with their priorities and which at some point may prove unsustainable. This is an issue of financial responsibility on which the opposition has no credibility, and it can be seen to diminish in no way the government's commitment to provide an adequate age pension. The government has clearly demonstrated its credentials
         <break page="9260" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          by being the first government to set aside money in the budget forward estimates to pay for this commitment in future years. Although the government does not favour the removal of the five&amp;hyphen;year sunset clause, we have decided to accept the Senate's request for amendment in this case to ensure that the government's commitment to maintain pensions at 25 per cent of the average weekly earnings benchmark is enshrined in legislation as soon as possible.

           However, I would also take the opportunity to inform the House of the amendments made by the opposition which the government did not accept and which were defeated in the Senate. The first set of opposition amendments tried to ensure that people on allowances—that is, unemployed people and their partners, people caring for children at home, widows and people who cannot work temporarily because they are sick—had the same legislative protection as people on pensions. Labor was seeking to give all of these people the same sort of protection that the government is giving to people on pensions. However, the government refused to give these groups of people this protection.

For those opposite who may be interested, Labor was attempting to address this appalling situation by ensuring that benchmark increases flowed on to these people. It is our strong view that people on allowances should be offered the same legislative protection as people on pensions.

         It is particularly critical in the climate created by this government, where we have had massive cuts to social security and where $10 billion has been cut from health, housing, education and social security, that we see some commitment to protecting those who are the most disadvantaged in our community. A member opposite said that he would like to know what Labor did when it was in office.

         When Labor took office in 1983, the coalition had left the single rate of pension at 22.7 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. Between 1983 and 1991 we progressively increased the rates until in June 1990 the single rate of pension exceeded 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings for the first time—as measured against male total average weekly earnings for the previous quarter—and again in September 1990, as measured against male total average weekly earnings for the same quarter. The single rate of pension stayed at or above 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings—as measured against that indicator for the same quarter for every subsequent quarter—until Labor left office except on one occasion in June 1995 when it fell below by approximately 15c.

         If the pension remains at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings it will be because of the coalition's good fortune and not because of any action on the part of the government. I say that it will be because of the coalition's good fortune because pensions will only remain at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings if wages remain constant or fall. This is not good fortune for the workers of Australia and of course would not be good fortune for pensioners. The likelihood of wages falling under a coalition government is very high. Let us make this position very clear: pensions will only remain at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings if wages do not rise over time.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The coalition voted against these two sets of amendments. They refused to guarantee benchmark increases for allowees, even those which they say they will pay for from the contingency reserve. The coalition also refused to benchmark pensions on estimated male total average weekly earnings for the current quarter rather than male total average weekly earnings for the previous quarter, therefore ensuring that pensions do not ever remain at 25 per cent of the benchmark unless wages are constant or fall.

         The Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill represents the first step in moving the Australian Wheat Board from a wholly government owned enterprise to a company owned and controlled by the wheat growers of Australia. The industry has recognised, for many years, that growers needed to take control of wheat marketing to ensure it is most commercial and can deliver the best returns to growers in an increasingly competitive international marketplace.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Industry agreed that the wheat industry fund should be expanded to become the capital base for a future corporate AWB structure. The fund now stands at some $444 million and is well on target to reach the figure considered necessary by the industry's financial consultants for the AWB to market and make advance payments for wheat without government backing. This target is of the order of $500 million to $550 million at the end of June 1999.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This government is faced with the challenge of delivering to the industry a viable approach to ensuring that the best marketing system is available to them after 30 June 1999. It is not a realistic option to do nothing or to delay action. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, my colleague John Anderson, asked the industry to develop a structure for wheat marketing which met three broad objectives. These objectives were, firstly,
         <break page="9262" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          grower ownership and control of marketing; secondly, a fully commercial approach to marketing; and, thirdly, self&amp;hyphen;reliance. The industry has responded with a structure which will meet these objectives. The arrangements to be put in place by the bill are an initial step towards implementing the new structure, which will take effect in 1999. They provide for converting the AWB's commercial activities into a commercial company structure.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second stage of restructuring involves the conversion of the WIF to a shareholding in the new grower owned company. This will be addressed in next year's legislative amendments. The industry has agreed that this is a sensible approach in order to deliver the outcomes it requires by 1999. The government supports the continuation of single desk selling by the AWB. This is of major importance to the grains industry.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Under this bill, the export monopoly will continue to be held by the statutory Australian Wheat Board, which will licence exports by its commercial pool export subsidiary. The matter of establishing an independent regulatory mechanism to manage and monitor the performance of the export monopoly after 1999 will be addressed in the second tranche of legislation next year.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government would not wish to see the AWB put at risk after 1999 simply because it had not had adequate opportunity to prepare to meet the rigours of the commercial and financial marketplace. This bill gives the AWB the means to prepare itself for an independent future while still enjoying the support of government, particularly through underwriting, until 1999.

         The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy appreciates the contribution that members have made to this particular debate. I refer to the members for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), Mallee (Mr Forrest), Page (Mr Causley), Wakefield (Mr Andrew) and Grey (Mr Wakelin); and, from the other side, the shadow minister, the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), and the members for Calare (Mr Andren), Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) and Corio (Mr O'Connor)—all of those who spoke, and who recognised the importance of the wheat industry and how essential it is to our nation

         The honourable member for Burke has sought to have consideration of the bill by this House deferred until the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee has reported. He has claimed that both sides of politics have expressed disquiet on a number of matters regarding the restructuring of the AWB. However, I would emphasise that there is widespread agreement on the proposals of this bill for a transitional restructuring of the AWB.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The key matters which have been raised in this debate on the bill, including those in the shadow minister's own contribution, have been whether a company structure is best for the AWB after 1999 and whether it is necessary to adopt a two&amp;hyphen;stage process to put in place this new structure. A number of options were considered by the industry&amp;hyphen;led working group, including trusts and cooperatives, but it was agreed that a company structure was the most commercial option. This was confirmed by the advice of the financial consultants, who believe that a company structure is most appropriate for an organisation of the type and size of the AWB. I would mention that a fully commercial structure was one of the principles set out by the minister for restructuring the AWB. The industry agrees with this view.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Further, the industry has developed a company structure and a shareholding arrangement to ensure grower ownership and control. Indeed, a company structure is also consistent with the previous government's plan for the AWB, as set out in 1992. The importance of a two&amp;hyphen;stage approach to move the AWB from a statutory authority to a grower owned company was agreed by the industry&amp;hyphen;led working group. The importance of early action to prepare the AWB for operation as a privately owned and financed wheat exporting company in 1999 was emphasised by the consultants to the working group.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The AWB needs to develop a track record and identify as a fully commercial body, rather than a government backed body, in
         <break page="9263" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          order to achieve the credit rating required to finance wheat exporting and pool payments after government underwriting is withdrawn in 1999. At that time, the financial markets will still be dealing with the same entity but the source of financial support will change.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Furthermore, providing for the AWB to conduct its activities through corporations law companies will assist in developing commercial disciplines and practices which are typically found in commercial organisations. It will allow the AWB to formulate and implement appropriate controls and accountability arrangements between the various subsidiaries, which can be carried over once legislative controls are removed. It will also establish a strong base for the new company as a commercial wheat marketer for the review of the export monopoly under the national competition policy in 1999&amp;hyphen;2000.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The matters raised by the shadow minister, such as access to WIF by growers after 1999 and settling a commercial rate of return for shareholders after 1999, are not germane to this bill. As the minister explained in his second reading speech, the government will specifically address matters such as transferring WIF into grower held shares in a second tranche of legislation next year. However, 30 June 1999 is now less than two years away. It is imperative to put action in train now to provide for the AWB to reorganise itself to become a fully commercial company in 1999. To do so would put at risk the continued provision of the best marketing services for the wheat growers of Australia. For this reason, the government does not support the amendment but commends the legislation to the House.

          Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1997
         </xref>
         make minor technical changes to two areas, in response to representations by the industry. The first area relates to the deemed agency arrangements in the bill, which allow the Australian Wheat Board to operate as an agent of the new holding and pooling companies—companies A and B—between 1 July 1997 and the commencement of operation of this legislation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The deemed agency arrangements are designed to avoid the need to have different pools, operated by the AWB and nominated company B, for wheat of the 1997-98 season. The original wording in the bill would have resulted in these deemed agency arrangements applying to the AWB's cash trading operations as well as to pooling, which was not the intention. For example, futures contracts for cash&amp;hyphen;traded wheat would have become the responsibility of company B, the pooling company, rather than of companies A or C, which will be responsible for non&amp;hyphen;pool activities.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second matter relates to the AWB's activities in connection with old seasons' wheat—that is, wheat of the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 and earlier seasons. The bill was intended to enable the statutory AWB to undertake all the activities necessary to finalise the pools for wheat of these seasons—for example, meeting export contracts and making further pool payments to growers.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, in the absence of this amendment to grandfather all of the current functions of the AWB for old seasons' wheat, the AWB would have been unable to continue to refinance borrowings associated with that wheat, to the obvious detriment of growers delivering to those pools. I commend these amendments to the House and present a supplementary explanatory memorandum.

          —As I was saying on 2 October, when I began this speech on the Native Title Amendment Bill, the High Court rejection of Aboriginal property rights in 1972 meant that the Aboriginal land right activists and their supporters were most concerned. They responded by erecting the tent embassy on the lawns of Parliament House. Their placards proclaimed `Land now; not lease tomorrow'. It was Australia Day 1972.

         The Whitlam government, elected in that year, responded by making a campaign commitment to introduce legislation for native land rights. Justice Edward Woodward was appointed a royal commissioner to advise this new government in relation to the granting of rights to land to indigenous people. Three years later, in 1975 and eight years after their initial walk&amp;hyphen;off, the Gurindji were given leasehold only access to some 3,000 square kilometres, a part of the land they had claimed.

          in 1992 in the Merian/Mabo decision of the Australian High Court it was found that indigenous Australian people had held and in some cases could continue to have a common law right to claim native title. The concept of terra nullius was no longer to be the foundation of our law regarding who once owned and who continues to have some rights to title to some land in Australia.

         Following Mabo No. 2, the Labor government moved quickly to frame native title legislation to give effect to the outcomes of the Mabo High Court determination. By 1993 the act was in place. A native title tribunal was established with state governments allowed to set up alternative processes. The act, as I have said before, was well intentioned. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said:
        </para>

         The act validated potentially invalid past acts of government such as grants of interest in land since the commencement of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. Following the successful Wik High Court challenge that focused on the question of extinguishment of native title over pastoral leases, some 78 per cent of the Australian land mass became potentially subject to native title claim.

         It is now 1997, 100 years since those Victorian Aboriginals first brought their claims for land to the parliament in Melbourne. And what has this Native Title Act 1993 achieved for indigenous Australians? How has it protected the rights of all Australians so they continue to have secure access to the land and water resources necessary to sustain a developed society? How has it fostered respect for Aboriginal and Islander culture or a recognition of their unique status as indigenes? The answer, of course, is that this act is deeply flawed and it has, in fact—but inadvertently—contributed to a deterioration in inter&amp;hyphen;race relations throughout this country.

         A great deal of goodwill has been lost on the side of both the claimants and those whose interests will be impacted by native title. In developing this bill our government has had four objectives: to reduce the current uncertainty in all things related to the act; to make the native title claim process work; to find a balance between the interests of all parties; and, most importantly, to foster and maintain a respect for Australian native title.

         These amendments will provide certainty by confirming that native title has already been extinguished throughout Australia on freehold, residential and commercial tenures. As well, it confirms extinguishment of native title where exclusive possession was either expressly confirmed or must have been intended when an agricultural lease was granted. It will not be possible to make native title claims over land where extinguishment of native title has been confirmed—and this country needed that sort of certainty. But no native title rights will be acquired or impaired without fair and just compensation, and this government sees that it is the responsibility of governments to pay that compensation.

          has been discussed quite broadly in the community and is held to be in great odour by many sections of the community. The government is claiming that this bill will fix up a mess, that it will give all the parties a renewed opportunity to get on with the job and to build a more secure, certain and prosperous Australia for all Australians. They are great words, but the trouble is that this bill is not going to do this for all Australians. It is heavily biased towards specific groups of Australians, amongst whom are some of the most privileged and well&amp;hyphen;off members of our community. It is actually going to detract from the rights of another group within our community—unarguably a group that is less well off, and that is the Aboriginal community—by permitting the extinguishment of most native title rights and allowing pastoralists to

         The High Court's decision in Mabo No. 2 left unanswered questions such as where native title exists, who holds native title and the nature of that title. It also opened up the possibility of extensive litigation in the courts. The Native Title Act 1993 was enacted in order to provide a statutory framework for deciding questions left unanswered by the Mabo decision. Members will recall that the Western Australian government challenged the validity of that act and its application in that state. The High Court, with one small exception, found unanimously that the act was a valid exercise of the Commonwealth's race powers. There have been other court cases that have had implications for the Native Title Act 1993. There has also been considerable discussion and lots of papers have been written and circulated on this matter.

         In particular, the Wik decision produced quite a reaction. In December 1996 the High Court held that pastoralists' rights and native title rights could coexist on the same land, although native title rights would have to yield to the rights of pastoralists to the extent of any inconsistencies. The government responded to this decision by releasing its iniquitous 10&amp;hyphen;point plan, with sweeping cutbacks to native title especially on pastoral leases. In effect, the government panicked. This legislation before the House tonight incorporates the government's 10&amp;hyphen;point plan and goes even further in its curtailment of native title.

         Native title will be extinguished forever on many types of land which is essentially public land—land dedicated for public works, land grants from one government to another or to a statutory authority and land subject to community purpose leases—even where there is minimal or no conflict between the public use and native title uses. Indeed, native title can be extinguished by the construction of a Telstra telephone tower, by a road that no longer exists or by an overland telegraph line. If anything that may have been granted for government or for community purposes in the past is part of an area that is claimed for

         Although extinguishment may be very rapid, Aboriginal people will still have to prove native title before they can be compensated, and various technicalities will make native title very difficult to prove.

         Access to land before native title claims have been decided will be restricted to people with current physical access, making it impossible for those forced off their land in the past.

         The government's legislation is divisive and, indeed, I believe, racially discriminatory.

However, what concerns me about this legislation is the hard line of the government. I cannot understand why there cannot be negotiations on these matters. You do not have to extinguish people's rights. The Aboriginal people are willing to negotiate, and so are others.

We have seen people of goodwill being able to get together and overcome a lot of these barriers. But unfortunately the government has been driven by people who do not have any goodwill in their heart or any kindness in their soul. This legislation is not a sensible outcome.

          Extinguishing native title will not work. This legislation, if passed, is certain to be contested by lawyers. In fact, it has been reported that the Australian Law Reform Commission, forbidden from putting its submission to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title, considers that the plan effectively will extinguish native title on pastoral leases and that that is unconstitutional. Members of the government might say, `Well, that's just one voice.' But there are so many of these voices saying that this legislation is flawed. There are many, many voices saying this is a very, very flawed piece of legislation. There will be more, not less, litigation.

But I think one of the problems we have seen in this country is that, unless we can find a way of reconciling those of us who have been here for a short while with those of us who have been here for a long while, we will not advance as a country.

         It is little wonder that there is so much confusion and division within our community. You only need to go back to the development of the Native Title Act 1993 and read some of the statements made by then Prime Minister Keating, Senator Gareth Evans, Senator Bob Collins, Robert Tickner and others to see where our current problems originated. The intention to extinguish native title on pastoral leases was clearly stated in an article in the

         The genesis of the deal that eventually clinched Paul Keating's Mabo package emerged Sunday night in a phone call between the Government's special adviser on Mabo, Phillip Toyne, and the Executive Director of the NFF, Rick Farley. Mr Toyne had a proposition to put to Mr Farley, based on some proposals from the Cape York Land Council's Noel Pearson. The proposal was the Aborigines would concede the extinguishment of native title on pastoral leases in return for a deal giving them access to the right to convert their pastoral leases into inalienable freehold.

Mr Farley asked how much time he had to think about it. None, Mr Keating replied. Mr Farley said he accepted the deal. Mr Keating rang back later at 11.50 p.m. to confirm the deal had gone through Cabinet.

And it is not in our interest to pursue . . . pastoral leases.

         There is absolutely no doubt of the deal that was struck and it is little wonder people feel both confused and betrayed. Mabo and Wik have turned the Australian land title system as we know it on its ear. We as a nation need to look at land tenure through a totally different set of eyes.

         While there are those who would argue that the whole issue should be left to the courts, I passionately believe that it is the responsibility of the parliament to provide a fair, certain and workable legal regime for the operation of native title. It would be totally irresponsible of any government to abrogate its responsibility by leaving this issue to the courts. I am not a lawyer, so I will leave the legal argument to those more qualified. What I do have, however, unlike the previous speaker, the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), is a real life experience of the effect within the community, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians, with the current act. Its effects are: anxiety, uncertainty, division and unrealistic expectations from some sections of our community. I submit an overview of three very different examples highlighting the effects of the current uncertainty. The first is an extract from a constituent's letter:

A claim has been placed over the esplanade and surrounding waters by three separate tribes. We have been here since 1978 and maps date back to 1897 when it was originally pegged. We are not a pastoral leases or a mining lease, as is most commonly discussed by the media when they discuss native title matters. We are in the port of Cairns.

         The second example is of a young family who are the lessees of an occupational licence that was originally granted in 1887. It has been used continuously since for grazing. In 1993 the family submitted a three&amp;hyphen;year development plan for the property and in doing so applied for a tenure upgrade. In short they were unable to identify any traditional owners but when the licence was advertised for claim in newspapers by the Native Title Tribunal a claim was lodged in May 1995. Unperturbed, the family had face-to-face contact with the claimants, a deal was quickly struck and a mutually acceptable access agreement was reached.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Unfortunately, through the intervention of local land councils the deal was rescinded. The family was prevented from having any further contact with the actual claimants and the last proposal put by the land council was for the family to surrender their lease to the claimant group, then lease back the property they had worked so hard to develop on terms and conditions set by the claimant body—hardly coexistence.

        <para first-indent="16">
         This process has now been going on for over three years and the financial impact on the family has been devastating. I should say that at this point in time there is absolutely no resolution in sight. There has been an estimation with regard to the cost of running that claim by the native title group representative body of some $2&amp;half; million. The family involved have spent, I think, $13,000&amp;hyphen;odd at this stage, of which they have been able to access $4,000 in support from the government. They are in dire straits. They certainty do not have any resources to be able to defend their rights.

The same lawyers to date have shared with some land councils close to $90 million of taxpayers' money over the last five years on native title issues. It would not be difficult to adopt a cynical view that these groups are more focused on their own self-interest than on looking after the interests of grassroots Aboriginal communities.

I would urge the church leaders to actually get into the communities and talk to all parties affected and therefore be more constructive and supportive in finding a solution for all Australians rather than being judgmental.

         Given the extent of the legislation, it is impossible to speak on all aspects, but I will focus on a few. Suggestions that this legislation is blanket extinguishment is nonsense. The effect of Wik was to more than double the extent to which native title may—the operative word here is `may'—exist, in effect increasing from over 30 per cent of Australia that which is vacant Crown land and Aboriginal land to include a further 42 per cent of Australia that is pastoral lease land and where coexisting native title may now exist.

         Much has been said with regard to access to pastoral leases. As somebody who knows, let me assure the House, particularly those on the other side, that in the greatest majority of cases access for legitimate reasons by Aboriginal people is welcomed by pastoral leaseholders, lifelong friendships have been nurtured and cultural differences have been respected. This is encouraged in our legislation. It saddens me when I hear assertions from those of the chardonnay set in metropolitan Australia with no concept of the reality of bush living that the Aboriginals and pastoralists in rural Australia are in continual conflict.

         There has been a lot of criticism with respect to the effect of schedule 4 in the amendment bill and that it will represent bucketloads of extinguishment. Again, I suggest that this sort of emotive hysteria is clearly unfounded. The reality is that schedule 4 represents less than 7.7 per cent of the Australian land mass and only contains those titles other than freehold—and I might point out that freehold in this country represents only 14 per cent—which clearly grants the land&amp;hyphen;holder exclusive possession. That is in line with the Mabo decision which, in part, states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The personal rights confirmed by common law native title do not constitute an estate or interest in the land itself. They are extinguished by an unqualified grant of an inconsistent estate in the land by the Crown such as a grant in fee or a lease conferring the right to exclusive possession.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         It is absolutely crucial to ensure that these titles are clearly defined. In order to bring some clarity to the issue, it should also be noted that all states in the development of schedule 4 have confirmed that we as a government have taken a very conservative approach to this matter and any titles in doubt have been rejected. I believe that no clearer

         I really do not think it is appropriate for us to be able to open up other opportunities for those few lawyers who tend to prey on the uncertainly here in an attempt to be able to pay for their own superannuation. In this day of litigation I think we need to be able to clearly define those areas where there is no doubt so that we can at least provide some certainty to the holders of those titles and also to not raise the expectations of Aboriginal people to a point where they believe that they may have some entitlement to that land.

         Another nonsense being peddled by interest groups opposing the bill suggests a windfall benefit for a few foreigners and wealthy pastoral families. There is no provision to allow for wholesale freeholding of leasehold land. In fact, there is a mechanism specifically to prevent this from happening. There has always been a provision for upgrading for special purposes, and this will continue. The cost to the leaseholder for these upgrades has been such that it is done on a needs basis.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When I listen to the arguments here there has always been a suggestion that this cost will be imposed at a cost to the taxpayer and for the benefit of a few. I can assure you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that any cost of upgrading is borne by the leaseholder and what they intend to do with what land determines whether or not they intend to upgrade that small section of their pastoral lease to give them a greater income. Not only is there a cost in the actual upgrading but also there is a very significant increase in fees or rentals for that upgrade in tenure. It is something that is not taken lightly and it is only done if they can justify an increase in revenue from the area which they intend to upgrade.

         Land matters have been and of course will continue to be dealt with at state and territory level. They are not done at a federal level; they have been and will continue to be done at a state level. The provision which broadens the nature of the activities that can be carried out on a pastoral lease is in line with primary production as defined in the tax act and is only acknowledging what currently exists.

          I think it would be most inappropriate for us as a government to lock in pastoral leases in a snapshot in time. The intended use of the original pastoral leases back in the early 1880s has certainly changed in the last 100 years. We have no idea what is likely to happen in the next 100 years. To lock them into a snapshot in time is most inappropriate and certainly would guarantee that the holders of these leases are doomed for failure.

          Those people who argue that we lock them into this particular concept of the original intention of the pastoral leases are the same people who will argue very strongly that, now we are talking in the 20th and 21st century, Aboriginal traditional hunting will include aluminium boats, outboard motors, firearms and four&amp;hyphen;wheel drive vehicles. I have no problem with that. It is part of developing society. But why should acknowledgment be given to one group of Australians to be able to move their culture with technology while another group of Australians are compelled to be held in a concept that was developed in the early 19th century? It is extremely unreasonable and most inappropriate.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Another thing is that they are always arguing about these foreign interests having massive windfalls. Foreign interest on pastoral lease land in this country totals about 3.8 per cent of the pastoral lease area. Australian companies and established `wealthy'—I use the word very loosely—pastoral family holdings have a similar amount. It may shock some on the other side and some of those that are opposing this legislation to know that the single largest pastoral lease holders are Aboriginal people themselves. Along with their own land holding interests, they currently own in excess of 15.3 per cent of Australia's mass. The balance of pastoral leases is held by average Australian families—bush battlers. On 1997 statistics each of these families possess an average debt of $132,000 per family and generate an average income of $47,100 per family. What we might be really surprised about, given the current difficulties with drought and stock prices, et cetera, is that the average profit is presently a negative $1,400 per annum. You could hardly suggest that they are the privileged silver spoon set.

           I am running out of time, but in wrapping up let me say that there are numerous other aspects of the bill that will need to be covered and I look forward to speaking on them at a later time. I do believe that the  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997  is a balanced and responsible legislative means of reflecting the outcomes of Mabo and Wik in such a way as to protect the legitimate native title rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians while at the same time giving security and certainty to all other land title holders of this nation. I commend the bill to the House.

          is a monument to indecisive and gutless government. The truth is that even with all the time the government has had at its disposal it has come forward with a bill that does not go as far as Paul Keating thought his own legislation went. Paul Keating was adamant that pastoral leases extinguish native title. Paul Keating believed that in his bill there was a prima facie case. It is in the prologue to the act; it is not in the body of the act. When it was first established the Native Title Tribunal rejected many claims as being vexatious and without merit. The legal service took the matter to the court and the court held that it was not in the act. In my view a responsible court would have acknowledged that it was a terribly badly drafted bill but that the intention of the government was clear and advised the government to amend its legislation; instead, it opened it up so that any Aboriginal anywhere in Australia could claim any land. As our ex&amp;hyphen;Governor&amp;hyphen;General Bill Hayden said, this has turned into no more than the right to extortion. The right to negotiate is no more than the right to extortion and that is the way it has been used.

         I went to see John Howard when he became Prime Minister because I had goodwill towards him. I said to him that I thought he ought to move quickly to extinguish native title, to bring in legislation to put it beyond doubt so that Australia would know how the government felt. His response to me was, `Oh, that would be far too controversial. I am going to leave it to the court.' I told him that the court was not to be trusted, to which he said in rather aggrieved tones, `Well, Paul Keating thinks it is.' I acknowledged that that  was the case and also that Keating was wrong. It is matter of history now that I was right on that occasion. He said, `Anyway, you wouldn't get it through the Senate.' I reminded him that, as Prime Minister, his responsibility was to put forward the legislation and the views of his party, to put it to the parliament and, if it was rejected, be prepared to take it to a double dissolution, which I felt absolutely sure he would have won.

He said to Mr Balderstone, the only man to survive from the Keating cabinet, `Get me Aboriginals.' So Mr Balderstone traipsed off to the Northern Land Council and put together a list of some 36 Aboriginals from across Australia. I do not know much about the eastern state ones but I know this: of the six appointed from Western Australia, I said at the time that I would be prepared to stand in an election where only Aboriginal people voted against any one of them and I could guarantee I would win, because those people had no respect, no acknowledgment, from the great mass of Aboriginal people, who were never consulted and still are not consulted.

          The real issue facing Aboriginals is not access to land. The statistics show this. Where Aboriginals have been alienated from land longest, their per capita income, their health and their welfare is generally much better. The issues facing Aboriginal people generally are housing, hygiene, health, education, and training and employment, probably in that order, but every one is essential. Leave one off and the whole cart falls over. What do we do? We rush around attacking one or the other. There is never a concerted, combined attack on that whole issue of what needs to be done to drag Aboriginal people along with us. I believe it is about time we had some real compassion, some real thought and some real effort put into this business. Let's face it, it is not an insurmountable problem. You are talking about less than two per cent of our population. Certainly we could deal with it if there was any consistent will there.

That is enough to buy every Aboriginal family in Australia a brand new house every two years. If it wasn't for the price of land in Sydney you could do it even quicker. Just imagine that: every two years we are spending enough to buy every Aboriginal family a brand new house. But it is not happening. The money is not getting down to the ground, and Aboriginal people know it is not. They know that the community at large is starting to say, `Where are our taxes going?' But they know the money is not going to them.

We say, `Look at those Aboriginals, getting the gubba in to do the work.' It is not their fault; it is the only way they can get it done. If they don't, the money churns around. It is given back the next year at the same time and the same thing happens. We see statements then made about the money these stations get. We do not see the money that is returned.

If you look throughout Asia, their record of treating their indigenous people has almost inevitably been extinguishment—not of titles but of a person. That has been the case throughout Asia. There is no regard for indigenous people. When people understand how much money per capita is expended on indigenous people in Australia, they get an idea of just what an effort the taxpayer of this country has made.

         In the Mabo decision the High Court found there was a common law right to native title. As a response, the parliament brought in the Native Title Act 1993, which was introduced by the Keating government. I would like to share with you a statement by the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating. On 16 November 1993, he said:

         While there was a recognition of native title it was plain that the Prime Minister of the day intended pastoral leases to extinguish native title.

         I would also like to read from a statement of the then Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, former Senator the Hon. Gareth Evans, on 18 December:

         . . . the High Court decision will confirm that properly granted pastoral leases, for example, do in fact extinguish native title. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said as much. That is our legal judgment, that is our belief,  that although the High Court did leave a sliver of doubt—

         Noel Pearson was asked the following question by Ian Paterson of the ABC on 10 November 1993:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Regarding valid pastoral leases, did you rule out the possibility of any legal action by Aboriginal groups?
        </para>

         Noel Pearson's reply was as follows:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Well, I rule out the possibility in Queensland of people pursuing any rights in relation to pastoral leases owned by non&amp;hyphen;Aboriginal people. I rule that out categorically, because there is a facility now available for us to purchase under the land fund, and to convert into native title, pastoral lease.

         What is the existing situation that we are now left with? As the member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) has said, we now have 15.3 per cent of land provided to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. That is 117 million hectares for two per cent of the population—352,970 people. How much land do you
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          suppose the average man, woman and child in Australia owns? I can assure you it is a great deal less than 331 hectares per man, woman and child. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders of this country own an area greater than the size of New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory. That is an area greater than the United Kingdom, Germany and France combined. This does not include private land tenures because Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders have the rights appropriately that all other Australians do to privately own land.

        <para first-indent="16">
         What of the funds that Mr Pearson mentioned? What of the facility now available for us to purchase under the land fund? I would like to share with the parliament details of those funds. From 1980 to 1989 the Aboriginal Development Commission bought 145 properties for Aboriginal communities at a cost of $32.2 million. From 1990 to 1996 ATSIC spent $89 million on the purchase of 196 properties. From 1993 to the year 2004 the indigenous land fund, mentioned by Mr Pearson, has a target balance of $1.289 billion, with an annual draw&amp;hyphen;down of $45 million in perpetuity. There has been an initial allocation of $200 million to this. From 1976 to the current day, Aboriginal groups in the Northern Territory have received $350 million in mining royalties. By the year 2004, which is only seven years away, there will have been provided to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in this country $5,000 per man, woman and child to buy land. That is over and above health and education, all of which are very necessary. It is aside from claims under the Native Title Act.

         So that is the current situation with land ownership and the Native Title Act 1993. In December of last year, in a breathtaking display of judicial piracy, the High Court overturned the will of the people expressed by the parliament in both houses and agreed to, as we have seen, by the former Labor Prime Minister Mr Keating, the House of Representatives, the Senate, the pastoral industry expressed through the farmers and the National Farmers Federation, Noel Pearson and the Aboriginal Land Council and also the Democrats. We now have the Wik decision, which
         <break page="9280" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          has said that all of those who agreed to the Native Title Act 1993 and the propositions and preamble in that were wrong. Our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is now faced with a response to the Wik decision. It is his role to assert the supremacy of parliament and to keep faith with those who believe a deal is a deal, particularly the deal of 1993.

         (i) The assurances given in 1993 by the then Prime Minister and Attorney&amp;hyphen;General to the Parliament, and contained in the preamble to the Native Title Act, in relation to the effect of the grant of a pastoral lease on any previous existing native title should be given statutory effect;

         And I want to add, for those who have said that there is a land grab here, that I happen to have been a fourth generation owner of land in Queensland, and in Queensland leasehold land is the same price as freehold. That is absolutely so. And when you convert from leasehold to freehold, there is a betterment charge—for everybody. So anybody in this House who has said that there is a land grab should remember that 96 per cent of land&amp;hyphen;holders in our areas are families and that we always pay a betterment charge in Queensland. I want that on the record because I am tired of the lies that are being spread about pastoralists in Queensland. I want to go on now to talk about some of the other things that we proposed:

         That is the situation that was left with the decision by the High Court on Wik. The Prime Minister, to his credit, has improved greatly on the uncertainty left after the Wik decision, and I would now like to share with you some of the very sound measures in this legislation, not only for farmers but for all
         <break page="9281" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Australians. These include the confirmation of exclusive possession on some tenures, especially freehold, as well as residential, commercial and public works. In other words, the cities and towns can go on with their affairs as they always have, and that is appropriate.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Can I say, though, that it does not extend beyond the cities and towns. We now have situations where, for instance, fire brigades are looking at building new sheds, but they cannot. They cannot find any land around their town or small city to put a shed for a bush fire brigade. Because of the changes in gun laws, gun clubs, with the enormous rise in membership, are looking at ranges. There is no land available for gun ranges. So not all situations are taken into account, and I think it is very unjust to make one law for the cities and towns and another for the bush.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Fortunately, we have confirmation of primary production and incidental activities under lease conditions. Defined primary production activities outside lease conditions will be able to be carried on, subject to permits, without the need for negotiation with claimants. The threshold test for native title claims has been tightened up. There is a single treatment for multiple overlapping claims; the Crown's capacity to manage water is confirmed. There is legal assistance for pastoralists, but not in all conditions. Claims are going to be determined by the Federal Court. The Native Title Tribunal will have a reduced role and there is a six&amp;hyphen;year sunset clause for claims under the act.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But there are difficulties in this legislation. Because compensation is to be incurred by the states, it is very likely that they are going to be slow in issuing permits to extend the activities of farmers beyond the terms of their leases. I will tell you what that means in real terms. If we are going to have primary production restrained to a 20th century version of production under the tax act, these are the things that will not happen.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would like to hark back to some decades ago when a pastoralist was in a great deal of difficulty. He was facing drought and other problems on his property. He decided that he would start a little freight run. He had a little plane and he was going to run a few passen
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          gers and freight around northern Australia, and he did. He became quite successful. He called his little service the Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services, Qantas. But you will not find Qantas under this legislation or the ideas put forward by the Labor Party. There will never be another Qantas, not under the Labor Party. They want to fossilise primary production in the 20th century.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I will tell you something else we will not have: we will not have wind farms, because primary production is defined as tilling the land, as building a fence, as putting in a dam. What pastoralists have now found in New South Wales is that they are farming the wind. They put in windmills, they collect the wind energy and they sell it back into the grid. What a great idea. But you will not be able to do that.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is something else that we will not be able to do. I am indebted to Dr Des Albert, an old university colleague of mine who is an Australian expert on plasmaphysics. He has done some calculations for me on solar energy; the fuel of the future. I will use the state of South Australia as an example because it is the right size. The projected total annual world energy consumption in the year 2015, which is not very far away, is roughly 500 quad. The source of that projection is the US Department of Energy—Outlook 1997. A quad is 1015 British thermal units.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         South Australia, which has an area of 984,377 square kilometres, receives 3,400 quad of solar energy annually. That is an average solar radiation density of 400 watts per square meter for seven hours of sunlight per day. If we assume an energy conversion efficiency of only 15 per cent, which is pretty low, and if we put solar collectors over the whole of South Australia or an area the size of South Australia we can fuel the world in 2015. But you will not be able to do that under this bill or the ideas put forward by the Labor Party. They want to fossilise our production in this country in the 20th century. We will not be able to fuel the world.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are a number of matters within this bill that need to be taken into account. We need to be looking at a tightening of the
         <break page="9282" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          threshold test. There needs to be a time limit on claims under common law. There are a number of other issues that need to be addressed. There needs to be a schedule of leases for those pastoralists who have missed out.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I want to make one final point: I think there can be a win-win from this. I congratulate my colleagues the member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) and the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), who have so rightly made the point that Aboriginal Australians have been missing out. Much of the money that is allocated to them is not put towards their betterment. I think there can be a win-win out of this, not a system of dual ownership that lashes people together, that takes us back to the pre&amp;hyphen;medieval days in England.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I recall Brennan speaking of the Canadian system in the Wik judgment. He said that dual ownership was an absurdity, and how right he was. We do not want a system of dual ownership. We want private property rights for all Australians—freehold rights for Aboriginals over the unalienated, unallocated crown land and freehold rights with a betterment charge for pastoralists. I believe we can have a win-win out of this for all Australians, most particularly for our children and grandchildren.

           Native Title Amendment Bill 1997
          </xref>
          today, I want to do a number of things. Firstly, I want to outline some of the attitudes that I think are revealed in this legislative package; secondly, I want to look at some of the key provisions of the bill and their shortcomings; thirdly, I want to look at some precedents from my own state—there is a real sense of deja vu about this legislation—and, fourthly, I want to look at some of the solutions that are available to the government.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In reading this legislation and the development of it through the 10-point plan, it is very clear to me that the government, particularly the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), has no real interest in Aboriginal rights or interests. The Prime Minister sees them as an annoying, noisy minority. It is as if Mabo, it would appear, had never happened. What sometimes comes through in the statements made by
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          members opposite is an unashamed and sometimes an unveiled hostility toward Aboriginal people and their interests.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A measure of the Prime Minister's own views is given by his censure of the member for Calare (Mr Andren) about parliamentary entitlements compared with his lack of censure of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). There is clearly in the Prime Minister's statements a failure to concede, let alone to understand, the importance of land and culture to Aboriginal people. He and members of his government have been falling over themselves to provide for pastoralists, saying that he would not let them down under any circumstances, swearing before them that he would look after their interests.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But at no time has such an assurance been given to our indigenous people. It is quite the reverse. Clearly, he and other members who have spoken regard their rights in land, if they are acknowledged at all, as second&amp;hyphen;class rights to be surrendered whenever anyone else lays claim to the same land. We just heard that in the speech of the previous speaker, the member for Dawson (Mrs De&amp;hyphen;Anne Kelly). What the Prime Minister and the government have revealed is a decided antipathy to negotiated settlement and coexistence, despite the generous proffering of hands of those representing Aboriginal communities around Australia. To their credit, they are still trying to reach negotiated agreements.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think it is important that members understand that the central feature of this legislation is the de facto extinguishment of native title and the removal of the right to negotiate. That is what it is all about. That is what the 10&amp;hyphen;point plan is; that is what this legislation represents. We can see that if we look at the key provisions of the bill. We see, first of all, effective legislative extinguishment of native title. The government has refused to incorporate the coexistence of native title on pastoral leases into this legislation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Indeed, it can be seen to have buckled under pressure from minority interests—something the government always accused the Labor Party of when in government. It has refused even to concede the existing interests of Aboriginal people in the pastoral industry,
         <break page="9283" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          which in my own state of Western Australia is very considerable. If we were to listen to the advice of the Australian Law Reform Commission—something the government apparently does not want to do—`there will be substantial grounds upon which it could, and likely will, be challenged before the courts' because of this extinguishment of native title.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill also represents a full&amp;hyphen;frontal assault on the right to negotiate. This, as members opposite appear not to realise, is clearly a core right, not a special right. It is needed—it is essential—for the protection of native title.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Its removal in some instances and its dilution in others will almost certainly be challenged, so God knows why they are doing this. We also see an upgrading of pastoral leases. Whatever some of those with interests in the pastoral industry might say, this is special treatment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In particular, by applying the primary production definition to pastoral activities, we have de facto extension. There is a significant extension of activities on pastoral leases. I must say that I was amused by some of the comments of the previous speaker, who suggested that the whole of South Australia should be turned into a solar farm. I am not sure that they would want that. As a matter of interest, the member for Bonython (Mr Martin Evans), who is at the table, would certainly be able to say so. Aboriginal people are willing and prepared to cooperate with sensible suggestions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Australian Law Reform Commission and others have also warned that in this case the upgrading of pastoral leases will likely contravene the Racial Discrimination Act because of its `discriminatory effect on a particular racial group within society'. That is very clear and unequivocal advice.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill also fails to provide the just terms compensation which inevitably arises from questions surrounding the validation of leases, particularly the so-called intermediate period acts and the proposed sunset clauses. Again, the government has been warned that this is likely to trigger challenge. How many times it needs to be told that I do not know, but it seems determined to ignore it.

          This legislation also contains changes in access to pastoral leases for traditional purposes. The high registration test is clearly unreasonable and harsh. If the government had been prepared to respond to the stolen generation report, it would begin to understand why.

          When I saw this legislation and the justification for it, I had a considerable sense of deja vu. In Western Australia, the Liberal's colleague and now Premier Mr Court failed in a similar attempt to extinguish native title in Western Australia. I was Leader of the Opposition at the time and had to oppose that legislation, too. It had many of the same characteristics, both in attitude and legislation.

          We are half a dozen years down the track and the government is attempting to do it again—a conservative government with no interest in Aboriginal people. We have been able to determine that, as a result of that folly by Premier Court, the taxpayers of Western Australia had to fork out at least $8 million. If the Prime Minister's folly were to pass this parliament, that would be made to look like a trifle. Not only will taxpayers be forced to compensate massively, but also taxpayers in effect will be compelled to provide windfall gains to pastoralists.

          The Prime Minister hailed Hanson's first speech by saying that it meant that `in a sense, the pall of censorship on certain issues has been lifted'. Apart from the moral bankruptcy of this position, the Prime Minister clearly feels no qualms about censoring the Australian Law Reform Commission's informed criticism of his inadequate legislation. He simply does not want to hear their warning that it is a recipe for uncertainty and for financial, legal and international embarrassment for Australia. But I think the people of Australia should hear that warning.

           Similarly in Western Australia, Premier Court attempted to cultivate fear and loathing amongst the people of Western Australia. He, too, talked about threats to our backyards. The Prime Minister has done the same and resorted to hauling misleading maps around TV studios to alarm the community. He is employing precisely the same dishonest tactics. In fact, he probably took advice from them.

           He is extremely alarmist too about economic development, as Premier Court was. It was claimed in Western Australia that mining and exploration would come to a halt, that it would be the end of it. The Prime Minister and his team have peddled the same arrant nonsense. In fact, mining and exploration have continued to expand apace in Western Australia, and there have been negotiated agreements and settlements with our indigenous people. They are the obvious solution.

           I want to have a look at some of the warnings that I gave in Western Australia because they are germane. In the second reading debate against the Court legislation that attempted to extinguish native title, I said:

           It will be the same for 1997 as for 1993. I said that, if the simplistic view enunciated by the Premier—substitute `Prime Minister'—and carried into this legislation prevails, Mabo—for which read `Wik'—would almost certainly lead to very divisive and expensive litigation. The outcome would be a recipe for a loss of investor confidence, which is quite the converse of what the Prime Minister is saying.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           I went on further to say that the Premier of this state—for which read `the Prime Minister'—is `hawking around at media conferences with a list of suburbs and maps purporting to show the specific backyards that would be threatened'. Interestingly, when the Premier was actually challenged to provide those lists and maps to the members of parliament in a question on notice, they had suddenly disappeared altogether. They could not be challenged, because they had disappeared.

            At the same time, the Premier—for which read `the Prime Minister'—was sitting in front of television cameras with the big background of Western Australia—for which read `Australia'—covered in red—for which read `brown'—stating that 80 per cent of Western Australia—Australia—is claimable under native title. It is almost exactly the same words, the same strategy and the same techniques. It will have the same outcome—it will be challenged.

            I said at the time that everyone knows that this position, put together and publicised at great expense, which is being used as the basis of a smear campaign in the Western Australian community, will fail. Again, I warn this government with my warning of that time: nothing is more certain than that this legislation will be knocked out at the earliest possible opportunity by a challenge in the High Court, brought either by the Commonwealth government, as in that case, or by interested Aboriginal people.

          —Tonight on the adjournment I want to talk about something that affects my community here in Canberra and which is a result of a decision taken by this government in their last federal budget. In that budget we had an announcement that the federal government had decided to sell off a number of Commonwealth owned buildings around the country, a sort of fire sale. In the national capital that translated to mean 11 buildings were to be sold. I was very critical of the decision at the time, pointing out the detrimental effect this would have on local confidence, on the local commercial building market, on the local community and on the confidence of the community at large.

          some of them in the ACT were actually listed as partially or, in one or two cases, completely empty at the time of the plan to sell. I queried at that time the signals that this would send out, the difficulty there would be, in reality, in selling these buildings. The
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

          last week ran a very interesting article expressing very strong concern over the situation as it now stands; some months, of course, have passed since that budget.

        <para first-indent="16">
         What has happened in the marketplace in the ACT since that decision was taken? Let me tell you. More than 10 per cent of all office buildings in Canberra are empty, a rate predicted to reach 22 per cent in the Civic and Woden areas—amongst the highest levels in Australia. Braddon—an area not far from this House—has a 30 per cent vacancy rate at the moment in commercial buildings; Belconnen, 18 per cent; Civic, 13 per cent; Woden, 10 per cent; and Turner, 20 per cent.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Property analysts say office rents have fallen 35 per cent in less than two years. They predict that in Civic and Woden, where the vacancy levels are currently 13 per cent and 10 per cent respectively, they could reach 22 per cent in those areas after 1998 unless drastic action is taken by this government to take its buildings off the market. Rising vacancy trends, falling rents and the major tenants—in most cases government—refusing to negotiate with private sector landlords, have created a crisis of confidence. The Churchill Trust, not exactly what you would imagine to be the most volatile or vehement a property owner, owns Churchill House in Northbourne Avenue. They lost their tenant a month ago. In order to attract tenants they have lowered their rent from $295 a square metre to $140 a square metre.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Property industry leaders are alarmed at the growing impact of the vacant buildings on property values, rental prices and investor confidence. They have urged the government to demolish or mothball the 11 buildings listed for sale until the market recovers. The Property Council of Australia said Canberra's office vacancy rate reached a record 10.3 per cent in July. It was 5.9 per cent at the beginning of 1996. The president of the council's ACT division is quoted as saying he hopes

The Mirvac Group is rated as one of the biggest private property owners in the area—and what is their view? Its ACT property general manager is reported as saying that institutionalised property owners were badly affected by the vacancies and this was a concern for investors from outside Canberra. `It is seen as a risk in Canberra,' he says.

         How things have changed, Mr Speaker. Less than two years ago we had the prospect of Commonwealth building development in the ACT; now we are looking at the demolition of the existing ones. No wonder confidence is low, cynicism high and patience almost fully expended. A government is supposed to govern the community, not just an economy. The effect on my community of this government's policies has been nothing short of devastating. There must be an urgent reconsideration of the sale of those 11 commercial buildings and there must be some signs of confidence from this government to this community. They deserve no more and they deserve no less. Newcastle, in its tragic future, at least had notice from BHP; this government gave no notice to this community. It walked in with its scythe, and it cut.

         Domestic violence orders are notoriously easy to obtain and are often granted in the absence of the respondent and on evidence that would not be admissible in any other type of application or court proceeding.

         So where all that is required is harassment to be branded as a person subject to a domestic violence order, with all the stigmatisation and consequences that follow, you would ordinarily expect a particularised charge, proper admissible evidence and an onus of proof more than just more probable than not.

         But, if my views are such that I am in need of counselling, apart from the solicitor I have just mentioned, what about some counselling for Mr Justice Moss of the Family Court and Dr Pat O'Shane, a prominent New South Wales magistrate? His honour said that `examples abounded' of the misuse of these orders in New South Wales. He said that couples were using them as weapons in divorce courts with spurned wives taking them out as vengeance against their husbands. The orders originally meant to protect victims of domestic violence had been expanded to cover so many areas that they were open to abuse and the laws needed to be changed. Dr O'Shane said:

        <para style="Para">
         Justice Moss said that in divorce proceedings one or both sides obtained them against each other as a way to further their case in the Family Court. In other cases one side would agree to an order with no evidence simply because it was cheaper than fighting it because they were already facing substantial legal bills for their divorce proceedings.

          As I said, the consequences can be horrendous. Take the case of Tim Garvey, a senior constable of police, a person who works in my electorate in a police station at Ferny Grove. His wife walked out on him with their nine&amp;hyphen;week&amp;hyphen;old baby after 12 months of marriage in April 1996. In October 1996 he was served with an interim order at his place of work. The application contains the flimsiest allegations—no physical violence, mind you—and some of the evidence demonstrates untruthfulness, sensationalism and hyperbole on the wife's part.

          Garvey appeared for himself; his wife was represented by legal aid. There was a particularly ordinary decision by the magistrate. The magistrate failed to particularise an act of domestic violence in his judgment or anything to suggest that such acts of domestic violence would occur in the future. What were the consequences? He had to notify his superior and surrender his firearm, regardless of whether the court made an order allowing him to retain a weapon at work and detail all of the circumstances. He is confined to a desk as a clerk in uniform until March 1999, 2&amp;half; years later. He cannot work overtime, he is stigmatised by his peers, people wonder if he is corrupt or a psycho and he cannot be promoted.

          If he had had the fortune to be charged with the criminal offence of assault or even assault occasioning bodily harm, he would have had the following rights: particulars of the precise charge he was facing; strict adherence to the rules of evidence, no hearsay; the onus of proof on the prosecution; the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt; and competent legal representation through his union. If found guilty of a criminal act, he would in all probability not receive a conviction; he might be discharged absolutely and he could even carry on in the police force as if nothing happened. Even if there was bodily harm, there have been cases where police officers have been convicted, not dismissed and go on as if nothing happened. This is a real injustice and, in the words of Pat O'Shane, Justice Moss and many others, the system needs to be reformed.

          —I listened previously to the presentation by the member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis), who spoke about the Commonwealth property principles in this city of Canberra. Quite frankly, I was not going to let her get away with that, and I will bring the House up to date with exactly what has happened in the Canberra property market.

        <para first-indent="16">
         When this government came to power in March last year, one of the first things brought to our attention was the absolutely dreadful state of the Commonwealth property portfolio. In actual fact, one of the first bits of advice that came through from departmental officers was that, in trying to bring that property portfolio up to date, we had a real problem. From memory, I think I am right in saying that, if we were to bring it up to date in the city of Canberra, the investment would have to be in the vicinity of $180 million. Why? Because previous governments, the previous Labor government, had completely ignored the state of Commonwealth property, and it was a mess.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Notwithstanding all the bleating by the member for Namadgi about what is happening in this city in terms of the private property market, the first thing this government did was to bring in the private sector to undertake a full review of Commonwealth property—and we took that advice. That advice was that there had to be some very great rationalisation of Commonwealth property around Australia, but particularly in Canberra because no review of Commonwealth property had been done in this city, I believe, since Federation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What we found was a dreadful mess. One of the first things that the government did was to make sure that the Commonwealth Public Service was tied to commercial leases, because there were no leases on any the office space taken up by the Commonwealth Public Service; in other words, they were day&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;day arrangements. If there happens to be vacant office space in this city, one of the reasons for it is the blithering incompetence of the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          administration of the previous Labor government. We put that together, and we did find that there was a great deal of vacant space.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Once again we went back to the private sector to seek its advice on how this property should be disposed of to make sure that we did not affect the Canberra market. That review was undertaken and, yes, there have been some recommendations that some of those properties—some of those dilapidated properties—that were ignored by the previous Labor government may have to be taken out of the market; maybe they will be demolished. But the reality is that the acceptance by the private sector of the government property principles has been absolutely tremendous; and the private sector, through the property council and other organisations in this city, is urging us along all the way.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If the member for Namadgi were to do her homework, she would find that some of that property has already been sold; in fact, the Melbourne building on Northbourne Avenue was one of the first. I think it is fair to say that the price the Commonwealth received for that property from a private family here in Canberra was vastly in excess of what we ever thought we would get for it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is confidence in this city. You will see development of some of these Commonwealth assets. Also, you will see a much greater utilisation of Commonwealth property. No longer is the Commonwealth going to be a property manager. No longer will the Commonwealth be a developer, because we are no good at that; we could not manage a building if we tried. In actual fact, the government has contracted out all management of all Commonwealth buildings around Australia, and the savings are absolutely phenomenal—and, as well, we are not getting too many complaints about the standard of that office management.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Around Australia coming up in this financial year will be the commencement of the sale of 57 Commonwealth properties, major properties, including those in Canberra. The results of those sales—and they will be in the vicinity of $1 billion all up—are going straight to the bottom line to retire debt. The Commonwealth is a great consumer of proper
         <break page="9289" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         No longer will the Commonwealth waste money in building buildings which, quite frankly, were never needed. No longer will we allow our buildings to go to rack and ruin. The Commonwealth is out of that. This government is all about efficiency in Commonwealth administration. The savings in the property portfolio and the investment opportunities in Canberra are absolutely enormous.

          —I am sure they will put up the same fight they did 10 years ago. Honourable members will recall that earlier this year the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Daily Telegraph
          </emphasis>
          published a photograph of year 12 students at Mount Druitt. Mr Speaker, as a result of this issue, I must say that I was at the time very critical of the Minister for Education and Training, John Aquilina, for his failure to consult with the community; you may recall that he had requested Alan Laughlin to prepare a report on the Mount Druitt result. That report has been tabled and circulated. But he has now done a second report, and he has outlined a number of options. He has appointed the Vice Chancellor of the University of Western Sydney, Derek Schroeder, to spearhead the community consultation.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Basically, four options are being canvassed. One is a senior high school with junior high schools; that is, junior high schools finishing at year 10, and a senior high school with years 11 and 12. That clearly is the option that is favoured in the report, and the one that I clearly favour. The second option is having junior high schools but farming out students to existing senior high schools—St Marys and the proposed Narimba senior high schools. Thirdly, there is the closing of one of the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          schools. And, fourthly, there is the consideration of any suggestions put forward by members of the community.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Senior high schools are something that I have been talking about in this parliament for a good 10 years. It is a matter of record that some 10 years ago both Richard Amery and I strongly advocated a senior high school for Mount Druitt. In 1988 the then Liberal government established the St Marys senior high school. That, of course, has proved to be an outstanding success. But St Marys operates without any feeder junior high schools. It operates really as very much a selective high school, although it is not called that. It has something like 800 people competing for 400 places in year 11. We need a senior high school in Mount Druitt because the comprehensive model in Mount Druitt is collapsing; there are just not sufficient students.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I believe that the `super high school', as the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Telegraph
         </emphasis>
         has called it, will be a real boost for Mount Druitt. I want to relate to the House the current retention rates for 1995-97 for years 10 and 12 at the five high schools serving the area. Bidwill High School has a retention rate of 50.4 per cent, Dunheved 30.3 per cent, Mount Druitt 37.6 per cent, Shalvey 38.9 per cent, and Whalan 45.3 per cent. None of the high schools meet the state average of some 66 per cent.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A senior high school like St Marys High School will be able to offer 146 subjects, so you have real choices. It will be able to offer real choices in vocational education. But, most importantly, it will increase the retention rate of students and it will increase their chances of getting a job at the end of their period at high school.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So I strongly commend the state Minister for Education John Aquilina for undertaking this community consultation. I again place on record my strong support for a senior high school in Mount Druitt, a `super high school' as the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Telegraph
         </emphasis>
         calls it. I believe we have exciting opportunities in terms of the vocational education that we can provide. TAFE based courses would be my particular choice. This is what we need to do for the students of Mount Druitt, for their parents and for the community. As the Parliamentary Secretary
         <break page="9290" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

          —What makes me and, I think, a significant number of other Australians despairing about the political process is that it appears that no matter what is put up by one side of politics it is immediately the subject of denigration and manipulation by the other, irrespective of the merits of the policy that is being proposed. Nowhere is that more evident than in the current debate, if you could call it that, in the community about the government's reforms in residential aged care. At the moment in Australia we have 5.3 Australians between the ages of 15 and 64 for every person under the age of 15 or over the age of 64. It is called an age dependency ratio. In 40 years time that ratio will be 2.6 to one.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If you read the National Commission of Audit report last year you will find that over the next 40 years we will need to spend 10 per cent more of our gross domestic product above and beyond real growth on the health and welfare costs of ageing. Halfway through next century a third of Australia will be over the age of 65. In the absence of a cure, something like 8 per cent of us over the age of 75 will suffer from dementia. Approximately at the moment about 5 per cent of us will eventually need residential aged care—and this in a country that is sustaining growth rates of between 3&amp;half; to 4 per cent when we peak.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So as a nation what we as Australians have to accept is that, no matter how noble the proposition may be, our country simply cannot afford to provide residential aged care for all Australians entirely financed by the government irrespective of the means of those people who are going to derive benefit from the care that is provided to them.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Of the three comprehensive inquiries conducted into residential aged care, the most comprehensive was that by Professor Bob Gregory, which was delivered to the previous government in 1994. Gregory documented amongst other things the need to spend $1
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          billion bringing our residential nursing home capital stock up to fire, design, health and outcome standards. Thirteen per cent of nursing homes in Australia do not currently meet fire standards. Approximately 39 per cent of people living in nursing homes live in a room with at least three other people. Many nursing homes are places in which you would not wish your mother, or indeed yourself, to be living.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So what the government has done is something that if Labor had won the federal election it would have done, as it had done for the hostel sector in 1988. Of the 210 words in the Labor Party's aged care policy presented to the
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         electorate for the 1996 election, you will find amongst them a language that is code for introducing into the aged care system what this government has done. And what the government has done is look at a 30-year vision of where aged care needs to be.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In terms of residential accommodation bonds, it is important that people understand: that the bond is something that is negotiated between the proprietor and the prospective resident, his or her family and their lawyer or their accountant or whoever they wish to have involved; that if an accommodation bond is negotiated for $20,000, $40,000, $50,000 or $100,000, that bond cannot be demanded by a proprietor as an up-front payment; that the resident, having negotiated the bond, then has the option of paying that over the course of a year as the $2,600 draw-down and approximately a four per cent interest stream on that accommodation bond. So, for example, if a bond was $100,000 you could opt to pay $6,600, that is a $2,600 draw-down plus a $4,000 interest stream, and pay it as $550 a month. Alternatively, you have the option available to you to have that bond taken out as a debt against your estate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is important that Australians appreciate also that 37.7 per cent of people who go into a nursing home do not, unfortunately, live longer than six months and 50.5 per cent of people will not live longer than one year. It is also important in relation to the income testing that the maximum amount that will be paid by the 9 per cent of nursing home
         <break page="9291" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          residents eligible to pay a fee will be no more than 25c in the dollar above the first $49 a week.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the end, the money that is raised from the accommodation bonds, which will be $1.5 billion over the next 10 years, and the money raised through income testing and fees can only be spent on one thing and one thing only, and that is the care that that person receives in a nursing home and the accommodation and facilities that are provided to them. It cannot be taken as profit and it cannot be siphoned away to be spent on anything else. It is as necessary as it is defensible. It is important that the opposition, who are manipulating elderly people in the community, started to realise that this serves the national interest and not the political opportunism of political parties.

        (1) From 1 October 1997, Residential Care Allowance (RCA—formerly rent assistance) payments to pensioners in nursing homes and hostels will be abolished. They will be replaced by a direct subsidy for providers, called "pensioner supplement". The abolition of RCA is a technical change to the payment process and will not significantly affect disposable incomes for residents or total funding for aged care providers.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (2) Under the new aligned fee structure that will apply to hostels and nursing homes, the basic daily fee for pensioners will be $5.30 a day (in March 1997 prices) lower than for non&amp;hyphen;pensioners, to compensate for the abolition of RCA. They will pay $21.10 a day, while non&amp;hyphen;pensioners will pay $26.40 a day. There are, however, other changes that will happen at the same time and which will also affect hostel fees. These changes include grandparenting of variable fees, the introduction of income tested charges and the alignment of hostel and nursing home basic daily fees. The effect of these changes on individual residents' fees and disposable income will depend on the level of fees they are currently paying.

        (1) There is no separate entity known as the Privacy Commission. While all functions under the Privacy Act reside in the office of Privacy Commissioner, financial and staff resources to support those functions are provided through the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC). HREOC decides each year the amount that is allocated to the privacy program. It has established a separate Privacy Branch, with a separate privacy program budget, but also provides support through a range of shared common services such as personnel, finance, IT and public affairs.

        The amount allocated by HREOC to the Privacy Commissioner covers the direct staffing and administrative expenditure associated with carrying out the Privacy Commissioner's functions under the Privacy Act. The best estimates of the funds used to support the work of the Privacy Commissioner in the four years in question is around $3 million per year, with some $2.2 million of that being allocated to the separate privacy program budget. These figures exclude a share of property operating expenses, but include income from fees and charges.

In making this decision, the Prime Minister made clear that the Government was concerned not to increase compliance costs for Australian businesses, both large and small. Complying with current regulatory requirements already imposes a significant burden on Australian business. The Government is committed to reducing regulatory burden on all business and it is believed that the introduction of a new compulsory regime would be counterproductive in meeting that commitment.

        (1) Australia is an active participant in international efforts to control the production, distribution and consumption of illicit narcotics and has been an active member of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs since 1973. Australia's National Drug Strategy, which advocates a balance between Demand Reduction and Supply Control to combat the illicit drug problem, is regarded by the United Nations International Drug Control Program as a comprehensive model strategy to restrict the supply of illicit drugs and their corresponding use. Australia contributes annually approximately $A720,000 in funding to the United Nations International Drug Control Program which has the mandate to address the production, manufacture, distribution and consumption of illicit narcotics.

        (1) No. The recently announced reductions to HREOC's budget amount in real terms to a cut of approximately 27%. However this reduction must be seen in light of the fourfold increase in HREOC funding over the past nine years.

        (3) Air Force Headquarters have advised that there is no definitive establishment or strength for RAAF squadrons. The establishment for each squadron is dependent upon the squadron's role, the type of aircraft flown, administrative arrangements within the force element group and the maintenance responsibility for the aircraft. For example, No 11 Squadron, which operates P3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft, has an establishment of 103 which consists entirely of aircrew. That number provides up to eight P3C Orion crews, navigators, flight engineers, air electronics officers and airborne electronic analysts. Maintenance for P3C aircraft

         operated by the flying squadrons comprising No 92 Wing is performed by a central maintenance unit at Edinburgh and by contractors in NSW. As a contrast, No 77 Squadron, which operates Hornet fighter aircraft, has an establishment of 157, the majority of whom are technical personnel. The Hornet aircraft requires only one pilot, but its day&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;day maintenance is carried out at the Squadron.

        (5) 6th Brigade and 7th Brigade amalgamated on 1 July 97 to form 7th Task Force (7 TF). The TF has been resourced to a level to allow it to undertake trials in support of Restructuring the Army (RTA). The TF is specifically involved in the integration trial of part&amp;hyphen;time and full&amp;hyphen;time personnel and the 6th Battalion. The Royal Australian Regiment is involved with the development of the motorisation and embedding trials. The TF retains the personnel, equipment and other resources allocated to it as a Ready Reserve Brigade. Under RTA, the ARA component of the TF has increased from 1,163 to 1,446 personnel.

        (6) The TF has an establishment of 4,281 personnel with 4,187 positions actually filled. There are, however, approximately 980 personnel who are not suitable from a rank/trade perspective to fill these positions. It is Army's aim to retrain and/or repost these individuals over the next two years to significantly reduce the rank/trade imbalance.

Although the panel is only now being formed, the intention to do so had been under consideration prior to the release of tenders, as part of agreeing the tender evaluation methodology.

        (1) Supplementary Services (SUPS) workers' role in the Special Needs Subsidy Scheme (SNSS) support is to participate in the preparation and reviews of the inclusion support plan for individual children; to support services receiving SNSS grants with training, resources, referral and specialist advice; and to provide information to parents and the wider community on issues related to child care and the Government's inclusion programs.

        (4) No, employment of SUPS workers is the responsibility of sponsoring bodies. Funding of $160,562 has been allocated to Fairfield City Council for 1998. This should enable the support of SNSS and other SUPS functions in the area.

        (5) The implementation of the Special Needs Subsidy Scheme included national training and communication strategies designed to ensure that SUPS workers, the child care industry, parents of children with high support needs and disability support groups have access to the information that they need to participate effectively in the scheme. This involved extensive media coverage and an advertising campaign in suburban press and women's magazines, industry publications and newsletters. In addition, a 1800&amp;hyphen;number telephone information line has been set up to provide information for parents and industry.

        Under the new aged care funding arrangements, residents are funded according to their care needs irrespective of their location in a low level care facility (hostel) or high level care facility (nursing home).

        Providers who wish to provide a full range of services are required to identify and comply with all relevant State and Territory legislation, regulations, professional standards and guidelines (Quality of Care Principles 1997, Schedule 2).

        My predecessor, the Hon J. Moylan MP, wrote to State and Territory Health and Community Services Ministers on 24 September 1997 concerning the implications of State and Territory health and related regulations for Commonwealth funded facilities. Mrs Moylan sought agreement to a protocol for the regulation of hostels, to operate for a two year period, to enable a review of existing Commonwealth and State health regulations applying to aged care hostels.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        The proposed protocol reflects an approach agreed by Commonwealth and State officials to clarify similar issues in relation to building requirements under the Building Code of Australia. The approach allows for variation in the use of buildings, with a low level care (hostel) building only needing to be licensed as a high level care (nursing home) facility where more than 10% of the floor

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        The Australian Building Codes Board, in conjunction with State building authorities, has also commenced a review of the classification of residential aged care buildings. The objective is to ensure that the Code licensing requirements can accommodate the development of integrated aged care facilities.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        I am confident that the States and Territories will, as they have done to date on other aspects of the reforms, cooperate in arriving at a sensible approach that will give certainty to providers and maximise the potential of the aged care reforms to achieve improvements without compromising the quality of care. Governments, consumers and providers have a shared interest in minimising duplication, in maximising efficiencies and preventing unnecessary costs and barriers to flexibility and choice.
