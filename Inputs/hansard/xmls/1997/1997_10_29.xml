          , I have a question to the government which must be answered; that is, what is the government's intention so far as further amendments to this legislation are concerned other than the amendment to introduce schedule 4, which has already been foreshadowed?

         The Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams) will no doubt be familiar with the press reports this morning that, within the coalition party room—or a subgroup of it—last night, a major revolt was threatened by National Party members demanding that the bill be further amended in a number of ways, otherwise they would cross the floor. It is further reported that the government, in response to those demands and threats, has in fact proposed that there be a further amendment to the threshold test, which is a crucial element in this legislative package, one which is certainly central to our response to it and central to any consideration of both the justice and workability of the legislation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As reported, the government proposal is that an already very tough threshold test will be
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          made much tougher still by a requirement that, as a condition of someone being registered as a claimant, the claimant actually have a current physical connection with the land in question. The notion that any such criterion could be required merely to get a claimant into the condition of being able to pursue that claim, to take advantage of rights, to negotiate and everything else in the legislation, is nothing short of outrageous.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government has already sold its soul on this legislation to those of its own members who have adopted from the outset an absolutely indefensibly rednecked, one&amp;hyphen;sided approach to this legislation by being utterly unwilling to acknowledge the reality that, for this legislation to be successful, effective and decent, it has to be balanced legislation which gets the balance of interests right as between indigenous Australians, miners and farmers—and of course the Australian public, the taxpayers, who are also stakeholders in this measure. That is the object to which we are trying to address ourselves.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The balance of this legislation has already wildly swung in the other direction. It is indefensibly unbalanced and one&amp;hyphen;sided in its present construction and, as such, cannot deliver the certainty and predictability, quite apart from the justice, that is necessary if the interests of these various categories of stakeholders are in fact to be met.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The point, obviously, is that, if you demand a current physical connection with the land, quite apart from anything or anyone else you are immediately excluding from the capacity to benefit from, or to participate in, this legislative framework for a start those indigenous people who were locked out of their land with which they had a long association and with which, in many cases, they have a very credible claim of native title as a result of the pastoral awards in the 1960s. Lock the gate, lose your native title is going to be the principle that is adopted, it seems, by the government if this further amendment is in fact accommodated and advanced.

        <para first-indent="16">
         There are many issues to be further debated today in the limited time we have available, but I must ask the government to respond, as a threshold matter, as to the accuracy of these

          reports and to state its intentions so far as a further amendment of the kind that I have been describing, of the kind that was reported in this morning's press, is concerned. Until we have a clear understanding of where the government is going in this respect, it is impossible to approach this already complex and difficult task with any sense of understanding about how the government is proposing to secure the necessary public interest balances that are involved. I ask the Attorney for an answer straight away.

When these matters were raised in the party room, they were returned to the backbench committee which I happen to chair—and I would like to underline that it is a `backbench committee'.

          government offer had been made in a committee of that nature, I do not know. Lengthy discussions took place, one of which focused on the addition of a word to that threshold test. I suggested that, if that matter was the only matter left outstanding, as chairman of the committee and with the approval of the committee, I could take it to the government. I did not have the approval of the committee, because even those concerned were not sure where it was. That matter was then apparently reported to the media by persons unknown and, when the media contacted me, I rejected it, and I think Margot Kingston's later article confirms that. Furthermore, I then advised those people that I was not prepared to take any further action whatsoever in the circumstances. All I would have been doing was being a conduit.

They allow everybody a say and do not try to put them down as rednecks or anything else when they are trying to represent the legitimate interests of their particular constituencies. It is always the case in these matters that you know where you stand. If you wanted to stand with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, you would be amongst a group of people who have no understanding even of the legislation. When they write to me and I write back and say, `Thank you, I'm very interested in your concerns; please tell me which part of the amendments actually achieves what you tell me,' they fail to respond. And do you know why? Because they cannot find it. It is interesting that the opening remarks from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition today were of a very general nature. I hope the rest of this debate features the actual parts of the legislation that prove it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let me put another issue to bed. In his opening remarks, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition talked about the Australian taxpayers as stakeholders. I know what that is leading to. We are going to start this argument that we as members of parliament should legislate to prevent Aboriginal people getting compensation. Of course some of their rights have been resumed by the previous act
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          brought in by the Labor Party—by the validation process. Of course their rights in the future—as have been the rights of freehold owners, farmers, lessees and all sorts of other people—will be diminished by resumption. The national interest demands it. But why should this parliament be writing rules—as you suggest, and as some of the other supporters apparently of native title suggest—that deny proper processes of compensation if that occurs? It is appropriate that the Australian taxpayer should be involved in paying that money, considering that all of this arises from past acts of government.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So opposition members should just keep going on that one—just keep telling the Aboriginal people that you think we should have devices so they do not get compensation, which many of them would prefer to a piece of land somewhere they no longer wish to reside. It might be valuable as a mine, but it is not a very nice place to live. Those people should be entitled to better living standards and the types of facilities they have drifted to over the years, where there are decent supermarkets and decent civic facilities. Your idea of inalienable, freehold property is to stick them out under a few mulga trees and leave them in those sorts of conditions, because that is what you achieve with those sorts of arrangements.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is another thing about this threshold test—that is, the process to the right to negotiate—that we need to get straight, too. As you had to admit in the parliament the other day, that is not a common law right; that is a law right that you created. It has been abused by a lot of people who have not even got genuine rights, and they are preventing those who do have genuine rights from getting their rights considered because of the log jam that has been created.

         I make some opening observations about how we intend to handle this consideration in detail stage and subsequent stages of this legislative debate for the sake of clarification. The time before us for consideration in detail in this House is quite limited. It will not be possible, under those circumstances, for us to move detailed amendments across the whole sweep that are necessary to begin the task of improving the  Native Title Amendment Bill . In any event, consultations on our side are proceeding as to the very complex matters of detail that are involved. It is appropriate that consideration in that degree of detail, with the moving of specific amendments, take place in the Senate rather than here.

In some cases, we will have particular proposals to make clear to the House. In others, it will simply be a matter of stating a broad attitude and leaving that further consideration and discussion to the Senate. With respect to the minority report of the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund, which was brought down a couple of days ago, we regard that as a very fertile source of analysis and argumentation on the matters now before this parliament. We will, of course, be drawing on it a great deal in describing the nature of the concerns that we and so many other Australians have about this legislation.

         While we see this report as setting the framework and direction of the opposition's response—one that we hope will be shared by the minority parties and Independents in the Senate—it is appropriate at the outset of this debate for me to make it clear that the recommendations contained in the minority report do not necessarily represent the considered final view of the Australian Labor Party opposition. The nature of the process involved in the preparation of parliamentary committee reports with questions of confidentiality, privilege, and so on, is such as to make it inappropriate for these matters to be dealt with in that degree of detail and finality. We are still considering our recommendations and our position on a number of these matters.

         I conclude by saying that, at the end of the consideration in detail, apart from dividing on the amendment concerning the Racial Discrimination Act, we propose to divide on the third reading and, given that the bill will obviously be unamended in the way that we would hope, we will be opposing that, as we did the second reading. That is not to be understood as representing any dog in the manger attitude by the opposition to the effect that the Native Title Act does not need amendment. Of course it does, in a number of respects, and we will be working flat out in the Senate to achieve just that. We propose in the Senate to support the second reading of
         <break page="10015" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          the legislation in order to enable the committee process to proceed. Equally, I foreshadow that, if at the end of that committee stage in the Senate a satisfactory outcome has not been achieved, we will be voting against the legislation.

         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We remember that a number of opposition speeches in the second reading debate indicated that there was `no need to amend the Native Title Act because the Wik decision guarantees that the pastoralists' rights will prevail'. Although the common law says that the rights of pastoralists' prevail, the effect of the current Native Title Act provisions may be to produce the opposite result. That was almost conceded by the opposition spokesman at the table.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Whatever the belief at the end of 1993 about the effect at common law of the grant of a pastoral lease or any other lease or government grant on native title, the fact is that the current Native Title Act provides only limited means by which future dealings affecting native title can proceed. That is to the detriment of all Australians, indigenous and otherwise. The only way in which many such acts can be done with any legal certainty under the Native Title Act is for native title to be acquired, resulting in extinguishment. The government says quite plainly and unambiguously that this is undesirable. That is why the Native Title Amendment Bill  is a very worthy piece of legislation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is very important, during this consideration in detail stage, to consider acts affecting native title. The Native Title Act will apply if the dealing is one that `affects native title'. The definition of an act affecting native title in section 227 of the act covers not only acts which at common law may have extinguished native title—for example, a freehold grant—
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          but also dealings which are `wholly or partly inconsistent with the continued existence, enjoyment or exercise of native title rights'.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is impossible to know for certain if an act affects native title until there has been a judicial assessment of both the native title status of the land on which it is proposed to do that act and the impact of the act on any native title rights and interests found to exist. So long as there is a possibility that native title may exist and may be affected by the act, the only way in which those dealings can be done which guarantees their legal validity is to comply with the Native Title Act.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is also the question of the validity of future acts. The dealing has to be one which is `permissible under the Native Title Act' or can otherwise be done validly under the act. These acts are the following kinds only, and I will refer to them briefly: acts which could be done if any native title holders instead held freehold title to the land in question, for example, the grant of a mining lease by the Crown or acquisition by the Crown—that is, it satisfies the freehold test; renewals of certain commercial, agricultural, pastoral or residential leases and renewals and the exercise of a legally enforceable right in existence before 1 January 1994; acts occurring offshore; acts which are within the definition of low impact future act, but only for so long as there is no determination of native title in relation to the land; acts authorised by an agreement of the kind referred to in section 21 of the Native Title Act; and acts done after the relevant government or lessee goes through the `non&amp;hyphen;claimant provisions'.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Any other act which affects native title is impermissible—that is, it is unlawful under the Native Title Act. In the words of Justice French to the joint committee, this limited range of permissible dealings reflects the fact that:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . was that native title would be found perhaps to exist in some fairly limited and fairly remote part of Australia. It would not be interacting with other ranges of interest in the way that is being asserted today.

          proposed by the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham). We believe that the opposition is being absolutely hypocritical in this matter. It should be noted that the existing section 7 of the Native Title Act deals with the relationship between the Racial Discrimination Act and the Native Title Act. Subsection 7(1) already makes it clear that nothing in the Native Title Act affects the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act. It should be noted that this provision was sufficient in 1993 for the now opposition, the Democrats and the Greens, and in our view it continues to be an appropriate provision.

         To be valid, an act by a state or territory government must comply with the requirements of the Racial Discrimination Act and the Native Title Act. However, where there is an inconsistency between the two acts the normal rules of interpretation would apply, and the later legislation—in this case the Native Title Act—would prevail. The proposal made by the opposition would require all of the proposed amendments to comply with the Racial Discrimination Act, notwithstanding the fact that they would be authorised in the parliament by the Native Title Act.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Racial Discrimination Act provides very broad principles. The Native Title Act provides specific detailed requirements which were designed to respond to the High Court's Mabo decision. Such an amendment would mean that, even if an action is specifically allowed by the Native Title Act, it may be

         What the opposition is suggesting is a recipe for absolute, complete and utter stagnation. It would be a lawyer's picnic, and the outcome would be endless litigation—not about whether native title exists, because the Prime Minister and the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams) have made it clear time and time again that we accept the Wik decision, but whether any act done by government, or indeed anyone, including representative bodies and claimants, was in fact authorised by both pieces of law. The resulting uncertainty would undermine the workability of the act—and everyone agrees, including the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) that the act is unworkable—and in fact would make it almost completely inoperable.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The basic rationale for the Native Title Act was to set out clearly and with certainty what future acts the government could take and by what process, and the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Banks would discard that clarity and that certainty. It seems to me that the opposition is absolutely determined to do whatever it possibly can to make sure that this is simply not workable.

There are people in this House, such as the member for Aston (Mr Nugent) and many on the Labor side, who are going around creating the idea that native title is akin to property rights. There is absolutely no substance to that at all. It may be that native title is no more than the right to hunt and gather, for which compensation is negligible. In Mabo 1, the judges determined 4:3 that native title probably would not occur in Australia because of the need to show continuous occupation. I would suspect it will be the case that, if we stick to law, there is very little valid native title.

I do not think this House has ever seen such a garrulous, sanctimonious heap of absolute fraud as has been foisted upon this place by the member for Holt.

          —I also rise, like the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), to respond to the amendment proposed by the member for Banks (Mr Melham). The government has said on a number of occasions that it has sought to comply with the Racial Discrimination Act and its international obligations, in particular, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, known as CERD. The government has also sought to implement its considered policies in the

Notwithstanding that, the government recognises that a number of submissions made to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund have criticised the bill for allegedly failing to comply with the RDA and CERD. But it is important, I think, to highlight that precisely the same criticisms can be made of the current act. The bill does include a validation regime, but the current act has a more extensive validation regime. We can go back and look at what happened in 1993 when the current opposition was in government.

         What the bill does do is maintain and strengthen the provisions of the bill in relation to a number of things, including compulsory acquisition of title. There is a strengthened non&amp;hyphen;discriminatory regime. It gives native title holders the same protections as freeholders and some additional protections. It does not prevent the compulsory acquisition of native title which coexists on pastoral lease land, just as it does not prevent the compulsory acquisition of native title on vacant crown land.

          —The problem with the 1993 Native Title Act is that, while it was very well intentioned, it is deeply flawed. One of the problems, which has already been alluded to, is in the area of the right to negotiate. Western Australia in particular has used the future act provisions of the NTA more than other states and that experience shows the right to negotiate is just not working effectively. For example, of the 1,910 acts which have been subject to the full right to negotiate process, only 148 were cleared for grant as at 10 October 1997. This is a clearance rate of only 7.7 per cent. Information from the National Native Title Tribunal indicates that, of the 181 tenements advised by ATSIC as subject to agreements, only 148 have proceeded to grant. That is a tragedy both for Aboriginal people and for those who have vested interests in the areas that are under claim.

        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Western Australia has advised that most of the mineral tenements which have attracted the right to negotiate are mining leases, with an overall clearance rate for section 29 notices of only some 18 per cent. This is only exploration prospecting tenures where there is a high clearance rate. In fact, the trend clearance rate for mining leases has been declining since WA began using the NTA procedures.

         We argue that the exemption from the RTN of compulsory acquisitions for infrastructure is appropriate. Such infrastructure has generally in the past been provided by governments, and acquisitions for government purposes have never been subject to the RTN; a non-

        <para first-indent="16">
         It has been suggested that the amendment that the right to negotiate not apply to land or waters within a town or city should not be included. But government policy is that the right to negotiate should not be able to delay the provisions of necessary government services, particularly in towns and cities where it is unlikely that high-level native title has survived; that a non-discriminatory compulsory acquisition regime is still required; and that this is not an open-ended provision as it applies only to land or waters within town or city boundaries as at 23 December 1996.

         The minority report of the recent Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Land Fund inquiry into the  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997  was concerned about the right to negotiate offshore and the shore line boundaries. The NIWG has proposed that the exemption from the right to negotiate of offshore areas be removed. But we have to remember that the current Native Title Act does not provide for the RTN to apply offshore.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The boundary for acts to which the right to negotiate applies has been shifted from `the limits of the state', because this is notoriously difficult to identify. The mean high&amp;hyphen;water mark proposed provides a more definable point at which the right to negotiate applies. Indigenous groups who see the intertidal zone as important are still protected by the fact that acts in that area must satisfy the future act provisions and, in the case of mining, they must satisfy the `freehold test'. A non-discriminatory compulsory acquisition regime is still required. There is absolutely no case to answer in terms of these amendments diluting or eroding Aboriginal rights.

         In recent months, the percentage of unopposed expedited procedure proposals has been falling in approved exploration acts. This is probably as the result of the broad interpretation given to section 237 criteria—which lists the limitations of the effect that an act under

          the expedited procedure may have—by the Federal Court in Ward and, consequently, the effectiveness of expedited procedure provisions has been reduced.

Amendments will modify the criteria in section 237 to require a predictive assessment of the likely physical aspects of the activities.

         The bill includes an amendment which will allow a government party, as soon as an objection is lodged, to `withdraw' the expedited procedure notice and switch immediately to the normal right to negotiate process for the proposed act. The change would reduce the costs and delays of an objection hearing in relation to the expedited procedure if the government felt that the objection would be likely to be upheld.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The expedited procedure has produced high clearance rates for exploration in Western Australia solely because the native title parties have chosen not to use the objections procedure in most cases. Section 26A provides arguably better protection for indigenous concerns than the expedited procedure as a result of the inclusions of new conditions. The criteria for approval under section 26A ensures contact between miners and indigenous peoples and that site protection and access issues are addressed for all exploration grants covered by the determination.

If the High Court says that was the law, then that was the law. But the governments of Australia never said that. The governments of Australia said, `You own this land.' I must make that point to this House. Across half of the surface area of Queensland, 1,500 pastoral lessees all had the right to transfer that land over to freehold title.

You have to ask yourself: why did nobody in Queensland freehold their land? Why is half the surface area of Queensland still pastoral leases? When anyone, at any time at all and for a negligible figure—we were attacked continuously by the ALP in the state house for having a negligible figure upon it, so it is a matter of public record that it was a negligible figure—could convert their pastoral lease to a freehold title, why didn't they do that? The only conceivable answer was that there was no reason to do it because you already had complete ownership of that land.

           Native Title Amendment Bill 1997

          in fact respects the Racial Discrimination Act provisions, and that is clear. It also recognises and protects native title in Australia as enunciated in the Mabo and Wik decisions. You will recall that Wik held that native title was not necessarily wholly extinguished by the grant of a pastoral lease. This bill recognises and protects native title rights as enunciated by those judges, although the decision did take everyone by surprise, including the member for Banks (Mr Melham) if he was honest today.

         The conclusion in the Wik decision is in fact confirmed by this bill which allows native title to continue to exist in certain circumstances. To allay any doubts that are being created by the opposition, it provides statutory access rights for certain registered native title claimants to pastoral land and also recognises the statements made by Kirby in the Wik decision that there may be some level of extinguishment of native title rights by the grant of a pastoral lease. Kirby said:

        <para style="Para">
         The bill has very carefully preserved that very test. Sections 23G and 23I enable the states and territories to confirm that pastoral leases have extinguished native title to the extent that grants of rights and interests are inconsistent with native title rights and interests. The bill leaves it to the courts to assess this level of consistency. The only actual inconsistency identified by the bill is that between any exclusive possession rights of the native title holders with the rights of pastoral leases.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Subdivision G of the bill implements the test that is enunciated by the courts by providing a range of primary production and other activities which can be carried out in relation to pastoral leases so that not only native title holders are given protection but also pastoralists are given clarity as to their rights. That is so they are not subject to imponderances and the uncertainties which are created by the present Native Title Act followed by the Wik judgment leaving certain issues not yet determined.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Permanent extinguishment of native title is under section 237A of the act—that is, the Keating act. The common law title is extinguished by an unqualified grant of an inconsistent estate in land by the Crown or other inconsistent dealings with the land by the Crown. That was stated in the Mabo judgment, I think by Chief Justice Brennan. It is not known yet, according to the High Court judgments, whether at common law native title can revive once it has been extinguished.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Wik judges did not come to any conclusion on that point. Brennan, Dawson and McHugh agreed in that judgment with him and concluded that the Wik pastoral lease had extinguished native title and therefore did need to consider whether native title can revive. Brennan, Dawson and McHugh in the Wik case, although in the minority, were the only judges that were clear on the issue that I have just referred to, and their view is a considered opinion which I think has weight and which the bill has taken into account.

         The government could not leave this issue unresolved. It would be irresponsible for it to do that, and it would add to the considerable uncertainty that is already surrounding native title and land management in Australia. We

          cannot go on with that. Some of the practical and conceptual difficulties that would result from a revival of native title for the lessees of the Wik pastoral leases were identified by Brennan in his decision.

         It would be highly unsatisfactory for all Australians if these kinds of issues were left to be resolved by the courts in relation to every kind of tenure in Australia on a case by case basis. In order to restore certainty to land management, the government has decided, as the bill clearly states, as a matter of good policy in Australia to settle in the bill that the extinguishment of native title is permanent.

         One of the amendments removes the operation of alternative state and territory provisions that depend on ministerial determinations to be disallowable instruments. Another seeks to allow states and territories to upgrade leases in groups or singularly with costs and betterment. There has been a great argument about land grabs. In Queensland there is always a charge for betterment and for the costs associated with an upgrade of a lease. Another amendment ends common law native title claims with a six&amp;hyphen;year sunset provision. This is constitutionally sound from the legal advice that we have been given. It does not, of course, prevent claims under the Native Title Act.

         Having secured private property rights for pastoralists, it is most important that we be even handed and secure private property rights for Aboriginals and Aboriginal groups as well. Two of the other amendments of this group address this very important aspect. One asks that states and territories which have laws that enable the issue of freehold for native title holders for any successful claims over vacant crown land be able to do so. In Queensland there are extensive areas of vacant crown land, some of it quite valuable land. When we said this to the Central Queensland Aboriginal Land Council they were very pleased because their claim was over vacant crown land. Further to that, there are deeds of grant in trust in Queensland and also extensive Aboriginal reserves covering some seven million acres. Under these amendments, that land would become effectively freeholded finally in the hands of shire councils.

          We are looking at a very even handed set of amendments that do not bind Aboriginals and pastoralists together forever in a dual ownership situation but one that looks on the rights of each group and addresses the need for both groups to have private property rights. I congratulate the National Farmers Federation. The majority of the early amendments are theirs. They put them on the table to the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund some weeks ago. They prepared amendments. Unfortunately, those amendments were not picked up by the government. We have chosen to move them with National Party amendments today.

          I wish to commend the amendments that have been moved to the House. I believe that they are a fair representation of the needs of both groups—pastoralists and Aboriginals, not the Aboriginal land councils which virtually enslave many of the Aborigines in reserves but Aboriginals themselves. I believe that if these were enacted we would see a much fairer regime. We would see private property rights for pastoralists and private property rights for Aboriginals, land that they would not only have a native title claim over but that they could trade, borrow against, develop, mortgage and bequeath to their children. It would be land that would be rightly theirs as private property.

If that is her concept of an even&amp;hyphen;handed approach to this legislation, that is just a grotesque and misapplication of the English language. What this package of amendments do is go far beyond what is already an absolutely unacceptable balance struck in this legislation to make it absolutely impossible for the concept of native title to have any continuing meaning at all.

         I go very quickly through the amendments that are still left on the table after you cut a swathe through them, Mr Deputy Speaker, for procedural reasons and briefly comment upon them. The first amendment relating to deeds of grant in trust would require those grants to be deemed to be vested in relevant community councils rather than the native title holders themselves. That is a deliberately divisive enterprise being embarked upon here by the member for Dawson, I am sure with the complete knowledge of what she is doing in this respect. It does not make any sense at all in terms of the basic concept of native title recognition and protection.

         The changes in division 1A in amendment 11 frankly amount to simply a wholesale further extinguishment of native title and the right to negotiate associated with it. What is involved here is provision for basically wholesale title upgrades, the effect of which would be to confer rights of exclusive possession by statutory fiat thus involving absolute extinguishment. There is a further gloss on this in the original version of the amendments

         The amendments from 16 onwards seem to involve an attempt to remove altogether the Commonwealth's supervisory role in relation to the arbitral and determination process, with the states left to determine for themselves whether their own institutional machinery and schemes in relation to the right to negotiate and so on do in fact conform to the legislation without any provision for supervision by the Commonwealth. Again, in a matter of absolute national importance of the kind that this is, that is a manifestly unacceptable abrogation of responsibility by the Commonwealth. We would not have a bar of it, and I cannot imagine that the present government would either.

         Amendment 31 relates to the sunset clause and not only involves the application of a sunset clause in relation to claims made under the Native Title Act but appears to apply across the board, or purports to apply across the board, so as to extend to common law claims as well. The immediate impact of that would be to expose the Commonwealth to massive constitutional liability for the demise of the property rights thus involved in an across&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;board removal of the chance to pursue those common law claims, quite apart from the statutory claims.

         The provision in amendment No. 33 for freehold title, or so&amp;hyphen;called ordinary title, to be vested rather than native title on vacant crown land, which the member for Dawson claims is a nice little bit of trading off, cuts a swath through the whole concept of native title as articulated in Mabo and as accepted by second governments. In the guise of offering a new opportunity to grant freehold title, it picks up the concept of native title being something unworthy to be recognised in Australian property law. The government has extinguished just about every other possible manifestation of it.

          It is a nice gesture to offer it in those terms, but it is a gesture that is loaded with significance, is pregnant with significance, in terms of the government's basic attitude to the whole Mabo concept. Then, of course, you have the application of a new test to be applied to any claims, and we will have to revisit that issue.

I say at the outset that my understanding is that she asserted that the amendments were National Party amendments. That was not my understanding. That understanding has been confirmed by the National Party Whip. They are amendments moved by the member for Dawson; they are not amendments moved in the name of the National Party.

         Can I briefly comment on them, having already foreshadowed that the amendments will not be supported by the government. A group of amendments relate to sections 43 and 43A. These are designed by the member for Dawson to address the concern that ministerial determinations under sections 43 and 43A may be disallowed in the Senate. The proposal seems to be that they not be disallowable instruments. Relevant provisions in the current act are disallowable.

         The  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997  conforms with accepted legal policy that changes to general laws, as distinct from decisions applying general laws, should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. A determination of section 43A will change the law in the state. It will replace the Native Title Act process with a state based process, and such a change should be subject to some level of parliamentary scrutiny.

         I am advised that amendment 17 appears to be a mistake. This removes from disallowance determinations to make additional future acts subject to the right to negotiate. The amendments in this group would leave great uncertainty as to whether alternative regimes were in place since there would be no ministerial determination as a trigger.

         Another group of amendments relate to the claims test, the registration test and the sub

The amendments require claimants in the Federal Court to provide evidence that members have had a traditional physical connection and currently have a traditional physical connection.

         The bill provides that, for registration purposes, a member of the claim group needs to have, or previously had, a traditional physical connection to the land covered by the application. To require a demonstration of current connection would exclude groups who have been removed from their traditional lands or who have been unlawfully or improperly locked out. It would work an extinguishment of these people's rights.

         Amendment No. 31 relates to the sunset clause. The proposal in the member for Dawson's amendment is to include a new provision, section 13A, the effect of which would be to prevent any person claiming native title rights or relying on the assertion of native title rights in any proceedings more than six years after the commencement of the amendments unless as a result of an approved determination or the person has a claim under consideration which was made within the six years. This would operate as a sunset clause on common law claims and, as such, would run the risk of extinguishment of native title and subsequent massive compensation liability.

         I will deal with three other amendments together—amendments 3, 5 and 11. Amendments 3 and 11 would allow the wholesale upgrade of pastoral leases to freehold or exclusive tenures and thereby the extinguishment of native title. The provisions would allow for the wholesale extinguishment over the 40 per cent of Australia which is pastoral lease land. The government's position is that, in the future, pastoral leases subject to native title should only be able to be upgraded with the agreement of the native title holders or by a rigorously non-discriminatory compulsory acquisition regime.

          —If I can just very briefly conclude my previous remarks by saying that, possibly for the first and last time in this debate, I am in wholehearted agreement with what the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) has just said in his response to these amendments. Just for the sake of completeness, can I say that the opposition also absolutely rejects the proposed changes in amendment 34 and, subsequently, the test to be applied both for the registration and the pursuit of claims. For claims only to be pursuable by those groups, a majority of whom have had a traditional physical association not only in the past but currently, is manifestly to work a huge injustice to a very significant number of native title claimants around this country, many of whom have simply been unable—not for want of trying or willingness—to pursue that particular association. We were discussing this issue earlier and there is no need to repeat anything I said. This is just an even more extreme manifestation of that position in these amendments.

         The final thing that needs to be referred to is the change accomplished by amendments 40 and 41, which would include in schedule 4 accomplishing complete and permanent extinguishment as a result of the effect of past acts. What about pastoral leases? The effect of these last two National Party amendments would be to treat pastoral leases—which the government has excluded from the scope of the provisions for which there is automatic extinguishment applicable and for which there is reference made in these schedule provisions of the act—as now having produced an extinguishment of native title where there is any inconsistency involved with the native title claim.

          That is absolutely against the result of the Wik decision, where the High Court held that, as a matter of law, pastoral leases are subject to native title and they can coexist on that lease. There is no question of treating it as an exclusive possession situation. Just to respond to the particular reference that was made to my remarks—

          —I take this opportunity to move the debate a step forward, I hope, by addressing the first of the package of amendments that go to the government's 10&amp;hyphen;point plan. The first such item I refer to is the provisions to validate certain intermediate period acts. What is involved in this part of the legislation—
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           division 2A—is to take up all those acts which occurred after the commencement of the Native Title Act on 1 January 1994 before the date that the Wik decision was handed down, on 23 December 1996, where those acts might have been invalid because they impact adversely on native title and to declare them all, with the stroke of the legislative pen, utterly and completely validated.
          </break>
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The validation of intermediate period acts in this way is the first of a number of examples of the scheme of the bill where deliberate or reckless flouting of the law by governments is cured by legislative action, where miners and others have had their invalid titles validated—or will have if this legislation goes through in this form—where Aboriginal people lose the native title that they would have been able to enjoy without this legislation being passed and where the taxpayer foots the bill for the financial consequences of it. That is obviously a pretty unhappy and unsatisfactory state of affairs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What makes the way this particular part of this legislation is constructed all worse is that the effect of validation is not only to extinguish native title permanently in the case of grants of freehold and other such legal interests where the High Court has left us in no doubt that the grant of such an interest does have that effect of permanent extinguishment; what this legislation purports to do now is to go further than that and, where grants of non-exclusive possession are involved—grants of interests which would not in themselves necessarily permanently extinguish native title rights—nonetheless have that permanent extinguishment now achieved.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am referring in particular to the validation of these intermediate past acts in relation to native title impairing acts taking place on pastoral leases where native title, if those acts are to be validated, would normally, to the extent of that inconsistency, not be permanently extinguished but simply suppressed or put in abeyance until such time as the overriding title constraint was removed. What we have here is something that goes further than that and actually permanently and completely removes the possibility of that native title right ever in effect bouncing back into life
         <break page="10036" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          and being legitimately exercised in the event that the overriding constraint disappears.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What the validation is all about is to really mop up after a number of state governments in fact behaved very badly when it came to issuing interests or permits, or whatever, over leasehold areas. They did so, claiming that they assumed that native title had in fact been extinguished. They, ignoring that all of us in 1993 who expressed a belief—and I was one of them—that probably that would be the case when the High Court addressed this matter, nonetheless left open certainly the possibility that the High Court would otherwise decide. The High Court did otherwise decide in the Wik case. It did decide that it was possible for native title to coexist on pastoral leases. As a result, a problem arose for all those states who had gone down the track of acting on the assumption that native title had in fact been extinguished, granting interests willy&amp;hyphen;nilly, and risking invalidity of those acts if the High Court held otherwise.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The assertion in the explanatory memorandum to the bill that governments believed that they were free to do various acts over pastoral lease land simply does not hold up. The truth of the matter is that a number of governments, particularly the Queensland government, chose to believe that that was the case. The Western Australian government, I acknowledge, was much more cautious in this respect and, as a result, there are less problems of this kind.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The problem arises as to what to do about all of this. Justice would demand that history be unwound; certainty would demand, on the other hand, that a line be ruled under all this and that we move on. The minority report in the joint committee adopts a rather robust approach to unwinding and tracking back over this.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is an issue which the opposition wants to have another more careful look at. It may be that a more workable approach would be to come at this from the other end and try to identify those situations where a manifest injustice was worked and to try to correct those individual injustices rather than to cut

        <para first-indent="16">
         I start from the proposition that the Australian Public Service is a great institution. It is a vital part of our system of democratic government. It plays a crucial role in providing advice to government on the development of its policies. It lies at the heart of accountability for the way in which the decisions of government are implemented. But, like many of our national institutions in the private sector and in the public sector, the Public Service itself is showing signs of age. This is no reflection at all on the calibre or the commitment of individual public servants.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The reality is that too often the creativity and innovation of those who work within the service are being undermined by inflexible work systems and process driven procedures. The Public Service Act, enacted in 1922 and amended more than 100 times since, is a key reason for that. It looks to a bygone age rather than forward to the next century. The act—together with the regulations, awards and agreements—preserves a rule-bound culture that emphasises control of inputs rather than effectiveness of outcomes and process over client service.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The previous government recognised that truth. Our government intends to address it.
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          If we do not, then taxpayers will pay the costs through inefficient and expensive work practices, and the public will have less access to the services they need when they need them. Equally important, the Australian Public Service will provide a less rewarding environment for those who work within it.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I acknowledge that, over the last decade, the APS has already undergone considerable change. Under the previous government, the Australian Public Service was significantly restructured and reduced in size: its machinery of government was restructured, program budgeting was introduced, many of the operations were commercialised and put on a user pays basis, the tenure of secretaries was made fixed term, the Public Service Board was abolished and the ties of central control were loosened. Yet considerably more needs to be done to enable the Australian Public Service to become flexible and adaptable to the needs of government in the 21st century.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We need to provide the foundation for a high performance public service while reaffirming its sense of public purpose. Reform of public administration is a key part of our micro-economic reform agenda. Until recently, the Australian Public Service had a monopoly in the provision of government services. If effectively enjoyed a protective barrier from more efficient competitors. Now, as the provision of public services becomes contestable, the pressures for structural adjustment in public administration are just as great as they are in other industries such as the manufacturing industry.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are some fundamental distinctions between the public and the private sectors. The private sector is responsive and accountable to the market. It delivers goods and services to customers. The public sector is, within the framework of ministerial responsibility, accountable to the public. It must ensure that, when citizens receive services through the marketplace, the standards of conduct of public servants remain accountable.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Public Service must ensure that citizens continue to receive certain fundamental services, often entitlements for which the government of the day remains accountable,

          no matter how those services are delivered. But recognition of this essential truth should not blind us to the fact that the manner in which the Australian Public Service workplaces are organised and people are managed is subject to the same economic, social and technological pressures that face other Australian institutions and Australian businesses.

         Maintaining and revitalising a career public service is a key part of our government's strategy to improve Australia's governance and to prepare it for the future. That in particular is why the government has sought to give a priority to the process of public service reform as an integral element of its broader reform agenda. Our commitment to reform is reflected in the passage of new financial management legislation, the introduction of government service charters and the promotion of more flexible employment arrangements under the Workplace Relations Act.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The modernisation of the principal legislation regulating the Australian Public Service, the Public Service Act 1922, is a vital element of this public service reform agenda. On 26 June 1997, my predecessor—the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith)—introduced into parliament the  Public Service Bill 1997  to replace the current legislative framework for the establishment and management of the Australian Public Service.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill proposes a modern act embodying a new approach to protecting the public interest of citizens while providing a far more flexible framework for the management of employees. It seeks to replace an act which is generally accepted to be outdated, excessively complex, overly prescriptive and unnecessarily centralist in its perspective. The new bill will provide a legislative basis for APS employment which will allow the APS to provide better policy advice to the government and higher quality, more accessible services to the community. It will encourage the APS to seek maximum value for public funds rather than minimise risk.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill emphasises the distinctive ethos of Australia's public administration and parliament's expectations of the Public Service. The
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          bill will maintain the service's integrity and professionalism by setting statutory values and a code of conduct that must be upheld by all public servants. This will strengthen the traditional ethos of the Public Service and remedy the manifest shortcomings of the current legislation. The 1997 bill establishes a framework for an apolitical and non&amp;hyphen;partisan Public Service. In contrast, the 1922 act is silent on such fundamental matters.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The new bill provides a fair balance between enhanced
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          accountability and devolved management responsibility. It establishes that employment powers within APS agencies rest with their chief executives and vests in them greater authority to meet the distinctive needs of their own organisations. This will provide secretaries and agency heads with the flexibility needed to provide more rewarding jobs for their staff and to develop employment arrangements tailored to the expectations of the clients they serve.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         At the same time, the bill ensures that the powers vested in agency heads are exercised appropriately. The bill provides for enhanced parliamentary scrutiny and greater public accountability. It requires agency heads to uphold and promote the values of the Australian Public Service. Together with the subordinate legislation, it provides the Public Service Commissioner with far greater powers of review, investigation and report than are provided by the current act.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The  Public Service Bill 1997  has undergone extensive scrutiny by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. I am pleased that the committee supported the need for the present act to be replaced and favoured the simplification, modernisation and more accessible format of the new bill. The report of that committee—a most thorough and professional report—made a number of unanimous recommendations.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I put on record my gratitude to the committee and its members from both sides of politics. I applaud both its bipartisan spirit and the care that went into its assessment. The government proposes to adopt, in whole or in part, the 20 recommendations made. The government has also given close consideration to the substantive comments contained in the report but which were not expressed formally
         <break page="10040" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          as recommendations and, in one crucial matter, intends to accept the committee's views.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let me now indicate how the bill will be amended to meet the suggestions of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The government has been persuaded that the APS values can be further strengthened. In particular, the bill will now recognise explicitly the need for secretaries to provide frank and honest advice to government and will place accountability in the context of ministerial responsibility. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts also asked that clauses 13 and 15 of the bill, which relate to the APS code of conduct, be further considered. Changes will be made to the bill as a result.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Much of the evidence given before the Joint Committee of Public Accounts related to the status of secretaries. This is somewhat perplexing since, as the committee noted, the tenure of secretaries will not be changed by the new act. The Public Service Act was amended during the opposition's term of office to allow a secretary's appointment to be terminated. It was during those years, too, that the policy was introduced that all future appointments of secretaries would be fixed term.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Joint Committee of Public Accounts supported the continuation of the current arrangements. I agree with this conclusion. I must say that I have found no evidence that secretaries are less frank and fearless in their advice today than they were in the 1970s. Robustness of advice is a matter of character, not tenure.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The  Public Service Bill 1997  proposes that the Prime Minister set the remuneration of secretaries and that agency ministers set the remuneration of the heads of executive agencies, usually after seeking the advice of the Remuneration Tribunal. On the recommendation of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the remuneration set for agency heads will be made public in the annual financial statements of Commonwealth agencies. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts also proposed—and the government agrees—that secretaries and heads of executive agencies must prepare annual reports in accordance
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          with the general requirements of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill retains the concept of the Senior Executive Service and includes for the first time a clear statement of the service&amp;hyphen;wide role of the SES. While agency heads will have enhanced responsibilities in relation to the SES, the Public Service Commissioner will be required to issue directions about employment matters relating to SES employees, including certifying that a termination is in the best interest of the service. This will address JCPA concerns that a Senior Executive Service employee should be free from any apprehension that they may be dismissed for providing robust advice to their agency head. I emphasise that the directions, like the regulations, are legislative instruments which parliament can disallow.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill introduces a streamlined approach to the review of employment actions. I agree with the conclusion of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts that there is a clear need for a revision of the current grievance and appeal mechanisms. The present review system contains too many avenues of appeal, resulting in complicated and convoluted processes. The responsibility to afford public servants a right of review of employment decisions needs to be balanced with the need to reduce the costs associated with a grievance based workplace culture.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, I emphasise that the bill does not propose and has never sought the abolition of external review. It explicitly provides public servants with a right to seek review of any APS action that relates to their employment and allows for independent external review from outside their own agency. The detail of the review processes and the particular rights afforded to staff will be set out in the new Public Service regulations. With due regard to the recommendation of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, these provisions will be made simpler, clearer and more concise than the draft they considered.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Although the JCPA made no recommendation on the matter, it expressed a view that it was appropriate for the Public Service Commissioner to set standards and to review service&amp;hyphen;wide performance. However, to
         <break page="10041" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          address any perception of a conflict of interest, it was suggested by the committee that, in addition, there should be a Merit Protection Commissioner with separate statutory powers to review individual employment actions.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government has agreed to take up this suggestion. It reflects a significant amendment to the existing bill, and has been made only after the most careful consideration. The Merit Protection Commissioner will be able to investigate a complaint and, much like the Commonwealth Ombudsman, make recommendations to an agency head on how it should be addressed. If not satisfied with the response, the Merit Protection Commissioner will report that conclusion to the Public Service Commissioner, who will have the power to report to the minister and, if necessary, to parliament. These represent very substantial powers of review and scrutiny.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is clear from my remarks that merit selection will remain a fundamental principle in selection decisions under the bill. Indeed, the bill specifically prohibits patronage or favouritism in staffing and prevents ministers from involving themselves in individual staffing decisions. The JCPA has recommended that the definition of merit should be included in the bill rather than, as originally proposed, in the subordinate legislation. That recommendation has also been accepted. The definition is based upon suggestions made by the Women's Electoral Lobby and supported by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another important element of the bill is the protection it provides, for the first time, to public interest whistleblowers. Public servants who believe that they have evidence of fraud or misconduct will now be able to make reports to their agency head or the Public Service Commissioner; an approach which, unlike the leaking of confidential information on government business, will serve to protect the public interest. The act will provide them with protection from victimisation or discrimination.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Joint Committee of Public Accounts recommended that the government consider widening the whistleblowers legislation beyond the APS. The government has agreed to this recommendation and has referred the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          matter to the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams) for his consideration.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         An important initiative is the requirement that each agency head must establish a workplace diversity program. While these programs will operate to ensure that workplaces are free from discrimination, they go further than the arrangements in the current legislation for equal employment opportunity. The programs will recognise that a service which values and uses the diverse backgrounds and perspectives of its employees is likely to be more productive and creative.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The need to better balance work and family responsibilities through the development of appropriate workplace systems and structures will be an important aspect of a workplace diversity program. It is important for parliament to be able to assess the effectiveness of these programs. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts recommended that the Public Service Commissioner's directions should require agency heads to evaluate the outcomes of their workplace diversity programs and provide the commissioner with all the information necessary to carry out comparisons of the programs on an agency&amp;hyphen;by&amp;hyphen;agency basis. The government accepts that these proposals will strengthen public scrutiny of its programs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The current Australian Public Service Act gives various rights of return to those who leave the APS to work with other Commonwealth bodies. These mobility provisions are lengthy and complex. They represent a considerable liability for Public Service agencies. The government's intention is to provide agencies with the discretion to determine arrangements that best meet their needs. The mobility rights of people covered by the current provisions will be preserved for a transitional period. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts has recommended that the transitional period be extended from one year to three, and the government has accepted this proposal.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It should be noted that mobility of staff between agencies is specifically provided for in the bill. Employees will still be able to move from one APS agency to another on promotion or transfer without having to resign
         <break page="10042" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          or be re&amp;hyphen;engaged. The classification rules, by grouping similar classification levels, will facilitate mobility across the service and again underpin the concept of the career service. The bill also continues, in a simplified form, the current provisions for the movement of APS employees where the government has made machinery of government changes or administrative rearrangements.

         The parliamentary departments are not covered by the  Public Service Bill 1997 . Instead, it is proposed that they will operate under their own Parliamentary Service Act. It is the government's view that the independence of the parliament and its employees can best be recognised by establishing a separate statutory regime for those who work in the parliamentary departments. For that reason, the government supports the bill brought to this House by its Presiding Officer. The establishment of a separate parliamentary service also has the support of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts.

         I am pleased that this  Parliamentary Service Bill 1997  reflects the new approach set out in the  Public Service Bill 1997 . The drafting of this bill has been the responsibility of the clerks. The recognition of the independence of the advice provided by the two clerks and the proposal that they have 10&amp;hyphen;year non&amp;hyphen;renewable terms reflects the views of the Presiding Officers. It is supported by the government.

         I have had a brief opportunity to peruse the amendments put forward by the opposition. It will be clear from my earlier remarks that the amendments proposed by the government address a significant number of the opposition's concerns. However, the government is unwilling to contemplate the high levels of prescription and central control that the opposition would impose on the engagement of staff and the management of their duties.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I remind the House that it was the then Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters, the Hon. Gary Johns, who reported to parliament in 1995 that there was a need to establish a more contemporary employment framework and, to that end,
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

         I am also disappointed that the opposition suggests the reintroduction of binding appeal mechanisms for all APS employees. The government is keen to make it clear to the opposition that it wants bipartisan support for this piece of legislation. We believe it is an historic piece of legislation that will provide the framework for this and future governments of this country. We approach the bill in that spirit.

         This is a complex and important package of legislation before the parliament. It has far&amp;hyphen;reaching implications obviously and immediately for the Public Service, but it has implications for all Australians, and particularly for those Australians who depend on government services. Whilst in one way or another that is all of us, in particular those Australians in greatest need tend to be those who most rely on government services.

          the Public Service (Dr Kemp) in speaking on this occasion—has repeatedly assured us that its intention is to simplify the 1922 Public Service Act. The opposition certainly does not challenge the need for its simplification or its reform. As the minister acknowledged, we were the first to recognise that need, instituting when in government a process to reform the act. But we do question the way in which the government is going about simplification. There is widespread concern that simplification may not in fact be the government's principal motivation in bringing forward this legislation, because under the guise of simplification we actually have some radical changes to the future and operations of the Public Service.

         I will comment briefly on some of these changes. We now have a circumstance, for example, where the Prime Minister and ministers will be able to negotiate salary and conditions for agency heads and these will not be subject to public scrutiny. That is a significant change and I think a cause for some concern. Agency heads, in turn, will have the power to hire and fire and determine salary and conditions for agency employees. They will have the power to revoke and amend determinations which give effect to conditions of service which have been negotiated and agreed between the government and APS employees. Officers of the SES, who constitute the management core of the Public Service, will not even have recourse to the unfair dismissal provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. It is a bit hard to say that this constitutes a small business, even if we were to revert back to that debate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Furthermore, a vast range of responsibilities will be devolved to agency heads, which will result in increased differentiation, competition and the potential for rivalry between departments and duplication of administrative procedures. I note this with interest in the context of a recent speech by the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) on 15 October when he talked about the need for a cohesive corporate government framework. I have to say not that I disagree with him saying it but I disagree with his view that this bill will make it more cohesive. To the

         We have seen some problems of that type—and if I have time I will refer to them—following upon the restructuring of government in South Australia after the South Australian elections. Without going into the merit of those changes, which are none of the business of this parliament or related to this bill, some of the difficulties that have been thrown up in trying to deal with the devolved decision making process as a result of that example of government restructuring are something that we need to give consideration to. Furthermore, the opposition is concerned that the APS will become less of a career service and there will be a loss of institutional memory.

         The Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act is being repealed and with it all of the current mechanisms for review of employment decisions affecting APS employees. We welcome the government's decision to support the continuation of an independent Merit Protection Commissioner, but we are still concerned to see what responsibilities the government proposes to give the commissioner. We got some indications in the minister's speech just now, and that is something we will wish to consider.

         I would like to take this opportunity—and it is relevant to this point—to agree with the minister about the good work of the JCPA on this bill. I was not altogether convinced that it was the appropriate committee for it to go to. I was certain that it should have gone to a committee and there should have been a review. If I had been asked, I would not have been sure—although I served briefly on the JCPA and have a high regard for it—that it was the appropriate place. I acknowledge they did a very good job. The opposition welcomes the fact that the government has taken up a number of the suggestions, some of them in full and some of them in ways that we may still have some concern about. This issue of merit review is one where, if I understand the minister's remarks and the previously publicised aspects of it, we may still have some concerns about the way in which that aspect of the JCPA's recommendation is going to be implemented. We hope that the regulations
         <break page="10044" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          will be available well before the Senate has to give consideration to this bill so that we can have a look in detail at how the government is proposing to implement it. Nevertheless, we welcome the fact that there has been some decision, however belated, to support the continuation of an independent Merit Protection Commissioner.

         Another concern expressed by members of the opposition, which I wish to reflect here, is the issue of mobility rights such as those—but not only those—that APS employees who are employed under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act enjoy. Those rights will be removed after a 12&amp;hyphen;month transitional period, thus limiting the movement of staff between the Public Service and Parliament House, and other mobility aspects as well, as I understand it. The benefits to both institutions which have flowed from this movement have the potential to be limited. I think that is an unfortunate change.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The overall effect of these and other changes introduced by these bills, in the opposition's view, contrary to the government's assertion and declared intention, creates the potential for a public service which will be more easily influenced by the government of the day and less willing to offer critical advice. I do accept that at its heart the capacity and willingness to provide critical advice flows from the commitment to public service which most people take when they join the Public Service. They make a decision that they wish to pursue a career in the service of the Australian people and part of that is to give frank advice.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I accept that we do not make people give good advice by passing laws. They give good advice because they make a commitment that that is what they want to do. They apply that principle and they apply themselves. It is nevertheless true that the legislative framework is what influences the marginal decisions and sometimes those will be very important decisions. They are matters that therefore give us some concern.

         Behind that concern, and why we interpret the government's intentions perhaps with some caution, is a strongly held suspicion that the government has a deep&amp;hyphen;seated antipathy

         Why would we hold that suspicion? It could be that 30,000 jobs have been cut from the Public Service, despite the fact that the Prime Minister said that 2,500 jobs would be cut over three years. We now find that there have been massive cuts to the Public Service and core Public Service responsibilities are being transferred to the private sector, sometimes in circumstances which we consider to be highly inappropriate. Against that background, I do not think it is surprising that many Australians, many public servants and the opposition share the suspicion which I have just outlined.

         Of course there are some positive aspects to these bills which the opposition welcomes and supports—for example, the inclusion of public service values in the legislation and a code of conduct for APS employees. Our concern is that, while the government claims to be ensuring the preservation of the traditional ethos and values of an apolitical and non-partisan APS by incorporating these values in legislation, which is a good thing to do, it is ensuring their destruction and that they are undermined by the inclusion of other provisions which we consider are incompatible with, and in some circumstances positively hostile to, these same values.

         For example, it is true, as the government claims, that the legislation proscribes patronage and favouritism. It is also true that the structure of the Public Service as a consequence of this legislation, if it were passed unamended, would create an environment where agency heads will be made completely beholden to ministers for their continuing employment and for their salary and conditions of employment, where departmental employees will be made similarly beholden to agency heads, and where the government will remain determined to restrict the appeal rights of public servants. That combination of circumstances encourages patronage and favouritism. If the government had actually set out to create a framework which was
         <break page="10045" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         The bills also need to be assessed in the context of the challenges the country is currently facing: the problem of continuing high unemployment, lack of job security, lack of confidence by industry and small business. At a time when unity of purpose and interdepartmental cooperation are needed more than ever, it is foolish in the extreme to risk undermining the cohesion and professionalism of the Public Service. By weakening the ties that bind the Public Service—such as classifications, conditions and rates of pay and mobility between departments—and accentuating division and competition, the government is engineering the demise of the strong, unified, apolitical Public Service that has served Australia so well.

We do have a proud record. It is a record which should be built upon and maintained.

As the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) mentioned in his second reading speech, these Public Service reforms are part of the government's broader micro-economic reform agenda, an agenda that was ill served by the empty rhetoric of the previous government. The previous government did consider the kinds of reforms being debated here today. They held the reviews, they conducted the negotiations but, in the end, their allegiance to the Public Service unions outweighed the rights of taxpayers, the nation's economic health and, it should be noted, the interests of Australia's public servants.

         In that context, it is significant that, in their original form, these bills sought to delete the 75&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old requirement for the Public Service `to provide frank, honest, comprehensive, accurate advice to the government of the day'. I am pleased to say that, in some ways, the government has been pushed back with respect to its original intent to undermine the thrust of that very important objective—`to provide frank, honest, comprehensive, accurate advice to the government of the day'.

         The tradition of Public Service employees giving frank, honest and accurate advice without fear or favour is, to my way of thinking, an important tradition based on an important principle.

They are as expressed in the diaries of Richard Crossman, a minister in the 1960s Wilson Labour government. In Australia, too, I might say, the Whitlam Labor government and other Labor governments have often had difficulty with particular Public Service departments—especially in more recent times, I might say, the Treasury and, in some instances, the failure by other departments which we would have expected more vision and strength from to actually stand up and counter the Treasury's view of life.

         This is about the independence of the Public Service. You do not necessarily always have to like the advice given to you by an independent Public Service, but you must always respect it, accept it and be willing to debate it. We have never sought to overturn the fundamental principle of an independent Public Service, which was the intent of the bill before the House as originally drafted. We even kept John Stone on as Secretary to the Treasury after our election to the treasury bench in 1983. For some in the Labor Party, that was a big ask, to actually accept that John Stone—someone who, historically, is

He suggested that this government will destroy the Australian Public Service as a career prospect. It seems, for example, that within the Liberal Party people like the member for Goldstein, a Liberal Party apparatchik, or the member for Kooyong can have career prospects, but public servants who seek to devote their career to community service are not to be given such career prospects under the Howard government.

         The coalition government has made clear by its actions towards the Public Service since being elected that it is motivated by hate and has a small&amp;hyphen;minded, mean&amp;hyphen;fisted approach to government. It hates the idea of government being involved in employment at all. It has directly dismissed tens of thousands of public servants. There are varying estimates of the extent of the damage already done by the government's actions. When we talk about the dismissal of public servants, we are not just talking about the loss of jobs; we are talking about an attack on the very fabric of Australia and delivery of services to all Australians in a country of significant geographical area which requires a government in Canberra to be willing to invest in the provision of services through direct employment across its length and breadth.

         More importantly—this is understood in the broader community but perhaps not in the government's benches—for every direct government job that has gone there has been a multiplier effect into the private sector, especially in local, regional economies. The closure of government offices in regions has had a devastating flow&amp;hyphen;on effect on local, private sector small businesses. Research for the government's own department of regional development before it was abolished, and which was reported to federal cabinet in July, shows that flow&amp;hyphen;on economic effects from the closure of regional offices can be up to double the direct impact. Presumably, this is exactly the kind of frank, honest, comprehensive and accurate advice which the government wanted to make illegal in its original intent.

It is easy to see why the Howard government and, I might say, the member for Goldstein, in particular, wanted to legislate to remove requirements for honesty from anything to do with public service employment.

        <para first-indent="16">
         One reality is that the federal government, whichever party rules, is the body that the Australian people look to for their nation's sense of purpose and direction. The federal government is the single most powerful entity in our society, and the government's actions and inactions do not just set the parameters within which our society operates. To use a somewhat archaic phrase: they do set the course of the Australian nation's destiny.

         The second reality is that the quality of governance the federal government provides is only partly determined by the representatives elected by the people. Despite the many stirling but all too often unrecognised attributes of politicians, the quality of governance that politicians deliver depends on the calibre of their bureaucracy. Politics has few certainties, but one of them is that the Commonwealth bureaucracy will continue to serve the Australian public and the national interest beyond the life of any particular government.

The JCPA's advisory report on the bill maintained the committee's

         The shadow minister for public administration, Senator Faulkner, who came onto the JCPA especially to consider the Public Service Bill, initially doubted both `the minister's motives' in referring the bill to the JCPA and `the thoroughness of the scrutiny that the bill was likely to receive' because the government `had the numbers on the committee'. Eventually, his doubts about a thorough scrutiny were dispelled and he congratulated the JCPA `on the comprehensive and professional way it went about its work'.

         Nonetheless, Senator Faulkner, like some of his colleagues in this House, still felt compelled to fire a couple of politically partisan parthian arrows, saying that the JCPA's report was a `slap in the face for the government', and that he was sure that the JCPA's government members wanted fewer recommendations that were actually contained in the report. Of course, neither is the case.

         <para first-indent="16">
          There were substantial concerns that the bill would erode the quality of APS advice. From my perspective, nothing in our system of government is more precious or more fragile than good advice. Occasionally, I speculate whether there is a Gresham's law of advice with bad advice tending to drive out the good. But it is the province of science to discover laws; politicians are restricted to making them. And, as a politician, I am comfortable about saying that good advice is often uncomfortable.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Good advice may cut across the grain of policy commitments that will not work or undermine apparent short-term political advantage that will boomerang in the longer term. Good advice occasionally contradicts the predispositions of superiors and, by so doing, it can, unfortunately, bruise their egos. Good advice is essential to good government and the concern to protect good advice is not only legitimate but, I believe, imperative.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Some of those appearing before the JCPA testified in quite dramatic terms that changes in the position of secretaries and others would mean the end of so&amp;hyphen;called frank and fearless advice. There was debate over whether advice was a matter of character or of tenure. Personally, I have long believed that, ultimately, advice is a matter of character, but this is probably the overhang of a youth misspent as an untenured adviser. I am now old enough and ugly enough to admit that it is probably easier to express one's character through good advice if one is not subject to sanctions, particularly the sanction of quick termination. However, the departmental secretaries' tenures effectively ended in 1983. They were ended when the Hawke government made the change to contract employment.

          The bill does transfer the appointment and termination of agency heads formally from the Governor-General to the Prime Minister, and in this respect the JCPA concluded that:

           the culture and ethos and provide the incentives for the bureaucracy to give the best advice. A government writing a new public service act has a particular responsibility to specify the quality of the advice expected from the Australian Public Service. In this respect, the bill can be improved because its only description of the quality of advice expected of the Public Service is `timely'.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Under questioning, some current secretaries advised the JCPA that going beyond timeliness was unnecessary. I must say that this threw me a bit, because timeliness is not next to godliness, and there are more important requirements than this when giving legislative expression to the quality of advice the APS is expected to offer. Indeed, in a hierarchy such as the APS, which it still remains, particularly given that the Public Service Bill concentrates even more power in the hands of secretaries, it is important that the quality of good advice be specified.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The APS needs to be given a clear legislative signal that governments expect all public servants to give frank, honest, comprehensive, accurate and, of course, timely advice. It is an indication of this government's commitment to the importance of the APS advice that it is moving amendments to the bill embodying this.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          A couple of further comments should also be made about Public Service values in the bill. There was a concern that the accountability of the APS be fully defined as being within the framework of ministerial responsibility to the government, the parliament and the public. The JCPA did recommend accordingly and the government is making the appropriate amendments.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Much has been made of the fact that the Public Service Bill for the first time provides for an explicit statutory reference to the merit principle. The reference to merit in the bill was not, however, accompanied by a legislative definition of merit, and the JCPA recommended one be included and the government is moving on this front.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The clauses in the bill relating to streamlining of APS review mechanisms generated very substantial contention. The Public Service and Merit Protection Commission and
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           the Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business submitted that:

          There is a belief that the APS suffers from a grievance mentality. This appears to be a long standing malaise . . . This view is not necessarily the sole province of academics but has credence amongst many Human Resources practitioners, for example, a senior officer remarked that `. . . perhaps today too many staff think in terms of rights and entitlements and not enough in terms of obligations and responsibilities.'
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          It may be that I have not quite mastered the Anglo&amp;hyphen;Saxon art of understatement, but it seems to me that there are a few too many phrases such as `appears', `it is believed', `not necessarily' and `perhaps' in this passage for the assertions about a Public Service grievance mentality to be absolutely compelling.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The methodological disputes between the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission and the Merit Protection Review Agency over the costs of current appeal processes and comparisons with private sector best practice are complex, but at the end of the day they are not totally to the point. The real bottom line is that a strong and widespread consensus does exist that the grievance and appeal procedures of the existing Public Service Act do need revision. The public interest does require streamlining and we need to reduce the costs of appeals procedures consistent with fair and transparent review processes.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As usual, the general consensus about streamlining and cost saving becomes a lot muddier when we come to specifics. A large number of reservations have been expressed about this section of the bill and the accompanying draft regulations. The Public Service's external and independent review mechanisms are of substantial importance, and the bill did involve a major change in the review system.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The MPRA is to be abolished and the Public Service Commissioner was initially to be the external reviewing authority. As the Public Service Commissioner pointed out, this represents a significant shift because, although it provides for external review through the Public Service Commissioner and is quite clear about the grounds for review and what action is and what action is not reviewable, it does not allow the external review authority
          <break page="10057" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           to overturn the decision of the primary decision maker.

          A commissioner not satisfied with a response to his recommendations must advise the agency head, and include details of the recommendation and any other relevant information in a report to the agency minister in the commission's next annual report, or make a separate commission report to the parliament.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There were understandable concerns about whether the Public Service Commissioner, who is a member of the management advisory committee comprising departmental secretaries, would be seen to be totally impartial in judging the actions of his management advisory committee colleagues. It is of central importance that the impartiality and the independence of the external reviewer be clear.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Various options were put about how this could be achieved. The JCPA thought that a sensible solution to this complex issue was having a public service commissioner and a merit protection commissioner operating within one administrative organisation, but having separate statutory powers. The government's amendments will implement this.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It still needs to be said, however, that the bill's termination of the external reviewer's capacity to actually overturn primary decisions remains a substantial change. This is consistent with the government's commitment to giving secretaries the maximum flexibility to manage their workplaces.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The other side of the coin to flexibility is accountability. For this to be met, the independent review body will have to be very robust in reporting to the parliament on cases where secretaries choose not to implement its recommendations. This is of great significance and I do expect that the parliament will be monitoring such reports very closely to see that what is intended actually does occur.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The JCPA was also concerned with regulations dealing with the review of Australian Public Service employment actions and recommended that they be redrafted in a way which is simple, clear and concise. As the
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           minister has indicated, I understand this is to be done.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Finally, I would like to touch briefly on the bill and the issue of workplace diversity. The bill states that the APS provides a workplace which is free from discrimination and recognises the diverse backgrounds of the APS. Agency heads are required to establish a workplace diversity program giving effect to this. There will also be a commissioner's direction setting out the requirements of the diversity program.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          These are important but broad legislative commitments and to be effectively implemented there needs to be adequate internal and external evaluations of outcomes and appropriate reporting on achievements and shortfalls to the minister and to the parliament. The JCPA made a number of recommendations relating to the required level of adequacy and transparency and the government has adopted them.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The Public Service Bill 1997, together with the changes proposed by the JCPA and accepted by the government, will, I believe, substantially strengthen the ability of the APS to discharge its responsibilities to the government, to the parliament and to the public in the 21st century.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The bill sets out the codes and values of the Public Service as a set of enforceable standards and expectations and does make them uniquely accessible to the public and, I think, accessible to a lot more public servants. It creates a more flexible environment in which secretaries really do have the capacity to manage their departments and will provide appropriate external and independent appeals mechanisms for public servants. The bill does this while preserving the key elements of the Public Service's values, ethos and traditions which are prized by individual members of the APS and which have enabled the service to make such a great contribution to Australia.

With that qualification, I appreciate the good work that the committee and the secretariat put into this report, and they are to be commended for that.

         I wanted to start off a little differently in my  contribution to this debate on the  Public Service Bill 1997  because I am a former public servant. Notwithstanding that, I think that all too often we forget the important role of the Public Service—that is, they are the administrators and the deliverers of those things that governments seek to do. It does not matter whether we are talking about taxation, social security, defence or a whole range of other things. They are always vulnerable to attack and politically we take quite a few cheap shots at them. I commend them for the very honourable tradition that they uphold.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We also need to take into account that, for some years now, the Public Service has operated in an environment of staff ceilings—they go back to the Whitlam days—efficiency dividends, special efficiency dividends and budget cuts. Increasingly, we are asking them to look to private enterprise as some sort of model and adopt all the procedures that private enterprise does—forgetting the special responsibility they have to fairness and equity in the way they carry out their business.

          the former head of the Prime Minister's department, Mike Keating, that one of the problems with pushing for increased productivity and increased efficiency and operating with smaller budgets is that we can become more efficient and effective but actually lose sight of the goal which we are trying to achieve. We get a tick for efficiency. We get a tick for accountability. But as far as customer service and people

         A classic case of that is the Department of Social Security telephone information service. I have no doubt that it is more efficient and more effective and that people are churning through inquiries at a rate of knots. What it completely ignores is that there are a whole range of citizens out there who are absolutely intimidated and threatened by the whole process. They are not able to use a keypad to flick through the proper options and to finally get through to the correct area for an answer to their question. I flipped out one day myself, I apologise, because I got so frustrated using the same mechanism. We can adopt all of the Public Service models but fail miserably on customer service.

This is not a good model for the Public Service. I am putting in a plug for all members of parliament to acknowledge that under difficult circumstances, under a rapidly changing environment, under considerable budgetary and staff pressure by successive governments, by and large the Public Service has done the right thing.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I notice that the bill addresses the accountability of public servants and a code of conduct. This is terribly important. It is no good having codes of conduct unless they are known not only to those within the Public Service but also to clients of the particular department. Again, you may feel that I am a little critical of the joint committee, but when we look at issues like the accountability of public servants we need to start specifying what the rights of clients are. For example, is it the government's view that a citizen, in dealing with a department and a departmental officer, has the right to know who that officer is? If any government member wants to rush back and say to me, `Oh, yes but of course we do', I would tell them that that is not the case today. There is not a situation where you
         <break page="10059" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          have the right to know. You do not even have the right, by the way, to contact your local Centrelink office or DSS office, as I have mentioned before.

        <para first-indent="16">
         While I can accept that pooling calls via a queuing system is efficient, I still think that constituents who deal with the department or Centrelink ought to have the right to the number of the local branch as well as the right to deal with an accountable and responsible officer. This is not the most efficient or the most productive way of organising your team. It comes with some cost. We now have to start factoring in that if we are giving citizens rights then it may cost some more. In a democracy, in an environment in which we are proud of human rights and the rights which our citizens enjoy, this is a cost of government which is well worth paying.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If anything, the rights of citizens are being eroded as this administration has gone on. Certainly, I do not think that we were perfect in government, but the wholesale attack on Public Service numbers and extraordinary efficiency dividends has now exacerbated that situation for ordinary citizens. I hope that when the Senate comes to consider this bill, when they look at this issue of accountability and a code of conduct for public servants, which I strongly support, they will also look at perhaps a charter of rights for citizens.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I can give you another example. It is only a minor thing, but in the Child Support Agency it has always been the case that the agency can make act of grace payments where the agency has made an error. The real problem is that the clients of the agency never know about it or hitherto have not known about it.

          If you have clients of Public Service departments who are ignorant of what they can apply for, then it is virtually like not having the provision at all. That is why it is really important that you not only have this accountability through a code of conduct but also have citizens rights enshrined in a public service act, and well publicised so that all citizens are equally knowledgeable.

         In terms of cutbacks and given that the parliamentary departments are also mentioned in this bill, I wanted to say how saddened I was that the Liberal government hacked $10 million off the parliamentary budget.

Let me say that I think, in the main, members of parliament are as good as their support staff, whether that is in their electorate or in the committee system. I the point in terms of members of this House of Representatives that if we were congressmen in the United States Congress, every member would have a minimum staff of 18. I do not argue that we should have a staff of 18, but what I do say is that, if we were to provide additional staff to members of parliament there is no doubt that, overwhelmingly, the members would be able to utilise the staff very effectively. The power of the executive—that is, the ministers of the government—has increased enormously, and the only way to redress that is to strengthen the countering institutions. I be

Indeed, as other speakers have said and as I have said, the basis of this debate is not only the legislation but also a very good committee report. If we are looking at staffing structures, committees were the first ones that were hit. In other words, we did not reduce the number of committees and we did not lessen their responsibilities, but we took more staff off them. The staffing ratios were reduced. This really is an attack on that institution and an attack on the counterbalance to the power of the executive.

         I have previously suggested that this parliament ought to show the way in the way in which it staffs its committees. Not only should we have the permanent staff that we already do, but I sincerely believe we should develop a system of internships or apprenticeships for university graduates. So we would offer modest contracts, traineeships or whatever you want to call them, to very bright, young university students for no more than 18 months. They would work within the committee structure. They would be the fresh, young, enthusiastic, bright brains of the committees, and I think they would give committees extra strike power in the important work that they do.

         While we are talking about the Public Service, I want again to remind members that the Ombudsman has consistently reported that many of our fellow Australian citizens, and quite a number of small businessmen, are missing out on the redress afforded by the Ombudsman because she does not have the jurisdiction to track the dollars. What does all that mean? It means that we are contracting out a lot of the work of the Public Service. When you contract out, you do not immediately give the clients of the Public Service the same rights of appeal that every citizen has to the Ombudsman.

I regret to say that there is example after example where whistleblowers have come forward and have suffered dramatically in terms of their career or their employment. I think this is a particularly unhealthy situation and one that needs to be redressed as soon as possible.

I do not think government members have any idea of the impact of that. Not having that advice does make you feel terribly isolated. I was always very privileged in the relationships I had with departments or with the ADF. I can never say that they always agreed with me, but we always had a good discussion about it. We always recognised and believed that they were giving very honest, impartial advice. I think in a democracy without a Public Service capable of giving that, or encouraged to give that, you really do have a second-rate Public Service.

          and associated bills. Before speaking about these bills, I will endorse some comments by the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), particularly in relation to his suggestion about staff for members of parliament. I can imagine that is not a popular point to make in the community. If it were discussed across the country in the context of the need to employ young people in a position where they can learn an awful lot about how the system works and about how busy an electorate office can be, as well as provide them with some opportunity to commence a career—albeit perhaps in the Public Service or even in industry, following on from working for a member of parliament—I think that should be encouraged.

         I am puzzled by the structure of our electorate offices, where we have three staffers each employed on a salary ranging between $31,000 and $35,000. Each backbencher has three people employed within that salary range, yet there are so many jobs in an electorate office that involve quite menial and repetitive activity. These jobs would be a good start for juniors. If members of parliament were allowed to employ an extra staffer—that is, a junior, who has just left school
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          and who is looking for work—I think it would be a great message to send to the community. There would certainly be no shortage of work that they could do in a member's office, and it would also send an important message.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I have employed juniors, young kids who have left school, on a work experience basis in my own electorate. I am pleased to say that I have a pretty good record of having those juniors going on to find work. I am very pleased to see that that has occurred. I think that by giving them that start—many of them have seized the opportunity although they have not been paid—they have been able to progress. I can think of one person in particular, Michael Atkinson, who has progressed. He is now working for Boral and has a very good position. He worked unstintingly and untiringly for me for some months in my office on a completely voluntary basis. So I give a gentle message to the executive about that: we should look very seriously at employing juniors. It would give members' offices a greater balance. Also, if it were explained to the community, I do not think the people in the community would have much opposition to it.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I will now turn to the bill itself. I should say by way of preface that in my electorate I have considerable numbers of public servants, both state and federal. From time to time, in the period that I have been a member, I have received a number of representations on a number of different issues. One thing we should bear in mind when any change is foreshadowed is that it is important that we explain that change and that we consult widely. I am pleased to see that, in relation to this particular measure, wide consultation with representatives and Public Service employees and individuals, as well as the ACTU, has taken place. It is important to consult for the reason that there are obviously concerns about changes, work security and what is going to happen. That particular area of concern has been brought to my attention recently in the Australian Taxation Office, where changes have been foreshadowed.

In recent times I have spoken to a number of workers at that very low level—and I do not use that term disparagingly—in the Australian Taxation Office who are concerned about their future. At the rung where people basically do administrative assistant&amp;hyphen;type work, there is concern about the future of their jobs—and I understand that.

         Many of these people have been in the Public Service for many years. A couple of people who have come to see me recently have service that collectively adds up to a period of just over 50 years between them. They have been in the Public Service all this time, and they are now something like 10 years from retirement age. They are very concerned about proposals for change—and understandably so.

         I have spoken to them at length, and I have consulted with the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Peter Reith, about this matter. We will continue to advise and consult with the relevant groups. I understand that that process is a difficult one to work through but, over time, I believe that the arrangements that will be made will be fully explained, that there will be full consultation and that a very sensitive approach will be taken, especially to those who are concerned about their security, and particularly to those for whom the Public Service has become their life.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I respect those members of the Public Service because they have worked very, very hard. They have worked unstintingly and unselfishly, and they have been committed to their jobs in a lifetime way. For many of them, that is all that they have ever done, and I think that that commitment and that determination to serve, no matter what government is in power, has to be respected by governments when looking at any changes.

         The Public Service Bill itself is intended to replace the current legislative framework for the establishment and management of the Public Service. It is a key element of the government's Public Service reform agenda which is being implemented within the framework of the Workplace Relations Act. The government considers that the Public Service
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          should operate to the maximum extent consistent with its public responsibilities, but under the same industrial relations and employment arrangements that apply to the rest of the work force. I think that that is fair enough.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The current legislative framework for the Public Service contained in the old Public Service Act 1922 is riddled with unnecessary prescription and detail. It has been amended piecemeal more than 100 times since its enactment, it creates a regulatory environment and an emphasis on process which is inconsistent with contemporary management philosophy, and it acts as an inhibitor to innovation and best practice.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This has in fact led to critical comment about the act, and in particular to arguments that it has become excessively complex and fragmented. Its language and organisational layout continue to reflect the climate of a previous age with central regulation of employment decisions, and results in an Australian Public Service which is rule bound and risk averse, with personnel matters being much more expensive than best practice in the private sector. Many jokes have been made over the years about that, and I think public servants have borne the brunt of that. Some of it is quite unjustified, I might say, but some of it is justified because of the unnecessary fragmentation and complexity.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill is designed to address a number of those problems and deficiencies, and in particular areas such as the character and purpose—the ethos—of the Public Service being clearly defined. Likewise, there will be an acknowledgment of the need for a non&amp;hyphen;partisan and apolitical Public Service. There will be a prohibition on ministerial directions to agency heads in relation to individual Public Service staffing decisions, except in areas where this is allowed—for example, with the engagement of permanent heads. There will be a clear statement of the principle of merit, which I think is also a good thing.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There will be a statutory code of conduct, where again there have been some difficulties. Last year there was some legislation in relation to problems that arose in respect of particular peculiarities in legislation which
         <break page="10063" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          effectively prevented a person who was on leave without pay from being dealt with for a breach of conduct, and legislation had to be introduced to deal with that specifically. That was an anomaly in the old legislation. There are a number of other things, including specific provision for the Public Service Commissioner to report through the minister to parliament, and also provision for an independent review of employment decisions by a merit protection commissioner.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I have mentioned consultation. There were about 100 groups who were consulted. As I said before, these involved public servants, state and territory government representatives, management consultants, unions and academics. There were a number of seminars conducted, and more than 1,500 people were involved in those. So all of these consultations were used to develop the proposals for reform.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The legislation before the House is more ambitious and bolder than envisaged by the previous government. The Public Service Bill, together with the Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill, replaces not only the old Public Service Act but also the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The act itself is quite short, really, having regard to the fact that it succeeds an amorphous piece of legislation and enactments and regulations. It contains only about five per cent of the words of the existing legislation and is written in a very contemporary style. It will provide a framework for Public Service employment which achieves an optimal balance between improved accountability and devolved responsibility so as to maximise the efficiency and effectiveness of the service.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It seeks to ensure that the service is able to provide both better policy advice to government and higher quality services to the community. Ultimately, this will enable the more effective and efficacious use of Commonwealth resources; greater responsiveness to the government in providing timely advice in implementing the government's policies and programs; and a fair, effective, impartial and courteous service to all Australians, which
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

         Generally speaking, in my electorate office in Dickson I get a number of complaints about Public Service&amp;hyphen;type matters, such as social security. But the complaints are more about problems of process than individual examples of rudeness. The latter are fairly rare. When complaints have been made of that nature, obviously I have dealt with them fairly expeditiously. But, generally speaking, they have not been about the way individual members of the service have performed or about the way they have spoken to members of the public.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That should be put on the record because sometimes there is a lot of exaggeration in the community about the way public servants speak. Their job is not an easy one at all. I think generally there is a greater expectation out in the community for more and more services from the Public Service. They have to work within a framework. They cannot perform miracles. I think it is fair to say that at times maybe we all ask a bit too much of them. We must remember that they are doing their best, and sometimes in quite difficult circumstances.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The legislation goes on to talk about a number of other areas which I cannot cover in the time available to me. It is important, though, to refer to the fact that the bill provides for far greater freedom for public servants to manage their own workplaces. I think this is important. I feel that this shows great innovation in this area. The industrial relations system in this country has been transformed by the Workplace Relations Act, and it is important to incorporate those reforms into employment practices within the Public Service—that is, as I said before, to put the Public Service on a similar footing to the private sector. Already, that is taking place. Recently we heard the minister speaking about that in relation to an enterprise agreement.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The half&amp;hyphen;hearted enterprise bargaining introduced to the Public Service by the previous government foundered on central control and third party negotiation. That was the problem, and that is the problem that the
         <break page="10064" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Workplace Relations Act has sought to redress in the wider community. But, with its application to the Public Service, I think it is an important step forward in a uniform application of those principles across the public and the private sectors.

         The minister had lengthy meetings with the ACTU and public sector unions about this matter. After those meetings he responded with about 30&amp;hyphen;odd changes to the original draft. So it is important to recognise that there have been adequate consultations. There have been considerable efforts put in by the minister to ensure that the bills before the House reflect those concerns but at the same time implement the government's policy on this important area. It was interesting to note that one message that emerged in the discussions that the minister had with groups of public servants and public sector unions was the wish to ensure that the traditional ethos, conduct and values of the Public Service were preserved. In my submission the bill does that, and indeed it reinforces those values in a way that has not been done before.

         The fact of the matter is that there are some real issues here. When we look at the government's attitude on this particular issue, we see it couched in terms which seem superficially acceptable—in fact, even desirable. The nature of the change principally is about simplification. Simplification is something which the government supports, as does the opposition. But, beyond simplification, we are seeing other changes occurring. We talk about efficiency, we talk about effectiveness, but in the circumstances what we are doing is destroying the nature of the Public Service. The Public Service has served this country well for many years. The situation is that we are looking at changes which will undermine the independence of public servants and put them in a situation where they are at the behest of the government to an even greater extent than they are today. When we look at what this government has done to the Public Service in the year and a half they have been in government, we can see what their real agenda is. From their own figures, 30,000 jobs have been cut.

          —You have no choice but to listen to the Treasurer if you are less than one metre from him when he speaks—and I think that is one of his many attributes. I make that particularly clear. Let me say one other thing. Whilst you can never be complacent about our trading performance, I do want to point out to the House that for the 12 months ending 1 July this year we had an all&amp;hyphen;time record in exports, some $104.4 billion. That was the first ever surplus in goods and services. I do not underestimate the task to build again on that record figure this year, but we are off to a flying start. The truth of the matter is that it is far too early to say what all the ramifications will be from what might be termed `Red October 1997' or `the October economic firestorm'—a phrase I have used, in fact initiated, and which many others have used around the world.

But this is always what seems to happen in the lead-up to what passes for policy formulation by the Labor Party. What happens is that the Left adopts the traditional approach of opposing everything; the Right adopts the traditional approach of agreeing with the Left; then the right wing ignores the left and does exactly what it wants.

He recognises the value of privatisation. He has stated in the past it assists in creating jobs. Of course he presided over the very healthy and very active privatisation when Labor was in government. The Leader of the Opposition was involved in various sales: the CSL public share offer, the uranium stockpile, the Qantas public share offer and the Commonwealth Bank. There are about 15 on the list, but of course we know what the story was with the Commonwealth Bank. He stood up and said, `We won't sell anything of the Commonwealth Bank,' and then he said, `We'll sell only a third.' Then, ultimately, they went for the total selldown of the Commonwealth Bank and put that in place before the government changed.

I can understand why the poor member for Canberra was put up to it—after all, he is the fourth opposition spokesman on finance in the last 18 months. But that was deliberately designed to undermine the sale of Telstra. Today there are long faces in the opposition because the market has bounced back.

At the time, I was working in them myself.

         I was surprised to see two things. The first was that, in about October 1987, the Australian dollar was trading around 67c in the US dollar. By about June or July of the next year, 1988, it had risen in value to about 80c. You might say that the country was therefore rendered slightly less competitive in price terms. When we looked at the arrival figures, we found that the number of people visiting Australia continued to rise very steadily, and even quite sharply, through 1988, such that by June 1988 we had about a 40 per cent year on year increase.

Furthermore, it must be pointed out that, whilst the Asian market in the past few years has certainly been our strongest one, it is not our only one.

          I would point out too, to Mr Baird and to other people in the industry, that we have some expectation of an increase in arrivals from China, likewise from Taiwan, with extra flights from Mandarin Airlines, I believe, to come into Brisbane. This is not the time to be quite so gloomy as perhaps some people have been. If anything, it is no time to be talking a great industry down.

          —I think the sensitivity of having to take a point of order illustrates my point. In answer to the question, one method of paying an accommodation bond is a lump sum. Remember that that accommodation bond is not a fee. It is not a payment to the government. It is not a levy imposed by the government. The fact is that the bond is an amount of money that a care recipient effectively agrees to lodge for the time they are in the care facility. They get it back. When the resident leaves the facility the bond must be paid back to the care recipient, less no more than $2,600 per annum, with the maximum deduction being $13,000 over the five&amp;hyphen;year period. I repeat that the most the resident will pay from their bond will be $13,000.

         This is the same system that operated under the Labor hostel system for the past 10 years. Under the government's proposal, all accommodation bonds will be protected by strict prudential arrangements, and this is very different to what happened under your arrangements. Under Labor there were no
         <break page="10073" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          requirements as to how the up&amp;hyphen;front entry contribution had to be protected. Labor let the hostel sector operate without formal prudential supervision. It was only effective cash control by hostel operators that allowed payments to be made. You turned a blind eye to protecting the money of the people in hostels and no prudential requirements were put in place. You totally ignored the problem.

         Under our scheme these prudential arrangements protect those bonds and people will get them back. The money will be used, as I have said repeatedly, to address the standards issue in homes and hostels around this nation. It is right that it should be so. It is a legacy of your neglect in this area—a 75 per cent reduction in your 13 years of government—in supporting capital improvements to nursing homes and hostels. It is an absolute disgrace to hide behind a scare campaign, to ignore the needs of the aged and to reflect poorly on all those people who care for the elderly in our community.

         Earlier this year I tabled the Burton and Quinn reports. As a result of the Burton report, we established an equity organisation designed to deal with this sort of problem.

There is sufficient concern that today there are terms of reference being settled by the personnel executive of the Defence Force, to be signed off by the CDF, which will enable an investigation to take place, particularly of behaviour at ADFA where a number of the reports emanate.

         The important thing is that we want confidence to be restored. Accordingly, there will be contained in those terms of reference the need to identify and eradicate any incidents of repeating offences—that is, a single individual may be reported on one occasion but no action is desired by the complainant at that particular time; however, that person could offend again. That is totally unacceptable. The Defence Force has a policy that zero sexual harassment and sexual assault is acceptable. To achieve that, we need to continue to have a very strong backup situation whereby, even if the complainant says that she or he does not want any further action taken, it is neces

         With regard to sexual assault, it is necessary that civilian police forces be involved, that it is not dealt with simply by the Defence Force, in order that proper transparency is always available in the prosecution of those cases. That agreement has been reached. If a person is acquitted or fails to be convicted by a civilian court, there is available action for the Defence Force to take only if the DPP agrees to it. That also requires looking at because it is not always forthcoming in some instances I have seen where perhaps it should have been.

         All those issues need to be looked at. But, at the end of the day, we must ensure that our policy is pursued rigorously, that zero is the acceptable level and that young women are not deterred from finding a very successful career in the Australian Defence Force.

          —My question is to the Minister for Family Services. Minister, on the John Laws program this morning you claimed that, first, your hardship provisions would allow you to grant extensions to the amount of leave a resident can take from a nursing home and, secondly, you would allow retirees to keep fringe benefit entitlements if selling their homes forced them to breach the pension income or assets limits. Minister, how do you intend to do this and are these changes consistent with the Prime Minister's and Treasurer's claims that there would be no further changes to your discredited nursing home policy?

One of the issues we want to discuss with the MUA is the whole issue of workplace safety on the waterfront and in the stevedoring industry generally. We have already done quite a bit of work analysing the safety of people who work in the stevedoring industry. We have been struck by some quite startling results of our initial research. For example, the level of fatalities on the waterfront are running at more than twice the level of the Australian mining industry and seven times the all industries average in the years 1991-95. Over the same period, the incidence of injuries and disease rose from 108.6 cases per thousand employees to 169.6 cases per thousand. These figures compare highly unfavourably with the all Australian average of 29.1 cases per
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           thousand. The report that we have had prepared sums it up very well in the executive summary. It says:

         Our review of the available statistical evidence suggests that the stevedoring industry is performing very poorly in comparison to other sectors of the maritime industry and other major industries in Australia. This is reflected in a high rate of work related fatalities, injuries and disease.

         That is not a report put together by the government. We have gone outside of government to an independent firm to obtain advice on safety levels within the maritime industry. One of those persons who was responsible for this report was Michael Easson, the former secretary of the New South Wales Labor Council, an associate commissioner of the Industry Commission on occupational health and safety, and current chairman of the workplace relations group at Corrs Chambers Westgarth. When we meet with the MUA and the ACTU tonight we will give them a copy of this report and seek from them a constructive response.

         The last thing I would say to members of the House is that, when we sit down with the unions to talk about the waterfront and the problems of the waterfront, the one thing we ask of them is that they at least acknowledge the problems that are genuinely there and that genuinely need to be fixed. If they have trouble accepting the reality of these claims that we have made, we only ask them to fairly look at the evidence. The evidence put together by Michael Easson on safety is very compelling. If the unions are genuinely concerned about the safety of their own members, the first thing—

         There are some on the other side of the House, and particularly their comrades in the other chamber, who have suddenly become born again rural activists. They have discovered, after 13 years of Labor, that there was a problem with services in rural areas. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy recently brought this to our attention. A recent report shows that up to 28 per cent of people living in rural Australia do not know that under the act they have an entitlement from the Department of Social Security. Taking these services out to rural Australia will ensure that our veterans are not unaware of the entitlements which they so justly deserve. This is about bringing services west of the Great Dividing Range and acknowledging that a third of our veterans in Australia live outside metropolitan Australia.

          —I can tell the member for Grey that I have been apprised of the report by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and its findings, which included some very useful information. Around 40 per cent of farm households received some form of assistance through the Commonwealth social support programs in the year 1995-96. The awareness of social support programs at the national level was generally
          <break page="10078" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           high, but there was evidence that some families were unaware of the existence of particular programs that might be available to them and of the varying assets and income provisions.

         So it is important in that context to look at the range of service delivery mechanisms to ensure that people are properly briefed on the information about the services, programs and payments. That information is generally made available through regional offices, but in rural Australia provision is made for mobile and visiting services to operate in small and remote towns where agencies may not be present. There are non-government agencies in a number of areas that act upon the Commonwealth's behalf. There are also cooperative arrangements with state and local governments for delivery of services.

         There is a community agent program which enables our indigenous people to obtain access to services. We have the teleservice centres for people who are able to access telephones to obtain information. There is a wide range of mechanisms whereby information can be imparted. Efforts are being made to ensure that people are able to access each of those services.

         As I am advised, we are also looking at the use of modern technology. In the future, electronic lodgment of claims will be possible. The provision of information through mechanisms such as the Internet and touch screen terminals is also possible. The agency is working towards being able to use telephones in the way they are being used so much in banking and other areas so people may be able to have claims, or at least variations of their entitlements, effected through that mechanism.

This government is committed to the proper investigation of any serious allegation of war crimes. I had informed the House at the time Mr Konrad Kalejs returned to Australia of the steps that were put in train. Those steps are still in train. I should mention that it is not the practice of attorneys-general or ministers for justice under this government or any previous government to be involved on a day-to-day basis in operational investigations.

         The allegations relating to Mr Ozels have more recently been the subject of publicity. In the course of that publicity, it was revealed that under the previous government, while the war crimes investigation unit was in existence, there had been extensive investigations made in respect of him. The investigations, I understand, ceased after the previous government closed the war crimes investigation unit.

         Home mortgage rates are now at the lowest level in Australia since the 1960s. The average Australian with the average home mortgage is now saving $3,000 a year as a result of reduced interest rates. I am sure all members of parliament will welcome the fact that home buyers in Australia are saving so much money on their mortgages. I am sure even the Labor Party will welcome the fact that home buyers are saving $3,000 on their average mortgage as a result of low interest rates.

          —Since 1987 when we had the most recent significant downturn in the equity markets, a number of changes have occurred that have changed the fundamental nature of equity markets world wide. In the first place, we have had the rapid development of hedge markets and derivative markets. For example, in 1995, the Australian Stock Exchange introduced LEPOs, which are a form of derivative product. We have also witnessed a
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           significant increase in the number of options being traded. In fact, the volume of option trades has increased threefold since 1987.
          </break>
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There has been a second significant change in the equity markets. Today, Australian equities represent 75 per cent as a proportion of Australia's GDP. In 1987, it was just over 50 per cent. Today, there are 4.7 million Australians who are direct investors in the Australian equities market, compared with around 1.5 million in 1987; that is, over a threefold increase in the number of mums and dads investing in the all ordinaries.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Since 1987, we have seen some memorable failures. Of course, the people who used to embrace the Labor Party and the people who the Labor Party used to embrace—the Alan Bonds, the Christopher Skases, the Laurie Connells and the George Herscus—are not around anymore to either serve the purposes of the Labor Party or to take away from the Australian investors their equity, their hard&amp;hyphen;earned cash and their heart and soul, if you like, that they have invested in the stock market.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Instead, we have seen a replacement with quality stocks. Blue chip stocks have entered the markets: Colonial Mutual with around 500,000 small&amp;hyphen;time investors; National Mutual with around 500,000 investors; the GIO with 140,000 new investors; Qantas, which I will come to a little later, with 120,000 new investors; and the Commonwealth Bank with around 300,000 new investors. The numbers of mums and dads—the average Australian battlers—who are investing in the equity markets today have increased threefold over the number of equity investors in 1987.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But there are two very fundamental differences. The first difference is that today our markets are more global. The globalisation of international markets has been linked to the development and the increasing strength in the US dollar. We have also seen a further development in global banking, with the net result that, out of this globalisation, world equity markets are almost, in many ways, trading as one.

         The more they trade, the more they rely on information. The information that they receive can, at any moment—in the moment of a
         <break page="10083" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          heartbeat—change the nature of the market. Anyone who has been down to the Sydney Futures Exchange would have noticed that there is a large black board that reports to the exchange every question of moment that is asked in the House of Representatives or the Senate. That is a clear indication of how fragile the market is; how sensitive it is to every utterance that comes from this place and from people who hold positions of responsibility in this place.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I suppose that when we came in in 1996, the class of 1996 was under the assumption that individual members of this House would be responsible not only to this place but also to the people whom they seek to represent. So, when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) went before the Australian people yesterday and talked down the Australian economy, there could be only one conclusion from his remarks: that his sole interest and purpose is to debase the politics of this nation by simply debasing the Australian economy.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is only one outcome from that. The net result of the comments by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was reported by AAP within moments with the headline, `Australia too weak to handle stocks crisis: opposition'. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is under the impression that he has scored a momentous political point, he should realise that the only people who suffer are not the people on this side of the House, but the people whom we seek to represent. They are the mums and dads of Australia—the 4.7 million Australians who directly invest in the Australian equity markets, who have, in many cases, their livelihoods riding on the all ordinaries index and the strength and purpose of the Australian economy.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In this current environment of great volatility in world markets, there is what is called in market terms a flight to quality. When there is a flight to quality, people go back to the fundamentals. Analysts and investors go to the fundamentals. They do not just look at PE ratios, net asset backing and so on, they also look at the economy in which individual companies are operating. They look at economic growth, and we have one of the highest
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          economic growth rates in the OECD. They look at inflation, and we have one of the lowest inflation rates in the OECD. They look at the direction of the current account deficit, and Australia's current account deficit, after a long time under Labor, is now going in the right direction. Those fundamentals are vital when it comes to an individual investment decision. Those investment decisions are made in New York, London, Brussels and Tokyo because people are seeking a haven for quality.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When new Labor makes comments such as those made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition yesterday, one can only conclude that it is old Labor again. But it is not even the Labor of 1987; it is almost the Labor of the 1950s with the old tactics. You could forgive the Deputy Leader of the Opposition if you thought for a moment that he was going to be making a considered, informed and statesmanlike comment on the economy, but you cannot forgive him for making a statement that is so economically illiterate as that which was made by him yesterday when he talked about the flailing Australian economy.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         You cannot forgive him. It might be okay for him to be innumerate; it is not okay for him to be economically illiterate. The net result was that he was trying to ensure that, out of all of this process, we had mutually assured destruction. It seems to be a classic tactic of the Australian Labor Party at the moment. They are seeking to destroy us and to destroy themselves at the same time, with the net result that the only losers over the last few weeks and, more particularly, out of the comments in the last 24 to 48 hours, are the Australian people. It is not just those 4.7 million people who directly invest or invest through managed funds in the Australian equity markets; it is every Australian worker who has superannuation in the Australian equity markets.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What was their motivation? What has been the motivation of the Australian Labor Party over the last 24 hours? Apart from self&amp;hyphen;interest and base political gain, there is only one motivation: they are trying to derail the Telstra float. They are trying to derail the
         <break page="10084" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          most significant initial public offer in Australia's history. They are trying to derail the float of the company that will be in the top five stocks in Australia, the company that will have over 700,000 investors, the company that is going to be the flagship of Australian interests in New York and around the world—with the net result that all we can assume is that the Labor Party does not understand privatisation.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I notice that the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) is at the table. It was his question yesterday which took politics  to the lowest level possible. What he tried to do, at the expense of 18 million Australians who have everything invested in Telstra, was bring to the attention of the markets, of mums and dads, of investors, the parachute provisions in the prospectus for Telstra. There is only one motivation for that: they want to derail the float.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Mr Deputy Speaker, if you do not believe me on this, I will quote from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I might put this into the context of the current debate within the opposition about privatisation, particularly the current debate about privatisation of Telstra. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition scoffed at suggestions that he was not interested in the current sale of Telstra. Yesterday he said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Of course the Government shouldn't be selling Telstra at
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          all
         </emphasis>
         . If it wasn't selling Telstra at all there wouldn't be this source of anxiety about reduced returns on the sale.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         This is a person who sees himself as Treasurer. He does not care what the asset is worth; he doesn't care about the returns. He says, `We don't have to worry if it remains in government ownership.' He goes on to say:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Obviously they are going to think long and hard about selling into the present down market. We've made our position very clear. Telstra should be in public ownership. The whole exercise has been misconceived, and the hopes for windfall gains from this are now likely not to be realised in the present environment. The Government's only got itself to blame for creating expectations that the world is now not going to satisfy.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         There is only one explanation for that statement: Gareth Evans is taking the Australian political scene to the lowest level by cheating the Australian public, by cheating the 700,000
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          investors in Telstra and by cheating the equity markets.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In the middle of the battle within the opposition about privatisation they cannot come to terms with what their real policy is. You can imagine Kim Beazley's photo album. In 10 years time he is sitting down with his family and showing them his photo album. He says, `Here I am in 1989 standing outside AIDC headquarters. Look at it. I was selling that.' AIDC headquarters: he had a bit of a problem. `In 1996 I had to buy it back. In 1991 here I am standing outside the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, a proud institution, a great institution. We were selling only 29 per cent.' And then in 1993 there he is with his arms around Ralph Willis, smiling in front of the camera.

         By asking that question yesterday, the member for Canberra was smart enough to know that the vendors in the sale are not in any position to sell to the Australian people the significant benefits of the sale. The vendor, the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey), is not in a position to talk up the sale in the way that a stockbroker can, because you have to keep referring to the prospectus, and the Corporations Law is very explicit about ramping shares.

I believe that the opposition in this case has severely let down the people they seek to represent.

          —There are some matters of public importance to be discussed here. It is a pity that the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) did not get to discuss them. They are these. We need to talk about the role of the parliament—and question time in particular—as a clearing house of information for the Australian public. It is a very important point in the accountability process.

         It is one that in 1987 you used in ways I will just mention to you in a moment, which nobody told the member for North Sydney about or he would not have got up and made that speech. That is why they got someone who was not here in 1987 to make this speech—because they would have been too embarrassed. They knew what the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the then Leader of the National Party said in 1987 at the time of the stock market crisis. Nothing careful, measured about questions; they were in there trying to whip it up. And we will be referring to that. We never have until now, but we will. We will not be bullied or bluffed out of discharging our responsibility by a government that is sagging in the polls and desperately looking for a diversion from all their woes—their nursing home woes, their unemployment crisis, et cetera. They are looking to change the debate, and this one is not going to fly.

          What was the most important public issue yesterday? We do not need a poll of those of us in here. The media made it absolutely clear it was the situation with the stock market and its consequences for the Australian economy. What was the most important direct public policy matter? The Telstra float. That is the matter that is the immediate financial responsibility of the Australian government. The other issues are important, we want to know what their implications are, but they are not the direct responsibility of the Australian government. It would have been an abrogation of our responsibility had we not raised those matters; it is not that it was irresponsible to raise them.

           it was an unreasonable thing to say, but if your allegation about my question is right this is an outrageous answer, although I did not think it was—`The government is still monitoring it, I assure you,' that is, the Telstra share offer, `on a very regular basis as the market goes through this correction.'

          If you think that the questions asked on Monday by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition about the share market were, as the Treasurer said today, a terrible attempt to use the volatility for political purposes and we should not be using it for sectoral or political partisanship, how do you explain this? On 26 October 1987—this date might be a bit familiar to some of you—the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, asked, `What impact will this have'—that is, the stock market decline—`on Australia's balance of payment and domestic demand?' He went on to ask:

          Of course, he was not using that volatility for sectoral or partisanship purposes; he was asking a socially responsible question. What about when the Leader of the National Party asked a question which, almost verbatim, was the question the Leader of the Opposition asked yesterday:

          What was the response to those questions asked by the Leader of the Opposition on this occasion, by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and others? The Acting Prime Minister, the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer), said, `This is a very serious situation.' He then went on to make the only provocative, over&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;top comment that has been made in this parliament about the economic circumstance. He said, `We've got an economic firestorm in Asia.' That was designed to calm market sentiments. He did that because he thought that, if he did not say something calm, it might be up on the member for North Sydney's black screen in the futures market. So he thought, `I had better say something calm. I will say there is an economic firestorm unravelling.' And today he repeated it, and he is proud of it.

         It was a disgraceful episode in public administration that we witnessed perpetrated by the Australian Labor Party yesterday. It was designed, as I have said, to scuttle the Telstra sale, but what it did was simply undermine some 820,000 applications that had been lodged by about midmorning today by the Australian people. I noted the figures that were given earlier in this debate by the honourable member for North Sydney in respect of the number of shareholders in other large Australian companies. I can say at this point—and there are still some days to go before the retail offer closes—that that figure of 820,000 indicates very clearly what the Australian people think about this great Australian company.

I think it is fair to say—and I am sure even the members opposite would acknowledge this—that there are no associations between the government and the employees of Telstra. In fact, I seem to recall—and I am sure my ministerial colleague who has just entered the chamber, the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) could well recollect—some the antics of the Telstra employees and the communications union prior to the last election when the government very honestly said to the Australian people, `We intend to sell one-third of Telstra.'

         I note the honourable member for Canberra, with his embarrassment, has now left the chamber. He went through 15 minutes of squirming. He tried to go back a decade or more to see if he could get some history that might back him up on all of this. Any trip back through memory lane will not excuse his behaviour or the behaviour of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Opposition and Labor yesterday as they sought to undermine the economy.

They never smile when there are good figures and good news, when the inflation figures come through on a regular basis or when those five reductions the interest rates were in fact discussed in this chamber as a result of the decision of the Reserve Bank over the past 18 months or so. None of that gives any joy to the Labor Party. The only joy the Labor Party gets is when someone is in trouble and when of course yesterday that market correction was taking place. That market correction has been going on for some considerable time.

         But that did not in any shape or form interfere with the demand, both in terms of volume and, dare I say, price, by the institutions both here in Australia and offshore. The institutions have applied for considerably more than the entire shares available at this stage for Telstra and they certainly are not going to get the entire allocation of shares—that has been made clear from the beginning. The demand is there in terms of price because, as at today, more than 94 per cent of those institutions bidding for shares in Telstra are above the high point in the range—and that range, as I am sure all honourable members would know, is between $2.80 and $3.30.

We saw a performance by the Democrats which contained within it the usual amount of lies. They talked about an $8 billion reduction in the price that the government would get for Telstra. That of course has nothing to do with the facts. It is simply in line with some of the speculation that has never been contributed to by me or anybody in government since this whole process of Telstra started.

We have seen the entire Labor Party from the Leader of the Opposition right through and the Democrats condemned universally—not just by John Short, as the honourable member for Canberra would want us to believe, but by the market. From a number of discussions that I had yesterday—as I indicated, I was monitoring what was occurring in the market—if there was any belief that there might be some sensibility from the Labor Party in terms of economic policy, economic management or otherwise, that responsibility or otherwise went out the door with the approach that was taken yesterday.

It did not work yesterday and, I suspect, despite the blackboard down at the futures market which quotes what might occur in the House from time to time—which keeps the members in the trading rooms informed of what the debate is in this chamber and in other parts of this parliament—there is little likelihood that they will take much notice of anything that is said in the future by the Labor Party because its members are seen to

         When the coalition came into government, it flattened the economy and talked it down. It talked incessantly of the $10 billion deficit, the $10 billion black hole. That talking down of the economy was immensely damaging. What was the truth of the matter? The actual budget outcome for 1995&amp;hyphen;96 was a deficit of $5 billion, about half the figure given by the Treasurer, and the forecast actual budget outcome for 1996&amp;hyphen;97 was not a deficit at all; it was a surplus of $464 million, forecast to grow to a surplus of $6 billion.

         The Treasurer did not want to tell the parliament and the people the truth about that deficit because that did not suit the government's agenda of attacking community services. The Treasurer did not want to talk about the real budget outcomes, he wanted to talk about the underlying budget deficit. As the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) has pointed out previously, the Treasurer's misuse of that term has turned the underlying budget outcome into the lying budget outcome. Even when we look at how this figure was arrived at, we can see that only $0.6 billion of it arose from spending decisions of the former government; the rest came from changes in the parameters. They were lower inflation and lower employment growth.

Their unemployment forecasts showed that over the three years from 1996&amp;hyphen;97 employment growth would be only 5.3 per cent compared with a rise of 8.7 per cent in the three years under the previous government. They were only aiming at 440,000 additional jobs over the first three years compared with the 666,000 additional jobs in Labor's previous three years. That is all they aimed for. It was pitiful.

         Under the existing law, it is possible for corporate groups to multiply capital losses through manipulation of the capital gains tax provisions. This measure removes the benefit of such losses where the loss was created by the rolling over of an asset before 3 p.m. on 29 April 1997. However, losses already used prior to the announcement of the measure at 3 p.m. on 29 April 1997 will not be affected. These provisions will not apply to small businesses as defined in the provisions relating to the capital gains tax rollover relief for small businesses. They would also not apply to certain assets used both before and after the rollover in manufacturing businesses.

This amendment will apply to losses and debts incurred in the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 income year and later income years. The two concessional tracing rules are the family trust concession and the alternative condition. The family trust concession will apply when a family trust holds an interest

         This bill will change the company tax instalment system to allow small companies and other small instalment taxpayers to pay their likely tax on 15 December following their income year and to pay the balance of their tax liability on the following 15 March. Corresponding dates will apply for taxpayers that balance on dates other than 30 June. Consequential changes to the date for classification as small, medium or large will also be made. These measures will allow small companies extra time to meet their income tax obligations and will also ensure that the classification of an instalment taxpayer can be based on their most recent year's income tax return.

         The bill proposes amendments to the income tax law in relation to the capital gains tax cost base provisions. These amendments were announced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on 13 May 1997 as part of the government's 1997&amp;hyphen;98 budget. The bill will ensure that taxpayers will no longer be able to include amounts of expenditure as part of the cost base or indexed cost base of an asset to the extent that the expenditure is deductible.

          The amendments are consistent with the principle that an item of expenditure should be either deductible for income tax purposes or included in the capital gains tax cost base of an underlying asset, but not both.

The new formulae, which were developed in consultation with the insurance industry, will exclude from a company's passive income only the income derived on assets that are referrable to insurance policies owned by non&amp;hyphen;residents that are not related to the company.

         This amendment replaces schedule 4. I also table the supplementary explanatory memorandum.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The amendment to the  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997  substitutes a new substant of schedule 4 which contains a new schedule 1 to the Native Title Act 1993 referred to in the definition of `scheduled interest'. Generally speaking, the existing Native Title Act only provides a framework for dealing with native title. It says little about whether or where native title may still exist in Australia and, apart from the very limited validation provisions in division 2 of part 2, it says nothing about whether native title may or may not have been extinguished. The act leaves these issues to be determined by the common law, an approach which has given rise to significant uncertainty for native title claimants and the holders of other interests in land.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The purpose of the proposed amendments dealing with confirmation of extinguishment of native title is to limit this uncertainty. The types of leases included in the schedule are leases which the Commonwealth and the relevant state or territory believe with reasonable certainty have provided exclusive possession and have, therefore, extinguished native title. The government believes that the grant of a right conferring exclusive possession has extinguished native title on the basis of Mabo No. 2 and Wik.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The grant on or before 23 December 1996 of a lease that appears in the schedule will be a `previous exclusive possession act' because of the operation of a new subparagraph 23B(2)(c)(i). A state or territory may legislate to confirm that previous exclusive possession acts attributable to it extinguish native title to the land or waters in relation to which the act takes place. This is based on new section 23E.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         By operation of the new section 237A, such previous exclusive possession acts will have permanently extinguished all native title to the area covered by the act. The schedule princi
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          pally contains specific types of residential, commercial, community purpose and agricultural leases. If there was significant doubt about whether a type of lease conferred a right of exclusive possession, it has not been included in the schedule. There are no pastoral leases in the schedule, nor are there lesser interests, such as licences or permits. The definition of a scheduled interest in section 249C expressly excludes mining leases. Neither the Commonwealth nor the Australian Capital Territory have included any leases in the schedule.

         The Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund heard evidence that the total area that would be covered by the schedule is less than 7.7 per cent of the total area of Australia. This represents approximately 5.8 per cent of New South Wales, 7.4 per cent of South Australia, 22.3 per cent of Queensland and 0.37 per cent of Western Australia. The areas in the Northern Territory and Victoria are less than one per cent of the total area of each jurisdiction.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A draft of the schedule was made available to representatives of both the pastoral and mining industries and indigenous interests on 20 August 1997. Discussions were held subsequently with representatives of ATSIC and the National Indigenous Working Group on Native Title, which resulted in a number of lease purposes being removed before the schedule was released publicly on 23 September. The schedule moved as an amendment is the same as that released and circulated on 23 September, apart from the following. As a result of representations by indigenous groups, the reference to tillage leases granted under the Western Australia Land Regulations 1851 has been removed. The leases contained a reservation for Aboriginal access.

         The government has taken an option laden with the potential for litigation and massive compensation. The decision to declare that previous exclusive possession acts permanently extinguish native title is a policy decision. It is not the law. It does not derive from the common law, where the less invasive notion of suppression for the term of an inconsistent grant would allow for the revival of native title. It claims to offer certainty by listing in a schedule grants of interest that this legislation declares to have permanently extin

         Where did this schedule come from? Public servants produced a list of criteria which they say could amount to permanent extinguishment of native title. The state and territory governments put forward wish lists of legislation which they hope might fit the criteria. The state and Commonwealth public servants applied the criteria, and presto! We had a schedule of interests that the minister declares to have permanently extinguished native title. No need for the courts; we can do it by administrative fiat.

         Some of the more outrageous try-ons have been excluded from earlier exposure drafts, but I reiterate that they can be put back in at a later date, as long as they have the numbers in the Senate. The schedule introduced today differs from that released on 23 September 1997, and that is conceded by the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams). Could it be that the government has read the minority report of the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund? I note that it is the Western Australian tillage leases issued under its Land Regulations 1859, cited by the minority as an example of an instrument falsely represented as granting a right to exclusive possession, that has been withdrawn from the latest version of the schedule.

         The problem lies, in part, in the method used in deriving this schedule. Consultation was scant. Chief Justice Brennan and others made it clear in the Wik decision that at common law the test for determining the effect of an interest in land on native title involves, among other things, an examination of the grant document, be it a lease, title deed or whatever.

          The creators of this schedule have not looked at any individual lease or title documents. They have simply applied their general criteria to hundreds of pieces of colonial and post&amp;hyphen;colonial legislation and summarily declared them as instruments that have permanently extinguished Native Title. Accordingly, the extinguishing effects of the grants allegedly derived from instruments in the schedule bear no relation to their effect in common law.

          —As the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams) stated a very short time ago, the Native Title Act 1993 currently says very little about whether or where native title may still exist in Australia and, apart from the validation provisions in division 2 of part 2, it says nothing about
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           whether native title may or may not have been extinguished. This is an enormous problem in terms of some sense of security and understanding of what rights Aboriginal people have in Australia today. The Native Title Act generally leaves the issues to be determined by common law. This has given rise to significant uncertainty.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The purpose of the proposed amendments dealing with confirmation of extinguishment of native title is to limit this uncertainty. The main effect will be to allow the states and territories to confirm that native title is extinguished on exclusive tenures such as freehold and residential leases and extinguished to the extent of any inconsistency on non&amp;hyphen;exclusive agricultural and non&amp;hyphen;exclusive pastoral leases.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         An argument has been made that this approach pre&amp;hyphen;empts the common law. However, to leave these issues to be determined on a case&amp;hyphen;by&amp;hyphen;case basis by the courts has the following implications: cost and uncertainty arising from involving potentially many thousands of respondents to claims; so long as there is a question about the legal status of particular tenures, the Registrar of the NNTT is not able to reject a claim on that basis; and whether claims are registered or not, there can be no certainty under the Native Title Act, as currently drafted, about the capacity of governments to carry out future activity until there is a judicial determination.

         This would be an immensely expensive and time consuming process and, on the basis of Wik, this massive expenditure of generally public resources would deliver nothing tangible to Aboriginal people. From the government's point of view, such a massive expenditure for no or very little tangible benefit for Aboriginal people cannot be justified. It is, in fact, a cruel diversion. Expenditure should be directed to determining where native title does exist and protecting the rights of the holders, not to confirming where it has been extinguished. That is just time wasting.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The opposition has suggested that exclusive possession is not the appropriate test. The majority in Wik was made up of four separate judgments. There are some differences between the majority justices so it is difficult to

          establish what the majority test is. However, the grant of exclusive possession remains the major indicator of an implied intention to plainly and clearly extinguish native title.

         The bill also allows states and territories to confirm that the vesting of land in persons has extinguished native title. That is in subsections 23B(3), (4) and (5). This is vesting of particular lands or waters by or under legislation of a state or a territory. This provision is not intended to catch the acquisition of sovereignty by the Crown over any part of Australia which would fly in the face of the Mabo No. 2 and Wik decisions. Nor is it intended to catch the simple management of crown land by a government. It is not intended to catch the creation of national parks or reservation of land generally or for a purpose. The vesting is limited to where exclusive possession has been given to a person, including a statutory authority—subsection 23B(3)—or where what is vested in a person is clearly equivalent to exclusive possession—subsections 23B(4) and (5).

         The court held in Wik that there may have been some level of extinguishment of native title rights by the grant of a pastoral lease. Justice Kirby stated:

         The bill adopts this very test. Section 237A provides that the extinguishment of native title is permanent. It has been said that this pre&amp;hyphen;empts and perhaps goes beyond the common law. Three judges of the High Court stated that extinguishment is permanent; four judges left the issue unresolved. It is the view of this government that to leave this issue unresolved adds to the already considerable uncertainty surrounding native title and land management in Australia.

         There is no clearer example of that overreach than in these provisions dealing with purported confirmation of extinguishment where previously exclusive possession has been granted. On the face of it, that looks a thoroughly innocuous set of provisions implementing a principle which is well established at common law and about which there is no argument—that if there is exclusive possession in some form of tenure that has been granted in the past, that is an end to the matter. For better or worse, so far as native title is concerned, it has disappeared.

         Schedule 4 is the main body of the new amending legislation which purports to deal with this. My colleague the member for Banks (Mr Melham) has already explained some of the problems that are related to that particular schedule and all the overreach that is involved with it. I want to refer specifically to another part of this enterprise which overreaches so far as so&amp;hyphen;called confirmation is concerned and that is in relation to crown freehold. Many interests in land are vested in the Crown in one capacity or another. National parks, state forests and defence reserves are clear examples.

         Under the Native Title Act 1993, grants of freehold and leasehold title from the Crown in one capacity to the Crown in another capacity—for example, the Crown in right of a state to the Crown in right of Commonwealth, or from the Crown in right of a state to a particular statutory authority version of that Crown—these sorts of transactions expressly did not permanently extinguish native title. They were called `category D past acts' in the jargon of the act, and it was up for subsequent judgment about what precisely their effect would be. At worst, they simply suppressed native title to the extent of any inconsistent enjoyment; they did not override it to the extent of permanent extinguishment.

         We now have, however, under the new regime in this amending legislation, a situation where Crown to Crown grants of a whole variety of characters will achieve the absolute extinguishment of the native title rights in question—and, in fact, do so permanently, just as Robert French of the Native Title Tribunal, as the minority report points out on page 68, has expressed very real concern about the impact of this provision on national parks in Western Australia, where the land is

         Other problems of this kind arise in relation to defence grants of land in the Northern Territory.

          —A further point of concern for the Opposition involving overreach in this legislation goes to point 4 of the so&amp;hyphen;called 10&amp;hyphen;point plan—the issue of coexistence between pastoral leaseholders, native titleholders and claimants.

         This is an area in which the National Party has a lot to be ashamed of, in particular the dissident noisy ones up in the corner there who have gone absolutely beyond any reasonable constraint in arguing for the absolute extinguishment of any remaining rights of native titleholders in relation to pastoral leases. They showed their colours with the amendments that were moved earlier on today.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I make the point very clearly that it is reasonable for this legislation to meet the reasonable expectations of pastoralists and farmers so far as the use of their land is concerned. Had the legislation remained unamended after the Wik case it would be the case, as was pointed out earlier on by the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman), that the existing regime would imply or would require compulsory acquisition right to negotiate for a lot of forms of additional diversification activity on pastoral leases which had traditionally been allowable provided a proper process was gone through with the state authorities of seeking permits and decisions in good faith being made.

          too far. It is one thing to address that kind of concern, but another thing to introduce a wholly new regime that gives across&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;board, open slather, carte blanche approval for, in effect, pastoral leaseholders to engage in any activity which is describable as constituting primary production within the meaning of the Income Tax Act.

         Ian Viner QC, the Deputy Chairperson of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, commented in his evidence to the minority committee about the inappropriateness of using legislation intended to define tax deductibility to enable the accomplishment of the extinguishment of native title.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Let us not be in any doubt about what is involved here. If exclusive possession acts of one kind or another, exclusive possession activity, is allowed on pastoral leases in a way that is inconsistent with the full enjoyment of native title rights, we effectively are looking at a situation of permanent extinguishment. There are some circumstances in which the non&amp;hyphen;extinguishment principle is supposed to apply, but in others the overreach potential of the legislation is self&amp;hyphen;evident. There is a particular concern about that, so far as we are concerned, and we want it addressed properly in the legislation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another concern that we have is about the way in which the pastoral lease primary production permissible activities extend to adjoining land, with the pastoralist able to obtain a permit to do all sorts of things on adjoining land without any requirement to involve native title holders in any way, shape or form, which can significantly prejudice their capacity to advance their native title interests. The question is: what is to be done about this situation? It is not a matter of sitting with the status quo in the legislation. That is not going to work. I have made that clear enough in my own discussions with the farm organisations. But, equally, it is not good enough to contemplate going down the path the government is going without significant modification.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We will be pursuing this in a lot more detail than is mapped in the minority committee report when the bill comes to the committee stage discussion in the Senate. We pro
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          pose a situation which has these characteristics: so far as basic pastoral activities are concerned—understood in their fullest possible connotation—we agree that no pastoralist should have to go through a right to negotiate process to carry out any activity which is permissible under his or her lease where that opportunity has been taken up. The act ought to make that perfectly clear.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Equally, at the other end of the scale, when what is being sought is a formal upgrade for all practical purposes of the title in question or the activity is such that it can only properly be carried out with such a formal upgrade, we say then that the compulsory acquisition/right to negotiate provisions should apply where there is no ready agreement reached between the parties. For all of that very large range of activity that occurs in the middle—where a pastoralist, for example, wants to put in a grape block or a cotton block or wants to engage in some diversity of his agricultural activity—where a pastoralist might in the past have reasonably been expected to get permission from the state or territory authorities to do so, we say it is fair enough that there be even this kind of radical change in land use. But here there should be an appropriate recognition of native title holders' procedural rights. There should be some notification; there should be some consultation; and there certainly should be respect for heritage considerations. It is possible to find a workable, balanced regime in this area.

          . The purpose of proposed division 2A is to validate certain kinds of interests created and acts done in the period between 1 January 1994 when the Native Title Act commenced and the date of the Wik decision on 23 December 1996. The justification is that these interests were created and acts done on the assumption that governments were free to do various acts over pastoral leases and other leasehold land, including converting it to freehold, without following the processes of the NTA. As a consequence of this belief, acts were done

         The preamble to the Native Title Act stated—and the whole world believed—that native title was extinguished by pastoral leases. However, the Wik decision proved this was not the case. The government does not believe that invalidity is the appropriate consequence for acts done on the basis of a legitimate assumption subsequently proved wrong. The ALP is totally hypocritical in this matter because, all the way through the debate over the original native title bill, they predicated their debate on the basis that native title was extinguished by pastoral leases.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The acts to be validated were done on the assumption that governments were free to do various acts over pastoral lease and other leasehold land without following the processes of the Native Title Act. This was an assumption supported by the decision of the High Court in Mabo (No. 2), by many statements of the former government, by the Native Title Act itself, by the practices of the National Native Title Tribunal and by decisions of the Federal Court. It is clear that the assumption that pastoral leases had extinguished native title was one which would legitimately have been held and one which was encouraged by the former government.

         Even so, a number of jurisdictions have changed their practice in relation to future acts. Queensland, South Australia and New South Wales originally used a `Swiss cheese' approach to granting exploration licences which excluded areas from the licence which might be subject to native title. Following the unanimous High Court decision that the Land (Titles and Traditional Usage) Act 1993 was invalid in March 1995, Western Australia commenced issuing section 29 notices in relation to exploration, mining and compulsory acquisitions on behalf of third parties. South Australia's alternative future act regime in relation to mining and compulsory acquisitions, along with its ability to determine native title claims, commenced operation in June 1996 following Commonwealth approval.

          tially more limited than the existing NTA validation provisions, which potentially apply to all government acts since Australia has settled. Proposed division 2A only covers acts and grants done on land in relation to which it was reasonable to assume that native title had been extinguished. It does not extend to acts done on land only previously the subject of a licence or reservation or which has always been vacant crown land. It also does not extend to invalid acts consisting of the making of legislation except where the legislation itself directly creates an estate or makes a grant or reservation.

         The document prepared by the National Indigenous Working Group rejected `blanket validation' and suggested that some categories of grant which have no compelling urgency or commercial imperatives requiring immediate validation be validated through the future act regime or the proposed regional agreements process. The major objection to this proposal is purely a legal one—it is not possible to provide validity through agreements. Even if a legally watertight agreement were obtained with native title holders not to challenge the legality of the grant, the beneficiaries of the invalid grant or title would remain vulnerable to legal action from any other person with interests affected by the grant—such as trespass where, for example, an exploration permit is given over a pastoral lease—because the grant itself would remain invalid.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The option of including a statutory validation provision but making it dependent on the satisfactory negotiation of an agreement would necessarily result in an effective veto for native title claimants in relation to mines and developments already under way. There would be a serious question about the legal status of these acts in the period before an agreement, even if the agreement were done on a government&amp;hyphen;representative body basis.

         It has also been argued that the effect of the proposed validation provisions in relation to public works will be to extinguish native title on the whole of the area of the tenure on which the work was built. This is incorrect. The effect of the validation of a public work is to extinguish all native title `in relation to
         <break page="10132" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          the lands or waters on which the public work concerned (on completion of its construction or establishment) was or is situated'. The concept of `land or waters on which a public work is constructed, established or situated' is defined in section 251D to include any adjacent land or waters `the use of which is or was necessary for, or incidental to, the construction, establishment or operation of the work'. The fact of the matter is that what has been suggested by the other side is simply not correct.

          —The Native Title Act, of course, does not contain adequate mechanisms to manage future acts on pastoral leases, which is a very serious issue and has to be addressed. The bill does that. There are no express provisions in the NTA which allow governments to continue to authorise pastoralists to carry on activities authorised under the lease where additional authority is necessary. There is no provision which states that the rights of the pastoralist prevail over any coexisting native title rights and interests.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Of course, at common law, pastoralists' interests do prevail, as is spelled out in the Wik judgment. The effect of the current NTA provision, however—the Labor legislation—may be to produce the opposite result. That is why this bill is necessary. The definition, for example, of an act affecting native title in the NTA makes it possible that activities done under the authority of a pastoral lease or permit are what we call, under the jargon of the Keating act, `future acts'. The grant of a future right, and even activities related to leases, may therefore become impermissible under the existing Native Title Act because they do not satisfy the freehold test. This has to be addressed and the bill does that. That is why it should be supported.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The definition also of primary production activity in section 24GA is designed to ensure that the NTA does not prevent the full range of activities which pastoralists are currently authorised to undertake on pastoral leases from continuing and that the states and territories are not prevented from exercising their ordinary land management powers to
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          vary land use on pastoral leases as technology and markets change. This bill unlocks that problem and allows for a satisfactory and very fair resolution of that issue which has been caused by the inadequate provisions of the Native Title Act passed by the Labor government.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In some jurisdictions, a range of activities is permitted expressly by the lease, while in others some additional activities require further permission. The bill allows permits for additional activities on pastoral leases to continue to be granted, but ensures that native title rights are only suppressed, but not extinguished, by such grants. It is a very fair provision. Off&amp;hyphen;farm activities directly relating to primary production may also be carried on in areas adjoining or near to agricultural or pastoral leases or freehold estates notwithstanding the existence of native title. Why should adjoining properties be blighted where there is a claim for native title? It is an extraordinary proposition and it should not be allowed to continue. It needs to be addressed and is addressed in the bill.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Under the amendments, pastoralists are able to carry on any activity authorised under their lease without reference to native title holders, which is section 24GC. This is consistent with the Wik decision that pastoral lease rights prevail over native title rights. If the pastoralist wants to exercise additional rights to those authorised by the lease, it will be necessary to obtain whatever legislative or administrative authority is required under the relevant state or territory legislation. If those additional rights come within the definition of primary production activities in the Native Title Act, then those activities can be carried on, but native title is suppressed and not extinguished.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The granting of additional rights cannot convert the lease to one that confers a right of exclusive possession, nor into a freehold estate. Under the current and amended Native Title Act, a state or territory cannot legislate across the board to upgrade pastoral leases to exclusive possession tenures. The only way in which an upgrade to exclusive possession tenure, including a freehold tenure, can be granted is through the surrender of any native title interests by agreement or by compulsory
         <break page="10136" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         Acquisition, of course, if it is occurring, can be done only in a non&amp;hyphen;discriminatory way with all the rights in the land—native title and non&amp;hyphen;native title—being acquired and just compensation paid. Those principles are preserved faithfully in the bill. Whether a particular state or territory can acquire rights for the purpose of a third party is a matter, of course, for the state or territory law. States and territories have indicated to the government, and publicly, that no change to current land management policy is intended in relation to freehold or pastoral leases.

         Let me move on. In the most incredible speech from the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), which was beaten only by one of the previous speakers on the ALP side, he talked about jobs. In North Queensland, Shelbourne Bay, worth $3,000 million a year to the Australian economy, has been held up for 12 years. The Wik claim was to hold up the Weipa expansion program, which was worth $1,000 million to the Australian economy. The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) used the example of

         Not only that, it has raised the bar line. Every time anyone wants to go mining in Australia now they have to parcel out $100 million because an aggressive 24&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old negotiator called Jason Yanner was able to secure $100 million and 3.5 million acres of land. If Jason chooses to use it as a Berlin Wall, stretching from the Gulf of Carpentaria one&amp;hyphen;third down the entire length of Queensland—and he has very anti&amp;hyphen;development attitudes, which is his privilege—then he has a very valuable and powerful weapon.

         The absurdity of the provision is that it will be unnecessary for claimants who already have access and it is unhelpful for those who do not. The government states that access for registered native title claimants to pastoral leases will be guaranteed. This is restrictively qualified, however, by requiring that the claimants regularly had physical access at the date of the Wik decision. This provision has been described by witnesses before the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund as one of the cruellest hoaxes in the amendment bill. The National Indigenous Working Group comment:

         Many Aboriginal people have access to pastoral leases and good relationships with pastoral leaseholders. However, throughout history, many Aboriginal people were forcibly moved from their lands as part of government policy and Aboriginal people are, in some instances, denied access to their traditional lands by pastoralists. If the native title claimants did not enjoy, or were refused, regular physical access to the area up until 23 December 1996, the statutory right of access is not available to them.

         The question of what constitutes regular physical access is not easily answered.

          —In relation to registration tests, most people who are dealing with native title in this country know that there needs to be an effective registration test to ensure that only claims with merit are registered on the register of native title claims to prevent overlapping and multiple claims by members of the same group or others who are simply vexatious or have major ambit claims. Too many of us have seen the sad situation which emerges when it is almost impossible for one group to have a just outcome when multiple claims arrive one after another, day after day, as others compete to have the same rights as those who are most likely to succeed.

         Under our bill, a physical connection requirement is to be found in subsection 190B(7).

         The restriction on the registration of overlapping claims has been criticised by some for not taking account of customary law. The intention of the provision is not to ignore the possibility of more than one traditional group having customary rights to an area—we know that was sometimes the case traditionally—but to reduce multiple claims by the members of the same claim group for the same area. Where it becomes likely that a claim in an application will not satisfy the registration test, it is anticipated that the claimants would seek to amend the claim under section 64. Subsection 64(3) specifically provides that claims may be amended even while the registrar is considering them under section 190A.

Following the High Court's decision in Wik, concern was expressed by some indigenous groups that some lessees may attempt to prevent native title claimants who have regularly had access to the lessee's land for the purpose of conducting traditional ceremonies from continuing that access. At the same time, concern was also expressed by some pastoralists that native title claimants who had not previously had access to pastoral land would, after Wik, attempt to access the pastoral lease land.

         In creating a statutory access rights regime, the government's intention was to preserve the status quo on pastoral lease land, subject to a registered native title claim pending the determination of that claim. It was not the government's intention to decide whether members of a native title claim group have native title rights of access to pastoral lease land, as that is an issue for the court to decide when it makes a determination of native title. Statutory access rights are only interim rights.

To expand the statutory access rights regime in this way would, in effect, clearly change the status quo. Furthermore, the suggestion is impractical. Litigation would inevitably be required in order to determine whether native title claimants were unlawfully locked out of their traditional lands.

         Calls by the National Indigenous Working Group to provide in the Native Title Act a general right of access without the necessity of a claim are completely at odds with the intention behind the statutory access rights provisions. Firstly, it would be entirely inappropriate for the Commonwealth to legislate in the Native Title Act in relation to general rights of access to pastoral land wholly unrelated to native title issues. Secondly, such a proposal would completely change the status quo. It is not the government's intention to decide who should or should not have access to pastoral lease land. That is a matter for state and territory governments.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The National Indigenous Working Group has suggested that the intention behind section 44C is to prevent the enforcement of common law access rights. This is not true. Section 44C proposes that, where a person has statutory access rights in relation to a pastoral lease, no other person can enforce native title rights in relation to the lease. This does not include rights under the Native Title Act. Where members of a native title claim group enjoy statutory access rights, other persons who claim native title to that lease should also make a claim under the Native Title Act. If that claim is registered, then those members of the claim group who had access as at 23 December 1996 will have a right under the Native Title Act to continue that access.

It is sensible and just that the court should determine all the native title rights in relation to an area of land, not just the rights of one group.

No application for compensation is allowed to be made later than six years from either the time when the amendment act commences or the time when the act is done, whichever is later—section 50(2A).

          —The comments made on the sunset clause by the member for Banks (Mr Melham) invite me to rebut what he said. He has gravely misunderstood the purpose of the sunset clause and its operation. The sunset clause actually provides a time limit of six years for making an application for a determination of native title under the Native Title Act. This applies to applications covering areas which have not been the subject of any previous approved determination of native title—I emphasise the word `approved'. The limitation period, therefore, does not apply to applications for a revised determination of native title, but the circumstances in which these applications can be made are restricted by limiting those who may make these applications under subsection 13(4). The limitation period runs from the date that new subsection 13(1A) takes effect.

         The member for Banks certainly has some misunderstanding surrounding the effect of proposed subsection 13(1A). I would like to clear that misunderstanding up now. The sunset period only applies in relation to the making of applications under the act—I emphasise `under the act'. It does not prevent native title claims being made under the common law either before or after the sunset clause. That is a very important point.

Of course, if you went the extra distance and knocked off common law claims as well, as the National Party is urging us to do, not only do we say that is indefensible in principle but also it would instantly involve the Commonwealth in having to deal with a potentially massive compensation payout claim because of the acquisition of property rights without just terms having been given.

I, for one, without going into the procedural aspects of the right to negotiate, acknowledge that the right to negotiate the particular threshold test or registration test which triggers a capacity to exercise that right is not something that has worked well under the present legislation. There is no doubt that it was not our intent in 1993 to have an open&amp;hyphen;ended capacity to access that right to negotiate, but the way in which the test has been applied by the courts, tribunals and registrar has made it, for all practical purposes, a worthless form of filter.

         In looking at the right to negotiate procedure proposals, again the member for Murray provided data on this this morning: 1,910 tenements have been submitted to the RTN procedures; only 148 have been cleared for lodgment of a section 34 agreement and over 1,700 remain outstanding.

          —This Native Title Amendment Bill in its current form is of no use to any of the major stakeholders, due to the galloping uncertainty to which it gives rise. The bill is a recipe for uncertainty. It is a blueprint for anyone who wants to halt developments or tie up all interested parties in the courts into the indefinite future. It is providing certainty and workability to nobody. The 1993 legislation was seeking to provide a less complex, more accessible, more cost&amp;hyphen;effective alternative to the common law remedies. But this bill is going to turn claimants back to the common law.

         There is general agreement that some aspects of the act require improvement: the Brandy amendments are necessary; workable registration tests ought to be reintroduced following the court decisions reading it down; we should have provision made to address overlapping and multiple native title determination applications; and pastoralists' rights need to be particularised and confirmed.

         But what do we have here? We have unworkable complexity. We have the government proposing to replace a 127&amp;hyphen;page act with a 293&amp;hyphen;page bill and a 385&amp;hyphen;page explanatory memorandum.

         There are agreements reached with indigenous people all around the world. It is just a standard form of operation. It does not even have to be indigenous people.

First the Mabo decision and secondly the Wik decision have made it clear that they do have legally enforceable property rights. If we choose to confiscate those property rights, then they have an entitlement to compensation. That is already clear.

It will give rise to litigation for years to come and the prospect of all of the parties being worse off.

           —Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Prior to the last division a number of members left the chamber. My recollection is that at the conclusion of the second last division you called upon all members to take their seats. I probably got the best part of 150 metres away after leaving the chamber and then returned when the bells rang only to discover that a one&amp;hyphen;minute bell had been in fact ordered by yourself. About 15 members were precluded from voting at the last division. They were not successive divisions, as I understand it. There was debate between the second last division and the last. About four minutes elapsed and, Mr Deputy Speaker, your call for one&amp;hyphen;minute bells prevented some 15 members, as I estimate it, from being present and voting. I would like that to be noted, because I believe members were prevented from doing their duty.

I was unfortunately one of the members who was precluded from voting on the last division, with about 15 members of the coalition, including many ministers, because you created the impression that there were not to be successive divisions by saying that members should return to their seats or quickly leave the chamber. I think that is what you said.

Seeing as you are going to discuss this matter with the Speaker, and seeing as you and the Speaker may canvass that ruling, I would ask that you might also canvass with the Speaker a ruling that you made which was exactly the same as that some time ago and which I think was probably the precedent for this issue rather than any other.

          —One of the greatest achievements of the Whitlam Labor government was the establishment of community health centres. In announcing the creation of community health centres in the budget in 1973, the then Treasurer, Frank Crean, stated that they would be `regionally organised, community based health services, with their emphasis on rehabilitation and preventative rather than curative health measures'. This program was a new approach to health care in Australia which examined for the first time the impact that environmental and social factors have on a person's health.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Community health centres were the Whitlam government's response to the 1972 May report of the Interim Committee on Hospitals and Health Services entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          A community health program for Australia
         </emphasis>
         . The then Minister for Health, Dr Everingham, stated:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The program should provide the required impetus for the establishment of much needed, but often overlooked, community based health services and should encourage communities and regions to examine their own needs and priorities and to express them to the relevant health authorities.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         Community health centres have traditionally taken a holistic approach to medicine with direct service provision and the wider issues of community development, education, preventive health care and self-help. Because they were administered by and accountable to the community, the centres aimed to empower local communities and individuals and offered them the opportunity to determine their own needs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Whitlam government recognised that there needed to be a federal approach on the issue of community based medicine. This was in part due to the Labor Party's strong belief in the role that the Commonwealth has to play in these matters. However, it was to a large extent a matter of necessity, given the parlous state of health services in the states
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          after long periods of conservative government in most of them.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Regrettably, the Fraser government attempted to sabotage the scheme by handing over community health centres to the states, failing to appreciate why the Commonwealth had taken action in the first place. This has meant that over the years community health centres have fallen victim to the economic rationalist ideologies that have gripped the nation. An emphasis on preventive medicine and community development to help avoid illness is a concept that an economic rationalist has great difficulty comprehending. The idea that money can be spent now to prevent far greater expenditures and social problems in the future just does not fit into the economic rationalist paradigm. Seeing the world as a series of budget bottom lines fails to appreciate the role of community health.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There have been, and continue to be, attempts by various state governments to take the community out of community health. In Victoria this June, the Kennett government replaced the elected committees of community health centres with government appointed bodies. In addition, the state government has created a number of regional health networks consisting of the hospitals and other health service providers in a particular region. These networks tender to the government to provide health services. The concepts of competitive tendering and block funding have taken their toll on community health centres. Local community health centres in the area I represent understand that they must cooperate with these networks in the delivery of health services. They are willing to examine the ways to achieve this required cooperation; however, some of the models under consideration threaten the very existence of community health itself.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Currently, the five community health centres in the north&amp;hyphen;eastern region of Melbourne—Eltham, Plenty Valley, Banyule, East Preston and Northcote—have formed an alliance and are considering proposals for their future. One of the proposals, and the preferred option, is for the retention of individual services with the creation of a coordinating body to look at planning issues and
         <break page="10156" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          service provision issues. Another option is for the complete amalgamation of all five into one—either as part of the local regional health network or with an administrative body of its own.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, such regionalisation of community health would mean that they have a different regional focus and would not have the ability to take into account specific local community needs and interests. This would mean that, if it was under the regional network, the regional network board would run the community health centres with only local advisory committees. However, advisory committees are exactly that—advisory. They have no real power. This model has already been accepted in one network in Victoria. By becoming just another part of the regional network, the community health centres lose an integral part of the reason for their success—the community involvement.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am concerned that the network or the amalgamation models could be adopted by the alliance of the five north&amp;hyphen;eastern community health centres. This would be a disaster for the people of the north&amp;hyphen;eastern region of Melbourne, and the amalgamation/network option should be unconditionally scrapped.

          —I wish to speak tonight on a matter of great importance in the lives of Western Australians. The state government in WA has decided to investigate the benefits of relocating the WA Police Academy, including opportunities to improve the quality of training and resource usage.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Western Australia suffers from an unsatisfactory high level of crime of various kinds, and many citizens, especially older citizens, have come to feel captives in their own homes. The WA police force has worked hard within the limited resources that are made available to it but suffers from shortages of manpower relative to the size of the task it faces.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A reliable supply of well trained and high quality police men and women is absolutely essential if we are to win the fight against crime in Western Australia. I have recently seen an expression of interest for the co&amp;hyphen;location of the WA Police Academy with Edith Cowan University and the North Metropolitan College of TAFE.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I have read the expression of interest and am very supportive of the concept. I will draw from some of the key parts of that submission to explain the great benefits that the people of Western Australia will no doubt get if the state government adopts this proposal.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The location of a high quality police academy alongside two prominent education and training institutions in the heart of Perth's second city will be a source of pride for the police service and the wider community. The sheer size and strength of the ECU-North Metropolitan College partnership will facilitate access to a range of facilities and services that will add enormous value to the operations of the WA police service.

         ECU is the second largest university in Western Australia, with over 19,000 students enrolled and operating from five major campuses with total assets in excess of $300 million and an annual operating budget of
         <break page="10157" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          $150 million. The Joondalup campus has 4,100 students and a capacity to grow to 20,000.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The university is a member of the unified national system of Australian universities and its awards are recognised nationally and internationally. Rigorous accreditation procedures are utilised by the university to assure quality and ongoing professional recognition of programs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The North Metropolitan College currently provides vocational education and training services to just over 47,000 students at its three major campuses. The college offers a wide range of programs in business studies, management—including police studies—office technology and so on.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For the past 15 years, ECU and the North Metropolitan College have successfully integrated police specific education and training into mainstream university and TAFE programs. The concept of a strategic alliance, where the three partners coexist in a region that has a strong shared vision, will help to establish a reputation both nationally and internationally. It will attract funds, applicants and attention from police and other law enforcement organisations to the region. The strategic alliance can expect to hold policing conferences in shared facilities and attract senior police from all over the southern hemisphere.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The key advantages of the WA police service co-locating with ECU and the college in the city of Joondalup can be summarised in four categories: prime location and development opportunities, educational synergies through the strategic alliance, optimisation of infrastructure and capital works development, and community immigration.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Joondalup, one of Australia's fastest growing population centres, offers an ideal environment for sustained growth. The location of a police academy in Joondalup will place it in a vibrant city centre with a number of advantages including: easy access to transportation systems for both public and private systems including fast track rail and the Mitchell Freeway—Joondalup is only 26 kilometres from the Perth CBD—competitively priced land with full services and single commercial
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          zoning of the city precinct to allow a multiplicity of use; a high profile image and community recognition; an excellent working environment with new open city planning and business campus precincts; convenience parking; a comprehensive and widening base of businesses, services and amenities; quality building developments; and a thoroughly designed management plan with a vision that balances residential, educational, recreational, business and commercial development.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The breadth of activity in a co&amp;hyphen;located facility will create a nexus between training and research which will counteract training decay, a situation highlighted in the Wood royal commission into the New South Wales police force. The college is the only TAFE in WA to contribute to the nationally accredited Certificate 4 in Policing and the Diploma in Policing by providing manoeuvres in management and cultural interaction. Similarly, ECU is the only WA based university that offers higher education courses in police status.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The university also offers postgraduate research and course work in justice studies, forensic psychology, addiction studies and security studies. The centre for police research, located on Joondalup campus, undertakes independent research on matters relating to policing.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I have written to the Minister for Police to express my very strong support for this concept. I hope that the minister will give the Joondalup community the opportunity to become involved in this project. I am absolutely convinced that the co&amp;hyphen;locating of the WA police academy in Joondalup with the ECU and the North Metropolitan College of TAFE is the most sensible option for the state government to follow. It will bring tremendous benefits to the region and because of its obvious advantages will allow us to produce the highest quality police officers for the resources available. All Western Australians will benefit from that. I will give whatever help I can to the partners of the proposed strategic alliance or the state government to make this proposal a reality.

Without even discussing it with me, without even having the common courtesy to let me know what he was going to do—you never know, I might have supported him—he snuck out while I was in the Main Committee getting ready to debate the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill, which is important to people in my electorate and in his electorate, like the gutter rat that he is because he is not sticking up for the industry.

But it did not stop the Labor members wandering around the electorate and up to the chicken growers, putting their hands out, looking for the dollars, taking their dollars and putting ads in the paper saying, `We will support you.'

The minister has continued the very good tradition of his predecessors by making available to the opposition briefings on the issues that come before the parliament and we greatly appreciate that. The level of cooperation that has come both from the minister's own office and from the Australian Customs Service has been superb. Our questions have been answered and staff have been made available to talk to me from both your personal office and the Australian Customs Service. Where there are issues of greater significance involving other shadow ministers, that opportunity has also been taken and we certainly greatly appreciate it.

         To make the minister's day even more, we will not be opposing the speedy passage of this legislation through the House either. This is another selection of bills dealing with issues arising out of the High Court decision that was taken some few months ago now where a challenge was launched by somebody from New South Wales about the validity of state governments to collect excise on tobacco and alcohol products and also petrol.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As a result of that, for a short period there was a mild panic in the states as to where their revenue base was going to go. I think I detected a slight smile on the face of the federal Treasurer (Mr Costello) about his increased opportunity to perhaps direct the states in certain ways. But, at the end of the day, accommodation was found and even my own state of New South Wales—although late to come to the party—certainly jumped on board and an arrangement has been put in place which will satisfy the state government and our federal government at large.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bills collectively propose to amend the temporary Commonwealth tax safety net arrangements concerning tobacco which were implemented after the High Court invalidated the business franchise fees levied by the states and territories in relation to tobacco, alcohol and petrol. The customs and excise bills propose new arrangements for the taxation of tobacco. Prior to the High Court decision, tobacco was taxed under Commonwealth excise, which taxes
         <break page="10163" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          on the basis of weight, and state franchise fees, which taxes on the basis of the value of the products.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The original safety net arrangement involved an increase in the Commonwealth excise of $167 per kilogram. This significantly altered the taxation of various tobacco products. This in turn would have flowed into significant alterations to retail prices and would have affected the relative profits of the manufacturers.

         I think one of the issues that is of great concern to us all will be that monitoring process and the effect that this will have on consumers. I think we all know that at different times, if changed taxation arrangements of some nature are put in place by governments, there is always the temptation by people who are involved in the retailing of some of those products affected by the changed taxation arrangements to perhaps tinker at the edges and go for some form of increased profit taking as a result of that.

        <para first-indent="16">
         What I am pleased by is the fact that the minister is responsible for not only Customs—and therefore this legislation—but also consumer affairs. So in that respect he has that added responsibility and capability to be able to monitor this from a consumer's perspective as well. He can just keep a tab on ensuring that there is no adverse effect on consumers by profit taking or some other means of trying to walk around this system, as we have put it in place, simply because there is a change.

         We will also be monitoring the paperwork requirements for retailers and wholesalers in complying with the new regulations, because we are ever mindful of commitments given by the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard)—when he was the Leader of the Opposition and, more recently, as Prime Minister—to the small business community of this country. The commitment was that, during a very short period of time, there would be a 50 per cent reduction in the burden of paperwork on small businesses. Any changes that affect the retailing of these products brought about by changed circumstances necessitated by the passage of this legislation will, in some respects, have an impact on those compliance costs associated with the small businesses retailing these products.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We are mindful of the fact that the Prime Minister gave an ironclad guarantee to the small business community that those compliance costs and the burden of paperwork would be slashed by 50 per cent. Regrettably, what we have seen through the passage of various other pieces
         <break page="10164" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          of legislation since this government was elected last year is that, in fact, just the opposite has occurred. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, you know that the  Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997  was debated last night in the House. In the course of those laws, there was a section relevant to the capital gains tax rollovers for small businesses. Once again, an increased compliance cost situation arose in respect of that in our view. Again, this is against the spirit of what the Prime Minister had intended.

         I go also to the new requirements under superannuation. Small business proprietors now must offer their employees a choice of five superannuation funds and give explicit financial advice to those small business employees that they have as to what each of those funds are offering. So they become de facto financial advisers to their employees. I dare say that there is the potential at some stage down the track for employers to actually be sued by those employees if their advice goes awry. I would have thought that those sorts of compliance cost issues tied in, as I have suggested, with what may emerge as a result of the passage of this legislation, because it is changing the actual methodology and calculation of the way in which the excise is applied and may have a similar effect.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So we will be watching those two issues closely. Firstly, we will be watching the consumer issue which I think will be monitored by the minister because of his dual role in this area. Secondly, we will also be looking at the burden of paperwork and how it falls on those small businesses that are caught by these changes to the legislation.

         At the end of the day, as I said at the outset, the opposition does not oppose this legislation. We are up to Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997  and  Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997  arising out of the High Court decision. I know there have also been some other tariff proposals tabled in the parliament, and I dare say that they will be coming forward as legislation at some stage down the track, similarly picking up on some of the elements contained in that High Court decision.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Once again I suggest that, subject to the legislation itself, the opposition would have no objection to that. It is simply fixing up a situation that has arisen as a result of a decision taken in the High Court—one which is to the benefit of consumers, hopefully, and to the benefit of the state governments. After all we cannot see, in the absence of a broader approach to taxation reform, the states having their revenue base slashed any further by this government and still expect the states to deliver the sorts of services that people expect to have delivered to them. It is quite interesting that that sort of view is not alone here in Australia.

         We seem to be on this particular path—whether it is because of changes in customs tariffs or excise tariffs amendments which we are dealing with today or whether it is because of changes to the way in which the taxation system is to be reviewed or whatever—that somehow if the Commonwealth gets out of that field, then private enterprise may pick it up or if they do not because of our system of federal government the states or local government may pick up those services. I think that is a mistaken philosophy.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I recently had the opportunity to visit New Zealand for two days and I was staggered to see that that government, in its similar quest for the bottom line, for having its budget certainly if not in balance then in surplus, was cutting back on the services that it provided from a reduced taxation background. It was cutting back on the services that it was charged with the responsibility for providing and yet asking private enterprise to pick up many of those services.

         The very common criticism that I was getting—from both sides of the parliament, which is in itself interesting, and from talking to people more generally in that country—was that

          people felt that in social security services provision, housing, road maintenance and all of those sorts of things the government simply was not doing the right thing but was obsessed with the bottom line, obsessed with the taxation arrangements that it had put in place.

         We would like to think that whatever taxation reform package this government brings forward, after the deliberations of its secret committee on this issue, it does get a very public and thorough airing. There is no doubt that we would like to participate in that process, but at this stage, like most others in the Australian community, we have been frozen out. Any of those broader views of taxation reform particularly where it involves changes to state and territory based sources of revenue—because, at the end of day, that is a major contentious point of argument still—needs to take into consideration things like the legislative base for what is being dealt with here today.

         I see my good friend the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) is here and he, from his Legislative Assembly background in the Northern Territory, knows full well that when changes occur, as a result of changes at the federal level, to the way in which revenues are distributed to the states and territories that places an onerous burden on the states and territories. They are expected to pick revenue up from other sources of revenue raising, from additional taxes or whatever it might be.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I hope that the taxation reform proposal that might emerge out of the deliberations of that committee—closeted away down in Treasury, PM&amp;C or wherever they might be—will take into consideration, as part of that broader reform process, the sorts of issues we are dealing with here and the reasons we are having to deal with this legislation today. I conclude by reaffirming that the opposition does not oppose the passage of this legislation. We wish it speedy passage through this chamber and also through the Senate.

          . What these bills collectively propose to do is to amend the temporary Commonwealth tax safety net arrangements concerning tobacco which were implemented after the High Court invalidated the business franchise fees levied by the states in relation to tobacco, alcohol and petrol.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The customs and excise bills propose new arrangements for the taxation of tobacco. As members will be aware, prior to the High Court decision, tobacco and tobacco products were taxed under Commonwealth excise, which taxes on the basis of weight, and the state franchise fees, which tax on the basis of the value of the products. The total taxation regime on tobacco was an amalgam of both a weight based tax and a value based tax.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Leaving aside arguments about whether the taxation situation which existed prior to the High Court's ruling was the optimal situation or not, the fact remains that the industry was operating on that basis. Given the high rate of tax payable on tobacco products, any substantial alteration to the taxation regime can be expected to have potentially significant commercial effects. The changes flow into the wholesale and retail prices of various products, and the relative profits of the industry participants therefore vary considerably.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Estimates put to the opposition by some members of the industry were that the annual effects of a change to only weight based taxation would be of the order of around $30 million per
         <break page="10166" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          annum. A change of this magnitude would obviously have potentially significant employment impacts, especially in some regional areas.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government knew about this problem when it enacted the original safety net arrangements. However, as further evidence of the government's poor planning prior to the High Court decision, no arrangements had been agreed with the states to overcome the problem and so allow a smooth transition to the new Commonwealth only tax regime. Instead, what we got was an increase in the Commonwealth excise of $167 per kilogram. This level of increase in excise was too high to merely replace the revenue lost from the state tobacco taxes which were invalidated.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In addition, the use of the excise base introduced these commercial distortions relative to the prior situation. The new proposals are going to replace the weight based system with a combined weight based and ad valorem or value based system which equates as far as possible with the situation prior to the High Court's decision.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The changes in these bills are complex and involve the replacement of the $167 increase with the options of, firstly, a hybrid rate based on a combination of a weight based rate per kilogram of 50.32 per cent of the gazetted wholesale list price for a particular product or, secondly, a solely weight based duty rate only where no wholesale list price has been gazetted.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Under the particular arrangements applying under customs and excise legislation, changes which are properly gazetted come into effect before the relevant legislation is passed by the parliament. The changes in these two bills were gazetted on 16 September and have operated since 17 September. Those bills merely formalise the decisions which have been operating for the previous six weeks.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The changes under the customs and excise bill will result in a decrease of $288 million in revenue. There is, however, no actual net financial effect on the Commonwealth because all of the moneys which are collected under the safety net arrangements of the collection and other administrative costs incurred by the Commonwealth are then passed on to the states and territories. A decrease in the gross level of collections does not affect the financial position of the Commonwealth as the decrease is completely offset by a similar reduction in the grants passed on to the states.

        <para first-indent="16">

         I also thank the member for Cunningham for his kind comments on my appointment to the ministry. I assure him, in his absence, that as minister I certainly will continue the practice of predecessors to ensure that the opposition is well briefed on matters that come before the parliament. I think it is a very important aspect of the parliamentary process that all members of parliament, including opposition members, are well informed about the issues.

          Hopefully, by adopting an open house and an attitude that will result in the opposition being aware of what the issues are, we may win their support on other occasions in the future. I acknowledge, however, that from time to time there will be reasons for them to oppose legislation. Of course, we respect their right and their obligation in some circumstances to do that. I am certainly anxious to work with the honourable member for Cunningham or any successors as shadow minister for customs to ensure that legislation has a smooth passage through the House wherever possible.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The member for Cunningham raised a couple of issues which I would like to comment on. One was not of great substance. He mentioned that this was the fifth piece of legislation arising out of the High Court decision and I suspect he gained that impression because this was  Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997 , but in fact some of the earlier bills were not related to High Court matters. I think this is actually the third piece of legislation arising out of the High Court decision. But, certainly, that decision has required a response from the government and we have always indicated a willingness to work with the states to achieve a satisfactory outcome following that decision.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The member for Cunningham also made some observations in relation to the importance of reducing paperwork for small business and he referred to the commitment by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for the government to do what it can to reduce the paper burden on small business. There have been a number of very significant initiatives by the government to reduce paperwork. Of course, everyone in small business would acknowledge that it is perhaps state and local governments that are responsible for the majority of the paperwork imposed on their operations. But the Commonwealth has been prepared to act and has demonstrated its willingness to act wherever it can. There have already been a number of initiatives which will reduce paperwork for small business.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Ironically, one of the effects of this particular piece of legislation, although not the prime purpose, is that it will have a major impact on reducing small business paperwork. For those who had been associated with the old franchise fees, they will no longer have to fill out any of the paperwork associated with those taxes which the High Court has ruled to be unconstitutional. Retailers will have no paperwork associated with this new measure and I think they will welcome the simplicity, from their point of view, of this new measure. So from the point of view of paperwork, there will actually be advances as part of this legislation.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The member for Cunningham also referred to the importance of dealing with the questions of state revenue as part of the tax reform process that the federal government is currently undertaking. Obviously, vertical fiscal imbalance will be on the agenda. It must be on the agenda in dealing with the future taxation regime that our nation wants to put in place for the next century. Those are the sorts of issues which will be under consideration by the government in that process.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I notice that he felt that he was being excluded. I can assure him that the government would welcome contributions by the opposition to tax debate. It is probably time we heard some of their ideas about how the tax system should be reformed, other than their only contribution to date which I understand has been on death duties, which is one that is not attractive to the government side, I can tell you. But if you have worthwhile ideas and would like to contribute to the debate, we are looking forward to hearing them.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          To summarise, this legislation is supported by both sides of the House and by all of the states, and I welcome its speedy passage. The bill will change the way in which excise duties
          <break page="10168" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           and customs duties in relation to bill No. 5 are levied on certain tobacco products, and will lead to a system which, as the honourable member for Wills says, is a little more complicated but more closely replicates the arrangements that existed previously. The arrangements will shift from a solely weight based surcharge to one based on both weight and value. There will be some revenue loss to the states associated with this measure, but the fact that they have unanimously supported these new arrangements demonstrates that they are prepared to accept those changes. So I commend the bill to the Main Committee.

This bill is directly related to the previous two revenue bills which we were just discussing, but it was not possible to cognately debate them, hence this brief separate debate. I therefore will not canvass again the changes to the customs and excise regime that have caused this bill to come forward.

         Under these on&amp;hyphen;passing arrangements relating to the safety net package, each state and territory receives a separate fixed share of the safety net revenue for tobacco, petroleum and alcohol, arising from the new government impost on each of these products. The bill proposes to alter the shares of the individual states and territories for the tobacco payments only. The changes have been agreed to by all the states and territories and hence are not opposed by

         The bill is also seeking authority to set any future changes to the distribution of alcohol, tobacco and petrol revenues by regulation to avoid the need for additional legislation.

         In the case where a future alteration of the relativities has been agreed to by all the states and territories, that is a proper situation in which a regulation could be appropriate to set the agreed relativities. Where there is not agreement—for example, where a change would be manifestly unfair to one or other of the states—the regulation would, of course, be disallowable in either the House or the Senate. Decisions relating to disallowance would have to be made, depending on the particular circumstances obtaining at the time. It is not possible to set down now the opposition's future position on particular questions that may arise. I merely make the point that there is an option for disallowance if necessary by the parliament.

         The Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) mentioned in the previous debate the issue of paperwork, and he suggested that this might be an advance on the paperwork front. The opposition queries this, and it occurs to us that one downside of the new regime is that the paperwork of small businesses may be increased due to the system of rebates paid by the state and territory governments to offset the new uniform Commonwealth taxes. The opposition will be closely monitoring these systems to ensure to the best of our ability that the burden of paperwork does not become unreasonable. We are mindful of the government's promise to halve the paperwork burden for small business—a promise which has been spectacularly broken by the government. I note that the minister for customs was starting to talk about the states and local governments having responsibility for the red tape burden on small business.

          . The measures contained in this bill are to counter the result of the High Court ruling on 5 August this year, which found that the New South Wales franchise fee on tobacco was constitutionally invalid. The Northern Territory government requested legal advice on their own position, advice which confirmed that the Territory's business franchise fees on tobacco were also invalid. Similar fees on alcohol and petroleum were also deemed to be constitutionally questionable and, in light of the tobacco ruling, probably invalid. This caused enormous fiscal uncertainty for the states and territories. They relied on these fees to the tune of some $5 billion per year, which constituted between 15 and 17 per cent of their total taxation revenue.

         The Treasurer of the Northern Territory, the Hon. Mike Reed MLA, wrote to the federal Treasurer, along with the other state treasurers, to request the urgent assistance of the
         <break page="10170" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Commonwealth in order to resolve these problems. To its credit, the Commonwealth acted quickly to put in place a safety net arrangement to ensure that the states and territories could  avoid the serious budgetary implications posed by the decision. I know the Northern Territory government appreciated the speed with which the Commonwealth implemented the alternative collection strategy.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The provisions of the safety net allow for the Commonwealth to use its taxation powers to collect, on behalf of the states, the revenue the states used to collect on petroleum products, tobacco and alcohol. The safety net arrangements had two parts. The first aspect was that the Commonwealth levies were increased on products formerly covered by business franchise fees. As the constitution requires, the Commonwealth has to apply taxes uniformly across the country. Therefore, the differing tax rates that the states and the territories had in place could not be taken as a guide for each jurisdiction.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As a consequence, the safety net rates were higher in some states than previously collected under the business franchise fees. Where the Commonwealth surcharge was greater than the Territory business franchise fees, the Territory government offered subsidies to wholesalers who did not increase their prices in line with the Commonwealth levy. The Territory government also gave priority to ensuring that motorists, including off&amp;hyphen;road users, were not disadvantaged and that the prices of petroleum products and tobacco products would not increase. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission was called in to monitor the movement of prices of these products to ensure that they did not increase needlessly.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second aspect of the safety net arrangements was the introduction of a windfall gains tax to protect state and territory budgets from refund claims in respect of past business franchise fee payments. The windfall gains tax will apply at a rate of 100 per cent and has been imposed by the Commonwealth at the request of the states and territories. Any revenue gained by the Commonwealth through windfall gains tax will be reimbursed to the states and the territories.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The windfall tax applies to refunds sought by taxpayers for payments made before 5 August 1997. The government will ensure that the introduction of the windfall gains tax does not result in double taxation effect. The revenues collected from the Commonwealth's replacement of business franchise fees are reimbursed back to the states and territories, less Commonwealth administrative costs, as revenue replacement payments under the States Grants (General Purposes) Act 1994. The method and distribution of the revenue is as formulated and agreed by the states and territories and set out in a schedule to the act. These shares are based on the Commonwealth Grants Commission estimates of 1996&amp;hyphen;1997 business franchise fee revenue bases. These arrangements will be reviewed by the states and territories in six months.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1997 has two main purposes. Firstly, the bill will introduce a request by the states and territories to adjust their share of revenue replacement payments for tobacco as established under the current safety net arrangements. Secondly, it will allow future changes in state and territory revenue replacement shares to be made by regulation rather than by legislative amendment. The states have requested that the Commonwealth alter the shares for tobacco related payments as a part of the new arrangements for the taxation of tobacco under the provisions of the safety net.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Due to the difficulties of administering a rebate for tobacco, the states and territories have negotiated their own package with the tobacco industry. This new arrangement would see a

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The federal government will be introducing a separate bill in order to deal with the revenue side of these new arrangements, although a surcharge rate is expected to reduce by $290 million the surcharge on tobacco resulting in a revenue of around $3 billion in a full year. The lower rate of revenue collected on tobacco could have resulted in some states being worse off financially because of the High Court decision. The states have therefore requested the Commonwealth to adjust the distribution of the revenue to ensure that no state is worse off financially than it was before 5 August.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As stated earlier, these arrangements are up for review in six months. By allowing for future changes to be made by regulation rather than legislation it will provide the flexibility which is essential should the states and territories need to alter their existing shares when they review the safety net arrangements after six months. Any change in the share allocation would only happen at the request and unanimous agreement of the states and territories. Consistent with the government's aim to avoid price increases in alcohol and petroleum, this legislation when passed will return tobacco revenue to the states and territories with a minimum of delay.

         One of the most important issues confronting our federation today is the vertical fiscal imbalance that leaves our states and territories in a weaker financial position than the constitution intended.

I understand this policy of a higher level of fiscal independence for the states has strong support. I hope that this issue will be examined in some detail by the government's tax consultative task force, and I expect it might also get some exposure at next year's constitutional convention here in Canberra.

          . It is a decisive, straightforward and sensible measure which picks up the difficulties that were created by the High Court decision on 5 August which affected state business franchise fees, essentially the collection of fees on petroleum products, tobacco and alcoholic beverages. They were matters which went to the heart of states' revenue and, in turn, to the expenditure on so many important and essential services in my electorate by the state government of Queensland.

         This bill gives effect to a straightforward request from the states to alter their share of revenue replacement payments for tobacco under safety net arrangements. It is important to note that there was so much at stake. As the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) and others in this debate have suggested, the vertical fiscal imbalance where essentially the states rely on the Commonwealth for so much of their revenue is something which can be addressed through the course of taxation reform, a debate which is ongoing in this country at the moment. That imbalance has certainly been a fact of life since the state

         The total of general purpose grants to the states in the budget this year totalled $16.83 billion, mainly in the form of financial assistance grants. Obviously, that is a lot of money and it is very important to the various states. As a result of the High Court decision in August there was going to be quite a large hole in the budgets of the various states unless the Commonwealth acted as it is doing in this bill.

         For that reason this bill will pass in this place without any dissension from the opposition, and I welcome their support. Of course, part of the overall planning as far as financial arrangements between the states and the Commonwealth are concerned this year have included the second repayment of some money back to the Commonwealth in the form of fiscal assistance which is a payment, a fiscal contribution, from the states back to the Commonwealth to help mend the $10 billion black hole left by the previous government. The states and the Commonwealth are obviously working very closely, as is evidenced in this bill, on matters relating to financial arrangements.

         I thought it was important to recount to this place just how the Queensland state government has been expending moneys given by the Commonwealth under this legislation, and doing a very good job in the last 18 months. In fact, the Queensland state Treasurer, the Hon. Joan Sheldon, and the Premier, the Hon. Rob Borbidge, said that, despite the High Court ruling in August, Queensland was committed to remaining a low tax state—in fact, the lowest taxing state government in the Commonwealth. There will be no changes to this government policy, and no increases to taxes and charges above the CPI.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Despite the fiscal contribution demands of the Commonwealth, and despite the actions and decisions of the High Court, these challenges are still being very effectively met by the Queensland government. They have been met with a point of greater efficiency in the delivery of services—in fact, the delivery of more services than had been the case under the previous Labor government led by Wayne Goss. There are tax cuts taking place in Queensland: tax cuts for individuals, for land-holders and for small business. There seems to be an ongoing program of announcements, including the largest capital works program ever delivered by a Queensland government.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In fact, the most recent budget by the state government in Queensland has provided record spending with the emphasis on tax cuts, delivery of services, capital works and jobs. It is all about helping business do better, create jobs and reduce the current level of unemployment, particularly among the young. In this regard, I think the Queensland state government should be congratulated for the way it is working with the Commonwealth to ensure the delivery of these very important and straightforward demands of our constituents.

         The Queensland government's recent budget also focused on giving some hope, help and incentive to rural areas devastated by drought and commodity downturns.

         In addition to the demands of the Commonwealth, the Queensland state government has made savings of about half a billion dollars against forward estimates of the previous government for 1996&amp;hyphen;97 and, quite sensibly, it has put those savings back into core services. The budget has delivered 1,000 new teachers, 252 more police, 500 extra doctors, nurses and
         <break page="10173" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          health workers, but, more importantly, 50,000 jobs for Queenslanders. As far as police numbers go, the government is well ahead of its target. There were 6,566 officers in the force at the  end of June 1997, up 160 on the previous year and 21 more than the government had targeted. The commitment to provide the extra 252 police officers this year is certainly going to be met. A further 200 officers are being freed from desk duties.

         On that law and order front, the government has also provided some practical and strong support in the way of legislation to deal with crime. Queensland now has some of the nation's toughest laws with violent criminals to serve at least 80 per cent of their sentence. With respect to juvenile crime, 50 per cent of all motor vehicle thefts were committed by males aged 15 to 19, with 584 offenders aged 14 years or younger. There were 111 sex offenders in the 10 to 14 age group and 189 in the 15 to 19 age group. Despite accounting for only 23 per cent of the total population, offenders in the 10 to 24 age bracket were responsible for 83 per cent of all break and enter crimes. These matters will be dealt with very strongly as a result of the new Juvenile Justice Act, brought in by the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General in Queensland, the Hon. Denver Beanland, MLA.

         As I said, I think the Queensland government, despite the challenges of the High Court, and despite the need to make fiscal contributions back to the Commonwealth to fill in the Beazley black hole, is doing incredibly well. In my own electorate, I am very pleased to see that the Hon. Mike Horan, the health minister, has effected a rebirth of the QEII hospital, which is near the centre of my electorate and is vital to the electorate. To the absolute disgrace of the previous government—which was not facing the sorts of pressures that the current Queensland government is facing in demands from the Commonwealth, in demands from the High Court and, for that matter, the tightness of the numbers in Queensland where the government needs the support of the independent, Mrs Cunningham—it allowed the QEII hospital to run down to the point where it was to be mothballed and closed up.

The national rate is 1.2 per cent, so Queensland is having an ever increasing demand on Commonwealth revenue to ensure that facilities can not only be delivered for the current needs, but also be planned for the future. In the past five years, the population of Queensland grew by 12.7 per cent—more than double the national growth of six per cent.

Queensland migration survey figures indicate that interstate migrants coming to Queensland are more likely than not to be in the 25 to 45 age group.

         It is worth noting that in 1995 the Goss Labor government had a substantial majority but sat on its hands and failed to do so many things. One of the things that governments of all persuasions, though, have failed to do in my electorate is a matter about which I have spoken to the new Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the Hon. Mark Vaile. It is a matter about which I have spoken also to the state transport minister in Queensland, the Hon. Vaughan Johnson, and I have raised it with council officers as well. I refer to the Coopers Plains level crossing over Boundary Road. For the last 25 or 30 years there has been a crying need for this.

         The people of Coopers Plains supported the Goss government very strongly in 1989 and in 1992. They did not in 1995 because they basically thought that after six years of Labor they would have seen results of something that the previous coalition government never quite got around to doing.

         This level crossing has heavy trucks travelling across the main arterial railway line between Brisbane and the Gold Coast. Increased railway passenger usage means that there are many more trains travelling across it now than five years ago. Yet nothing has been done to address the need for a proper, reliable crossing there. People have been killed at this crossing; people have been injured in car and truck accidents. There has been some alleviation and some improvement to the site by changes in signalling made by the city council, but there is still a crying need for major capital works.

         I know that financial assistance grants under the state grants act do go now to assisting with road and infrastructure in the various states, and I certainly look forward to continuing my role in advocating that something be done about the need for this crossing and in ensuring that the federal government plays its role. But there really is a challenge for the state government to plan, in concert with the Brisbane City Council, what it would like to have there. I think that is a challenge that transport minister Vaughan Johnson can take up.

If each of those four good local people—with strong local connections, having been educated and lived for many years in the areas that they would like to represent—is actually elected to the state parliament in Queensland, I know I will have working with me some very strong advocates for those sorts of basic needs.

          In closing, it is important that the Queensland government keep up the good work. Despite the challenges that have been placed on them because of the $10 billion Beazley black hole to make a contribution in a fiscal sense back to the Commonwealth to play its part in paying back this huge budget deficit the Howard government was left with, and despite the fact that the High Court has added to the challenge by saying that they cannot collect what were traditional fees on tobacco, alcohol and petroleum products, I think the Queensland government continues to rise to the challenge and must continue to do so for the benefit of people in my electorate of Moreton.

         But turning to the  States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill (No. 2)  before the House, I am pleased to support this legislation, which came about as a result of the recent High Court decision on franchise fees. I have spoken before about the need for tax reform. I think there are many members on this side of the House that have. Indeed, the government has appointed a committee to look into that—a very strong and very sensible committee. It is opportune to congratulate one person, in particular. Although I do not want to necessarily single anyone out, the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) has been at the forefront of the need for tax reform. I just want to say that a lot of the agenda on tax reform has been very much pushed by the honourable member for O'Connor. I think that he deserves great credit and I am very pleased to see that he is on this committee.

         The High Court decision highlights yet again the incredibly difficult milieu surrounding Commonwealth&amp;hyphen;state relations, in particular on the core issue of tax—the very clumsy system that we seem to have where the Commonwealth collects most of the tax but the states provide most of the services. The particular imbalance that arises by a history of, particularly, legislative measures in the last 50 or so years, the passage of time, the change in orientation generally and a centralist orientated—at times—High Court really has left a noose that was maybe once, a few years ago, maybe 20 or 30 years ago, dangling around the states' necks and has now been tightened more and more. I do not think it bodes well for our future of federation unless we come to terms with the need for tax reform.

         Recently I had a lengthy discussion with a man called Vince Cini, who is the proprietor of a business in Lawnton in my electorate called Pressed Plywood Products. Mr Cini runs a very good business, but over a period of time he explained to me that he does not believe that, the way the system is going, his business can survive much longer.
        </para>
        <break page="10177" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          Only a couple of years ago Vince Cini had 30 staff. He is now down to 11. He pointed out to me during the course of our discussions that a number of other manufacturers that he is aware of in the same business have been experiencing a similar problem, one particular manufacturer in recent times having cut its work force down from 85 to 25.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          He told me about his business. Basically, what he does is make moulds. He illustrated this by referring to an example. Right in this room there are numerous chairs and in those chairs are ply mouldings. His company makes those ply mouldings. He does a very good job of it. He showed me an example of his work and then he showed me an example of some imports. The imports are only marginally cheaper, although obviously the price of the product in bulk is a lot less. But there is no doubt in my mind that the imported product is grossly inferior in every way to the Australian product, and in particular to his product.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I said to him, `We need to change the tax system, don't we?' He said something to me which I think has been forgotten in this debate. He said, `You've got to have wealth first. You cannot tax something that is not there. You've got to actually be making money for tax to be drawn on that profit.' I thought that was a very good, simple point, because you cannot talk about tax in a vacuum. He said, `You start with a business making money.' The thing that you have to look at in all of that is the question of business inputs.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          When he started discussing this, I then reflected on the Commonwealth, state and local government interaction in respect of the cost of business inputs and the effect that all of this has on people who are in a very small operation, but nonetheless a large one in terms of what this man is producing. He spoke of various things. One particular matter he mentioned was the environmental levy. He uses very user&amp;hyphen;friendly environmental materials. He uses plantation forest timber and a water&amp;hyphen;based glue for gluing the ply and he has the machinery to effect the gluing of the ply.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I inspected the factory last week and I could not detect anything in the nature of an offensive smell. It was a very pleasant and clean environment and yet he has been charged $700 per annum environmental levy, when the gluing product he is using—which is the major product concerned said to be sufficient to attract that levy—is a 99 per cent organic product. Seven hundred dollars may not sound much, but you have to add it to the myriad of other business inputs and then reflect on why this is happening. Why is a levy like that put on such a business? It is dragging down his competitiveness and making him less competitive with that inferior product.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The reason has to be that there is this problem with our tax system which is causing more and more little levies and additions to spring up. I need not go into payroll tax. That is yet another one which certainly has to be redressed, because that is a tax on employment. Again, that is another one of those things which forces his input cost up and makes him less competitive. Indeed, he has got to a stage where he has been made offers by overseas interests to move his factory lock, stock and barrel overseas and been offered very attractive terms for doing so. It is a real worry. There were 30 people working there a couple of years ago; there are 11 now. There may not be any more soon. It is important that we address these inputs. The cost of workers compensation is an extraordinary impost. He told me about the cost of that.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I am the first to say that workers have to be protected. I do believe in common law rights; I do not believe in the system of workers compensation at fixed rates and no common law action. However, having said that, my experience of doing workers compensation cases over
          <break page="10178" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           the years was that the workers compensation board was the most inefficient organisation that you could possibly imagine. Cases where liability screamed out at you would not be settled until you were at the door of the court. All of the costs involved in that procedure were incurred along the way. The $30,000 or $40,000 in legal costs could have been avoided if the board had taken a more realistic approach.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The government that was elected in Queensland in 1996 has certainly redressed a lot of that and has streamlined the board. Nonetheless, that has a very marked effect on Mr Cini's business, along with those matters that I have referred to. There are a number of other things too, but all of these things make his business less competitive and less able to deal with the imports.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Then Mr Cini told me this story, which was extraordinary. He became aware of a particular company that was buying these mouldings, and the company buying the mouldings had bought them from England. The product was inferior and it was marginally more expensive than what he was making them for. Eventually the English company got very interested and said, `Look, you can make them cheaper. Why don't you do it?' So he said, `Yes, I will. I can supply you.' So some negotiations took place. Then the UK government put a 45 per cent tariff on his item.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          So it really is quite extraordinary. I could go on for a long time about this particular issue, but I guess it is all bound up with the fact that we do need reform of our tax system to help those small businesses. The question has been asked before whether, if this tax system is fixed up—we need to do it, and do it quickly and do it in a bipartisan way—we would have a problem with tariffs. I think there are a lot of people who take the view that, if our system were fixed up, we would be producing things at a better rate and be much more competitive because of the lower cost of inputs. So I support the measures but, yet again, ring the bell on tax reform for this country. I hope that the bell is heard by those on the other side who, to date, have used it often for political purposes.

          —in reply—First, I will thank the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas), the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) and the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) for their contributions to this debate. Both sides of the House recognise the importance of doing something in respect of the High Court ruling on 5 August 1997, when challenges were launched in the cases of Ha and Walter Hammond and Associates against the New South Wales franchise fees on tobacco. It involved around $5.2 billion of tax revenue to the states. Clearly, there had to be an arrangement made.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Following the High Court ruling in that decision, the states and territories unanimously approached the Commonwealth—I just want to emphasise the fact that it was a unanimous approach by the states and territories to the Commonwealth—with a request for a safety net. The Commonwealth agreed to that request. I guess we could have said no, but commonsense in these matters means that there should be an arrangement worked out. I want to emphasise a few matters that relate to the safety net requested by the states and territories involved, because I know that the debate has been reasonably wide ranging and not directly on this particular matter, and that is fair enough in the  States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997  debate. In encapsulating the ideas in regard to this bill specifically, I would like to go through some details.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The safety net which was requested by the states and territories involved four things: firstly, a surcharge being placed on Commonwealth taxes on alcohol, tobacco and petroleum;
         <break page="10179" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          secondly, surcharge revenues being forwarded to the states and territories less an amount to cover the Commonwealth for admin costs; thirdly, the surcharge revenue being distributed to the states and territories on the basis of distribution shares requested by them and set out in a schedule to the States Grants (General Purposes) Act 1994; and, fourthly, a windfall gains tax at the rate of 100 per cent so as to protect the states and territories from refund claims.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The safety net arrangements are intended to be temporary and will be reviewed within six months. With regard to tobacco, there were a lot of complexities in this particular issue, and the safety net arrangements involved an increase of $167 per kilogram in the customs and excise duty on tobacco products. This weight based tax surcharge differed from the state and territory systems which were based on value. So there were complexities which came out of that.

         The Commonwealth, states and territories have separately held extensive discussions with the tobacco industry and agreement was reached between the states and territories and the industry and most of the details were announced by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) on 11 September.

          —I was making some comments about tobacco and the difference between the way in which the states and the Commonwealth were levying the charges, excise and so forth. The Commonwealth and states and territories have separately held very extensive discussions with the tobacco industry, and an agreement was reached between the states and territories and the industry. Most of the details were announced by the Treasurer on 11 September.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That agreement included three key points. Firstly, the tax take from tobacco products on behalf of states and territories would be cut from a full year amount of $3.261 billion to $2.973 billion. Secondly, the states and territories would not pay rebates to consumers to compensate for the increase in the outgoing amount of revenue being collected from the tobacco. Thirdly, a hybrid weight based ad valorem surcharge would be introduced so as to make for a taxation system which more closely modelled state and territory franchise fees. Following the Commonwealth government's acceptance of a request by the states and territories to implement these arrangements, they were put into place by the Australian Customs Service.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another aspect to the legislation is the regulation making power. The bill also seeks to allow future changes in tobacco, petroleum or alcohol revenues to be prescribed by regulation. This will provide flexibility, should the review of the safety net arrangements to be conducted within six months give rise to further requests by the states to alter the existing shares. In practice, any change to the distribution of tobacco, petroleum or alcohol revenues, would be unanimously requested by the states.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In regard to price rises, there has been some comment about price rises and I will make a few brief background comments. There was some criticism of recent arrangements reached between the states and territories and the tobacco industry and announced on 11 September. This was because it was accompanied by predictions of a 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent increase in tobacco prices, reflecting the fact that no rebates would be paid while the gross state and territory take from tobacco would increase from $2.885 billion to $2.973 billion in a full year. However, the initial safety net arrangements—involving a revenue target of $3.261 billion, some states refusing to pay rebates and the others having no suitable rebate arrangement in place—could have seen even higher increases in tobacco prices.
        </para>
        <break page="10180" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          There is little the Commonwealth can do to force prices down. All of the money raised on behalf of the states and territories is being returned to them except for a small amount for administrative costs. The responsibility for addressing price rises therefore rests with the state governments. I want to underline that fact, that any price increases rest with the state governments, not with the Commonwealth government. The Commonwealth is constitutionally prohibited from requiring that the states pay a rebate as this would run the risk of being seen by the High Court as discriminatory taxation.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Concerning the new taxation arrangement, the initial safety net arrangements involved a customs and excise duty surcharge on tobacco and tobacco products of $167 per kilogram. This has been replaced by a choice of three options. Firstly, there is a hybrid option involving an ad valorem surcharge of 50.32 per cent of the final wholesale list price, which includes both the total weight based duty and the ad valorem component along with a weight based duty surcharge of $2.65 per kilogram. Secondly, there is a solely weight based duty surcharge of $147.90 per kilogram where there are no more than 1,200 cigarettes per kilogram. Thirdly, there is a solely weight based duty surcharge of $265.73 per kilogram where there are no more than 1,200 cigarettes per kilogram

The main aspect is to introduce from 5 January 1998 a guaranteed minimum interest subsidy of 1&amp;half; per cent compared to the benchmark market rate.

         The opposition does not oppose the bill, which will benefit some 52,000 veterans. We view the government's measures, however, as clearly being a case of too little too late. I have to say it is not Robinson Crusoe in regards to activities in this portfolio. As we have witnessed over the last year, we have had months of delay regarding disability pension changes.

         The provision of housing loans to veterans with war service has a long history in the Australian repatriation system, dating back to 1919 in the immediate aftermath of World War I. The concept of war service loans is one that enjoys ready understanding and strong support in the community.

         The details of the scheme are now somewhat complex. Eligibility is generally based on the veteran having operational service overseas. Between December 1972 and May 1985, the scheme was also used as the mechanism to provide home purchase assistance to regular personnel serving in the ADF. Whilst many retain eligibility from this period, people joining the ADF after 14 May 1985 are eligible for assistance under the defence home owner scheme, which commenced operation in January 1991.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Loans under the scheme are on a fixed rate basis, and borrowers in similar circumstances can be paying different rates of interest on their loan, depending on when they took out their loan. As well, loans taken out between December 1974 and December 1988 generally contained two or three so&amp;hyphen;called tiers, with a different interest rate applying to each tier. Separate arrangements, and a higher rate of interest, have also applied to additional loan advances or advances for essential repairs to the home.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For many years the scheme was administered by the Defence Services Homes Corporation, a Commonwealth statutory authority. In October 1988 the Hawke government announced that it had sold the existing defence service homes portfolio and the right to provide future war service loans to Westpac, for some $1.4 billion. The corporation was then wound up.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Under the arrangements that have applied since that sale, the Department of Veterans' Affairs issues certificates of entitlement to veterans qualified to receive subsidised loans. The department then pays an interest rate subsidy to Westpac, based on the difference between the DSH loan rate paid by borrowers and the benchmark market rate of mortgage rates charged
         <break page="10182" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          by the five biggest banks. This subsidy arrangement is the key to this bill, and I will return to it shortly.

        <para first-indent="16">
         For the vast majority of DSH borrowers the effective interest rate on their loan is 6.85 per cent, even if the actual loan contains several tiers. This rate has been in force since October 1980, some 17 years. Over the intervening period, there have been many changes in both the cost of housing and home loan interest rates. The fixed rate nature of the scheme has provided veterans with a secure arrangement that protected them from fluctuations and the boom and bust cycle that has impacted on the general community. At the same time, however, it has also restricted the ability of the scheme to adapt to changing needs and circumstances.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Reserve Bank data shows that in October 1980, when the 6.85 per cent DSH rate came into effect, market mortgage rates for owner occupied housing stood at 10.5 per cent. This meant that borrowers taking out a loan at that time were, effectively, obtaining an interest rate subsidy from the government of 3.65 percentage points.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the intervening period, however, such mortgage rates have varied from 17 per cent to 6.7 per cent, implying an interest rate subsidy to DSH borrowers of between 10.15 per cent and minus 0.15 percentage points. During the 13 years of the Labor government, the effective interest rate subsidy on a 6.85 per cent DSH loan never fell below 1.9 per cent. Under the coalition, since August this year the main DSH rate has actually been higher than the variable mortgage rate charged by the private banks.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I acknowledge that the above comparison is based on a different market benchmark than that contained in DVA's agreement with Westpac. My figures are based on official Reserve Bank monthly data on the bank's new variable rate housing loans for owner occupation, which has been consistently applied for the 17&amp;hyphen;year period examined by the opposition. Similar times series data on movements in the benchmark rate applied under the DVA&amp;hyphen;Westpac agreement are not available to us.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Whilst borrowers are most unlikely to be unhappy about recent falls in interest rates, veterans with a DSH loan have good reason to be dissatisfied with the government's performance. On the one hand, we have seen the Treasurer (Mr Costello) rightly demanding that the private banks pass onto their customers, in full and without delay, welcome falls in official interest rates. On the other hand, for months the same government pretended that these falls had no implications for its own war service loans scheme.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A cursory examination of the budget papers reveals the explanation for the coalition's inaction. At the time of the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 budget—the coalition's first—the interest rate subsidy payable to Westpac for the scheme was estimated to be $49.7 million. In fact, the actual subsidy paid to Westpac that year was only $30.2 million and the estimate for this financial year a mere $22.1 million. These figures clearly show that, over the past year, the coalition has been pocketing the savings on the interest rate subsidy to Westpac, rather than passing these savings on to borrowers, who are the veterans it is supposed to be helping into home ownership.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These figures provide the context for an honest examination of the government's package of measures contained in the bill. What we see is veterans having to wait until next January to receive what is, in effect, a cut in interest rates of a mere 1.22 percentage points—from 6.85 per cent to 5.63 per cent, based on the DSH benchmark rate currently being 7.13 per cent. As I say, they have to wait until January in a situation where there have been marked interest rate
         <break page="10183" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          reductions over a very significant period of time and the concessional nature of the loans has been severely undermined.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Interestingly, I note that the Treasurer gave other borrowers firm advice on how to assess the appropriateness of the interest rates they were paying. According to an AAP report of 30 July 1997, he said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I say to the small business proprietors of Australia, you should today be paying two and a half per cent less for your business loans than you were a year ago.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         The opposition's main concerns are thus both the delay in passing on any cut in DSH rates and the actual amount of the reduction. As I mentioned earlier, at no time under the previous government did the effective interest rate subsidy fall below 1.9 percentage points, whereas the coalition is providing a `guaranteed' subsidy of 1.5 percentage points, starting next January.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I stress that the opposition has no objection to the overall design of the measures contained in the bill. The concept of providing a guaranteed subsidy that will apply within a certain interest rate band is a sound one, as this overcomes in&amp;hyphen;built obstacles to making frequent amendments to the legislation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I also welcome the fact that the bill effectively converts tiered loans into a single rate or so&amp;hyphen;called blended loan, with the interest rate being either 3.75 per cent, 4.5 per cent or 6.85 per cent—the latter, of course, will be further reduced under the guaranteed subsidy arrangement. I know from callers to my office that many veterans with two or three tiers to their home loans found it hard to understand the effective total rate applying to them. Many with 10 per cent tiers also expressed frustration that they could not pay out a single tier of the loan, when they saw private lenders offering loans at a much lower rate. These people will be the particular beneficiaries of the bill. Having one single interest rate per loan and no&amp;hyphen;one paying more than 6.85 per cent—further reduced by the guaranteed subsidy—are worthwhile measures, which I am happy to acknowledge.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Ex&amp;hyphen;service organisations have approached me as shadow minister about other concerns they have about the defence service home loan scheme. It is notable that the groups representing Vietnam veterans have shown particular interest in the scheme, as their membership is more likely to be contemplating a home purchase.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The most frequent concern is, of course, the fact that the $25,000 maximum limit for a loan has not been increased since 1980. Over the intervening time, there have been astronomical increases in housing prices, particularly in major cities like Sydney. In that housing market, $25,000 is more like a deposit than a realistic housing loan. Veterans also hide the fact that the maximum loan available to serving ADF personnel under the defence home owner scheme is now $80,000. Whilst I acknowledge that the design of the two schemes is radically different, there is clearly a degree of inequity in the treatment given to those with war service. I would seek an assurance from the minister that the government will review the $25,000 upper limit in the near future.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To be able to purchase a proper home, veterans are effectively required to take out both a subsidised DSH loan and an unsubsidised market mortgage. In this regard, Vietnam veterans have expressed concern at the fact that the DSH rules insist on holding the first mortgage. This appears to have the effect of locking veterans out of the growing and generally cheaper non&amp;hyphen;banking loan sector. This sector generally restricts its lending to first mortgages, putting veterans with a DSH loan at a particular disadvantage. It has even been suggested to me that some veterans are actually financially better off, in the short term at least, taking out a full
         <break page="10184" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          mortgage on a low interest rate with one of the non&amp;hyphen;bank lenders than taking up the $25,000 DSH loan topped up with a second mortgage from Westpac or another bank. I would be interested to hear the minister's response to this aspect.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Finally, I would like to express concern that new DSH borrowers, while likely to be these younger veterans, as those with Vietnam service, are to be hit with a $4 per month account maintenance fee from Westpac. This fee is not included in this bill, presumably because it is to be imposed administratively by Westpac. Whilst the minister claims that this fee represents a 50 per cent discount on the fee that Westpac imposes on other borrowers, it is disappointing that the government has not taken a stronger approach in negotiations with Westpac. As a result, new borrowers will lose $48 a year from the benefits provided by this bill. I reiterate that the opposition does not oppose the bill and will not delay its passage through parliament. We remain disappointed, however, with the timing and amount of the rate cuts announced by the government and seek action on other outstanding concerns about the scheme. I look forward to hearing the minister's response to our concerns.

         In 1972, just after the Vietnam War, its name was changed to the defence service homes scheme to recognise the extension of eligibility to those with qualifying peacetime service. The defence service housing scheme provides financial benefits in recognition of the contribution of certain men and women who have served in the Australian Defence Force in either peace or wartime. The benefits include housing loan subsidies and other housing related benefits such as comprehensive home owners insurance cover at competitive rates.

         Defence service housing borrowers who are suffering serious financial hardships also have access to a range of additional benefits, including assistance with essential repairs and a reduction in instalments. In 1985 the government decided to sell the defence service housing mortgage portfolio to the Westpac Banking Corporation, who then became the scheme's lender, in December 1988. The Commonwealth's responsibility under the defence service housing act for the administration of the defence service housing subsidy scheme and the defence service housing insurance scheme rests with the secretary to the Department of Veterans' Affairs.

         The maximum home loan is $25,000, with the borrower currently paying the government's subsidised interest rate of 6.85 per cent. I would suggest to members and to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) that perhaps that amount needs to be revisited given the cost of housing today. The amount of subsidy the government pays is calculated on monthly, and based on the average of, standard variable home loan interest rates offered by the five major banks, which is currently at 7.13 per cent per annum.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The impact of falling interest rates has meant that defence service housing borrowers are no longer deriving any significant discount from the loan arrangements. In 1974, the rates were fixed at 7.25 per cent, and in 1980 at 10 per cent. At the time, these rates were concessional to or comparative with the market rates. To the many soldiers returned after war, including Korea and Vietnam, the scheme was God sent. To many it meant the very first real opportunity to buy a home.

        <para first-indent="16">
         To many retiring regular soldiers it was a bonus which was jealously guarded because it could only be taken once, and the time had to be right. Although the amount then was $20,000, which fell well short of the total money required to buy a home, the fact that the interest rates were well below the market rates meant that the total mortgage became affordable. Naturally this government has been very pleased with the reduction in interest rates. In fact, the interest rates are now lower than when man first walked on the moon, or, in military history terms, before the end of the Vietnam War, which is continuing good news for the economy in general.

          home ownership more affordable for young families, couples and single Australians than literally for decades. However, the reduction in market rates for housing loans has also significantly reduced the value of the beneficial interest rates that have traditionally been available to borrowers under defence service housing schemes. Therefore, to ensure the scheme continues to provide genuine compensation for veterans, the government has introduced a guaranteed minimum subsidy of 1.5 percentage points, below the average standard variable home loan. With the current benchmark of 7.13 per cent, the interest rate on defence service housing loans will reduce to 5.63 per cent. In addition, the 10 per cent per annum rate for additional advances and advances for essential repairs, fixed in 1980, will be reduced to 6.85 per cent per annum.

I can think of no better epitaph than to produce evidence that the government is committed to the men and women who have served in the defence of Australia and to whom we, as a nation, owe a significant debt—a debt that some, unfortunately, take for granted in society today but a debt that can never be truly repaid.

         This government fully acknowledges the fine service by the men and women of the Australian defence forces and in many ways and means puts the national gratitude into appropriate and practical effect. One important measure of such acknowledgment has been the defence service homes scheme which provides financial benefits to those servicemen and women who have served our country in war and in peace. These financial benefits include house related benefits such as comprehensive home owners insurance cover at competitive rates and provides defence service home borrowers who suffer serious financial hardship access to a range of additional support covering essential home repairs or reduction in home repayments. One of the most significant financial provisions is the subject of this legislation, being the retention of an interest rate advantage, now to be maintained at 1.5 per cent lower than the bank benchmark rate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The history of the defence service homes scheme goes back to 1918 when it was established as the war service homes scheme. The name of the scheme was changed in 1972 to the defence home service scheme to provide for the inclusion into the scheme of those who also served our nation in peacetime. In 1985 the government sold the defence service homes mortgage portfolio to the Westpac Banking Corporation, which became the scheme's lender in December 1988. Currently, the maximum loan under the scheme is $25,000, repayable over a 25&amp;hyphen;year period. Under the agreement between the Commonwealth and Westpac, the Commonwealth subsidises Westpac for the low interest loans provided.

        <para first-indent="16">
         There are around 90,000 defence borrowers who will benefit under this legislation. Loans are available to buy, build, enlarge, complete, modify or repair a house or unit or to refinance a mortgage over a house or unit. Loans are also available to allow defence borrowers to buy into certain retirement properties or to obtain granny flat accommodation on another's property. The government is mindful of the impact of residential needs on the general health, comfort and wellbeing of our veterans, most especially our elderly  veterans and their ability to continue to live in the dignity and independence they deserve. In such circumstances, situations of safety and security of their homes and the suitability of housing to meet special needs are of concern to this government.

        <para first-indent="16">
         By its initiatives in the 1995-96 budget, the government has implemented various policy measures which significantly improve the flexibility of and access to defence service home benefits. These include extension of eligibility to full-time members of the World War II women's services, assistance where the property title is to be held in tenants&amp;hyphen;in&amp;hyphen;common, assistance where the property title is a company title or leasehold holding and extension of access to defence service homes insurance for all eligible for assistance under the act. It also includes the stabilisation of terms and interest rates for further advances.

         In the past, interest rates have been fixed by legislation. In 1974 the rate was 7.25 per cent and in 1980 the rate was fixed at 10 per cent. During these times the interest rate was concessional to the current market rates and reflected the objectives of the legislation to recognise the special status and standing of its defence recipients.

         <break page="10188" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          management has been the significant reduction of the concessional interest rates applicable under the defence service homes scheme. This bill corrects this reduction and introduces a guaranteed minimum interest rate which will remain at least 1.5 per cent below the benchmark rate, irrespective of any future fluctuations in interest rates.

         This bill provides the mechanism for a single rate of interest for those who may have two or even three loans at various rates linked to the different levels of borrowings. These measures will also provide for the abolition of the 7.25 per cent and the 10 per cent interest rates which have deprived defence borrowers of the well-deserved concession that they have every right to expect. The minimum interest rate subsidy of 1.5 per cent will be achieved by allowing the interest rate of 6.85 per cent flexibility to move down when interest rates fall or to be capped at that level if interest rates rise in the future.

          The defence home loans scheme was set up originally to make it easier for defence people to purchase their own homes, and this is important given the lifestyle that we ask of our defence people. They are subject to postings. There is some attempt to ensure that they are not posted too often, and we try to maintain them in situ for three years, but this does not always happen. In my six years with the RAAF I was posted four times. Every time I moved, there were expenses involved in that. Defence people are not always in an advantageous situation having to renegotiate loans, depending on the ups and downs of the market. So this scheme was introduced to give a service benefit for the lifestyle that we demand of our troops. For the services that they render it is almost a condition of service that they have access to cheaper home loan rates.

          There have actually been several schemes to date, and they have been changed quite frequently, but today we are actually amending the interest rates paid on those schemes. I will look specifically at the $80,000 loan which most of those who joined in my era have taken advantage of—although there are still some constituents of mine who are on the old $40,000 Defence Force housing loan and the $25,000 Defence Force housing loan.

          It does actually affect me, in particular, because I qualified for a Defence Force housing loan after my service. You are able to take it within two years of discharge from the military forces. At the time when I was discharged, I looked around to see how valuable that was, and when I looked at the interest rates at the time, it appeared that, in fact, it was yet another condition of service that had been whittled away over the previous few years. So it is imperative that we bring in this amendment to allow that condition of service to continue.

          The interest rates were fixed in 1974 at 7.25 per cent and in 1980 at 10 per cent, and not much has happened since then. Currently, there are approximately 15,000 loans with an effective interest rate of more than 6.85 per cent. I have made a number of representations on this issue and I am glad to see that, as usual, our government is responding to the needs of people in my electorate. If you go to the National Bank at present you can get a current interest rate on a one&amp;hyphen;year fixed loan of 5.49 per cent per annum. That is the interest that you would take your $80,000 out on for the first year, and it then transfers to the variable rate which is currently running at 6.7 per cent.

Of that amount, the government subsidy which they will pay in addition to, or in place of, your repayments is $122, so the customer only pays $455 in repayments. That is certainly a substantial amount of money for those raising children and paying off a mortgage, in a situation where they are posted regularly and experience numerous additional expenses because of that.

          The scheme ensures that the interest rate that is fixed at 6.85 per cent is allowed to move down when interest rates fall; but, most importantly, it cannot rise above 6.85 per cent if interest rates rise. That certainly makes it a much more attractive scheme than is currently the case. These arrangements take effect from 5 January next year and, as such, I am still in time to take advantage of my loan, should I choose to do so, because it does expire. It has also

          The actual defence service housing loan at this stage is also available through the National Bank, and some parts are also available through the Westpac bank. We do not look after our members with only those two banks; we have also established the Defence Force Credit Union, which has a facility on each of the three bases in my area and which offers exceptional home loan, personal loan and car loan rates, with limited penalties for early repayment and with no loan application fees or monthly administration fees, free loan protection insurance and also mortgage offset accounts.

          It is still a very complex situation when people in the defence forces are thinking about buying a home, but it has been made financially a lot easier by the passage of this legislation. When they do buy a home, it has to be for their personal accommodation, and that is very important for people in defence. I know that a lot of couples in defence tended to think that they were only going to be in a situation for three years and, as such, would not really make the place home. So, for three years, they would live in temporary digs and not do an exceptional amount to really decorate their house and make it very personal. Then they would be posted, and on and on it would go.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Others, on the other hand, would establish a home very quickly and make it theirs, and would maintain a standard of living that civilians take for granted. So it has been a major incentive for people to actually start making homes as soon as they are posted and arrive in an area, to set up home and make the place theirs in a family support situation. In my experience in the RAAF, the couples and families that did that certainly were not coming to see me, as a lawyer, for family law matters quite as early as did those who had not tried to establish some sort of home and who lived the almost gipsy lifestyle of people in our military.

         <para first-indent="16">
          It is important to maintain that mobility of our forces, and that sense that they are not in a place for a permanent amount of time, because that is the nature of conflict and it is the nature of situations for which they have been trained. They will be fluid and they will be fast moving; and we do try at all times to ensure that they are going to feel comfortable and secure that their family, their loans, their funeral services, their wills and anything else that needs to worry them is taken care of, so that they can focus totally on the job that is at hand, which is the defence of Australia. It is perhaps a small condition of service, but it is an important one. I feel sorry that it is not entering earlier than 5 January, but at least it is being put in place, and the recognition and action are taking account of the very fluid home loan interest rates that are available.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          At present there are three tiers of interest rates that are applied to defence service home loans. Those three tiers will be replaced by a single rate. At present the rates are: from $0 to $12,000 it is 3.75 per cent; from $12,001 to $15,000 it is 7.25 per cent; and from $15,001 to $25,000 it is 10 per cent. That system is being amalgamated and it is becoming a 6.85 per cent across-the-board loan rate. It is a beneficial measure; there will be no adverse effects.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The DSH rate certainly is more valuable when interest rates are high. Although it may be very attractive to seek loans from outside the scheme in low interest rate periods, it is certainly a scheme which affords a certain amount of protection when interest rates are high. And as we all know, what goes down, in a fiscal sense, will eventually come up. I certainly hope that is the case in light of yesterday's crash on our financial markets.

           Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill 1997
          </xref>
          is intended to amend the interest rate on defence service home loans. It is a fixed rate, as has been said, that is about 1&amp;half; per cent below the benchmark.

         As indicated by the shadow minister, the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson), the opposition does not oppose this bill and we will not delay its passage. However, if we do have any disagreement with it then it is in the timing and the amount of the rate cut announced by the government.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill will benefit 52,000 veterans. No-one disputes the significant debt Australia owes to the men and women who have served in the defence of this country. This legislation will preserve and protect one of their longstanding compensatory benefits, a subsidised housing loan under the Defence Service Homes Act 1918.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As we are all aware, interest rates, in general, have fallen significantly in recent years and not, as those opposite would have us believe, since they gained the Treasury benches. I thought it was a bit rich of the honourable member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) to indicate that in the 18 months that the Liberal Party has had stewardship of the Treasury benches interest rates have dramatically fallen. I well remember that interest rates fell dramatically when Labor was in power. Indeed, it is because of the policies established under the Labor Party that interest rates have come down to the extent where so many people are now enjoying them.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I suppose there are no wins without pain and, as a result, the reduction in interest rates, especially in the market rates for new houses, has been significant. Of course that then made the benefit that was obtainable through these defence loans not such a benefit, as other speakers have said. This bill proposes a guaranteed minimum subsidy that will ensure that defence service home borrowers retain an interest rate advantage of at least 1.5 per cent lower than the benchmark rate, regardless of future changes in market interest rates. That is the important thing: it is regardless of future changes in interest rates. It is the changes in market interest rates that have eroded the benefit of this.

         The measures in this legislation will come into effect on 5 January 1998. While speaking on the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill 1997 , I will also take the opportunity to mention the Defence Housing Authority. Although it is important for defence personnel, and former defence personnel, to be able to purchase their own homes, it is also important that
         <break page="10193" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          defence personnel posted throughout Australia are housed in decent accommodation. It was particularly interesting to hear the honourable member for Lindsay draw attention to the fact that in the six years that she was in the forces she had four moves. So often we hear of people with 20 years of service who have had 18 or 20 moves in that period.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When I first joined the Public Works Committee, and before the Defence Housing Authority was there, I recall being appalled at how many of our defence personnel were housed in appalling conditions. One of the great successes of the Australian Labor Party, when in government, was the establishment of the Defence Housing Authority. Since its establishment in 1988, it has housed 17,111 personnel; 10,294 houses have been purchased; and 6,817 house have been leased. The scheme has always had my enthusiastic support. Indeed, it is the envy of much of the world.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is a realistic scheme based on market forces and it mixes defence and civilian personnel together in housing estates. The Defence Housing Authority has always had a very commercial approach and some of the estates, especially Willow Vale in the electorate of the honourable member for Hughes (Mrs Vale), are a real credit. Indeed, the housing estates in the Northern Territory have won awards for Troppo Architects. I am very proud, as a member of the Labor Party, that we did bring that in. The present government is of course keeping the DHA going, as indeed it should. I hope that the DHA and the defence service homes scheme can continue to enjoy the bipartisan support it has had over the years.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would also support the comment by the shadow minister expressing concern that the $25,000 limit has not been increased over a number of years. There have been huge increases in housing prices, especially in Sydney and other cities throughout Australia. While serving ADF personnel can obtain a loan of $80,000, veterans are limited to loans of $25,000. I join with the shadow minister in seeking an assurance from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) and the government that they will review the $25,000 upper limit in the very near future. Indeed, I noticed that the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) also made a plea for the $25,000 limit to be reviewed. But of course the honourable member for Paterson, in this very bipartisan debate, could not help having a go at the former government when he said, `What did they do in the 13 years that they were in power to ensure that that rate was lifted?'

          —It might be a very good point, Minister. But I remember when at one time—and for whatever reason—housing interest rates were 17 and 18 per cent, my own brother was getting a loan at six per cent from the Defence Housing Authority. I was paying 18 per cent interest on mine. Over those years when housing interest rates were very high, those veterans did get a considerable advantage. It is only over recent years, when interest rates have fallen so dramatically, that that advantage has been eroded. That is why I congratulate the minister and the government in making it a fixed rate. Regardless of how interest rates fall, there will always be a compensatory advantage there. I think that was the original idea and is to be commended.

         There is also some concern about the $4 per month account keeping fees imposed by Westpac. I know that Westpac say, `That is lower than the normal fee. The normal fee is $8 and we are doing it for $4.' Although it is not covered by the legislation, new borrowers will automatically lose an additional $48 a year from the benefits provided by this bill.

          It really is time that someone—whether this parliament or someone else—took on the banks. It is not only this $4 per month that they will charge; they will also charge a whole lot of other things. I know that every time I get my bank statement—and I have a loan, not at 18 per cent now, but I do have one—there is not only the bank keeping fee; there are all sorts of other things there too—$4 for this, $2 for that and the $8. The banks have for too long been ripping off the people of Australia, making those massive profits. Maybe it is time that someone took them on. Although the keeping fee is not part of the legislation, I think it is important to draw attention to that.

          I am not sure about it—and I realise I should have alerted the minister to this before—but I take it that injured service personnel would still be eligible for this and repairs to the house and so forth that often the defence forces do. In my area I have the Injured Service Personnel Association. I know that when people in the defence forces get that compensation, quite a lot of work has to be done to their houses—doors, ramps and so forth.

          It is very important that this legislation come before the House and be approved. I think it is to the credit of the government that they had realised this problem. We have indicated that they have been a long time bringing this legislation up. It is all very well for the member for Paterson to say, `The Labor Party did nothing for the 13 years that they were in power.' Nevertheless, if it was such a major item of importance to the government, one would have thought that they would have moved more speedily in the 18 months that they have been in power than they obviously have.

         <para first-indent="16">
          It is very important that our defence personnel and former defence personnel be housed in adequate housing. We do expect a lot of our defence personnel. We expect that, when they join the defence forces, they will make a commitment that they will move—often at very short notice—to many parts of Australia. They will be forced to move, to give up their home. As the honourable member for Lindsay said, often they have put a lot of attention into that home. It is very important that the government ensure that they are adequately housed and that, after they have left the services, if they so want it they can then get this loan. It is not all that much. That is why we are asking the minister if he could possibly lift it a little.

          —in reply—Firstly I would like to thank my colleagues for their contributions to this bill and also, mostly, their positive and thoughtful comments—not always positive from the other side of the House. I thank both sides of the House for their contribution. I was a little bit disappointed in the opening comments by the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson), the shadow minister, who sought not to address directly the bill before the Main Committee. I will touch on some of his comments during my summing up.

         Let me say at the outset that this bill is all about ensuring that veterans continue to receive a measure of compensation in the defence service home loan—DSHL—arrangements. The government, like previous governments, has made a firm commitment to look after the interests of our veterans in our community. These are men and women who have served in the defence of their country and they richly deserve the generosity of us all for their sacrifices. This bill has come about only because of the disciplined approach taken by this government in the economic management of our economy.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The commitment to cut the budget deficit has led to the repeated fall in interest rates. In fact, interest rates now are so low that the beneficial nature of the defence service home loan is almost being matched by the commercial home loan rates. What this bill does is to ensure that veterans on a standard defence service home loan will receive in future a guaranteed 1&amp;half; percentage point interest rate reduction below the market rate on their defence service home loan, to ensure that a genuine element of compensation is maintained in the loan. As interest rates fall, so will the interest rate on veterans' defence service home loans in the future. These changes will commence on 5 January 1998.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I would like to point out also that we have abolished for good the 10 per cent and the 7&amp;half; per cent interest rates which are enshrined in the existing legislation. So all those people who were prevented from paying off the 10 per cent tier first will no longer have to worry about it. It is gone.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I know that has been the subject of concern of veterans in most constituencies around Australia: they have in the past been prevented from paying off those higher interest rate tiers faster or ahead of the other tiers within the loan structure. If the benchmark rate were to fall in future to 7.13 per cent, for example, then the interest rate on a defence service home loan of $25,000 would fall to 5.63 per cent. However, I cannot stress enough the fact that the maximum interest rate on a defence service home loan is forever capped at 6.85 per cent. That is another element of this bill that is not only a good measure but is a commitment from the government that we understand and we care for our veteran community.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I table a document which will help members understand the three tiers that existed in the past, how they will be structured in the future and where the compensation and subsidies will apply. I urge members to discuss that with their ex&amp;hyphen;service organisations and people in their own constituencies.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I would like just to touch on some of the comments made by members of the opposition and to talk particularly about some of the comments made by the shadow minister. He said in his opening remarks that I as minister and we as a government cannot get legislation through the House.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I remind the opposition that this legislation has been accorded category T status by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). This is legislation that has been given urgency status. That is a demonstration that we not only care but are committed to getting the legislation through the House so that it can benefit our veterans.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The shadow minister also said that we have done very little for veterans. I will touch on some of the things that we have done. We have now got a simplified claims system. We have got increased support for veterans' advocates around Australia. We have made sure that there are no fees payable for entry to the Australian War Memorial. The average time for benefits claimed—to be handled by my department—has been reduced from 167 days to 77 days. If that is not benefiting the veterans of our nation, I do not know what does. We have reduced the time by almost 100 days.

          Veterans living in regional and rural areas now have better access to information, health and safety services and increased entitlements to medical grade footwear. The long overdue recognition of the Korean veterans is being provided by the preparation of a nominal roll. Veterans receiving a disability pension through the Department of Veterans' Affairs and aged pensions through the Department of Social Security can now elect to receive one simple payment through my department—further streamlining of the operation and delivery of that

           income support to those veterans who have an entitlement from two departments. There is a range of other initiatives that the government has achieved in its first 18 months. I reject the shadow minister's comments that we have done nothing since we have been in government.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In relation to interest rates, I think the shadow minister was referring to the fact that he felt that this initiative could have been passed on sooner. All of us would have liked to pass it on sooner, but he would know that this has to be put in place by a legislative process and that it cannot be put in place until January of next year, as I have outlined earlier.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The shadow minister was critical that we did not increase the amount of the loan. I remind the Main Committee that the loans were last increased in 1980 under a coalition government. The opposition were there for 13 years and had an opportunity in 1988, when the defence service home loan was sold to Westpac bank, to put arrangements in place—if they really believed in what they were saying—to increase the loans, as part of the defence service home loan arrangements. It is gross hypocrisy for them to say in the Main Committee that they would like to see these levels raised, when they had an opportunity for 13 years to do so—and they had a very real opportunity in 1988.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In conclusion, the passage of this bill will provide immediate savings for entitled veterans. I thank all members of the Main Committee and the House who have contributed to this bill and also the opposition for their confirmation that they will not be preventing the passage of this bill. Like us, they want this bill to be put in place so that those beneficial measures can be passed on to the veteran community, starting on 5 January next year.
