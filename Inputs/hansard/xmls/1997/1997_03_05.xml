Indeed, what they might decide to do—and what I would suggest, Mr Speaker, you might decide to do—is have a little read about what the now government when in opposition said about what were far less dramatic changes that previous Presiding Officers wanted to make in this place.

         If just by fiat of the Presiding Officers we are going to see the whole nature of the way this parliament has worked for at least the last 50 years change so dramatically, that is not good enough. If your stewardship of the job of being the head of the House of Representatives is to see a short consultation with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) as the way to do this, I must say to you, Sir, that that is not the way these things have been done in the past and not the way they should be done now.

         In the past when governments and Presiding Officers have looked to get efficiencies out of the parliamentary departments, they have canvassed these things widely. The member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) and I, for instance, put forward a private member's bill here some time ago. The government has not even given that time for debate. In the past, Speaker Child brought in legislation to this House which was canvassed, debated widely and then rejected by the Senate. We had widespread debate on that, but all of a sudden now you want to stampede us into agreeing to something in a few weeks time. The short statement you have made here is just a most

         It beggars belief that we should be expected to say, `Terrific, go ahead and do it.' The opposition believes that there are ways of getting economies of scale out of the parliamentary departments. We said that while in government and we have said that while in opposition. But we think that members on both sides—and members of the government—should not just see this as something that they should be stampeded into.

         You are the people who will suffer from this. The people who will suffer most from this are members of parliament. Sometimes in debates in this House we have to consider ourselves to be members of parliament, not division cannon fodder for the government or division cannon fodder for the opposition. If being a member of parliament means anything it means having at least some control over what happens in this House and what services are provided to members of this House.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Quite frankly, as a member of the House of Representatives, I would not be happy to see the Senate department have absolute control over the manner in which services are provided to members of the House of Representatives. What will happen with the division of responsibilities between the two chambers? What will happen when there are—as you know and as a former Presiding Officer I know—the regular disputes, which do occur, between the two houses? What will happen when the Senate decides, as it normally does, that there is a standard for them and a standard for others? If you divide the assets of the joint departments between the two chamber departments you will find that the appropriation of the Senate will grow fourfold.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It also gets down to accountability. The Senate department has a standing Appropriations and Staffing Committee where opposition and government senators sit down with the President and tell the President how the President will spend the money appropriated to the Senate department. Quite frankly, as a member of the House of Representatives, I find it interesting that a group of senators will
         <break page="1963" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          sit down and decide how they will spend money which in fact will provide services for members of the House of Representatives.

         Mr Speaker, I did not hear in your paper that you are going to take us into your confidence and set up the same sort of thing for the House of Representatives—I bet you are not. When I was the Speaker I resisted doing that, my colleague the member for Cunningham resisted doing that and former speakers resisted doing that. But we are going to allow senators to decide what will happen to services provided to members.

I must say in a cynical fashion that those of us who have been here for more than five minutes—with all due respect to my colleague the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan), who saw the light and left the Senate and came here—know that the Senate will look after itself to the detriment of people here.

These are issues that members on both sides need to get a full understanding of. They are not issues that we should deal with at half past nine in the morning with a one&amp;hyphen;page statement.

         If that is the way you see the job of the Speaker in representing this House to the government then I think you have lost the plot, Mr Speaker. I say that in all seriousness because this will be one of the most important changes in the way this House works to have occurred in the last 50 or 60 years. There may be good and cogent reasons for this to happen. There may be different models from that of just absorbing a couple of acts of parliament—I do not know how you absorb a couple of acts of parliament, but somehow you and the President have found a way to absorb a couple of acts of parliament.

         This needs far more debate. It at least needs the same debate that we had when previous Presiding Officers considered smaller changes. Mr Speaker, we may not be able to do anything in this House because the government members may be willing to be stampeded into what the government wants to do, but we will certainly have a lot to do and say about this when it gets to the Senate. Mr Speaker, if you and the President want to get some movement on this issue then far more widespread discussion might ensure that there is some movement in the Senate. At present I can say fairly clearly that our point of view is that there will not be any movement. There certainly will not

         This is a profound change to the way the House of Representatives and the parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia will work; and because it is such a profound change it is something that you do not do at half past nine on a Wednesday morning on a non&amp;hyphen;broadcast day after a short discussion with the Leader of the Opposition. We want far more discussion of this. We have proposals to put to you and the government—if the government is driving this, and I am sure it is—about how this system ought to work. There are models such as the one put forward by previous Presiding Officers. There are models like the New Zealand model with a parliamentary commission where members on both sides sit with the Presiding Officers and have some say in how their house will work.

         Most certainly, Mr Speaker, you would be letting down this House if you went through with this proposal in the way you have briefly spoken about today. The proposal ensures that members of this House have fewer rights than members of the other house will have. Under this plan that you have put forward here we most certainly will have fewer rights. Neither government nor opposition members will have a chance to say to you what we think about how the services that are provided in this building work, but senators will.

         I would imagine that one of the first problems Madam President is going to have if she made the same sort of speech in the Senate 15 minutes ago is that the first thing the senators will say is, `Has this been to the Appropriations and Staffing Committee?' They seem to think that they ought to be consulted about everything that moves over there. That might be rightly so, but I think it is a bit rich that they will get that say and we will not. Your duty, Mr Speaker, is to ensure that we get that say; to ensure that this House is not stampeded into something in a few weeks time which will be to the detriment of the institution of the House of Representatives. If this goes ahead quickly like this it will be to the detriment of this institution.

If what happens is as you have just said to us, then we are really in a position where members have had no say in what happens to what is the pre&amp;hyphen;eminent house of parliament in this country—the House of Representatives. You will hand over control of services to the Senate and if a serious altercation between the houses of parliament occurs this House may not be the pre&amp;hyphen;eminent house.

         The Senate thought about that and, as you are probably aware, Mr Speaker, in recent years have ensured that, if the House of Representatives Presiding Officers ever decided that they wanted to restrict things for the Senate, the Senate had a whole range of things they could do themselves. They had their own printing operation over there long before this House did. They had a self&amp;hyphen;contained operation which would ensure that the Senate maintained its independence.

You might be right; I might be right. But that certainly is a matter that should be debated and looked at when we know all the facts. A one&amp;hyphen;page statement at half past nine on a Wednesday morning allows no one to know the facts. That is not doing your duty on behalf of all of us. I do not say that in a nasty fashion. You have done your job as the Speaker of this House very well. You have been willing to say to the government that you think some things should be done differently. I am not trying to set you up in conflict with the government, but the government should understand this.

If the government wants to do this quicker, then you should put this squarely in their court. The Prime Minister can be asked what his view of this is. If his view is that he wants to change the House of Representatives by 9.30 fiat, then we find that fascinating. We had some changes that we thought we ought to make to the constitution about whether Australia becomes a republic or whether you ought to do things like this, and the Prime Minister said, `We've got to have national, wonderful, incredible debate'—and that is right.

While we have such a large number of new members on both sides, it is even more important, and incumbent upon you, to ensure that they understand what has happened. This is not something that should happen in response to some decision that the ERC has made.

           If the government believes that the parliament matters that little, then I think that is a sad commentary on what the government does. If the Prime Minister, who has stood up in this House year in and year out and talked about the importance of this House, thinks that to change all this by ambush is the way to do it, then my view of him as a parliamentarian has significantly changed. The one thing that I have always had for John Howard—I might not have liked the things that he said or did—is a lot of respect for the view that he often took in here as a parliamentarian. If the Prime Minister is a parliamentarian of any regard and if he has any love of the way this House works, then the government should ensure that there is far more discussion and that everybody understands just what we are doing.

It seems to me, looking at the statement by the Speaker, that the

        The Speaker concludes by saying that he will `advise the House as soon as practicable'. The point is he will involve the House. We have full confidence in the Speaker's preparedness to consult. But, on the issue of consultation, always remember that you will never garner a unanimity of view from this chamber—there are so many different points of view as to sitting hours, to the conduct of standing orders and the like. The Speaker, as is rightly the case, has the final decision. Some of those decisions may be hard or otherwise as he seeks to meet his objective, as he says in his statement, of `increasing demands for services at a time of budgetary restraint'. The member for Grayndler has been unfair. He has employed—I appreciate that a number of points he made were very fair, reasonable and legitimate—

Certainly from this side of the parliament, as my colleague the member for Watson (Mr Leo Mcleay) has clearly demonstrated, on previous occasions it has been the Labor Party, when in government, that has sought to bring about some change in the way in which this parliament is managed. Both you, Mr Speaker, and Madam President, as part of the way in which our parliamentary arrangements currently operate, have very important responsibilities in that respect.

        The member for Watson alluded to the fact that on previous occasions Speaker Child, himself as Mr Speaker, and me as the Speaker in the last parliament endeavoured to bring before this place legislative changes which would bring efficiencies to the way in which the parliament operates. I do not think anyone disputes that that is necessary. I do not think anyone disputes that there is duplication. There are five government departments on the hill that look after the affairs of state with the parliament. Within each of those five departments there are separate human resources areas and separate pay areas—a whole range of areas where there is duplication.

        Behind driving change under previous Presiding Officers has been the desire to ensure that efficiencies were there, that it delivered some savings but that those savings would go back into ensuring that in no way was the opportunity for members and senators to carry out their responsibilities diminished. I think this is a paramount issue in this

        We need to get an unequivocal assurance, Mr Speaker, not only from yourself, as the guardian of all of our concerns here in the premier parliament of Australia, but also from the government on this matter. Make no mistake about it, there is a very clear nexus between the parliamentary departments and the government. What the government wants at the end of the day the government will achieve, because the government allocates the funds for parliamentary departments. The concern we have is to ensure that any efficiencies which you, Mr Speaker, and Madam President drive in getting rational approaches to the delivery of services in this place do not diminish the ability of us as parliamentarians to do our job.

        There is a lot going on in Australia at the minute, there is a lot going on in the parliament and there is a lot of debate raging at the present time about members of parliament. There is a debate about entitlements and about what we do as members of parliament. It is all well and good out there for public mythology to believe that most of us do not do an honest day's work for an honest day's pay, that we are all out there with our snouts in the trough and dipping into the public purse. I refute that. Most members of parliament certainly take the opportunity, whenever they are talking to schools or to the public, to refute that. Most members of parliament that I know work, on average, 70 to 80 hours a week. They do a long, hard and arduous task on behalf of their constituents, not for any self&amp;hyphen;gratification that they may get. I will always defend members of parliament right across the chambers on that very point.

        Therefore, I do not want to see any of these issues associated with making efficiencies in the operation of the parliamentary departments being driven by perhaps polling, or perceptions that the government has, that in some way this is going to make members of parliament look different in the eyes of the electorate at large. Our opportunities to work

        Also, as a former presiding officer, I know the difficulties that you are faced with in running your department. I know, for example, that in the last election campaign the present government went to the people of Australia promising that there was going to be a $10 million cut imposed on the five parliamentary departments if they were elected to office. They saw some efficiencies that were required there, but they did not know what it meant. They simply said you were going to have to cut back on the amount of money which you expended in those departments.

        In the case of the Department of the House of Representatives there was a $2 million cut required of them. I have to say, in one of the more selfless tasks I have ever seen, a senior public servant in an SES band was given responsibility by the Clerk of this department to examine how those savings might be achieved. At the end of the day, in a great act of selflessness, he actually recommended that his position be eliminated—and it was, and he left. The department saved an enormous amount just in one SES salary. He also recommended changes which the Clerk had to put in place—at great personal heartburn to himself because, as a departmental head, he had responsibility for ensuring that the services to the department and to the parliament were not undermined to any great extent and, of course, he had a great feeling for the people who worked in the place.

        The abilities of our parliament here and the House of Representatives committee structure, and so on, had to be examined. So we now see smaller secretariats looking after a couple of parliamentary committees in the one hit. They have had to say, `We can't do extensive examinations of issues because we haven't got the staff or the resources, we haven't got the travel budgets, and so on, to enable members of parliament to conduct their business as it should be done.' This is one of the sad reflections of what happened.

        I have to say this, Mr Speaker. You achieved one thing which I never did as the Speaker, my colleague the member for Watson never did, and I do not think Speaker Child or Speaker Jenkins ever did. You actually got, with Madam President, to the ERC to argue a case on behalf of the parliamentary departments. I understand you had that opportunity last Thursday, if my information is correct, and I congratulate you for that. We used to have to rely on the Minister for Finance to go into an ERC and argue for parliamentary departments' appropriations. That is not exactly a great recommendation because all Ministers for Finance are looking for cuts, not necessarily looking for support for those particular departments. But you have been there and have been given an opportunity to argue the case on behalf of the members you represent in this chamber. Do not forget, you have been elected, Mr Speaker, to represent the members' interests in this place. That is what the Speaker's position is all about.

        When I put a question to you earlier this week—and you might reflect on this as well—about whether or not you felt you might achieve some more success in some of the discussions that were ongoing about improvements to the parliament and how the services of members and senators and the parliamentary departments more generally could be delivered, I suggested that you might have a little better success with the Senate if any of these changes required legislation. At the time you indicated to me that there was a possibility of some consultative group being established and I put a supplementary question to you about whether the opposition

        I thought that was a great suggestion. It took a few people by surprise because I do not think anybody really knew that was on the go. We thought that was great because we thought, on our side at least, that, if the changes that we had tried to make in previous parliaments were going to be achieved, then clearly we would have a role to play and we could have some negotiations and put a point of view. As my friend the member for Watson said, he and I, and those on this side of the parliament, have tried to do much of this in the past but have always got knocked over in the Senate.

        If you have been able to achieve some radical change in creating just two departments out of five, then clearly you seem to have some indication from government that they are going to support that.

         —Consultation was the hallmark of the report which was brought down. Interestingly, there was a minority report as part of it.

        He convinced the coalition senators about this and, of course, they refused to deal with it over there. At that time, the Leader of the Opposition was weak enough to say, `Well, all right, I'm not going to take my own senators on about this.' I think it is fair to say that the member for Aston, the member for Watson and I—because it fell on me to implement the recommendations that flowed from the member for Aston's report—actually brought a bill before this parliament to effect some of that change. It got through this House with no dramas at all. The government had the numbers and we were right. But it got over to the Senate, and there it lay.

        As I said, I do not have a great problem with change. I do not think that I will have, necessarily, a great problem with what has been proposed to get two departments. As long as the House of Representatives has certainly equal, if not a little stronger, influence on the way in which this might work in a practical sense, that is going to be fine. Originally, as I said, I put a proposal forward that had a third department, which, with the Department of the Library, the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff and the Joint House Department in one, provided the physical services, parliamentary information and so on.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I thought that was a reasonable opportunity, but I am not dissuaded from what is being proposed. I just wonder, in part of the broader consideration of this, whether maybe we need to do what the member for Watson suggested; that is, have a bit more time for reflection and consultation about the methodology of this. We would like to know if legislative change is necessary. I think it probably will be. I think it has to be. You cannot just get rid of statutory departments by saying, `We're going to amalgamate these' and just leave it up in the air. You have people such as parliamentary librarians and secretaries of joint house departments and the departments themselves, which are actually created as departments of state, already there.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So if you are eliminating those, you must have legislative change to bring that about. We would like to know what that is all about. But, in terms of the broader overarching control of this, the member for Watson alluded to New Zealand's parliamentary experience. I would also commend to you the board of management concept in the House of Commons and the House of Lords in the UK. From my recollection of the way that works, it was effective in as much as you had people from both sides of the parliament contributing
        <break page="1971" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         as part of that. You also had the opportunity for things like some of the existing committees to continue to operate.

        One of the other practical elements of the implementation of this runs to the committee structure which is in place to oversight the way some of these departments presently work. The Joint House Committee, for example, the Library Committee, and I think there was a PISO committee, too, which was operating for a period, certainly in an advisory sense to the Presiding Officers. We would want to know whether there will still be an opportunity for people of the parliament—that is, the members themselves—to contribute in that sense to the way in which these departmental committees are run.

        My friend here the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), for example, has been a great contributor to the parliamentary Library Committee over a long period. I think on both sides of the parliament it would be recognised that if the opportunity was not taken to use his great ability for contribution in that sense, if that was eliminated as part of this overall structure proposal, that would be a very sad thing for the parliament. The board of management concept in the UK parliament probably still gives us the opportunity to keep those departmental committees going and to provide an opportunity for the members of parliament still to contribute to the way they want their own parliament to run.

        It is all well and good for our friends in the ERC to talk about bottom&amp;hyphen;line figures and how we are going to get cost savings and so on. Given that I have suggested and tried to implement some of these myself, I am not averse to that—I say that to the Leader of the House (Mr Reith). I have talked to him about this in the past and suggested to him that if he wanted to achieve some of these savings the easiest way would have been to bring on my private member's bill last year to give it a bit of a run to see how it would go. You would have gone down to three departments and some rationalisation and savings would have been made.

        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         I became chair of that committee three or four or five years ago, that I was appointed by the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), who was then the Speaker. The committee was set up under his tutelage and, certainly, it was set up with a majority of non&amp;hyphen;government members. I think I was actually nominated by the then opposition; the opposition whip may have had something to do with that particular activity. But I was chair of that committee. It had a majority of non&amp;hyphen;government members, it deliberated for some length of time and it made certain recommendations in terms of mergers of some of the departments. It had a specifically limited brief, which was not as broad as the proposals that I understand you are bringing into the House now. Nevertheless, it certainly came out with a majority recommendation that there should be mergers. There was a minority report from three senators: two from the coalition and one from the Democrats. Subsequently, the matter stalled on its way through, as we have already heard.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It seemed to me that, as we went through the assessment of merging the departments, there were a great number of benefits to be achieved through such a merger. At that time we were looking particularly at merging the Department of the Parliamentary Library and the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff—Hansard. We were not looking at the Joint House Department at that stage, although options had been looked at previously. It seemed to me there were considerable advantages in what we were going to do. We identified some specific dollar savings and, at that time, we got an assurance from the then government that those savings would be ploughed back into the parliament for further development of services for senators and members. That, of course, was a major attraction about the process.

        In terms of supporting the principle of rationalisation or mergers, such as your statement has put before the chamber today, there are a couple of things that need to be said. Obviously, the statement you have provided us with is fairly broad and I will await with great interest the details of how you intend to achieve the objectives you have
        <break page="1974" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         laid before us. But it seems to me that, in looking at what you are proposing to do, there is a very important question of balance. Historically, the Senate has been the chamber that has jealously guarded its rights, its entitlements and so on. I am sure that I do not need to remind you but, for the record, I will say that I think it is important that the House of Representatives makes sure that, in any new arrangement, it is appropriately structured and supported in any joint arrangement. This is the chamber where governments are formed and this is the chamber the Prime Minister comes from. This chamber needs to ensure that it is adequately and properly supported in every sense of the word. That is something that you will have a heavy responsibility for in terms of the plans that will be brought forward.

        I am interested to see, Mr Speaker, that you are suggesting the merger of the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, the Library—and, for the benefit of those in the gallery, the Library is not just a collection of books: it is also a major research service which, in many ways, is a more important function than just the collection of books—and the Joint House Department, which looks after all of the housekeeping and maintenance of the building. The practicalities of merging those and putting them under the control of the two chamber departments, the Senate and the House of Representatives, will present some unique challenges. I await with great interest the clear ingenuity that will obviously be needed to achieve success in that because you are talking about common services being split in some shape or form to provide separate services to senators and to members of the House of Representatives. Whilst I do not see too many problems in terms of the mechanics of splitting some elements, such as the reporting staff and maybe the library, when it comes to matters of security, building maintenance and so on there will be a necessity for some standardisation between the two chambers, probably more in terms of taking away things that the Senate might hold unto itself. It will be an interesting set of negotiations.

The structure for this parliament has been in place for many years and there is no doubt in my mind, from the previous exercise that I conducted as the chair of the committee that looked at merging some of those departments, that there are overwhelming reasons to rationalise, merge and restructure some of the departments in this building. A lot of those savings can be made purely and simply by doing away with some of the duplication of functions between departments, by streamlining administration and by not having to get duplicate sets of advice, duplicate sets of information and duplicate sets of consultants to advise different departments on different things. There is a lot of streamlining that will go on which will not only make dollar savings, which is obviously important in the current climate, but will also make efficiency savings and will help the chambers run more effectively.

What concerns me is that while from before I came to the parliament, certainly from the day I arrived, I thought the five&amp;hyphen;department structure was absurd, on the face of it, Mr Speaker, I have to say that you seem to have come up with an equally absurd proposal—but I hope when the detail emerges that does not prove to be the case. I am sure you have thought it through and there will be some indication of how what looks on the face of it to be not an adequate alternative will develop to be so. I merely endorse the remarks made by my colleagues about the need for a fuller explanation and an opportunity for consultation.

        One of the two phrases in the statement that caught my attention and surprised me was the phrase `we have decided' rather than `we are putting forward a proposition that' or `we would like the House and the Senate to consider the following proposal'. But that has been adequately traversed by others. The
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         other phrase is `make significant savings'. I have been here for nine years and I have been in public political life for 20 years; and I know what that code means. It means that the over 1,000 people who work in this building are in serious trouble. Their job security is under serious threat. That is what it means.

        I am concerned that you have announced here today `we have decided' and I wonder what consultation there has been with those people who work in this building and with their representatives, the trade unions which represent them in this place. Many of these people live in my electorate and the electorates of my colleagues the member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) and the member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel)—and also of course the member for Eden Monaro (Mr Nairn).

        I am sure they would share my concern that we have here a proposition that will dramatically affect immediately not only the security, confidence and optimism but in the very short term perhaps also the jobs of a large number of Australians, not in most cases highly paid. They will go into a labour market here in the ACT in the south&amp;hyphen;east New South Wales region that is severely depressed and is correctly described by Access Economics as in recession. So I am very worried about what is proposed and its implications for those people. I am particularly concerned—and not having had the chance to speak to you, Mr Speaker, I do not want to assume this—because, as on the face of it the government did not know about it and the opposition did not know about it, it seems to me highly unlikely that there has been opportunity for consultation with those 1,000 people most directly affected. It is their jobs that are so politely affected by these code words `make significant savings'. Everybody knows what it means.

I think the small number of us who have served in both houses can contribute something to that from an interesting perspective. But that has been discussed at length and we are unduly taking time to duplicate it. I simply wanted to add to the concerns properly raised by the three previous speakers my concern about the prospects and consequences of these changes and the process of their implementation for the over 1,000 people who work in this building.

         —Whilst I appreciate that this is on indulgence, after discussions with the opposition I think the proposition is that I will close the debate as best I can but that there will be further discussions informally on the matter during the day. I should say that my initial reaction is to say that you have shown a firm direction for some changes to the supportive administrative arrangements for the parliament and I would think there would be a lot of support for your initiative in terms of reforms to those administrative arrangements. I think that was well put by the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) when he made the point that some of these issues have been the subject of a lot of discussion over many years and in a sense you have taken the bull by the horns and come in this morning with a very clear proposed framework for reform to be undertaken.

        There is, of course, much merit in this particular proposition, but I confine my remarks to the most generalised sense as there have been a number of reform options developed over the years—and I speak ad lib and without an opportunity to prepare in any detail. The House of Commons, I think, went for a sort of megaservice department and two—lower house and upper house—departments, but that was a scheme that did not
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         work. There are other Commonwealth parliaments that provide a steer as to the effectiveness of administrative arrangements, and the one that you have proposed I know from my past reading on this is certainly a viable option and would have much merit to it. Obviously that has been a factor you have taken into account in putting the proposition.

        I do, however, accept the point which opposition members have made that it is important to provide people with real detail as to what lies behind this proposition because there are some very genuine areas of concern which people will have. The jobs issue, of course, is very important; the service to members is important, and there are other matters that go to the balance between the houses which I suspect will also be the subject of concern—and proper concern at that.

You have opted for the up&amp;hyphen;front transparent setting of the goal and a process to meet that goal. By having a relatively short timetable, I presume your intention is to minimise uncertainty in the minds of those who might be affected. I think uncertainty for people, particularly when it comes to jobs, is a real problem for people, most understandably, so I think that must lie behind what you have said.

There is no rationale, there is no process, and there are no positive outcomes. The government has gone missing, the minister has gone missing and, particularly, the backbench has gone missing.

Secondly, energy consumption has tripled and manufacturing output has tripled. But the real catch is that employment has only grown by one-third.

         A couple of months ago I asked the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) whether he would refer to his cabinet unemployment committee the impact of the abolition of the book bounty on companies like Griffin Press in Adelaide, where 140 full- and part-time workers were given redundancy notices. It has to be said that he basically avoided giving a real answer in stating that the decisions cannot be disaggregated.

         The book and publishing industry were operating on the understanding that the bounty would continue until the end of 1997.

         Printing and publishing firms estimate that around 50 per cent of the 2,600 jobs in the industry could be at risk and lost. This is an industry that the book bounty encouraged to increase exports by over 200 per cent. Its premature abolition threatens export earnings, 1,300 jobs and 1,300 families. Opportunities for young Australians are diminished and, basically, it is just a kick in the teeth to the printing and the publishing industry.

         The abolition of the ships bounty just defies commonsense. The government wants to cut the five per cent support for Australian shipbuilders of vessels, nearly all of which are exported. In the eight years since Labor introduced the bounty, the Australian shipbuilding industry has grown dramatically. It is a world leader in high&amp;hyphen;speed catamaran production. Production is up by 200 per cent. Exports are up by 150 per cent. Employment is up by 50 per cent. You would have thought that that is a very good recipe for growth, progress and jobs. But the government's response is to give it a belt around the ears. At five per cent support, Australia could more
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          than compete with Norway, with a subsidy of 13.2 per cent, with Denmark, at 13 per cent, and with Italy, up to 25 per cent. But they cannot compete at zero per cent.

         Has the government taken into account the fact that the so-called OECD agreement to end shipbuilding subsidies by the end of 1998 will not go ahead now because the USA will not sign up to it? Consistency certainly is no hallmark of this government. The government continued to support the ships capital grants scheme by funding $23 million to help companies like Shell and BHP import ships made in Holland, but it will not help Australian shipbuilders. For a saving of a measly $9 million to the budget, the abolition of the ships bounty cost one company $225 million in lost contracts. The company suffers. The employees suffer. The nation suffers.

         In addition to the abolition of the book and shipbuilding bounties, the government has terminated the machine tools and robotics bounties and will abolish the computer bounty on 1 July next year.

If you spend it on light rail, you get 23,000 jobs for the same expenditure—around double the jobs you would get for anything on road construction.

         Every year in Australia the cost—`subsidy' is more correct—for road transport is well in excess of $10 billion. In fact, I think it is more like double that. That is $5 billion we spend on the actual road building and maintenance and $5 billion on the result of road

         It is interesting to note that the leaders of government and the leaders of industry around the world in the 1950s and 1960s went through school in the 1930s and the Depression. Many of these people, highly skilled people, waited sometimes three or four years before they got a job.

         In the first Howard government budget we have seen the withdrawal of over $3.9 billion in industry assistance over a four&amp;hyphen;year period. That is in violation of the explicit commitments made to Australian industry in the lead&amp;hyphen;up to that election. For example, the government gave an express and explicit commitment to maintain the research and development taxation concession to Australian industry at 150 per cent. In its budget it announced that it had slashed it to 125 per cent. It gave an express commitment to maintain export incentive programs, and in the budget they slashed them mercilessly. With regard to the bounty schemes relating to books, computers, machine tools and robots, and ships, which are the subject of this legislation, the promises given to manufacturers in these industries have been broken as well.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What makes the ahead of schedule termination of the bounty schemes significant is simply the specific nature of the impact of the budget decision—specific in the sense that the impact is on easily identifiable industries and manufacturing firms and on regional communities. When the government slashed the R&amp;D concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent the impact of that decision was felt by many firms in manufacturing industry. A similar impact has occurred as a result of the reduction in expenditure on export assistance schemes.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In the case of the bounty schemes which are the subject of this legislation, the damage wrought by the government decision is localised, identifiable and substantial. While the amendments in this bill represent some marginal improvement on the original measures that were announced in the budget, the opposition regards them as regressive; and we will oppose them. With regard to the government's backdown on the books bounty, we consider that it has not gone far enough with the amendment it is proposing in this legislation. The opposition is of the view that the govern
         <break page="1982" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
          ment should have restored the original expiry date of 31 December 1997 put in place by Labor when it was in government—an expiry date the coalition signed up to before the 1996 election.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         With regard to the ships bounty, the government backdown extends it six months beyond the 30 June 1996 expiry date put in place by Labor. However, the measures which the government has announced are quite inadequate in meeting the needs of shipbuilders in this country and they have responded to the government's initiative by labelling the government's measures the Clayton's bounty and a failure.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The opposition will oppose this government amendment because of its failure to adequately link the bounty to an OECD agreement to eliminate shipbuilding subsidies. The OECD agreement is due to commence in July 1997 but has yet to be ratified by signatory countries. The weakness in what the government is proposing is that it does not provide a sufficient guarantee to industry that the government will extend the bounty if the OECD agreement is not ratified by that date.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The opposition's amendment in contrast would ensure the continuation of the ships bounty until the OECD agreement comes into force. This will establish a more secure investment climate for the industry in which it can negotiate its further contracts and get into the exporting ring in a bigger way.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is not the only weakness of the government's bill. The other major weakness relates to the phase&amp;hyphen;in period. There is an inherent advantage to overseas shipbuilders under the terms of the OECD agreement when compared to what the government is proposing in this legislation with regard to Australian shipbuilders. Under the OECD agreement, shipbuilders can still claim a subsidy up to three years after the agreement commences, provided the contract was signed before that date.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Under the government's legislation, the bounty can only be claimed for ships completed by the end of 1997. The advantage to overseas shipbuilders is patently obvious. The amendments that the opposition is proposing align Australia's arrangements squarely with
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          the OECD. This at least gives Australian producers the same tilt at industry assistance as overseas shipbuilders.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The shipbuilding industry in Australia has left us all in no doubt as to their assessment of the government's about&amp;hyphen;face in this legislation. They still regard the government's measures as a Clayton's shipbuilding bounty, as I mentioned before. I refer the House to a press release issued by the Australian Shipbuilders Association on 12 February 1997. In that press release they explicitly state that this is a Clayton's shipbuilding bounty and that the government's failure to address the bounty issue correctly heralds job cuts and more export losses. At a time when the national economy is struggling and we need extra jobs in manufacturing industry, and at a time when the balance of payments needs exports to bring that deficit down, here we have a deliberate measure being proposed by the government which will, on the advice of the shipbuilders of this nation and other manufacturers who receive the bounty, lead to a decrease in employment opportunities across those industries, particularly in regional areas, and will lead to a decline in exports. This is what the Chairman of the Australian Shipbuilders Association, Mr John Rothwell, had to say:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Australian shipbuilding industry is no better off than it was prior to the Federal Government's announcement to extend the shipbuilding bounty, and substantial stand&amp;hyphen;downs will be experienced in the near future.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         Further on he said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         While the industry was initially very excited and relieved by the announcement, it has proved to be nothing more than a disappointing teaser, and in reality of no value at all. We remain hugely disadvantaged.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         This is an industry which employs over 13,000 Australians directly or indirectly and last year earned in excess of half a billion dollars in export earnings. Here we have Mr Rothwell saying that what the government has announced is purely a tease. We have an industry minister who is a big tease. That is about all he can deliver. He does not deliver measures of substance and industry assistance measures of substance; he merely teases the industry while it struggles to compete with
         <break page="1983" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          heavily subsidised overseas manufacturers in the shipbuilding area.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think it is pertinent at this point to ask why the government is proposing these amendments in its legislation at all. Really, they are simply a humiliating backdown for the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), a minister who is regarded across the length and breadth of manufacturing industry in Australia as both hopeless and hapless.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But, of course, the government has changed its view on the measures that it announced in the 1996 budget because of the pressure that we have applied to it here on the floor of this House and out across the regions of Australia. I pay tribute to manufacturers in the industries that are affected by these measures and to the regional communities in which those firms are located for their substantial lobbying efforts on behalf of their workers and their families and their regional communities, because it has been that combination of pressure from the opposition, from regional communities and from industries themselves that has brought this pathetic change—if you can call it that—to the government's proposals.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I suppose we should be grateful for small mercies, that the industry minister has gone away and argued the toss before the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and come back with a few concessions to industry. But they do not go far enough. And the only measures and the only amendments that will really address the industry concerns are the ones that have been put on the floor of the House by the opposition.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Of course, the government could have saved itself a whole lot of trouble in this particular area, with this legislation, simply by sticking to its election promises. It gave specific commitments to manufacturers in the shipbuilding industry, in the computer industry, in the machine tools and robots industry and in the book printing industry. They were very specific commitments, and those commitments simply said that the government, when and if it came to power, would continue the arrangements that Labor had implemented when it was in power.

          The Prime Minister also said that those promises were predicated on the basis that, even if there was a deterioration in the deficit, or even if their worst fears were realised, the bottom line in all of this was that the Prime Minister would keep his promises to the Australian people. Well, he didn't. He didn't keep them to the shipbuilders of this nation or the book printers of this nation. He certainly didn't keep them to the regional communities who are now going to be affected by this exercise in industry assistance stupidity, and certainly not to the workers and their families who are employed in those particular industries.

         <para first-indent="16">
          At least we have extracted some concessions out of the government, as a response to the pressure that Labor brought to bear both in this House and out in regional communities. In the context of this debate, I am very pleased to make some comment on the remarks of the Treasurer yesterday when he arrogantly strutted this House claiming that no-one really knew what Labor stood for. This arrogant Treasurer is very much out of touch with what is happening in regional Australia.

          In Tasmania, they know what Labor stands for in regard to industry policy and the shipbuilding industry in particular.

In Maryborough, Victoria—I acknowledge the presence in the House of the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), who knows the midlands area and that town very well; he should know the devastating impact that the government measures will have on that particular community—they know very well what Labor stands for in regard to the assistance given to the printing industry in particular.

          We on this side of the House are very perplexed about what this arrogant Treasurer really stands for himself. We know that, as a founding member of the H.R.

Nicholls Society has come out in the last week and said that it is a betrayal and a sell-out. When asked in this House yesterday whether the Treasurer concurred with the views of this society that he established, all he could say was no—an arrogant no to a very substantial question which was asking the Treasurer where he stood on measures that affect the livelihoods of workers in regional industry.

          We on this side of the House have very great concerns about the competence of this arrogant Treasurer.

          The impact of the government's budgetary measures in the bounty legislation will be felt acutely in the regions of Australia—especially in Tasmania, Western Australia and Victoria. Last year when this measure was announced, I travelled to Maryborough in Victoria—a regional town which relies very heavily for its employment on the printing industry. I talked with industry leaders, community leaders and companies such as McPherson's which are going to be affected by the withdrawal of the book bounty and the withdrawal of other industry assistance measures that the government is emasculating in its budget. They expressed a total lack of confidence in the industry minister and also in the direction of the government's industry policy.

The Prime Minister's failure to do what he should have done has sent shock waves reverberating throughout regional Australia, because they have lost confidence in this industry minister and they have lost confidence in the industry policy of the government.

         I might add that my term in state politics probably led to the most major change in industrial expansion in the city of Maryborough that ever occurred. I was able to convince the Hon. Dick Hamer, the then Premier, that Maryborough needed natural gas. During my time as a state member there, the whole city of Maryborough was reticulated with natural gas, and that led to the expansion of industry and employment opportunities in the Maryborough area. There was a substantial growth in industry during that period.

         In fact, both of the firms I have mentioned—Australian Print Group and McPhersons Book Printers—have expanded as a result of the availability of natural gas and all the other infrastructure support that is available in the city of Maryborough. They have also been able to attract Nestle, the big sweets and confectionary manufacturer, as a result of natural gas being reticulated through that whole district.

In fact, the member for Barker and I, during the debate following the IC report in 1992, played a major role in overturning the ALP's direction of removing all of these bounties.

He did not deliver on the promise, nor did he put it into the budget estimates. It is very convenient for the member for Batman to be selective about his quotes. He is saying that I, as the member for Bendigo, have gone missing on the question of future book bounties and support for key jobs in the town of Maryborough and his electorate. I can assure you that that is not so. I have been very active on this issue. I have received representations from the Australian Publishers Association. I have made representations to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism and the minister has agreed to look at the situation of tariffs on any inputs into the book printing industry.

          Speakers before me in the debate have pointed out that it is poor government in terms of creativity. The member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) said it is an obsession with short&amp;hyphen;term debt cutting at the expense of long&amp;hyphen;term investment. Not only that, they are removing revenue which far exceeds the amount they are paying out in terms of the bounty. That is shown very much in research provided by the Australian Publishers Association with respect to the book bounty. Similar facts exist with respect to the ship bounty where we have received from PAYE tax revenue and payroll tax revenue in the order of $62 million from the ship bounty at a cost of $24 million. So we are well and truly ahead.

          With respect to the book bounty, the Australian Publishers Association has quantified the decline in PAYE taxation revenue at $9,634,000, a decline in payroll tax revenue at $2,733,000 and increases in unemployment benefits of over $21 million, at a total cost to the government in excess of $33 million, far exceeding the amount the government pays by way of this bounty. The removal of the books bounty six months ahead of time is going to mean the loss of some 1,500 jobs. That is unquestioned. With respect to the seat of Bendigo, Prentice&amp;hyphen;Hall has for the first time in nine years published a textbook offshore. That is the start of things to come.

That, in this day and age when so many people are connecting to the Internet, is a real tragedy. There is no other description for it.

Unless we have that, we will be forced to compete on the lower wages regime.

You cannot do that unless you build factories; you cannot build factories unless you equip them with tools and technology. Tooling is therefore essential if we want to develop sophisticated tools to equip our factories and if we want to develop the sophisticated robotics technology such as has been at the heart of progress in our car industry. As much as possible we want to tool our factories with these sophisticated pieces of machinery. Unless we do so, it will mean either that our factories do not have those tools or this technology or that they import it from overseas.

          —Like the member for Barton (Mr McClelland), I am somewhat saddened to rise to speak against the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill, as it serves as yet another stark and harsh example of one of the many popular and highly successful programs that the previous Labor government established to support Australia's small and medium size businesses which this government is best perhaps described as foolishly dismantling. It also serves as another stark example of the Howard government's duplicitous and misguided treatment of Australia's small business sector.

         We are not dealing with this bill because the government in any sense of the word believes that it is part of a broader strategy which may build upon the effective reforms already well under way and entrenched by the former Labor government. However, I do believe that the bill that we are debating here today and the underlying issues involved do indeed go to the heart of the difference between the Labor opposition and the coalition government in both their philosophy and approach to economic policy, and specifically to industry policy.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Those of us on this side of the House will be opposing this bill on a number of grounds, including its deleterious effects on specific regions of Australia which have become home to these particular industries, the fact that this bill represents yet another broken promise by the government and because, last but not least, it is simply poor policy enacted in the shabbiest and most duplicitous of ways.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I will go to some detail in regard to each of these bounties. Turning to the books bounty, Australia's printing and publishing companies and their workers have made significant gains in productivity reform and improvements in competitiveness throughout the course of the last decade. It is unfair and, indeed, unjust to attack in this way an industry that is making such profound progress halfway through its restructuring program merely to satisfy the government's short&amp;hyphen;term desire to balance the books. As the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) contended, this simply involves a short&amp;hyphen;term desire to cut debt at the expense of long&amp;hyphen;term investment. Indeed, our industries need some measure of certainty. This is an underpinning requirement for confidence before long&amp;hyphen;term investment can be generated.

         In the case of the books bounty, printing and publishing firms have been operating for some time now on the clear and unequivocal
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          understanding that the measure would be in place at least until the end of 1997. But the government's decision to prematurely end the bounty as of budget day last year makes it very difficult, and perhaps even impossible, for some firms in this industry to make long&amp;hyphen;term investment decisions with any degree of confidence whatsoever.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Even the Industry Commission, in its August draft report on the printing industry, recommended that the bounty be allowed to run through to 1997. Of course, the books bounty has had a significant impact on the international competitiveness of both the printing and publishing industries. The export of books, for example, has increased by some 200 per cent over the past 12 years. At a time when the government and economic analysts are calling for measures to deal with the level of Australia's foreign debt, the decimation of the book industry will have a disastrous effect on Australia's current account.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         According to the Printing Industries Association trade consultant, Mr Ronald Fisher, surveys by the Printing Industries Association indicate that up to 50 per cent of book production in Australia would be lost to overseas printers with the termination of this bounty. This would see a loss of book exports up to a value of $40 million to $50 million per annum and an increase in imports of up to $80 million per annum, an adverse impact on Australia's balance of payments to the tune of some $120 million.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The ending of the bounty will cut short this growth and significantly reduce employment in the industry. Of course, in the printing industry, job losses of up to 1,500 have been predicted, with a particularly severe impact upon regional centres such as Maryborough in Victoria, notwithstanding the best efforts of the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid). He has, I am sure, spoken long and hard in defence of industries within his own electorate, but that certainly has not been enough to stop companies like Prentice&amp;hyphen;Hall publishing a book offshore for the first time. The numbers of those in general working in the book and related industries will be cut by almost one-third.

          I turn briefly to the issue of the ships bounty. We have seen over the last decade the growth of what might best be described as an innovative and export oriented Australian industry in the construction of fast ships and ferries. With the assistance of the ships bounty, companies like Austal Ships in Fremantle and Incat in Launceston have grown from nothing to become major exporters in both the European and Asian markets.

          The abolition of the bounty in this bill will mean that this industry, which has so much potential, will not be able to compete with our international competitors who have subsidies of anywhere between nine per cent and 50 per cent. The Premier of Western Australia, Mr Court, in his letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) urging him to reconsider his decision in regard to this particular bounty put the case very clearly and, I believe, very cogently. Mr Court states in his letter:

         <para font-size="-=2">
          It is inconceivable that this huge export dollar earning industry can successfully survive when competing against subsidies such as those of Norway at 13.2%; Denmark between 8% and 13% and Italy between 15% and 50%.

          Mr Court goes on to say:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          Of great importance is the fact that the shipbuilding industry is not promoting hand outs. It can successfully compete in the international market on quality and expertise, but not if it is disadvantaged to the tune of 9% of the contract price. It is only asking that the present rate of 5% be retained until other OECD countries eliminate their subsidies.

          As Mr Court also attested in his letter, the beneficial impact of the ships bounty is clearly significant. Since the bounty's inception, production in the industry has grown by some 200 per cent, exports have grown by 150 per cent and employment levels have grown by 50 per cent.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I am sure Mr Court would share similar concerns about the computer bounty, given that there is the genesis of an effective and efficient west coast based computer industry being generated in the Perth area. It was the Labor government who, in 1995, had legislated to extend the operation of this computer bounty right through until the end of the year 2000.

         <para first-indent="16">
          During the election campaign, the coalition had matched this commitment. However, in the budget, adding to its ever growing list of broken promises, the government has abolished the bounty from 1 July 1997. Having recently taken part in the debate on the child care amendment legislation, where once again the opposition is in the unusual position of trying to keep one of the government's election promises not to means test child-care benefits, I am not greatly surprised to find another situation where the government is trying to worm its way out of one of its election promises.

          The Industry Commission, in its 1995 report on the computer hardware and software industry, found that firms used bounty moneys effectively, that in the absence of the bounty they may invest less or undertake less R&amp;D and that, for some firms, investment, R&amp;D, exporting and employment would cease without bounty assistance. Although the IC report recommended that the bounty should lapse, this was predicated on the continuation of schemes like the 150 per cent R&amp;D tax concession, the export market development grants scheme and the AusIndustry initiatives, all of which have been cut and slashed by this government.

          Mr Peter Upton, the Executive Director of the Australian Information Industry Association, described the government's decision to hasten the phasing out of the computer bounty as having `knocked one leg from under the chair of the information technology industry'. I am sure that Mr Upton would have similar sentiments had he been actively involved in the machine tools and robots industry because since the mid&amp;hyphen;1980s that industry has not become internationally competitive. It has shown an encouraging increase in both production and exports.

          For example, in the last three years, Australian production of bountiable machine tools has increased from around $95 million to $144 million when exports have doubled over the same period. The Industry Commission, in its draft report on the machine tools and robots industry, recently recommended that the bounty be retained until its legislated expiry date of 30 June 1997. In scrapping the bounty in the budget, the government has once again shown that it is happy to commission reports and then equally content simply to ignore them.

Whether through providing high quality infrastructure in transport and communication, through establishing an industrial relations system which encourages both harmony and productivity rather than conflict and division or through simply recognising that the Australian firms have a competitive advantage over their international rivals through their access to and use of technology and innovation, government has an obligation to ensure that the conditions that are necessary for a healthy and growing economy are set in place.

          —Your presence makes my day. We have heard a considerable amount in this debate about how essential these various bounties are to the survival of the firms and sectors that use them. The government has, on a number of occasions, acknowledged the role bounty assistance has played in the development of shipbuilding, books, computer manufacturing and machine tools and robot industries. The fact remains that the actual rates of assistance have fallen significantly over recent years as a result of policies implemented by the previous Labor government. For example, book bounties have fallen from 30 per cent in 1983 to 4.5 per cent from 1 January 1997. The machine tools and robots bounty has fallen from 40 per cent in 1988 to five per cent on 1 July 1996.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The industries that utilise the four bounties covered by this bill have been able to adjust. This has been acknowledged by the member for Hotham and by a number of independent reviews. The Industry Commission book bounty review noted, for example, that production of bountiable books had increased over 50 per cent in real terms since 1992 and at a time when the bounty rate was falling. The various reviews of bounties have also found the assistance measures have effectively run their course and should not be extended.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Nevertheless, the government has recognised that circumstances do exist which warrant some alteration to the provisions of the existing bill to put in more generous  transitional arrangements. For this reason, I will be moving in the consideration in detail stage several amendments to the bill which extend the termination dates for the shipbuilding and book bounties.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In conclusion, the government believes that the future of different industry sectors does not lie in debate about the possible long-term retention of low level bounty assistance. Rather the priority is to put in place a more comprehensive framework or strategy for industry that reflects the need to establish an appropriate environment for investment, access to overseas markets and effective business assistance programs.

         This amendment and those to be moved as government amendments Nos 2 and 3 give effect to my joint announcement with the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on 16 December 1996 with respect to the books bounty. These amendments defer the termination date for the

          books bounty, extending the government's previously announced termination date of 20 August by 10 months.

          —The opposition supports the first of these amendments, the amendment before the House at the moment, which in effect deletes the subsection of the Bounty (Books) Act which wound up the books bounty on budget night. We support totally the deletion of this provision from the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill. The effect of its deletion will be to restore the books bounty in its entirety. That is the position that we want supported in this House.

         However, I would remind the House that the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) has a further amendment which will restore the books bounty period until 30 June 1997—six months short of the original position. The original position was that the books bounty would remain until 31 December 1997. The first amendment that the government has brought forward is a backdown, but it is only a partial backdown. As a result of the campaign that we in opposition ran in the regions—we convinced those in the communities to pursue the campaign—we have seen a partial backdown, but the partial backdown does not go far enough.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         No-one can deny the significant impact that the books bounty has had on the growth of the industry. The industry has increased its book exports by 200 per cent over the past 12 years. These are not assistance measures to protect industries, they are measures that level the playing field. The countries with whom our book publishers must compete all have these bounties and other arrangements in place. The level playing field does not exist.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The reason these bounties were inserted by the Labor government was to enable these industries, which should be world competitive, to compete in the marketplace, but they
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          cannot do so because other countries have got measures in place that support their industries.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The purpose of the books bounty was to get our book publishers into the game. It is true that under Labor the books bounty would run out by the end of this year but we had undertaken to conduct an inquiry into what should occur post 31 December 1997. We would have required the Productivity Commission to have regard to two important things in its deliberations: first, the pace of change of our trading partners; and, second, the impact of the decision on regions and their jobs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We sought to get the government to accept these amendments when they introduced the Productivity Commission legislation in the last sitting fortnight, but they opposed them. They have no commitment to understanding what our trading partners are doing. They are expecting our participants in industry to unilaterally disarm and expose themselves to the rest of the world without any support, without any assistance, and to flourish in that environment. It does not happen.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We are saying, Minister, that you should not only put this amendment forward but also desist from the further amendments you will be moving. The first amendment will reinstate the books bounty and will enable the inquiry to proceed to decide where we go after 31 December this year, but your next amendment will curtail that. It will end the bounty six months down the track. We have had a partial victory but we want a total victory. We will be persisting with that view in this House.

          —I am pleased to be associated with this amendment to the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill. It is clear from the lack of attendance today and the lack of support for the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) that he is pursuing an amendment to what is, on balance, a fairly successful scheme. He is not supported today because the members of his backbench, especially those in regional Australia, know that they are the real losers.

         What are the real savings? We are talking about savings in the order of $4 million. That is not big bickies according to the current members of the government. Until they were
         <break page="1999" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          forced to back down because of the results of the polling conducted by Andrew Robb, they were prepared to move the Speaker's chair at a cost of $500,000. That $4 million is not big bickies in the mind of the minister for industry—after all, in terms of his lifestyle, it is not even worth a big drink. That is what he is on the record as being concerned about.

         It goes to a question of the impact of these proposed changes on regional Australia. Yesterday afternoon, in the debate concerning this all&amp;hyphen;important bill, I raised the question of the impact on regional Australia. It goes to a question of a fairly fundamental issue—jobs.

         I find it strange that the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), for example, is not here this afternoon speaking in support of the amendment moved by the shadow spokesperson for industry. If anyone ought to be on his feet at the moment, rather than cowering in the corridors of Parliament House, it is the member for Bendigo. He ought to be in here this afternoon standing up for the town of Maryborough.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In case the member for Bendigo does not know, Maryborough is in his electorate—it is not in Queensland, it is actually near the town of Bendigo. Twenty&amp;hyphen;five per cent of the work force in Maryborough depends on the book industry through two key employers. Worse still, it is an area of high unemployment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is an area that demands government assistance. It is an area that is prepared to stand on its own two feet, provided the government has a well thought out industry policy which creates opportunities for that town. Twenty&amp;hyphen;five per cent of that town—which covers quite a considerable number of families—depends on the bounty system.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I said, the people of that town are prepared to stand up and be counted. They are prepared to deliver. All they are asking for is a helping hand in accordance with the original proposal with respect to this bill. Instead, they will suffer as a result of the initiatives of the minister for industry. They will suffer a full frontal attack on the welfare and livelihood of that town. One&amp;hyphen;quarter of the local work force is dependent on this bill. Two big printing firms—the Australian Print Group and
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          McPherson's Printing Group—are central to that local economy.

        <para first-indent="16">
         That might not mean much to the minister for industry, because I dare say he has not got shares in those two companies, but it means a lot to the livelihood of that town. The government ought to embrace this amendment. It is not big bickies, it is not even a big drink in the mind of the minister for industry—it is  $4 million. However, in terms of that town it is big bickies—25 per cent of the work force.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I can understand why the minister for industry is feeling the pinch this afternoon. They might not be game to come here, stand up and speak about the importance of this bill, but out on the back bench they are vitally concerned. If I were the member for Bendigo I would be concerned about an unemployment rate of 10.5 per cent. I would be concerned about the potential job losses from the impact of ripping away additional assistance for a very short period in a town of high youth unemployment, a town that needs government assistance, an area that is already suffering from high unemployment, an area that is crying out for a reasonable industry policy approach.

         On balance, it is about time the government took up what was a fairly objective criticism by the former chief executive officer of the Metal Trades Industry Association. Everything is not a cost, it is an investment—it is about investment in industry and investment in regional Australia.

          —This is the most important part of this amendment because it reduces the period for this bounty back six months. For the paltry sum of $4 million, this government is going to place in jeopardy many jobs in the printing industry and the fact is that there has been no argument put in this debate. No argument has been put by the minister in this consideration in detail stage about any rationale for not keeping the bounty until 31 December 1997. There has been no attempt by the minister to give any full explanation of why that is so. He relies on the joint press release he made with the Treasurer (Mr Costello) but that has no explanation of why the bounty period is to be reduced by six months. Here we have an argument in this chamber over bringing the expiration of the bounty back from 31 December to 30 June 1997. As my colleagues, the members for Hotham (Mr Crean) and Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), have indicated, what the minister has to understand is the regional consequences of the decision that his government is involved in. We have acknow

         The thing that we wish to see is the response from the minister on this point. He sat there, babbling away, interjecting, not putting any concrete case to justify either the original decision or the ensuing backflip. Why is the six-month period so important? Obviously it is only important because of the budget bottom line and the $4 million that it is likely to save in the budget. That is just not good enough for the people of Maryborough where the printing industry employs something like 25 per cent of the township's employment force. They need answers from the government about the alternatives. What are the alternatives? Simply put, the overall macro settings that they rely upon have not eventuated into jobs. What the Australian community is looking for is Australian jobs. This is an argument about Australian jobs. What we need to see from the minister today is some indication of what it is that he is arguing in cabinet against those cabinet ministers who are from the dry faction of his party and are very much anti&amp;hyphen;job.

         of Friday, the Australian Publishers Association put a proposition. The Australian Publishers Association's proposition was based on the fact that the cost to the budget of the government's policy is likely to be $28.6 million over 12 months based on the lower tax revenue and the higher unemployment.

          Unfortunately, that association's solution is to ask that the tariff on imported paper should be removed at the same time that this bounty is decreased. Which state would be most affected if this tariff was removed? Which state would be the most affected? Tasmania. So, in juggling the regions we are going to trade one region off against another.

          This is the whole problem. When the Productivity Commission legislation was before us and the opposition said that the Productivity Commission should take into account the regional aspects of policy ideas, the Minister denied that that should be part of the Productivity Commission's considerations. The survival of the regions is dependent on this.

         I want to draw the House's attention to the legislation that was introduced in 1992 by the ALP. The Australian Labor Party, when in government, introduced a bill into this House, following an Industry Commission report in 1992, to abolish all book bounties.

The proposal I put to the minister was put to me by the Australian Publishers Association who believe that there should be a correction on the other side of the ledger that would be related to the tariff on inputs into the industry.

         Let me just come to some of the issues that the member for Bendigo has raised. He talks about the loss of memory and about the fact that I, in this House, supported a resolution to abolish the books bounty. I think that this is what he was inferring, although he never quite stated it because he did not know what he was talking about. In 1992, the Labor government did propose the abolition of the books bounty. But it did not do it and do you know why? The member for Rankin (Mr Beddall) and the member for Hotham were in there saying, `Don't do it,' and it was not done. That is why the book bounty exists. I say to the member for Bendigo that if the book bounty had been abolished, why would we be up dealing with it today? The only people seeking to abolish it are the Liberals, aided and abetted by the member for Bendigo.

         The question of the art gallery in Bendigo is really getting under the guard of the member for Bendigo. You try to say that the former Prime Minister promised the $2 million. He did, but so did you. You went to the press and said, `We need to be able to match this promise.' You promised them $2 million. Do you know what? He then got the Treasurer (Mr Costello) out, and the Treasurer said, `We are not going to give you that $2
         <break page="2007" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          million but we will fund a feasibility study and we will give you $100,000.' This is the Alan Bond solution. This is payment of 5c in the dollar. That is your treatment of the electorate of Bendigo. That is your approach. You promised them $2 million, and you gave them $100,000. You are a disgrace. You are a disgrace to the electorate of Bendigo, because you will not stand up for them.

         I make this further point. You talked about what Labor did in 1975 and did under the tariff plans that Labor introduced for textiles and clothing. None of the companies that we visited the other day—Empire Rubber, Stafford Ellinson, ADA—would have been in existence had it not been for Labor's automotive and textile plans. You go and talk to them. Your problem is that it is a bit expensive to make the long distance phone call from New York, and they will not pick it up, in your case. You are irrelevant because you cannot do anything for Bendigo. You cannot deliver the art gallery. You cannot deliver jobs in Maryborough.

I can tell the House that the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) and I constructed some amendments, and those amendments were forced onto the government. The attitude of the present government has always been that the former Prime Minister did not worry about buying local products; he bought Italian suits and French clocks.

It is all very fine for members on the other side of the chamber to have memory lapses about the role that they played in putting forward legislation to abolish the book bounty in 1992. Do not worry, the people of Maryborough still remember that legislation and the people in the book industry remember that legislation. The legislation was introduced by the Australian Labor Party to totally remove the book bounty. It is no good members opposite moving away from that position because it is all on the record. They can deny it as much as they like. In this instance, the minister has given an undertaking that he will look at the tariff on inputs into the book manufacturing industry.

When we went and talked to the people about the book bounty, we saw that the proposal that was before the government at the time would damage local industry.

He should listen to the local people and not knock off this very important bounty.

         Bounties are important in the way that we build our local industries.

We work closely together on these issues. As the chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, he probably has more knowledge than the minister does. What the minister should do is listen to the chairman. The minister should take note of this and give a commitment that he will retain the book bounty, then the member for Bendigo can go back to his electorate and tell them that he has succeeded on their behalf.

         , in its brief analysis of the proposition being put by the APA, says that the basis of that submission is that the tariffs on imported paper should be removed. I remind the minister that the report goes on to say that the impact of that will be job losses in Tasmania. The overall effect of the bill that we have before us is to drive Australian jobs offshore; to drive the jobs of those in Maryborough that are working in the print industry offshore to our neighbours in the Asian region. The proposal now being put as a solution to save the jobs of those in Maryborough is to deny the jobs of those in Tasmania. Perhaps there is some forgetfulness in the people that are proposing this, like the honourable member for Bendigo, in that they need to be reminded that, whilst Tasmania might be overseas, Tasmanians' jobs are Australian jobs.

This government seems incapable of understanding that the directions of their policies have to take into account the impact of those policies at the regional level. If one looks at the month to month unemployment figures—and this debate is about jobs, Australian jobs, keeping them in Australia not driving them overseas—the government needs to take into account the regional impacts.

One of the things I recall the Labor Party boasting about was the record number of positive quarters of growth. You might be interested to know that the figures released today showed a revision to zero growth in the March 1995 quarter. The long, so-called interrupted run that we were always told about has just been revised out of existence. Indeed, the March 1996 quarter was revised downwards from 2.1 per cent to 1.6 per cent.

         The Deputy Leader of the Opposition asks why we would see things slowing over the course of 1996. Most people who follow these things closely would know that probably the principal reason for that was the way in which monetary policy was tightened at the end of 1994. It was a deliberate decision by the

We have passed, after some obstruction from the Labor Party and, initially, from others in the Senate, the Workplace Relations Act, the provisions of which are progressively coming into operation. They provide a far better, a more beckoning and a more benign climate for major projects in this country. The provisions of that act are far more likely to encourage people to invest in this country than did the old industrial relations regime which the new Workplace Relations Act has replaced.

         Our commitment to improve the climate of operation for small business in this country is undoubted and undiminished. There is also a very major role in the future of Australia's economy for the development of major projects attracting large levels of investment, both domestically and from overseas. We need a heightened, more concentrated effort to sweep away the obstruction, the bureaucratic delay, the red tape, the unnecessary obfuscation which is often involved in the process of government approval and determination. I believe Mr Mansfield's appointment will strike a very strong blow in that direction.

Since March 1996, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has reported 160,000 new jobs in Australia and, on an adjusted basis, there could in fact be up to 200,000 jobs created over the period.

It is something that this government, I believe, and this Prime Minister, if I may say so, will be able to look back on in decades to come and say that the government in 1996 had the courage to put this trust together—one of the most long-sighted environmental developments that we have ever seen in this country and, I regret to say, opposed by the Labor Party root and branch at every step that we took to put in place this environmental trust.

There have been a number of recent media reports in respect of the sale process for the long-term leases of Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth airports. I am pleased to say that we have received a total of 18 individual, strong, competitive and high quality bids from nine consortia. Each of those bids has been thoroughly reviewed by the asset sales team, which includes BZW—the government's advisers—against a comprehensive set of evaluation criteria based on the government's stated sales and ongoing privatisation objectives.

Following that extensive and exhaustive evaluation process, the government, as flagged as an option in the tender documentation issued to the bidders, has decided to leave 13 individual bids, from six of the bidding consortia, on the table for the next stage of the process.

         I acknowledge the contribution in this process made by the opposition, particularly by the former Minister for Finance, the now Leader of the Opposition, who actually commenced this process.

I am not so sure that new Labor shares the same support that the Leader of the Opposition formerly gave.

I sincerely hope that his view does not come through in the end.

Is the Attorney aware that thousands of mainstream Australians are demonstrating today against the government's destruction of our legal aid system? Does the Attorney recall telling the House yesterday that the Queensland government will enter into an agency agreement to deliver Commonwealth legal aid in that state,

Isn't the legal aid system now in chaos because of the Attorney's inconsistent statements and his inability to win an argument in cabinet?

          —There are two things wrong with legal aid. One is that the Labor government allowed the system to drift for 10 years under out&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;date agreements. The other arose out of the budget deficit black hole, which required cutting of programs like legal aid. The honourable member for Banks has, I know, a genuine interest in legal aid, but I am surprised he does not have a greater interest in Aboriginal legal aid, about which he has not asked any questions at all.

         Let me deal first with the question relating to Queensland. Queensland announced yesterday, completely consistent with what we have been seeking, that they will have a system under which they will be accountable for state funding provided for state matters, which enables us to join with them in a cooperative delivery of legal aid services in Queensland on the basis that the Commonwealth is accountable for funding for Commonwealth legal matters. That is exactly what we set out to achieve.

         We have maintained the present cooperative arrangement in Queensland by having a one&amp;hyphen;stop shop. A one&amp;hyphen;stop shop provides the service.

We are having negotiations with a number of jurisdictions and we have reached broad agreement with two of them. We are progressing negotiations on a daily basis.

         For the member for Banks to suggest the system is therefore in chaos or crisis I think suggests that his motives are not consistent with the interests of legal aid clients. Let's get behind getting the system working in a way that enables governments to account to legal aid clients. Let's reform the system so that the

         Cloning is nothing new. It was first achieved in 1952 in tadpoles. But what is new is that it has been successful in higher animals. Two days ago it was announced at the Oregon Primate Research Centre in the United States that a monkey had been successfully cloned and it was on the basis of this that President Clinton announced overnight that federal funding would not be available for research into human cloning. He was responding to a situation that exists in the United States. The situation in Australia is different, as I will outline in a moment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Of course, the problem for society is that the technology of cloning and its experimentation are progressing at a much faster rate than that at which society can contemplate the scientific, social or ethical implications of such experiments. It has been given more urgency because the cloning of a primate is something very significant as it is the species most close to the human race genetically. It is very difficult to contemplate what the long&amp;hyphen;term prospects might be.

        <break page="2018" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          The situation in Australia basically has three points to it. The first is that, under NHMRC guidelines, human experimentation with the aim of producing two or more genetically identical offspring, which is in fact cloning, is prohibited. The NHMRC has the Australian Health Ethics Committee, a subcommittee which has published ethical guidelines on assisted reproductive technology. These were tabled in parliament in November last year.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The NHMRC is of the view that such experimentation is unethical. It would not be funded under the National Health and Medical Research Council. The other great body of funding in Australia is the Australian Research Council and they take note of the NHMRC guidelines. The NHMRC also has a statement on human experimentation. Supplementary note 7 has been issued to that. It prohibits gene therapy that has the potential to change the genetic material that can be passed on from one generation to another.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Human cloning is governed by state law. The Commonwealth does not have the right to legislate in this area. In Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria it is illegal. However, in the other states and territories what is not covered by the NHMRC or the Australian Research Council would almost certainly be found to be unethical through either hospital or other research institute guidelines. I can assure honourable members that the government is of the view that experimentation on human cloning is beyond the bounds of what are acceptable guidelines. The National Health and Medical Research Council is aware of our view.

Is it not the case that the current tariff, abolished by the government yesterday at $55 per tonne—an effective 13 per cent—is comfortably within that obligation? Is it not the case that the sugar tariff on many of our export destinations is massively higher than that? For example, the US is at 100 per cent, Thailand is at 104 per cent and the European Union is at 170 per cent. How does the government's establishment of a zero sugar tariff for Australia stand with the Prime Minister's statement to the parliament last year that the government would take into account what other countries are doing or, as the

          the minister stated that company only trials would begin soon at a number of export meat establishments and, as he said, using qualified company inspectors supervised by a government veterinarian. Given this entirely predictable response from the US, why didn't the minister do his homework first before boasting about proposed reforms to the meat inspection system? And when will the government release a progress report on the project 2 trials?

          Late last year, I did release a detailed report prepared by Price Waterhouse and Maxwell and Druce International about the expanding opportunities in our region, in South-East Asia, for the development of this industry. The interesting figure is that it is estimated that there is some $600 million worth of sports exports to Australia in a variety of forms, to which I refer, up to the year 2000.

          Finally, and in conclusion, can I indicate also that one of the examples of the achievements that we have been able to see from our sportspeople is in the recent result in the cricket match in South Africa. Four of the members of that team—Glenn McGrath, Shane Warne, Greg Blewett, who got 214 runs, by the way, and Michael Bevan—were all graduates of the Australian Institute of Sport Cricket Academy in Adelaide. That is the sort of example that can go to showing the rest of the world what we can achieve and help further this industry to expand.

They announced that they have doubled their exports in the past 12 months and in the next 12 months they expect to double them again. The important and significant point that comes up from British Aerospace, which is based largely in South Australia, is that defence industry is worth three per cent of South Australia's state domestic product and is just as important as the wine industry is to that state. They employ 1,800 people and their determination to comply with the five principles this government has laid down means that there are more job opportunities and more exports coming into this country.

          —I thank the honourable member for Kingston for her question. I know she is very concerned about environmental issues and I know she is also concerned about jobs, including for the people of Kingston and the people of Adelaide and South Australia. The government has received advice of the European Union's negotiating target proposal for all OECD countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 15 per cent compared to the 1990 levels by 2010. The EU intends to submit this proposal to the negotiations currently taking place in Bonn.

         The House may be aware that the Australian government is arguing for what is described as a differentiation proposal in these climate change negotiations. That is to ensure that there is an equitable sharing of the burden amongst all of the so-called annexe 1 countries, which are in effect the OECD countries. There is no reason why this country
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          should be asked to bear a disproportionate burden in addressing the climate change issue.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The European Union proposal contains a differentiation proposal itself. It contains differentiation for individual EU member states but excludes this possibility for the OECD countries. So there are different targets for individual member states—for example, Portugal's target allows emissions in 2010 to increase by 40 per cent, Greece's target is to increase by 30 per cent, Spain's by 17 per cent and so on.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Australia, along with other non-EU OECD countries, is being asked to accept a uniform flat rate reduction of 15 per cent, and that is clearly not going to be acceptable. It is inconsistent for the EU to deny others what they are using as a key element of their own efforts to address climate change.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The fact is that a 15 per cent reduction target by 2010 is unrealistic. As we see it, it is little more than a negotiating tactic at this stage by the European Union. It also has to be said that the European Union proposal is frankly unworkable because it does not provide a sound framework for long-term cooperative action to address the climate change issue.

          —Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Of course this minister, as the then opposition spokesman, was forced to withdraw this proposal in January 1994. In an interview of the day, he went on the record saying that he no longer felt this was an economically viable proposition. Indeed, he rejected the hypothetical proposition which he had been advancing for the electorate. He went on to say:

          What are we referring to when we talk about nuclear fuel reprocessing? Most members are familiar with nuclear power plants. They are familiar with the very safe operation of the Lucas Heights facility over the last 40 years. But most people are not so familiar with nuclear fuel reprocessing.

          You have to wait some 30 years for the spent fuel rods to cool sufficiently for them to be reprocessed. They are then treated with concentrated nitric acid, forming a very hot liquid and some gaseous components as well. This hot, thermally active and radioactive liquid is then separated into its respective components.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Those components are uranium and waste material which is still very radioactive and in liquid form, and there is the potential for a small amount of plutonium to come from this process as well. That plutonium is very significant, and I think honourable members should keep sight of that as we proceed through this discussion.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          One thing nuclear fuel reprocessing does not do is that it does not reduce the level of radioactivity of the material concerned. At the end of the process, you still have very substantial quantities of radioactive material, although you have it in separate components. Instead of a mixture of nuclear fuel, you now have the uranium, the plutonium and the liquid waste separated out. You do not have any less radioactivity, but you do have a massive increase in the volume of this material. We are now required to deal with massive amounts of liquid radioactive waste, and this is what the minister proposes to locate at Lucas Heights in the middle of suburban Sydney. Minister, this is not a vision for science; this is more an illusion which is going to become a nightmare for the people of Sutherland Shire.

           Secondly, there used to be economic reasons for reprocessing. It used to be necessary to extract the uranium from the reprocessing in order to have uranium to feed back into the nuclear fuel cycle. Uranium, of course, is now quite plentiful. Australia is not short of uranium, if it wishes to supply its reactor, and that is no longer a necessary objective. The third reason is that it does in some small way facilitate disposal because you have separate components with which to deal rather than a homogenous group. But taken in totality in 1997, this is not an adequate reason to proceed with the reprocessing of nuclear fuel in this country.

           Nuclear reprocessing is an option in England. The British government has established a number of very major reprocessing facilities in Dounreay and Sellafield that have been in operation for some time. There is a very strong view in the nuclear industry that the only reason those plants are continued, maintained and indeed expanded is because Britain and France—its colleague country in this regard—have already made substantial investments in the nuclear fuel cycle, and they have significant plants which need to be maintained. That is why they are in that business.

           As an alternative to a pilot plant, the minister may have in mind—and given his past enthusiasm for the nuclear industry—importing waste from other countries. Indeed, he has commented on this as being part of the fast growing Asian nuclear region. He may want to attack some of his theories in the nuclear club by having Australia be part of this arrangement and import nuclear waste. I think the honourable member for Hughes (Mrs Vale) would need to ask what the hidden agenda is behind the government's plans for an airport at Holsworthy. Is one of those agendas the importation of nuclear fuel through that airport? I sincerely hope not, because that would expose us to even greater risks than the minister's bizarre proposal already does.

         Despite the member for Bonython understandably rejoicing in the event of today and in the attention that it has brought him and the issue, he has three major problems—and he did not overcome any of the problems during his address. The first is that the Labor Party did nothing in government for 13 years to address this problem. We have inherited this. We have come to government, and the advice from ANSTO is that next year the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

         Instead of seeking a reasoned, sensible and calm debate on this issue, the Labor Party seizes on a front page story dramatically presented with a headline, photos and sketches but which reveals nothing new or different. They come in here and turn up the temperature. During his whole address, the member threw around words like `nuclear power', `nuclear fuel enrichment' and `nuclear proliferation', instead of addressing the one issue—that is, how do we dispose of the spent fuel which is an unavoidable by-product of the research reactor?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second problem is that the Labor Party spent, in round figures, $40 million in research into Synroc technology. If I understand them correctly, we are now not entitled to consider that as an option. You tell the Australian taxpayers, firstly, that you spent $40 million over 13 years on a technology that you were never going to use in government—and which never sees the funding, by the way—and, secondly, that we are not entitled to consider it as an option. You tell them that you have wasted $40 million. You will not. Of course we are entitled to consider the Synroc technologies. You would have done in government, I suspect. But from your remarks now, I am not so certain.

Thirdly, you have no policy yourself on how to dispose of these 1,600 spent fuel rods. I listened very carefully to every word, particularly to see whether or not you would finish up with a declaration of how you would dispose of the 1,600 spent fuel rods. The member for Bonython failed to do that, Mr Deputy Speaker. So what credibility do you have? With what seriousness should we regard your protestations on behalf of the people of Hughes, for whom we have real interest because we want to dispose of the spent fuel rods?

HIFAR is also used to analyse more than 33,000 samples each year for the minerals and oil exploration industries in Australia.

          The government is very supportive of this essential facility. In medical, environmental, industrial and research terms, ANSTO serves the nation extremely well. It does not deserve the adverse publicity which the opposition and the minor parties are now visiting upon it. The hypocrisy of anyone, including the member for Bonython, to accuse me or the government of letting down ANSTO is astounding. It is they, the opposition, who are stirring up community feelings on this issue. We will fully, properly and responsibly consider all of the factors that go to make up the different options available to the government for this unavoidable problem. It is not going to go away.

          Remember that ANSTO is Australia's only producer of radioisotopes which are used in treating and detecting illnesses which include cancer, thyroid disease, heart disease and others. There are over 100 nuclear medicine departments in Australia performing an estimated 300,000 diagnostic tests and 4,000 treatments annually with a combined value approaching $200 million. In an average year, more than 250,000 Australians—I mentioned 260,000 Australians earlier on—will have a nuclear medicine procedure and, on average, one in every two Australians can now expect one in their lifetime.

          These and other non-invasive procedures have replaced the need for much exploratory surgery to assess a patient's condition, significantly reducing discomfort and cost to patients. Use of these tests also reduces the length of hospital stays. Sales of ANSTO's radio pharmaceuticals to the Australian market now exceed $11 million annually. Some $700,000 of ANSTO's radio pharmaceuticals are also exported to South-East Asia, where the market is estimated to be $25 million and growing at more than 10 per cent annually.

          —It is scaremongering, as my good friend and colleague over there says. The opposition are clearly desperate to find something to put to this chamber and have come up with this. What is even worse is that, with these utterly misleading statements, they have been playing on the fears of good, decent, ordinary people in Sydney and they have been insulting people, trying to assume
          <break page="2037" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           that they are ignorant of what all this stands for and of all the fine things that ANSTO has done. My good colleague the member for Gippsland and minister for science has already outlined what a fantastic job ANSTO has done. I might add they were doing that while the Labor Party was in power, too. I did not hear the Labor Party complaining at the time about all the good things that were done by ANSTO for the health of Australians.

         The way the Labor Party has behaved is quite extraordinary, and I would be far more concerned for the people of Australia and for the people Hughes about having a recycled member for Hughes in the form of Mr Tickner. Look at the damaging consequences of what he did. Look at the Hindmarsh Island fiasco and think what a reincarnation of the Keating government would mean. We would have the former member for Hughes back. It would be a disaster. The budget deficit would come back. Interest rates would go up. We would see all the woes that the people of Australia thought they had got rid of when, in March last year, they decided that they had to get rid not only of the then member for Hughes but also—

The minister, in his complete demolition of this matter, made some very salient points about the Labor Party's problems. He made three points very clearly and enunciated them in a way that all honourable members opposite should have listened to.

          Firstly and most importantly, he pointed out that Labor had 13 years to look at the problem of what to do with the nuclear fuel rods, and they did nothing—except spend $40 million thinking about what they might do. They never actually did anything. That is the first point, and all honourable members opposite ought to be reminded of that, particularly those who were not here during the debate earlier.

          The second point he made clearly was that the $40 million was spent on developing Synroc. Then the member for Bonython said, `That's okay, but we are not allowed to use it in Australia.' We will develop it, but that is for someone else—not in my backyard. It has got to be in another country. We do not care where, as long as it is not in Australia.

          The opposition, having failed to learn from 13 years in government, has no policy today. There was absolutely nothing put forward in the debate today to tell us what we might do. So all we get is this scaremongering and, frankly, I think it is damned irresponsible the way the Labor Party put all this up. It ought to be made very clear to those people who live in Sydney that the Labor Party have done nothing but go out and try to run a scaremongering campaign—and insult people's intelligence by making all sorts of outrageous claims.

Then he said, `Synroc has to go overseas'—the same sort of thing. Then he started on the problems of radiation. He even referred to some place called `Nuclear Heights'—I do not know where it is.

The smartest thing they could have done was withdraw it before it even got listed for debate.

          Having listened to what the minister had already said, it was quite clear they had made a dreadful mistake; and now they are coming along, still trying to create fear. Having already been made to look like fools over this whole thing, they then turned around trying to run this fearmongering and deceptive sort of debate, trying to create fear amongst all those people who live in Sydney and totally misleading them. I suggest that this is a very poor effort and the chamber deserves better than they have heard today.

         This dairy produce levy bill has two purposes. Firstly, this bill, in conjunction with the Australian Animal Health Council (Live&amp;hyphen;Stock Industries) Funding Amendment Bill 1997, will establish a statutory levy to fund the dairy industry's contribution to the Australian Animal Health Council Ltd. Secondly, this bill will double the maximum research levy rate specified in the Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Act 1986.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Australian Animal Health Council Ltd, or AAHC for short, has been established as Australia's peak animal health body. Its mission is to ensure that Australia's animal health service system is capable of maintaining acceptable national animal health standards which meet both consumer needs and market requirements in domestic and international markets.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         AAHC is jointly owned and funded by the Commonwealth, state governments, the Northern Territory government and the peak representative bodies of Australia's livestock industries, including the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation. To date, the dairy industry's contribution to AAHC has been met from surplus moneys paid to the Dairy Research and Development Corporation upon cessation of the exotic animal disease program and supplemented by a payment from the Australian Dairy Corporation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The peak industry body, the Australian Dairy Industry Council, has sought the establishment of a levy mechanism as a transparent means of meeting the industry's funding commitment to the AAHC, as currently occurs with Australia's other livestock industries. The levy would be imposed in the same manner as other dairy industry levies, that is,
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          on the milk fat and protein content of an individual producer's milk supply.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The need to increase the maximum research levy rate has arisen because the current operational research levy rate, which partially funds the activities of the Dairy Research and Development Corporation, is very close to the legislated maximum rate. The present situation provides very little scope for further increases and may significantly curtail the ability of the Dairy Research and Development Corporation to respond to the needs of the industry in the near future.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would point out that a doubling of the maximum research levy will not automatically lead to a rise in the actual research levy rate paid by producers. Rather, it will provide scope for the dairy industry to seek government approval for an increase in the actual levy rate, as the need arises. The increase in the maximum research levy rate has the full support of the Australian Dairy Industry Council.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The dairy industry has enjoyed significant growth in recent years, with milk production in 1996&amp;hyphen;97 expected to pass nine billion litres for the first time on record. Around half of this production will be exported with the value of exports expected to be about $1.8 billion. These amendments will enhance the capacity of the dairy industry to undertake animal health and research and development activities which, in turn, will contribute to further industry growth and improved competitiveness in domestic and international markets. I commend the bill to honourable members and hand over the explanatory memoranda.

        The purpose of this bill is to amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921 (the Tariff Act) to ensure the continuing excisability of all beverages which contain distilled alcohol, including spirits, regardless of their alcohol content.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Under item 2 of the schedule to the Tariff Act, `spirituous beverages' are subject to duties of excise, which are calculated at a dollar amount per litre of alcohol in each beverage. The term was introduced into the Tariff Act in 1985 with the intention of making excisable any beverage that contained a spirit. Since that time, all such beverages have been treated as excisable regardless of their alcohol content, including beverages whose alcohol content ranges from five per cent to nine per cent, for example, the rum and cola mixer drinks.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In November 1994 Carlton and United Breweries, CUB, commenced the manufacture of the product known as `Subzero Alcoholic Soda' which had an alcohol content of approximately 5.5 per cent. The Australian Customs Service, the ACS, considered `Subzero' excisable under subitem 2(H) of the schedule to the Tariff Act as a spirituous beverage. CUB appealed the decision of the ACS to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the AAT.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        On 7 June 1996 the AAT determined that the production of `Subzero', with such a low
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         alcohol content by volume, could not be described as spirituous and was therefore not excisable under subitem 2(H). The decision was based on what the AAT considered is commonly regarded as the definition of `spirit' in the community, which is a strong alcoholic liquor usually containing not less than 37 per cent alcohol by volume. The ACS is appealing this decision to the Federal Court.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Since the AAT decision, CUB has ceased manufacturing `Subzero' using alcohol derived by distillation. However, there are several other companies—UDA, Remy Australia, Swift and Moore and Angove—who manufacture beverages of low alcohol content which are based on, for example, brandy or whisky. The ACS has continued to impose excise duty under subitem 2(H) on these beverages as they are considered by the ACS to be spirituous beverages. The payments of excise duty by these other manufacturers are being made under deposit in accordance with section 154 of the Excise Act 1901 on the basis that, since the AAT `Subzero' decision, these manufacturers allege that these beverages are no longer excisable.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Prior to this decision, there was no dispute with manufacturers of the low alcohol beverages using distilled alcohol as to their excisability nor to their proper classification to subitem 2(H) of the schedule to the Tariff Act.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The combination of these amendments will remove any connotation as to the strength that an alcoholic beverage must be before it will be excisable. All such beverages will continue to be excisable regardless of their alcohol content and the excise duty will be calculated

       <para first-indent="16">
        It is also proposed that the amendments will take effect on and from 3 February 1996. The effect of the retrospective commencement date of the amendments will be to extinguish all rights of appeal to the AAT in relation to the excisability of low alcohol beverages and all rights to refunds of excise duty in respect of such beverages. The commencement of the amendments on this date is considered justifiable on the following grounds:

       <para style="Para">
        (a)
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         As previously referred to, the intention of the term `spirituous beverages' was to make excisable any beverage that contained a spirit and there had never been any dispute as to this intention prior to the `Subzero' case. It is considered that the amendments are not altering the law with respect to alcoholic beverages as it stood at the time of the `Subzero' decision but are merely clarifying what was the status quo. It is therefore considered appropriate that the amendments commence on 3 February 1996 to remove the technical loophole which was uncovered in the Tariff Act by that decision which this amending legislation is now removing.

       </para>
       <para style="Para">
        (b)
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The commencement of the amendments on 3 February 1996 would not require the retrospective recovery of any excise duty from the manufacturers of the alcoholic beverages. The excise duty has continued to be paid by the manufacturers, under deposit, and the 3 February 1996 commencement would protect the government against all claims for recovery of this duty. If the amendments do not commence on 3 February 1996, however, the government might be liable to pay $12.6 million in refunds of excise duty if the Federal Court confirms the AAT decision in favour of CUB. Given that the products manufactured by these companies have been sold duty paid, such a favourable decision to the companies would represent a windfall gain to them, with little chance that it would be returned to the consumers of the product.

         The original legislation counted every student equally for the purposes of the registration charge. This amendment specifies that students doing courses 26 weeks or less will only count for half that value for the purposes of the registration charges. It acknowledges the large number of students doing short courses. I suppose the amendment means that the scheme can be rendered analogous to the purchase of motor car insurance: we are not only providing a discount for fleet buyers but also, in a sense, providing a discount for low mileage.

         The problem with the original piece of legislation was brought to the attention of the government by the industry associations, by the opposition, by the Australian Democrats and by the Greens. As a result, this amendment has gone through the Senate and it has now come before the House. May I say that the process by which this was achieved in the Senate is an example of how a responsible upper house can improve legislation. I commend the amendment to the House.

There were measures debated in the parliament and the public arena through the course of 1996 that dealt with those matters. We regard this provision at item 1 of schedule 1, an amendment to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, as a backdoor way of achieving the things that the government could not achieve last year. It is opposed by the Labor Party and we will be voting accordingly.

          —Further to the comments of the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), I would just like to add with respect to the abolition of the accelerated depreciation provisions regarding Australian ships that this is part of a broader attack on Australia's maritime industry by this government and it is particularly inappropriate when you consider the availability of accelerated depreciation for a range of other equipment, particularly in the agricultural and mining sectors.

         There are two key points that I would like to make in this debate on this issue. The first is that, almost without exception, the countries that Australia competes with in the maritime industry support their industries in some form or other with provisions such as accelerated depreciation, tax rebates for their seafarers and other initiatives. This is widespread throughout the world. It is not a level playing field. The situation in this industry is that virtually all of the players substantially subsidise their shipping industries.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Australia has little hope of being able to be a significant player in the maritime industry without such supports. The former government put these supports in place, and not at huge cost—significant contributions but not at enormous cost to the budget—and without those supports the Australian shipping industry is likely to dwindle fairly rapidly into virtually nothing. It is something that suits the ideological orientation of this government, which essentially sees transport as nothing more than a cost, that it is a cost to miners and farmers and that it is not an industry of importance in its own right. Yet, in areas like aviation and the maritime industry, transport delivers substantial export dollars, improves

         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If this provision is passed by this parliament, it will ensure the further export of Australian jobs and the further incursion of flags of convenience shipping into Australia with all of the threats that that imposes, particularly to our marine environment, and it will ensure that we have a reduction in our overall trading situation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Australia is the fifth biggest maritime nation on earth. In terms of volume carried per kilometre, Australia is the fifth largest market for shipping in the world. A situation where something like 97 per cent of that market is filled by foreign shipping is something that I do not think should be allowed to continue, yet this government clearly wants to see it at 100 per cent.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second point that I would make with respect to this provision is that, when you actually look at the various accelerated depreciation provisions that are available in other sectors, the hypocrisy of the government's position becomes very apparent. When you look at things like bulldozers, crop&amp;hyphen;dusters, tractors, a whole range of agricultural equipment—and I am sure the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) knows this only too well because of his background—you see that accelerated depreciation of 20 per cent, which is what the former shipping provision was, up to as high as 40 per cent for things like crop&amp;hyphen;dusters is almost universal across a wide range of high cost major capital equipment in agricultural and pastoral industries.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the things this proposal exposes is that this government does not mind subsidies and does not mind a bit of assistance here and there provided it is to their mates. When it is for industries that they do not approve of, when it is for industries that they are ideologically opposed to, they then say, `No, you cannot have any assistance,' even when there is a strong case for it because of the nature of the international marketplace where there is widespread assistance amongst our competitors.
        </para>
        <break page="2044" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          This is a very stark contrast: a government that is prepared to have accelerated depreciation for the industries where it draws a lot of its political support from but for those where it does not see itself as politically favoured—even though they are just as important to Australia's overall economic position—it says, `No, we will get rid of that support. We do not want to have anything to do with it.'
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The Australian community, the Australian maritime industry, the Australian shipbuilding industry and the various industries associated with the provision of maritime services will be the losers. It will not just be the Maritime Union of Australia and the seafarers, which the government hates. It will not just be those people and their jobs that are affected. There will be a range of flow&amp;hyphen;on effects as a result of the attacks on the maritime industry, of which this abolition of accelerated depreciation is but one part. Those flow&amp;hyphen;on effects will spread right through a variety of industries and a variety of economic opportunities and will ultimately have a negative impact on our balance of payments.

          —I have just a few comments to make on this taxation legislation. The previous speaker for the opposition, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), indicated that we are not supportive of people in the maritime industry. Of course we are. We came into government and we made an election commitment to wind up the ships capital grants scheme. Eligibility for tax concessions under section 57AM of the act is linked to the operation of the SCG Act. There is a need for competition in every industry in Australia, including the shipping industry. We believe that the measures which the government has undertaken here and in other areas of government administration are appropriate. Therefore, we support schedule 1, item 1 as it stands.

         There has been some concern around the place—amongst professionals anyway—that the changes will force many taxpayers to retrospectively alter the methods of calculation they currently use to value these shares. That will involve, where it comes about, a considerable amount of inconvenience but, more importantly, will impose compliance costs on those taxpayers which might have been possible to avoid had the amendments been more sympathetically drafted.

         We have had no clear explanation as yet from the government as to why it is proposing in item 8 of schedule 3 the move from 75 per cent to 66 per cent. The government should explain to the House the rationale that the government and the cabinet are advancing. We believe these share schemes should be as broad based and as inclusive as possible. Moving from 75 per cent to 66 per cent is a step in the opposite direction, and for that reason it is opposed by the Australian Labor Party.

          —Could I just ask the extent of consultation the government has had with employee associations. It is all right to say that the captains of industry regard this as more viable. They undoubtedly will be in the invitation, whether it is 66 per cent or 75 per cent. We are talking about employees; we are talking about the work force; we are talking about trade unionists in many cases. I would like to hear from the government as to whether or not their consultation went beyond the captains of industry and actually got to the shop floor to consult with the average working Australians who will be affected by this change.

          —The Labor Party has no opposition from its reading of the amendments, but we would have thought it was respectful to the House to have some explanation of them by the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles). It is not too often by a decent Westminster standard that legislative amendments are moved and then the mover sits down. Normally, there is some explanation. I do not know if the advisers, who are looking anxious, provided the relevant notes, but at least they should be recited to the House. I would invite the parliamentary secretary to do so.

If these amendments are the answer to those criticisms, then in terms of public accountability and, most importantly, accountability to the chamber, the government should have some explanation of what it is doing. Have you something to say?

         They have told me that they do not accept the view, when talking about schedule 4, major underlining interests, that the concept of backdating from the date of an unusual trade has always been part of the framework of section 160ZZS or its administration. I did touch on that in my speech in the second reading debate and I referred to an income tax ruling by the commissioner. I have already made that point, but I do not think, in summing up the second reading debate, that it was addressed. The parliamentary secretary may be able to comment on that.

Furthermore, they make the point more than adequately that the definitions of abnormal trading are excessively broad. I might go into that in a little detail, depending on the way this debate goes. The TIA and the Corporate Taxpayers Association support the use of `reasonable approximation' testing as at a date proximate to 20 September 1985 and similar flexibility, in their view, should be allowed in respect of subsequent testing dates.

         Still on schedule 4, perhaps I could refer to the transitional provisions as spelt out in section 160ZZSA. These appear to be circular to say the least. Section 160ZZSA(1)(b) seems to exclude the new regime whenever section 160ZZS(1) has been attracted prior to 20 January 1997. But subsequent provisions appear to proceed on a contrary assumption. For example, section 160ZZSC(4) presupposes that the new regime may apply in cases where a prior public ruling imposed a requirement to test and that the test would have been failed prior to 20 January 1997. The intention appears to have been to exclude the new regime only in cases where there has already been an adverse determination under section 160ZZS and that the taxpayers involved have conceded that it applies. In all other cases, it would appear that it is intended that matters can be dealt with and, if necessary, determined independently by the commissioner under sections 160ZZSC(3) and 160ZZSC(4).

         The purpose or effect of requiring by examination of its records is worthy of some further consideration and clarification. For example, is the intention that the basis for determination be limited to an examination of corporate records and, if so, when? That sort of limitation may well be inappropriate. Is the intention that there be no right or obligation to go beyond records? I would like to quote direct from written information I have from the Taxation Institute of Australia. They say:

         Where the company fails duly to make a determination within the time allowed, the test is effectively deemed to have been failed at the commencement of the test period. The penalties or consequences which flow from this will often be inappropriate. Thus (for example) if a company fails to make a determination as at 20 January 1997, it is deemed to have acquired the asset on 20 September 1985 for a consideration equal to the market value on that date. That would be entirely inappropriate if the failure arises because the company is unable to make the determination, or fails to do so because it is not aware of an abnormal trading triggering event. It would also lead to entirely inappropriate results if, for example, the test had clearly been satisfied up to December 1985 (and had appreciated in value to that time) but it was unclear whether or not it was satisfied thereafter. The risk of such an outcome could be worse than any risk of application of Sec.160ZZS(1). It is also not in accord with the principle espoused in the Budget Papers which was that the amendments would defer the date at which assets lose their pre&amp;hyphen;CGT status from the date when the majority underlying ownership changed to the time when the test of underlying ownership is required to be conducted.

          —Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence, I hope you do not mind us making these informal arrangements. It is easier. My interest in schedule 5 arises out of the length and complexity of the bill. There are 26 pages dealing with the small business capital gains tax rollover concession. I would say that the complexity has in very considerable measure subverted the government's policy intentions in this area.

         The major reason for the length and complexity of the legislation seems to be a perceived need to quarantine goodwill from the other assets of a taxpayer's business—in turn, to prevent small businesses from rolling over a capital gain from the disposal of goodwill into a non&amp;hyphen;goodwill replacement asset. This seems to be because there is a fear that operators might try to convert a capital gain—for example, a building development—and shift it into a business with excess goodwill and then claim the partial goodwill exemption for that goodwill.

         If someone sets out to do that, the general anti-avoidance provisions of part 4A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 would undoubtedly apply. This is an example of how the provisions have been made unduly complex by the inclusion of unnecessary words. The Taxation Institute of Australia, on this matter, had this to say:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The problem is that the Bill now leaves the genuine entrepreneurs with no effective rollover relief. For example, someone who has built up a business from nothing, so that the assets of the business will be predominantly goodwill, and who wants to attempt to turn around a moribund business where the goodwill may be worth very little, will be locked out of the concession.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         It is unfortunate that with the introduction of the new rollover provision, the opportunity was not taken to align it and the partial goodwill exemption provision. What policy reason can there be for the different thresholds and differing rules about associated businesses.

         For a sole trader in a partnership, the rollover relief is available at the individual level. For a company, the rollover relief is available at the company level. For a trust, the rollover relief is available at the trustee level. This treatment merely reflects the government's announcement that rollover relief will apply to a direct interest in an asset. With regard to partnerships, if one partner buys out another partner in a two&amp;hyphen;person partnership, the selling partner can get the rollover relief if the partner buys a new business, either as a partner in a new partnership or as a sole trader.

         It is my understanding that Treasury officials have advised the government of their concerns about the way in which some of these provisions might be open to abuse and tax minimisation. I believe it is always very important in a debate looking at a new form of tax concession to consider the flip side—a flip side that the average working PAYE taxpayer is always concerned about; that is, that the corporate sector in Australia is not being opened up for the possibility of shonky practice and that the government is standing as guardian of the integrity of the tax system. That is a very important guarantee for the government to provide in this debate, particularly when a number of parliamentarians have been made aware of concerns expressed within the bureaucracy. I would ask the parliamentary secretary if he could clarify those two matters. Does the government stand by the $215 million costing after the amendments that have been carried earlier and the public critique that has been offered by a number of organisations? And, if it is standing by the $215 million, does it also offer a guarantee to the House in terms of the integrity of the Australian taxation system?

I am pleased to see, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, that you are in the chair because, before the question time break, we actually had the effect of inducing you into the House. What do we see here now when we are debating the bounties legislation, which is going to see jobs lost in all sorts of regions around the country? Not one government backbencher in the place; not one. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), who is at the table, is pointing to himself. He has to be here. The member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) reckons he has had the effect of changing your decision, but where is the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes)? She has not come in in all of this debate.

         The member for Bendigo is prepared to come into this chamber and at least stand up for what he thinks he has done—not very effectively—but the member for Kingston is still not here. Let me remind the House of what she said. Yesterday she urged the government to be more critical of the advice it received in preparing its second budget and that cuts to industry assistance in last year's budget had already hurt the state. That, indeed they have. This is one of those cuts. This is a cut to the book bounty. It has cost 300 jobs—and the minister laughs at it—at Griffin Press alone because of their inability to plan and their inability to deal with a secure investment environment because this government unilaterally cut the bounty from under their feet.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          The fact is—and it is important because you are in the chair, Mr Deputy Speaker—that these issues of cutting the bounty were always attempted and put up to us by Treasury. But as a government we resisted them. There were attempts to reduce these measures in the so&amp;hyphen;called interests of the level playing field—which does not exist. We all want to get there but we are not there now. What we have is a government proposing unilateral disarmament, flying in the face of what is happening in the rest of the world and expecting our industry to be able to cope. The simple reality is that these firms could compete with overseas countries if those overseas countries did not have support and assistance. That is the truth. They are world competitive. But what they cannot do is compete and get into markets that are restricted to them in those countries.

          I can remember the circumstances in relation to book publishing where people in this country would lament every time they picked up a new publication which said `Printed in Singapore'—printed somewhere else, printed everywhere except Australia. Australians are some of the most avid readers in the world, yet we could not get a book publishing industry in this country until Labor introduced a plan for the book industry. It did so by support through research and development initiatives as well as the book bounty—the bounty to level the playing field, the R&amp;D to get them to invest in state&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;art technology.
         </para>

          But these are programs that this government has come in and slashed, regardless of the consequences. It believes it has got to pursue the budget bottom line rather than consider the consequences. It has established a Productivity Commission, but it will not give it legislative teeth to have regard to the impact on regional economies or to have regard to what our trading partners are doing when it comes to their level of assistance and support.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We say that has to change. The member for Bendigo, who is in the chair, has recognised it has to change. It is just that he is impotent in getting that change. He says he has taken representations to the minister. If you have taken representations and been successful to date, as you claim, Mr Deputy Speaker, take
          <break page="2054" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           some more submissions—because the industry is telling you. If you go and visit Maryborough, they will tell you they want this decision restored, that they want it to the end of next year—and Labor supports the extra six months.

If there is any commitment to regional development, to the people of Maryborough and the people of Adelaide who depend on this industry for jobs, support our amendment. I call on the member for Bendigo, when he is out of the chair, and the member for Kingston to come in and vote with us.

         The proposition that we are in support of is very simple: the government proposes that the book bounty be abolished from 1 July rather than 20 August. So far as we are concerned, that is six months short of the original expiry date established by the Australian Labor Party. That expiry date was established in consultation with local industry in places such as Maryborough, South Australia and Queensland. It is about saying to those local employers, `If you are prepared to give it a go, then we are prepared to give you a go.' We are basically saying that we are prepared to provide the necessary assistance to ensure that you are capable of growing on the export front and as part and parcel of that export growth, capable of providing additional jobs in areas of high need.

          Queensland. Let us have a look at some of the high unemployment levels that currently exist in Queensland. I know the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) is not too interested in these facts. As at January 1997 what was unemployment in the north&amp;hyphen;west of Queensland? It was 10.6 per cent. In the Rockhampton area it was 11.6 per cent and in Far North Queensland around Cairns it was 8.9 per cent—all above the national average. That is why I put it to the House that it is wrong to abolish these industry bounties, especially for the state of Queensland, the minister's home state. The abolition of these industry bounties will take Australia in the opposite direction from what is needed for its development at the moment. I suggest that, if this legislation is passed, Queensland businesses—and it will be on the head of the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism—will lose nearly $7 million.

         These amendments are consequent on the government's decision to extend the termination date of the book bounty. The amendments introduce an absolute end date of 30 September 1997 for book bounty claims, 90 days after the end of the bounty period proposed in the previous amendment. This will ensure that the administration of the scheme is wound up quickly and that the majority of payments for eligible productions are made as soon as possible after the end of the period of the eligible production. I commend the amendments to the House.

They are consequential on the government betraying the book publishing industry in this country by abolishing a bounty for them, by being forced to reverse that decision, but to only partially proceed down the reversal route. We are saying that the book bounty should be extended by another six months. This government has just voted against that and there are people who should have voted on this side, like the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes), who still is not in this chamber, who still will not come in and defend her actions.

         The fact of the matter is this was an uncompetitive country and it could not get into the game because all the other countries were supporting their book publishing industry. Labor introduced a two-pronged attack: it said, `Invest in the technology and we'll give you tax deductions for it.' As a government they have wiped out the tax deductions despite the fact they went to the last election promising to keep them. Broken promise, bad policy—two bad hits.

         But then we also had the book bounty, which we were always being told we had to get rid of. The member for Bendigo made reference to this earlier—that Labor trotted out a plan to get rid of the book bounty itself. It is true that the bureaucrats put that forward, but we opposed it. It did not come and it did not get passed. If it had have been passed, why would we be debating the issue today? So for you to come in and say that we voted down the books bounty back in 1993 is just plain wrong because, if it were true, we would not be debating this issue now.

         Let us understand that the only people who put book publishing on the map in this country were Labor: Labor through the books bounty, Labor through industry support. Labor has seen the growth of this industry, an industry which has seen a doubling of exports in the space of time in which it has been in place, an industry which previously saw non&amp;hyphen;existent jobs growth. There has been 200 per cent export growth over the past 12 years that this plan has been in place under Labor, and it has taken them six months to abolish it, despite the fact they told no-one during the election campaign they would do it.

         What did they do in their first budget? They broke that promise comprehensively. Now this is one of the areas that has not yet seen a reversal of form. This area plus the machine tools and robots areas have not got any relief or respite yet. Books and ships have, but not enough, and computers and machine tools and robots have not.

         Where, might we ask, is the consistency in that position? Do you know what the consistency is, Mr Deputy Speaker? There has been a more effective lobbying campaign run to date by the shipbuilders and book publishers in this country than there has been by the computer and machine tools and robots industries. We will still keep pursuing their interests because certainty has been taken from them.

         Understand that you have a computer industry in this country which has invested massively in research and development, massively in exports, massively in production and we have seen huge growth in all of those areas of activity. For example, in the last five years exports of information technology related products have trebled in this country. That has occurred because there was a certain regime introduced by Labor—a regime that was built around the partnerships for development program and included the computer bounty and the R&amp;D concessions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Under the partnerships for development program there was a requirement for firms entering into the program to commit to levels of growth in production, R&amp;D and exports. All of those targets and commitments have been met until now. Why will they not be met now? Because the government deceived this industry during the last election by promising to retain the bounty. It wiped it out—3&amp;half; years in one fell swoop. It also reduced the tax deductibility from 150 per cent to 125 per cent with the minister saying, `You should be thankful because it could have gone to 100 per cent.' His defence was, `I have really

         This level of growth would not have occurred had it not been for the plan and the certainty introduced by Labor. The simple fact of the matter is that the manufacturing industry has grown in this country. We have seen huge growth in the exports of certain key industries—the information technology industry being amongst them—but it only happened because there was a plan behind those industries. What does the industry itself have to say about the government's decision? Mr Neville Roach, the Managing Director of Fujitsu, wrote to us saying:

         Both the present government and its predecessor supported the extension of the computer bounty as recently as 1995. This bipartisan support only came after a long and exhaustive period of consultation between the industry and government. Both recognised that the bounty is not a subsidy but rather a compensation to local manufacturers for additional component cost and they result from other decisions that the government had taken.

         This was addressing market failure. This was recognising that, if the industry was to grow, it had to have this market failure addressed. The minister is on record as saying that he recognises the need to intervene where there is market failure. Well, he recognises the need to intervene, but he has cut away the intervention. Some intervention! You recognise the problem, but you are not prepared to address the cure. It is no wonder you have had criticism from this industry.

         We believe this is also an area that has to be reversed. The government has to return to the commitment they made during the election and support the local information technology industry. We will be persisting with this measure to get that reversal.

         What we have got is the circumstance in which there is no commitment from the minister to support an industry, though it was his promise, his policy. He went to the last election saying it. No doubt he went to his leader and said, `This is a vital area to secure because there are lots of employees in the manufacturing sector in computers, and we've got to keep them onside.

         The minister might be interested in looking at today's national accounts figures because they address the question of production over the last quarter. The manufacturing sector has seen a 2.6 per cent reduction in outputs. That has occurred because of the policies that you put in place as a result of the budget.

         There is no point saying to the industry, as the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) would have us believe, that you have got interest rates down or you have done these other things if in fact you are putting them out of the game.

If you are undermining these industries by stripping away the mechanisms by which their exports have grown, then what you are doing is really denying this country the opportunity for significant, huge advances.

         The fact of the matter is that the minister has made a commitment. The only target the government has set, I might add, is a target of 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing. But every time the minister has been asked in this place to tell us what his strategy is to get there, he has not done it. He has not even asked his department to produce a strategy for it. How are you going to achieve it when, in one quarter alone, you have had a decline in manufacturing production by a massive 2.6 per cent? You come into this place and claim that everything is doing well in terms of the national accounts and that growth is on course, but growth is going down and manufacturing production has gone into the negative.

I refer to the fact that, during the election campaign—and I am sure the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) was consulted; after all, he is the Prime Minister's number cruncher—the coalition matched Labor's commitment to retain the computer bounty to the end of the year 2000.

         I think that was a fairly important commitment. It was made in good faith, and industry took that commitment on board—as did a lot of workers and their families who depended on that commitment for the purposes of their job security and their ability in the end to look after their families.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I know the Prime Minister likes to talk from time to time about the question of security—security at work, security at home, security in the community at large. But the problem is that, since the election, the Prime Minister has decided that your word is not your bond. That is what he has decided. With respect to the computer bounty and their undertaking that it shall prevail until the year 2000, your word is no longer your bond.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What does the government say is the justification to achieve so-called savings? As the minister said in his second reading speech, the savings are to be achieved through the termination of the computer bounty with effect from 1 July this year. He then goes on to suggest that these bounty schemes have run their course.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I suggest to the House that these bounty schemes have not run their course. I will tell you why: the level of unemployment in Australia suggests that they have not run their course. The problem for the government—and it is walking away from its responsibilities—is that not only is unemployment a major problem at the moment, but it is especially a huge problem in regional Australia and is especially a huge problem for the long-term unemployed.

          there is a role for government to involve itself in regional Australia; and there is a role for government to involve itself in trying to push and prod industry. The government needs to encourage industry to invest and to create decent job opportunities—real job opportunities—not half-baked suggestions or proposals as brought forward by the Prime Minister just on a week and a half ago with respect to the work for the dole scheme.

         If there are any real concerns about these issues, I refer the House to the fact that, in seasonally adjusted terms, the numbers of long-term unemployed rose from 229,500 in December to 232,700 in January. The minister wants the House to accept that the schemes have run their course. I do not accept that the schemes have run their course when you have 232,700 people in Australia who are long-term unemployed. It is interesting that there are now 30,100 more long-term unemployed Australians than in May 1996 when the Howard government began cutting decent labour market programs, including Skillshare, throughout the length and breadth of Australia.

         These schemes have not run their course. Australian industry expects support. The bounty scheme that prevailed in the computer industry encouraged industry to make investments, because a company's ability to make investments depends on a sense of stability and security. It is on that basis that companies are prepared to make medium- to long-term investment decisions.

          —I will try to make this as brief as possible. These are opposition amendments. Basically, these amendments simply seek to provide for automatic indexation of the income thresholds at which the private health insurance tax rebate cuts out. Reading through the Senate
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Hansard
          </emphasis>
          , there was a bit of confusion about whether our amendments were going to index the value of the tax rebate or whether they would index the income threshold at which the rebates cut out. Everyone who has studied this knows that it is about how we index the income limits. That is why the proposed index is average weekly earnings. I will not dwell on that, but that is the point that these amendments go to.

          I have two questions, Minister, that I will go through very quickly. One was that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services and Parliamentary Secretary for the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Senator Ellison) in the Senate said that one of the reasons the amendments could not be accepted was that there is no provision for them in the forward estimates. I would have expected that the forward estimates are based on a certain number of people having private health insurance. I thought in the past we had spoken about a figure of 35.5 per cent. Given that there are now only 33.2 per cent of people who have private health insurance, I would have thought there is a bit of fat in the forward estimates.

          Unless there is a sudden jump in the number of people with private health insurance on 1 July, there will be a bit of fat in those forward estimates which would allow, perhaps, the funding of this automatic indexation. If I am wrong, I am happy to tap the mat on that. Perhaps we can deal with that question first.

          —My understanding is that we are dealing with the best figures we have so far, in the December quarter. We cannot really predict what will happen by the two quarters hence. There is no fat that I am aware of. I am informed that the cost over four years of doing this would be $73 million. While I can see the merit in doing it, what we have attempted to do is simply implement what we promised before the election. Honestly, if I had another $73 million, I would probably be spending it on another area of need in health. I feel we have more than acquitted our undertaking to the Australian community by implementing what we propose to do. I note in passing that similar indexation arrangements were not promised in the Labor Party's election proposal. To the best of my knowledge, there is no fat and I do not have the capacity to make  that without offsetting it in the rest of my portfolio—$73 million over four years is a substantial amount to offset.

          —A brief debating point first, Mr Deputy Speaker. If the minister believes that an extra $73 million could be better spent in other areas of the portfolio rather than in providing tax breaks for private health insurance, I am wonder whether he is willing to now accept the opposition's point that perhaps the whole $1.7 billion could have been better spent in paying for extra operations in public and private hospitals or in other areas of private health care. I do not think I will persuade him on that point, but I thought he left me an opening on that.

         Finally, concerning the second question I spoke about before, at various times we have been trying to find out what the government's intentions are about the thresholds. I think we have been told that, if at some future time the government wanted to increase these income thresholds, it could do so by introducing legislation and amending the act. At one point I think we were told incorrectly in the Senate that this could be done by regulation, but my understanding is that it will require an amendment to the act and so we would be seeking to know from the minister whether the government is planning to change the thresholds. That is a crucial point. Are you planning to change the thresholds that apply to this Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 1996?

          —On the debating point, without carrying it too far, the whole of the $1.7 billion is being spent to implement a core election promise, and we keep our promises. There are no plans to increase the thresholds at this stage. It does not mean we would not do it; it means that we really have, only in the most early stages, started considering the 1997&amp;hyphen;98 budget. I do not say at a future date we will not do it but, like Medicare levy thresholds under the previous government, they were not indexed but they were increased from time to time as a policy decision. We have no plans to do that at the moment. That does not mean we will not do it at some stage in the future.

          —We are disappointed. We thought we might have been able to persuade the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) to accept our very reasonable proposals on the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 as well. Once again, this seeks to index the income limits at which the Medicare levy cuts

         We believe that it is only fair that this income limit be maintained in real terms. The minister might remember that, in the debate on these matters previously, I did express concern that at the next budget the government might bring in a proposal to lower the threshold, perhaps from $100,000 for a family down to $80,000 and, in the following budget, down to $60,000. That is why we are seeking to introduce this automatic indexation, so that the real value is maintained in real terms.

         That is the debating point. I have one question on this issue. It is the same one that we put before. Given those concerns, is the government planning to change those income thresholds for the Medicare levy?

          —I say to my colleague the honourable member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) that in his electorate that might be the case, but on the Central Coast of New South Wales a large number of people who need to use the incontinence products that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has spoken about on many occasions do benefit from this change and they will be hit by this increase in the threshold. It might be different in Bradfield, but I am sure that in Chisholm and on the Central Coast there are lots of people who unfortunately will be a bit worse off as a result of this.

          —This schedule relates to the machine tools and robotics bounty, which has been described by the Metal Trades Industry Association as fundamental to the whole manufacturing sector, in that it supplies enabling technologies to most other sectors and is an important source of innovation and skills. As they point out, the decision made in last year's budget to terminate the machine tools and robotics bounty will result in the cessation of an extremely successful industry program.

         The bounty has been instrumental in the growth of a high-technology export oriented industry. It has provided cash flow, and the MTIA say that over the past 10 years the machine tools and robotics industry has produced an export growth rate of 20 per cent per annum. The year before it generated $117 million in sales and $80 million in exports, and it paid $12 million in tax. This year, the MTIA predicts that export sales are likely to be closer to $130 million. By comparison, the
         <break page="2070" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          cost of the bounty to the government or the taxpayer was only $2 million in 1995&amp;hyphen;96. As the MTIA points out, cessation of the bounty will see an immediate reduction in the rate of growth of exports, and they describe that outcome as perverse. And indeed it is. It is counterproductive, because you have a decision taken on the grounds that its objective was eliminating the budget deficit, but you have a reduction in the rate of growth of exports happening here and that will have precisely the opposite effect.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The MTIA also point out that the burden of the cutbacks in government spending borne by the machine tools and robotics industry is disproportionate. Not only has this industry had to bear the abolition of the bounty, which is what this schedule is all about, but over the past six months this industry has had to bear the burden of cuts to research and development programs—both the tax concession and the discretionary grants—imposition of a three per cent duty on industry inputs under the tariff concession system, substantial dismantling of export facilitation programs such as the export market development grants scheme and abolition of the development import finance facility, the DIFF. As the MTIA sum up, these new arrangements mean that now Australian producers are not operating on a level playing field but on one that is tilted straight toward our competitors' goals where you have machine tools coming into the country duty free while Australian producers importing components are paying a three per cent duty. That is an extraordinary outcome. In the face of the reversal of the budget decisions to abolish the ships bounty and the book bounty, termination of this bounty represents a further slap in the face.

         This is a matter of particular concern to me because of its importance to manufacturing industry in the Wills electorate. By way of example, as I have mentioned previously, Farley Cutting Systems is a company based in Glenroy. It commenced business back in 1983. Its mission statement is to be a leading world supplier of systems for cutting flat metals and similar materials. It has achieved success both domestically and in penetrating markets abroad with the sale of cutting ma

          chines into specifically targeted sectors, such as shipbuilding and the heating, ventilation and airconditioning industries. At last count, it had 300 machine installations in more than 20 countries around the world, a staff of 75 people, turnover in excess of $12 million, with exports accounting for approximately 75 per cent of sales. It is actively involved in ongoing research and development activities—including activities with a range of external partners—and is implementing various manufacturing improvement programs to enhance competitiveness.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is a terrific achievement, but underpinning it all is the kind of support Farley Cutting Systems got from this bounty. In 1995&amp;hyphen;96, they received $325,000 from the machine tool bounty, $100,000 from export market development grants and $900,000 from the tax concession for research and development. They have been able to claim assistance under the export market development grants from 1984 right through to 1991, and they used that sort of assistance to get into new export markets in Malaysia, China and India. What we have here is abolition of support under the export market development grants and abolition of the research from research and development. But the thing which has really knocked this company around is cancellation of the bounty—$300,000 straight off the bottom line. For that reason, because of the impact this provision has on Farley, I urge the House to oppose it.

This government has failed in its industry policy and, in relation to these cuts in the bounties, it has been bad for regional Australia and for working people in Australia. I will be supporting the amendment as put.

         Throughout this debate what the opposition has been seeking from the minister at the table, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), is some clear direction about where he sees industry policy going, under the government. There can be no clearer example than this decision with respect to the bounty on machine tools and robots where, by the actions of this bill and these clauses, the bounty will be ceasing 10 months earlier. It ceases on the night of the budget but was supposed to run through to 30 June 1997.

         Indeed, when the Industry Commission last looked at this industry it recommended that the scheme cease when it was due to end on 30 June 1977. This is something that the industry had been able to factor in. But just for the sake of the fiscal consolidation that the government has claimed was required we see that this bounty has been terminated.

          The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism has to address these problems, because they jeopardise Australian jobs by sending those jobs offshore.

Today the Treasurer (Mr Costello) was trying to claim credit for growth of three per cent over a year and 0.5 per cent in a quarter, but he is presiding over an economy that has seen manufacturing output slump by 2.6 per cent.

Why doesn't she get to the minister at the table, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore)? He has been got to by the book publishing industry and the ship industry because he has had those industries reverse themselves.

The doctrine of economic rationalism commenced its pervasion of the Canberra bureaucracy under the previous Labor government, a government of which the member for Hotham was a minister for some six years, I understand. The member for Hotham entered this parliament in 1990. A year later, Michael Pussey warned that economic rationalists had `invaded' the bureaucracy by exposing the extent of the spread of their doctrine through Canberra in his book entitled

         I would like to say just a few words about the economic performance of the previous Labor government, particularly in relation to the automotive industry. The current debate, as everyone knows, has centred on the issue of tariff reduction. The Labor Party in government reduced tariffs in the car industry from
         <break page="2077" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          57.5 per cent in 1984 and committed it to a target of zero per cent in 2010—and they called the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) `Captain Zero'. Now they have suddenly become the saviours of the automotive industry by proposing a slow down in the rate of reduction by announcing that they have adopted Ian Webber's position. Thank you very much, but we on this side of the House do not need their help. We will support the industry as we believe fit, by working with the industry.

         The member for Hotham was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training in a government that spent billions of taxpayers' dollars on labour market programs that did not create the jobs to put the people they were training into.

         The programs were so expensive that the Labor government had to flog off their crown jewels, like Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, in order to pay for them when they should have been retiring their debt in order to reduce the strain on interest rates which was one of the many factors that they let kill off the small businesses that could not afford to employ the people they were churning through the member for Hotham's training programs.

          —The 12th of June is the National Independence Day for the Republic of the Philippines and 12 June 1998 will mark the centenary of national independence for the Philippines. The circumstances surrounding that declaration of independence were that for a number of years the Filipinos rebelled against Spanish colonial rule and on 12 June 1898 they declared national independence. They did this at the time of a war that was being fought between Spain, the colonial country, and the United States. In July 1898, after Filipino independence had been declared, United States forces arrived in the Philippines and Spanish forces surrendered to American forces. There was considerable Filipino resistance to that situation. Nonetheless, the Philippines was ruled until 1946, with a period of Japanese occupation, by the United States. Nonetheless, Filipinos regard 12 June as their National Independence Day.

         Australia has a strong bilateral relationship with the Philippines. If one looks at some of the indicators, one can see that in 1995-96 merchandise exports from Australia to the Philippines were worth $1.1 billion, which represented a growth of nearly 30 per cent on the previous year. That compares to merchandise imports from the Philippines of only $0.3 billion. Australia has an overwhelming trade advantage.

         Jacinta was a proud member of the ADF reserve and was in her early 20s at the time of her death. She was robbed of her true potential contribution to our country by the accidental discharge of a weapon at Greenbank. Since then, her parents have wanted justice and answers.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I want to refer especially to a letter dated 10 June 1996 which was sent by Jacinta's mother, Mrs Genia Otuszewski, to the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General John Sanderson. It took General Sanderson four months to reply to the letter from my constituent, Mrs Otuszewski. The reply came on 8 October 1996. I contend that this is a very poor and insensitive treatment of a family—to think that it took four months for the Chief of the General Staff to respond to some legitimate concerns expressed by the family in that letter.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Many people have suggested to me that the Department of Defence often employs a standard operating procedure in matters involving the death of personnel—to essentially string out the paperwork until the established three&amp;hyphen;year statutory limit has expired. This claim was certainly evidenced by the Senate committee in their inquiry into the Nomad tragedy. They recommended a five&amp;hyphen;year statutory period in their findings.

        <para first-indent="16">
         General Sanderson outlined in his letter of 8 October a number of reasons for not disciplining the particular army personnel involved, Sergeant R.C. Thorpe. Quite frankly, so many of the reasons seem inadequate to me.

        <para first-indent="16">
         A board of inquiry was originally convened following the death of Jacinta Watson. It recommended disciplinary action against Sergeant Thorpe at the time, but that particular recommendation was suspended because charges of a similar nature were laid by the Queensland police against Sergeant Thorpe. He was charged with unlawful killing and the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          unlawful wounding of another soldier, Corporal Michael James Gardiner.

         Defence, according to General Sanderson, were going to charge Thorpe in two possible ways—under section 36(2) of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982, which is `dangerous behaviour causing death by recklessly handling a weapon'; or under section 36(3), which is `dangerous behaviour, causing death by negligently handling a weapon'. But those charges were never laid.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         On 4 June 1996, the Queensland Supreme Court found Sergeant Thorpe not guilty of the civil charges. General Sanderson claims section 144 of the Defence Force Discipline Act precludes:

         General Sanderson claims his judgment is that certainly would have been the case in the matter involving Jacinta Watson's death so he decided against pursuing any action against Sergeant Thorpe. General Sanderson's letter said:

        <para font-size="-=2">

         That is certainly true, but I do not think anybody in this place would deny that the family of Jacinta Watson—and, for that matter, all members of the ADF—will carry a tremendous burden out of this unfortunate accident which resulted in her death.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Mr Speaker, I am well aware of your distinguished career within the Defence Force, but my contention is this: the reputation of the entire Australian defence forces can suffer from this sort of decision. It seems to me that the person who was in charge when someone was killed and another was hurt should be disciplined in some way—perhaps as a token gesture, but there should be some discipline. Disciplinary action would demonstrate to all service personnel and to the Australian community that the ADF enforces the high standards expected of it. Rank carries responsibility, and even ordinary members of the ADF often carry far greater responsibilities than the general Australian community. Accordingly, such responsibilities justify the exacting of
         <break page="2080" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        <para first-indent="16">
         The parents of people who have been killed in the too many accidents involving ADF personnel in recent years are well motivated in their pursuit of answers to their questions. They are understandably proud of their children's involvement in the ADF and they bear no grudge against the Commonwealth; rather, they just want their fears put to rest. General Sanderson's slow response to Jacinta Watson's mother certainly did not help the cause.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I submit that it is certainly time for the army in particular to take greater care and to move to analyse the common causes in these various incidents—for example, the training and the attitude of personnel involved—to apply these findings to prevent further incidents, as well as define and impose appropriate penalties. If the Defence Force Discipline Act is inadequate, let us amend it.

However, what about those 850,000 contributors over the age of 65, the half a million people earning less than $20,000 a year or the one million families surviving on annual incomes below $40,000? I do not know how long they would survive without access to some kind of insurance pool.

         Whilst it is easy to suggest that, as 40 per cent of private hospital episodes are now day procedures which cost approximately $2,000 to $2,500 each, who could responsibly suggest a battler go without effective cover for several years whilst they save the money? If the financially fit drop their health cover, they abandon those with mental illness, with intractable disease or with meagre resources to the collapse of a system that provides their only hope of affordable and timely access to quality care.

         I think people should be under no misapprehension that, if private health insurance collapses or if low income people cannot afford to buy it, private hospitals in the private hospital sector would continue to flourish—with the exception of those in regional and certain rural areas—but the market to which they will be appealing will be those who are of higher incomes and who can afford to pay cash. At the moment there is also a very untapped but lucrative market in South-East Asia for people who would be prepared to come here—and in fact are in increasing numbers—and pay cash for hospital care.

         The AMA's seemingly radical considerations reflect its opposition to proposals by the health insurers that have been put to the Productivity Commission for the establishment of what is described as US-style managed care programs. These programs have been described by Hillary Clinton as `an assault on the doctor-patient relationship'. Insurers would control both the quantity and quality of care delivered through the ownership of hospitals and the contracting of doctors.

         If the AMA adopts a position of advising people to drop their private health insurance and subsequent regulatory amendments are adopted by the government, do they then turn 180 degrees? Do we find that some of the most vulnerable people in this country—frequently elderly people, quite a number of whom have been ringing my electorate office recently about this issue—are then told by the AMA in a few months time: `We retract our earlier advice and now suggest that you take up private health insurance?' What of the confusion amongst those with chronic illness?

         Would a person quit their private health insurance on the advice of the AMA—whose advice frequently is taken by the community—and then subsequently sought to take it up again, and if they then suffered a serious illness and found that they suffered misadventure on a public hospital waiting list, would the AMA and its officers be held liable for the sort of advice which they had given?

         Whilst I understand the basis of the recommendations that are coming from the AMA's Health Economics Committee and the frustration that underlines it, I think the Federal Council of the AMA as a group would be well advised to wait for the government's response to the Productivity Commission report—the regulatory environment is very much in need of reform—and consider the social obligations that it has to the vulnerable people in Australia.

          —This legislation could be categorised as an omnibus bill because it has 10 separate measures incorporated within its covers. Some of them are of a more routine nature, but there are those that, to my mind, require special attention. While I wish to spend most of my time on the capital gains tax arrangements, I would like to record my significant support for the changes within this law relating to equity investments in small and medium enterprises whereby changes to the tax law are allowing and simplifying a process where major lenders can take some equity in a business, as compared to lending them money.

         One of the great difficulties for small business has always been the fact that their only source of growth capital has been to borrow the money, making them subject to the vagaries of the interest rate market and, frequently, not allowing them to take that option. Too often, debt has been the downfall of a business when, without the capital, they simply could not grow their business which is essential in modern&amp;hyphen;day economics.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When there is an equity position, the equity holder has to take the good with the bad. Their component of the investment does not become a burden when things are tough. It becomes a form of burden when things are good, because dividends are paid to the equity holder. But, as I say of taxation, if you are paying taxation, you are making profits and the tax man does not yet want 100 per cent of your profits, so it is always a much more advantageous situation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I thank the government for taking initiatives to simplify that opportunity and I think it has to be grown. In fact, our whole capital market structure has to be further reformed. The idea of a second board for medium sized companies has to be better understood as a speculative market. Admittedly, we have to watch out for the crooks, but the re&amp;hyphen;establishment of a second board, which is now back on the agenda, is required.

         For very small companies, a company structure is required that particularly allows family members to invest in a company without liability. In other words, they do not have to go in as a retired couple and risk their family home to help their kids start a small business, but if they have a bit of spare cash that they are prepared to apply in that direction they should be able to put it in. Whereas in that type of small business company, as compared to a partnership, there is still the opportunity in a legal sense to require that the principal shareholders or directors have a degree of liability, which overcomes a lot of the other problems associated with granting credit to small business corporations. The whole capital
         <break page="2085" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         It is interesting that we again revisit capital gains tax. I have been around for a reasonable time and, going back in history, when we were in opposition our then leader, Andrew Peacock, campaigned with a simple slogan—that, as sure as night follows day, if the people of Australia were to re&amp;hyphen;elect a Labor government we would get a capital gains tax.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As a consequence that was denied vociferously by the government at the time and, of course, history records we got a capital gains tax. We also got it without very much regard for the effect that it would have on, particularly, small business. There is a very simplistic argument that capital gains should be as taxable as any other gain and, of course, you can progress, if you like, to a wealth tax which says that people who are extremely wealthy should have their wealth assessed on an annual basis and that taxed at a flat rate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         All of it is very negative to the accumulation of wealth. There are two points of view in Australian society. One is that everybody should be poor and the other that if some people are wealthy they assist the poor. I subscribe to the second view. I am not at all embarrassed to see someone drive down the road in a brand new Rolls Royce because I know a lot of people have got a job out of building it, maybe in a foreign country. There are also, of course, a lot of people getting a job out of the taxes that were paid to buy that vehicle and maintain and keep it on the road. Any suggestion that that sort of consumption only benefits the purchaser is silly. If someone can afford a butler then a butler gets a job as far as I am concerned. I am not at all concerned with the fact that by their efforts someone has achieved that level of income and they can afford to pay other people to assist them around their house. In fact, I hold the view, personally, which may not be even supported by my colleagues, that such household expenditure can be tax deductible. I see no reason why, where there is a family with two members, husband and wife, with skills in demand who should be both out there growing our economy, they have then got to come home at 5 o'clock and do the household duties while someone else remains unemployed who would be ideally suited to doing those household duties and sharing in the income of those two people who have skills in demand.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The incentive to do that would arise from saying to those people: part of your effort in both going out each day to earn a living and contribute to our economy requires that you employ someone in your household. I can see no reason whatsoever why that cannot be seen as a business expense. Furthermore, it would create a lot of employment that currently does not exist. It is all a bit silly. That is a personal view. I am not speaking on behalf of my government colleagues when I make it. I think we miss an opportunity because we have somehow still got this fixation with upstairs downstairs which is also, in my view, silly. I think all forms of employment are honourable employment. If people's skills limit them to household duties, why not? Not everybody is going to have the skills to be a computer programmer or somebody in that category. Computer programmers marry computer programmers, doctors marry doctors et cetera, and we are suggesting to them that the society should still demand that one of them gives up work to look after the house when in fact there is a demand in  society for them. But I will not continue on that particular subject. It has strayed a little bit away from this legislation.

         The reality of capital gains tax as I saw it in business was as follows: somebody goes out and expends say $50,000 to buy a small business. It is run down and they work extremely hard
         <break page="2086" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          and extremely long hours and they build it up to a point where it has reached its capacity. It is not going to grow any more. They have ambition to go on to bigger and better things and they offer it for sale for $100,000 with the intention of buying another business for $150,000 and starting the cycle all over again. That is good for the economy. It is good for them and it is government's responsibility to encourage them. But what is the outcome under the present and past capital gains tax regime? They have made a $50,000 capital gain. They are going to sell a business for $100,000. They have probably sold it through a real estate agent so they have to pay commission on the sale. Then, of course, when they go to buy the new business for $150,000, the state authorities put out their hand for stamp duty. To add to their concerns we add a capital gains tax.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In simple arithmetic those three costs consume the whole $50,000 of profit that they have built into the enterprise by hard work. It is silly and of course there is an absolute disincentive to sell the first business because in fact you are back to square one. That is what has been happening and the losers have been the real estate agents who could not turn businesses over and all sorts of other people and, of course, the state authorities with their rather iniquitous stamp duties which have got to the point of the ridiculous. They, again, are very much like a capital gains tax. I would like to address that issue in a moment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Suddenly we find that the idea that you are taxing people on this sort of hidden profit of capital gain has been very negative to the revenue. People have not been using it. Furthermore, it has discouraged people from going on and doing what is best for society. That is trying to expand their business activities and have this incentive to grow. This legislation specifically addresses that problem. It could not be more simple. It simply says that if you are in that situation and you wish to reinvest in another business, then you have the right to do so without
         <break page="2087" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          paying capital gains tax. You are given two years to make that decision, which I think is very generous. To the great credit of the government, notwithstanding their policy position pre the election, they have wiped out the like&amp;hyphen;business component.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I campaigned very strongly against that by correspondence with our Treasurer and the committee that was looking at it. There are thousands of reasons that people would want to shift from, say, a newsagency to another business. More particularly, in my electorate, we find farmers wishing to move out of the farming industry sometimes because of physical injury—their back has given out or things of that nature—and they are seeking to invest in another business, say, a newsagency or a caravan park or something like that. And why not? The reality is that they might have inherited the family farm and found that they were not even suited to the farming business for whatever reason and that they would be more skilled in another. They should be able to move into different types of business within, of course, the $5 million turnover limit that is applicable.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I congratulate the government on taking this step. They could stand to lose revenue in the process but I think, in the end, that may not be the case. I think there will be additional turnover in businesses resulting from this arrangement and I think the real estate industry is in for a bit of a bonanza. There are a lot of people just waiting for 1 July to be able to participate in this new arrangement and change from one business to another. We will see  some quite significant activity which will benefit other governments such as state governments in their stamp duties. Taxes will be earned from the profits of real estate agents and others who will be the beneficiaries of this arrangement. It is, therefore, a very good proposition.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Nevertheless, it is also worth addressing at this time the overall tax situation as it applies to business. I have been in business for all my life. I commenced in my first business while I was still at school. I went out painting houses on weekends and my school holidays and actually used to employ my school mates on certain of the less skilled jobs that were associated. I could give them as much in a day as the then department stores paid them for a week, over the Christmas period.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But the reality is that a business, strangely enough, never enjoys profit. A business, for all intents and purposes, is a piece of paper that constructs that business. Those who enjoy the profits of a business are either the partners or the shareholders and I have never been able to work out why we therefore tax business. We have a hatred for them. We read in the papers constantly that nasty old BHP—that employs millions of Australians—made a big profit and we should be cutting them down to size. In fact, we should be leaving them with the profit so they can invest and create more jobs and more economic activity and maybe pick up the 800,000 or 900,000 unemployed we have in this country.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Of course we should tax them the minute they pay money out to their shareholders or transfer it to another entity or want to transfer it out of the country. But that is the point. And, of course, that is the great opportunity that Treasurer Keating missed when he went for imputation. There is some reference to imputation in this particular legislation. Treasurer Keating had the choice with imputation. He could have taxed the company, as he did, and passed the franking credits on to the shareholder or he need not have taxed the company and he could have taxed the dividends. And, of course, he could have quite properly taxed them by way of withholding tax.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The difference would have been that anybody who was prepared to reinvest in their business would not have paid tax on that investment and there would have been a massive incentive
         <break page="2088" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          to do just that. It could have international implications—people in other countries making judgments that they had this opportunity to operate in this environment in Australia and bring their investments here, be it in petrochemical plants or any of the other secondary processing facilities, in particular, that Australia is wide open to considering its natural resources base.

         I welcome reading in today's paper how in Western Australia proper investors, quite properly, are going to bring our solar salt production and our huge gas production together by way of a petrochemical plant. We export them both to somebody else to do that particular job and that sounds silly to me. But, again, any incentive that says to business, `If you reinvest you do not pay tax' seems to me to have a lot of merit. What is more, I do not believe government revenues would lose eventually because there would be a growth in PAYE earnings, a reduction in dole payments and the benefits from all the other things that follow from economic development. It is an issue that I would like to see considered.

         As you would be aware, I have advocated for quite some time that it is time the parliament of Australia—people from its own ranks—for the first time in history sat down with a select committee and studied our national tax system, right down to local government—not as a government but as a parliament. My proposition would be that the opposition got half the say because the reality of taxation is that unless the people of Australia, through its parliament, are prepared to take a bipartisan view and not play silly politics with taxation—put the national  interest ahead of our political interest—then we are not going to get reform. We are going to go on, for instance, arguing about what level of tariff we should have on motor cars when in fact we put $800 worth of lead in the saddlebag of every car manufacturer for every car they produce through our indirect tax system—the height of the ridiculous.

          —Treasury figures show us that 800 bucks is included in the manufactured cost of every car made in Australia because we have a fuel tax that they cannot recover and because we have payroll tax—a tax on employing people! I have always been rather stunned at the logic behind that particular argument. We have all these other taxes flowing into the system which they cannot escape. They add four per cent to the cost of growing a wheat crop, which we export. We see the great benefits to our balance of payments that this year's wheat crop is providing. It is just silly, and yet apparently we have not got the capacity as a parliament—as a government and an opposition—to sit down and have a look at the proposition of whether income tax should apply to business or shareholders.

         I have expressed a view. I will express another view: in the international environment a VAT type tax is essential. Furthermore, it should be levied by the federal government but in two groups: firstly, for federal revenue at, say, 10 per cent and, secondly, for state revenues at, say, five per cent. At that point in time we say, `That's where you get your revenue; the Commonwealth provides you nothing.' Of course, that means that state governments lose this wonderful opportunity they have to blame the Commonwealth every time they put up their taxes but become answerable to their own constituency for the services they provide with that money. They are the realities. It goes right down—if you give state governments a reasonable revenue base then maybe they would abandon land taxes and stamp duties on such transactions and allow local government to raise their rate revenue at no real cost to the community and they would become independent.

          —It is a great pleasure to rise to speak about the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill No. 4 (1996). At the outset, I must commend my colleague, the very energetic member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). Today he has given a great presentation of his thoughts on the capital gains tax which are exactly consistent with the thoughts he expressed prior to this hideous tax being introduced back in 1985. For many months he repeatedly asked questions of the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, about the tax. He was told many times during that period that there would be no capital gains tax. I am sure that as he leaves the chamber now he would agree with those sentiments.

         The main amendments in this bill deal with the change of entities involving capital gains tax rollover relief from capital gains tax for small business—a change to accelerate the depreciation rate cut&amp;hyphen;off date for Australian trading ships, insertion of generic definitions of Commonwealth education and training programs, franking account concessions for companies which have not converted them for the purpose of imputation and beneficial changes to concessional tax treatment relating to employee share acquisition schemes.

         Capital gains tax is payable on the difference between the sale price and the index cost base of assets acquired after 19 September 1985 when the asset is disposed of. Assets changing ownership, even if acquired before that date, will attract capital gains tax as well.

         As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, it can be said that this was very much a core promise of the coalition in the election campaign of 1996. It has been argued however that there could be some administrative problems with companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange and having to compare and trace stockholders' interests. However, such argument would apply only if a literal interpretation of the Income Tax Assessment Act is applied rather than the view adopted in the various rulings made by the commissioner.

         A series of changes to subdivisions in division 20 of part IIIA of the Income Tax Assessment Act define the requirements of entities to calculate whether there has been a change in the underlying interests in the entity and if the continuity of ownership has been affected. On the basis of this information, capital gains tax will apply.

         This measure is consistent with the government's objective of reducing compliance costs and increasing the efficiency of capital gains tax systems. Rollover relief from capital gains tax applies in a number of circumstances, such as involuntary disposal, transfers to wholly owned companies, changes to superannuation trust deeds and the merger of superannuation funds.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Prior to the 1996 general election, the coalition announced that, as part of the capital gains tax reform, rollover relief would be available where a business disposes of an asset to purchase a like kind of asset. This relief would be subject to certain conditions, including that the
         <break page="2090" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          disposal and purchase occur within 12 months and that the disposal price does not exceed $5 million and that the relief would be available only once every five years.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Since the 1996 budget, the scheme has been substantially the same but with the following amendments: rollover relief will be restricted to taxpayers whose net assets do not exceed $5 million; relief will be available only in respect of active assets and the acquired asset is used in the same business or a like business.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Further amendments were announced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in a release dated 3 September 1996. These are that the like business test will be removed and that the period between disposal and acquisition will be extended to two years.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is a sign of a very progressive government, a government that has gone out and listened to the needs of business, in particular small business. To sell a business and buy a like business might be all right for a very large corporation, but imagine the average Mum and Dad or, indeed, just the single sole trader who has gone out and started a small business and built it up and then found that that is not quite his niche market, but that there is another niche market. I heard my friend and colleague the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) say, an example is a farmer which I have  and which, indeed, many colleagues in regional and rural Australia have. Farmers may be forced to sell off the farm and, perhaps, move to town and rather than sitting back and going into a very early retirement they look to set up a small business.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If you applied the objective of the intention of the amendment prior to those changes announced on 3 December, there would be capital gains tax applied to that sale of the farm business because it was not transferring to a like business. But the Treasury and cabinet, in their infinite wisdom, have determined that sometimes it is a matter of a situation out of their control where one has to sell one business and go into a totally different type of business. But the main thing is continuity. By allowing a period of up to two years, it does not mean that one has to risk all of the assets that one has built in that business, by rushing into a business that, perhaps, may not be secure or sound or, indeed, where time has not been available to do the necessary market research to ensure its long&amp;hyphen;term viability.

        <para first-indent="16">
         A new division will also be inserted into part 111A of the Income Tax Assessment Act, providing a definition of an asset currently used for capital gains tax purposes. These include any form of incorporeal property, such as goodwill. The usual capital gains tax definition will include motor vehicles used in the production of income, and will exclude personal use assets, rights under superannuation, or improved deposit funds and life insurance policies. Further assets will be excluded, which will result in total savings to small business.

         When the bill was originally suggested, the savings to small business were $150 million in 1998&amp;hyphen;89, and $160 million in 1999 to 2000. However, with the announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on 3 December 1996, this has expanded to $200 million in 1998&amp;hyphen;99 and $215 million in 1999&amp;hyphen;2000. While some would say that the government is giving away money again to small business, it is actually an investment in small business. It is small business that employs the majority of the people. It is small business that takes the risk. So, to provide a small investment in that amount, spread across the 800,000 small businesses that are out there, is a very small outlay for a maximum benefit of return.

They reigned over the period of absolute record high numbers of bankruptcies and drove interest rates up to a level that would never have been dreamt possible. The only ones who benefited—and God bless their souls—were the pensioners who had a few dollars tucked away. But small business suffered. Small business could not afford to borrow or invest.  Then, when people had to sell off that business to reduce the overdraft because the banks were putting the pressure on them, the former government, in their wisdom and absolute support for small business, decided that they had better nail them a little bit more and take some capital gains tax out of them. Even though they might have wanted to go on and start another business, or reinvest into something like their superannuation, the former government said no. They wanted it all.

They build that business as their superannuation retirement fund. They work hard all their lives, building that business up.

And this government is delivering action. One of the things it is delivering, by the introduction of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1996, is a core promise to ease capital gains tax. It is an investment in small business and, more particularly, in the long term it is an investment in the job futures of all Australians.

          I was in this chamber late last night when this debate had resumed and it was interesting to listen to some of the representatives from the opposition parties, particularly the Labor Party, criticising this measure and the government. A number of speakers had a problem confining their comments to the bill. But it was interesting that the coalition government was being criticised by the Labor Party for not paying enough attention to small business. Some of the comments by members of the Labor Party were beyond belief.

          Since we have been in office, which is just on 12 months, one of the things we have achieved that we were committed to achieving for small business are low interest rates. There is nothing more important that a government can do than to try and encourage and create the environment for sustainable low interest rates for the small business sector. Just remember what happened during the 1980s and early 1990s in this country. The most devastating thing that happened to small business in the entire history of this nation was the high interest rate regime which was overseen by the former Prime Minister who was then Treasurer. He sent tens of thousands of small business people out of business. Whether they were small business people in towns, cities and urban areas, or small business people on the land, the monetary policy run by the former Prime Minister sent tens of thousands of them to the wall. That was the most damaging thing ever done to small business in Australia's history.

          So, Mr Deputy Speaker, we are not going to be lectured by the Labor Party in this debate. We are not going to be lectured by the Labor Party about what we are doing for small business and what they did or did not do for small business. This government, in 12 months, has overseen a regime in this economy which has seen interest rates fall; which has seen inflation

It has seen the report from the small business task force of the Prime Minister on deregulation. They are the things that this government has done in 12 months for the small business sector of Australia and that is the commitment of this government to seeing that we create a stable economic environment for small business to prosper in this country.

          We have done that in a 12 month period, whereas we know history has already recorded what the Labor Party did over 13 years to small business in this country. I can guarantee that what the Labor Party did over 13 years in government to small business is one of the key motivating features why a lot of the members of the coalition parties are in this place today—because they are motivated by what happened to small business over those 13 years, and particularly in those dark, black years when Paul Keating was the Treasurer of this country, driving interest rates to the level that he did and then coming out with the glib comment that `it was the recession that we had to have.' It was the recession that Paul Keating wanted. It was the recession that Paul Keating wanted because he wanted to bust the developers that he saw investing money in Australia's future in Noosa when he was on holidays up there. That is evidenced in that article that Max Walsh wrote and it is evidenced in that biography that is written by John Edwards about the former Prime Minister and Treasurer.

          So, Mr Deputy Speaker, we are not going to be lectured by the Labor Party with regard to what we are doing for small business in this country. We made a commitment at the election last year. This is the manifestation of part of that commitment and we are going to continue on that path so that we can create a stable economic environment in the Australian economy for small business to prosper, because they will provide the future growth of Australia and they will provide a lot of jobs in the future. I commend the legislation to the parliament. If we divide on this and if the Labor Party want to divide on their amendment, let the people of Australia know, and let the small business people of Australia know, that the Labor Party did not want to provide them with the capital gains tax rollover relief that the government does.

          —I would like to sum up this debate, and I think that summing up is probably encapsulated by certainly the last two speakers: the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) and the member for Lyons (Mr Vaile). Also, I would make the observation that, in regard to a debate centrally focused around the engine room of employment in this country—small business—we find that of the 14 speakers, 10 were from the government and only three from the opposition. So I think the enthusiasm with which the last two speakers have spoken in regard to this motion and debate, on behalf of the government, indicates their empathy and understanding of the actual small business sector.

         The very fact that there are only three people who came in here from the Labor Party to talk about small business and how important it is to employment really illustrates how out of touch the opposition has become in this place. We know that from the way in which the Australian people voted just over a year ago. This is a great opportunity to come in here and talk about the $200 million benefit to small business by taking away the capital gains tax. It really is a mark of this government that we are interested in small business people and small business operators. This is a fulfilment of a government promise prior to the last election that
         <break page="2099" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          we would address some of the real difficulties that small businesses were placed under by the previous government. This is a quantum leap forward by the government to assist families, to create jobs and to assist businesses throughout this great country of ours. I think for the opposition to ignore this debate in the way in which they have illustrates their lack of interest in small business in this country.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The opposition has foreshadowed a second reading amendment and the government will be opposing that amendment. That amendment deals with three particular issues. Firstly, the second reading amendment provides that the House calls on the government to ensure capital gains rollover relief is restricted to situations where a net increase in employment will occur. If the opposition spokesman on this really understood small business, this section of the amendments would not have been put. It is really about short-term populous politics as against principled positions by a government. That is what it is about—nothing more, nothing less. In framing the policy, the government, unlike the opposition, listened to small business. We actually went out there, listened to them and understood them. Small business said that the capital gains tax was an impediment to expansion and growth. Does that not imply that they were saying that the way to get employment in their sector was to take away the capital gains tax? I am not sure what the opposition really is on about in moving that sort of amendment. We believe that small business is the engine room of the economy and that the rollover relief will encourage further expansion and employment growth in this sector. It is pretty obvious to anybody who thinks about it. We listened to small business in this area and this is one of  the major planks of what they were saying to us. Clearly the opposition and certainly their opposition spokesman did not listen at all.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Secondly, the purpose of restricting rollover relief to active assets is so that the relief is only available in respect of assets directly linked to generating employment. That is why that is there. Again, I do not think that the opposition have actually read what is in the bill.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It calls on the government to closely monitor the integrity of the tax system in the light of the capital gains tax changes. They are nice sounding words in this amendment but I really find this criticism very interesting indeed. The opposition is all over the place on this measure; there is no doubt about that. On the one hand, it is frustrated that it was not able to come up with such an idea as we have and is showing its annoyance. On the other hand, it criticises us saying that company shares are not eligible for the rollover relief. It then states it is concerned about the integrity of the taxation system. How can you run both arguments on the floor of a parliament; they are totally contradictory.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Thirdly, this amendment put by the opposition says:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Reverse the reduction in the minimum proportion of the work force which must be invited to participate in an ESOP.
        </para>

         As the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) would know, the provisions in the bill implement the coalition's election commitment to provide more generous tax treatment for employee share schemes. That includes easing the employee participation conditions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We, unlike Labor, framed these changes to recognise that the employee share schemes contribute to strengthening employee participation in Australian business and to encouraging voluntary savings. These changes have been welcomed by all but the Labor Party. Everybody out there—employees and employers—have welcomed these changes. It is fairly natural that they would. Why is the Labor Party being totally ignorant of the desires of the overwhelming majority of Australian employees?

         <para first-indent="16">
          Finally, the second reading amendment asks the government to reverse the proposed limitation of accelerated depreciation to shipping. The repeal of section 57AM gives effect to the government's election commitment to repeal the Ships Capital Grants Act 1987 and related accelerated depreciation provisions. This government believes that the Australian taxpayer cannot be expected to continue pouring capital grants and depreciation concessions into the shipping industry when it failed to address the serious problems impeding development as an efficient and competitive world class industry.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I would also like to touch briefly on a number of issues raised in debate concerning the capital gains tax rollover relief for small business. Certain speakers referred to comments reported in the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Financial Review
          </emphasis>
          today by the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants. The ASCPA have raised two major concerns, and I would just like to quickly go over them. Firstly, there is the ineligibility from rollover relief where shares in a small business are sold and where that relief is available only as a trade&amp;hyphen;off against the 50 per cent goodwill exemption. When a taxpayer chooses to rollover a capital gain made on a disposed or goodwill replacement asset, the 50 per cent of goodwill exemption is deferred, not lost. The exemption will be available when the replacement asset is eventually disposed of.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Secondly, both of these design features were specifically highlighted in the budget announcement and are necessary to prevent abuse of the provision. Thirdly, the ASCPA were involved in the consultative process on the legislation for the measure after the budget. They did not raise any objections to either design feature at the time, so there was consultation with the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants. We did listen to them, and they did not raise any objections to that design feature.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Fourthly, a small business operated through a company structure can be sold in two ways: by selling the shares in the company, or by selling the underlined active assets. Rollover relief will only be available where the underlying assets are sold. While this may not always be the preferred method of disposal in some cases, this must be weighed up against the value of the rollover relief to the taxpayer, and a threat to the revenue of the measure to be extended to the sale of shares. If the measure were extended to the sale of shares, the legislation would be even more complex if the revenue were to be protected.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Comments were also made concerning the proposed amendments to section 160ZZS relating to additional compliance costs. The point that was overlooked in those comments was that the budget announcement and this legislation contain some significant concessions. Firstly, the amendment defers the date at which the assets lose their pre&amp;hyphen;CGT status, from the date when the majority underlying ownership changed to when the test of underlying ownership is required to be conducted. And, secondly, where a change in ownership has been found, entities will be able to determine the cost base for CGT purposes on the basis of market value at the date that the test was required, rather than valuing the assets at the market value on the date on which the underlying ownership actually changed.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We are opposed to the amendment which was brought by the opposition into the Main Committee and, hopefully, I have addressed some of the issues which were raised by some of the speakers and by some of the bodies outside this House that have expressed some concerns. We believe, as the government, that this legislation is vitally important to small business throughout this country of ours. It will underpin employment opportunities and will give small business a break. It is costing the budget $200 million per year, and that is a massive boost, we believe, to small business. We think that Australian families throughout this

          Moreton Bay is recognised as one of the most significant breeding grounds in Australia for a variety of fish, crustaceans and marine life. There is also a substantial colony of dugong and a large population of dolphins. With the increased usage of the bay for both recreational and industrial purposes it is increasingly important that proper management of the bay be considered.

          Currently, there is a major dispute over state government plans to change policy on crabbing operations in the bay. A number of professional and recreational crabbers and fishermen have approached me with their concerns. It has been put to me that, should the current catch quota continue unabated, Moreton Bay's crab stocks will be depleted within a matter of two years.

          There is also a considerable problem with the continual raping and pillaging of all varieties of sea life through trawling. It would seem that some professional fishermen have little regard for the future viability of the bay. The commercial fishermen have put it to me that as an industry they need these changes to the catch allowance, as there is growing demand for their product at the markets.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Their other point is that this industry supports a growing number of families. If this is the case, then better management strategies need to be used to ensure future viability of fishing for all those involved, not just the commercial fishermen but recreational fishermen as well. It is the long&amp;hyphen;term future of the fishing industry that is at stake at this point in time. With over 7,000 recreational fishermen using the bay regularly, depletion of fish stocks has been a concern for many of these fishermen. To ensure the future viability of this industry, it is  essential that we continue to fund research into fish stocks in this and many other areas of Australia.

This sort of research will be of benefit to many areas, not just to Moreton Bay.

           On one of my recent trips across the bay to North Stradbroke, I had the privilege of accompanying the state minister for emergency services and the local Air Sea Rescue crew. They were possibly the roughest conditions I have ever encountered in the bay—there were 25&amp;hyphen;knot winds; I do not mean the company on board! However, these men told me that it was nothing compared to what some fools will attempt and, unfortunately, when these reckless idiots get themselves into trouble in the middle of the bay it is these brave men and women from Air Sea Rescue who have to risk their lives to save them. The men and women of Air Sea Rescue give up their time and put their own bodies on the line for very little reward. It can also be a very gruesome job. Quite often it will be the Air Sea Rescue crew who have to pull the body of a victim from the water. This is not a job I would care to do. However, when the rewards come they can be great. This was obvious from the emotion shown by the Australian Navy officers who recently effected the rescue of the round the world yachtsmen. The sense of achievement these men must have felt would have been enough to make them forget the risks they took. For my local Air Sea Rescue crew, the elation of saving a life on Moreton Bay would be no less than it was for these brave naval officers.

When an accident occurs on Moreton Island the locals contact the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Charleville, an arrangement which seems strange when the Royal Brisbane Hospital is just two hours away and the recently upgraded ambulance station on North Stradbroke Island is just half an hour away by helicopter.

           I would like to turn my attention to another section of the bill, and that is the additional appropriation for assistance to people with disabilities. Just this week I had great pleasure in confirming additional funding and employment places for people with disabilities in my electorate. Both the Horizon Foundation and Bayside GATE Employment Service have received extra funding for the disabled. I met with representatives from both these organisations recently to discuss their needs.

Both services have assured me that the increase in funding will go a long way to providing much needed employment opportunities for the disabled. These people have an enormous contribution to make to our communities and the government's commitment to these services is to be applauded.

Under the government's black spot funding program, local communities are being encouraged to identify black spots in their community. In my electorate of Bowman we have several potential sites.

The corner that I mentioned was the site of a fatality on New Year's Day this year. An elderly lady was struck by a car as she crossed the road. It is not uncommon for pedestrians to come to grief on this corner, as usually confusion reigns supreme. To make matters worse, it is used by a great number of school students and parents.

          —I rise to speak on the appropriation bills as they apply to the coalition government's industry policies. This is not unrelated to the debate that we had in this chamber this morning. My speech is made against the background of a mixed industry response to government industry policy. Last Saturday, 1 March, in the

          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Australian Financial Review
          </emphasis>
          relating to manufacturing increasing as a percentage of exports. The article says that the national chief
          <break page="2106" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           executive of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, Mr Alan Handberg, stressed that the growth in manufactured exports was unlikely to be sustained without a national plan, and that manufactured exports still lagged a long way behind manufactured imports.

         So there is still a long way to go, but I see manufacturing as having the potential to fill the employment gap between the high wage, high skill industries, where there is not a lot of employment growth, and the low wage, part&amp;hyphen;time and casual employment areas where most of this country's employment growth is. The recently released ABS employment figures show that 38,400 new jobs were created in January. However, nearly 35,000 of these were part time. To highlight a problem that this is creating in the training area—I know the honourable member for Latrobe (Mr Charles) would be quite interested in this—I will quote from a paper given by Richard Sweet from the Dusseldorp Skills Forum at the Tasmanian Education Consortium in Hobart, which was held on 10 to 12 October last year. It states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         In May 1996 part&amp;hyphen;time work accounted for a quarter of all employment, but in retail trade and the accommodation and hospitality industries it accounted for one job in two. In the service sector in particular the rapid growth of part&amp;hyphen;time casual employment, among both adults and among young people, has severely limited the scope for apprenticeships or traineeships to establish themselves, as the existing models are largely based upon the assumption that both young people and those that supervise and train them in the workplace have a full&amp;hyphen;time job.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         I believe that the manufacturing industry can provide the real jobs, the training and employment growth and the fair wage rates that middle Australia is crying out for. Yet under the coalition's policy of cutting assistance, manufacturing industry is not being able to reach  its full potential. In fact, the long&amp;hyphen;term prediction for our manufacturing industry is far from rosy. Surely this must be of some concern to the government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If we look at what industry is saying, we can get a clearer position of how industry sees the future. I looked back over the last nine months to see what business commentators, business reports and surveys were saying. In June last year, a survey by the Australian Business Chamber and the State Bank of 500 New South Wales companies showed that the June quarter was the sixth in a row where production, sales and orders had all weakened. In response, companies were reducing prices and cutting back on employment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We saw the same two organisations reporting in September that Australian manufacturers were continuing to experience adverse conditions. The prediction in that survey was that manufacturing could shed as many as 15,000 jobs in the year ahead due to these adverse conditions. Mr Philip Holt, the managing director of the Australian Business Chamber, said at the time that several factors were affecting business conditions in manufacturing—and he listed them—but, clearly, Mr Holt's major concern related to the government's lack of commitment to a strong, clear industry policy.

         This lack of leadership in industry policy was further amplified at a dinner hosted by the Heavy Engineering Manufacturers Association, whose membership includes major companies such as BHP, Transfield and ANI. The chairman of the St George Bank and Howard Smith Ltd, Mr Frank Conroy, told the dinner that there was a `vacuum of embarrassed silence' on key issues relating to industry and employment. In his speech at the association's dinner, on 9 October in Canberra, Mr Conroy  said:

         Perhaps even more frightening is that there is no apparent answer to the problem of employment. Worse, there is very little serious public debate or understanding of what might be an "acceptable level of unemployment" in today's fast changing economy.

         Mr Deputy Speaker, you can see that industry itself is certainly not conveying a lot of confidence in the government's policy. In August, a visiting Harvard economist Mr Jeffrey Sachs, while praising some of the economic reforms introduced in Australia was nevertheless critical of Australia's lack of encouragement for manufacturing exports. In his talks in Australia, Sachs referred to the successful Asian economies where special export manufacturing zones, with tax holidays and other assistance, are designed to attract foreign investors. Some of those may well be disgruntled Australian manufacturers.

The survey covered 250 businesses in technology, mining, telecommunications, building, food, chemicals, pharmaceutical and manufacturing, and showed that more than half expected to reduce their R&amp;D investment by 20 per cent or more because of changes to R&amp;D assistance.

New South Wales manufacturers received $65 million in orders, which, according to ISO economic multipliers, converted to approximately 1,900 New South Wales jobs.

         As a nation we are relying too heavily on imports to meet local demands for manufactured goods—as we all know. Our reliance on imports is a major contributor to Australia's disastrous balance of payments figures—our current account deficit was $1.4 billion in December last year.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Mr Bert Evans, Chairman of the New South Wales ISO, said in the annual report:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         Consider our 1995/96 import bill of $77 billion. If we replaced just five per cent of that with local production we could create 113,000 new jobs; over $1 billion in extra taxes and charges to governments; nearly $1 billion in welfare savings; and nearly $900 million in extra consumer spending. These are the objectives that the ISO is endeavouring to achieve.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         Rather than depend on restricting imports by tariff and non&amp;hyphen;tariff barriers, the ISO lets the market decide what imports should be replaced. By matching the needs of purchasers, who would otherwise be importing, to the industrial capacity of Australian manufacturing the ISO has replaced imports on a commercially viable basis.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The ISO has been successful in convincing many Australian industries to switch to locally made products based on cost and quality. This means that the economic growth which occurs with the replacement of these imports has been achieved without adding to inflation. By buying better value, these purchasers actually contribute to the control of inflation.

         During its 12 years of operation, the ISO has been demonstrating how to develop industry and create jobs through import replacement. The annual report highlights a number of major projects that the ISO has been involved in over the past 12 months. I intend to briefly mention some of these projects as outlined in the review.

         The Sydney airport noise attenuation project required airconditioning of houses and schools under the flight paths and for these premises to be completely sealed and insulated against noise.

         ISO involvement has led to Australia's only spark plug manufacturer, Champion, replacing its wide use of imported steel rod with a BHP product which will result in millions of dollars worth of export income for Australia. ISO has also targeted overseas manufacturers to replace steel intensive imports with Australian made steel. The program has resulted in one manufacturer of 50&amp;hyphen; to 120&amp;hyphen;tonne mining trucks, who was about to import onto the Australian market, being introduced to local manufacturers capable of producing payload trays. An additional $3 million of work for Australia also is being targeted in the ship container market.

         Also, the close working relationship developed between the New South Wales ISO and the Australian defence industry has exposed many Hunter region manufacturers to the world of leading edge defence technology. This exposure has come about through the construction, at Carrington, of one of the most advanced naval vessels in the world. After just two years into an eight&amp;hyphen;year contract, the Australian industry involvement in this project is already set to exceed 69 per cent of the $1.2 billion total contract value. Of the 1,150 active suppliers to the project, over 900 are Australian and New Zealand companies and more than half of them are based in the Hunter region. The approach by ISO and ADI has enabled local capacity to develop the Hunter region into one of the world's most advanced shipbuilding centres.

         The ISO annual review also reported on a successful project involving ISO, Davey John Brown Pty Ltd and BHP Steel. The joint effort related to the No. 6 blast furnace at the BHP Port Kembla facility. While ISO located suitable Australian manufacturers for different components, Davey John Brown Pty Ltd and BHP negotiated with offshore equipment designers to have their designs built locally rather than in  foreign workshops. The $10 million of extra local business for this project will create approximately 300 extra jobs and place some $2.6 million in consumer spending power into the pockets of Australian families. The development of regional manufacturing capacity, as detailed in the minehunter and BHP projects, is being encouraged by the New South Wales ISO establishing regional offices in the Illawarra, Orange and Albury.

         Mr Deputy Speaker, it is appropriate that you arrived in the chair at this time, as I was speaking about the great value that ISO has brought to the industry in Port Kembla. I am a strong supporter of the Industrial Supplies Office—I am not too sure whether you are familiar with its role. As I understand, it is basically funded by the New South Wales government. However, there is a peak national body called the ISO network, and I would appeal to the current federal government to look strongly at the work that this organisation does because it does a great job for Australian industry.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         You can see from these remarks that the ISO network is playing a major role in sourcing work for Australian industry. I understand that, under the previous Labor government's industry policy, some 13 consultants were funded to work with various ISO networks throughout Australia in specific fields. I am concerned that this current government will cut the funding for these consultants. I would urge the government to follow the Australian Chamber of Manufactures suggestion and expand the activities of the Industrial Supplies Office in the interests of manufacturing industry in Australia.

           I aired in the last parliament. The report was prepared by Mr Terry Donnelly of Western Australia. Mr Donnelly is not a professional investigator; he has no personal or vested interest in the subject matter of this report.

         Cash Converters Pty Ltd was registered on 6 January 1988. According to its documents of incorporation, the company's principal business activity was to be that of `franchisor'.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The trading company began its operations in Western Australia where it opened a handful of stores. After that, expansion was rapid. In April 1995, following some changes in the composition of its board of directors, the trading company's shares were acquired by a new company called Cash Converters International Ltd, the `holding company'. Thirty&amp;hyphen;five per cent of the share capital in the holding company was floated on the London stock market in  December 1995. By that time there were 129 Cash Converters stores in Australia. In addition, there were 85 overseas stores.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The public trading activities that the Cash Converters group support are pawnbroking and dealing in second&amp;hyphen;hand goods. Both are regulated businesses, the first being concerned with lending on the security of goods and the second with the simple purchase and resale of goods. Because of the high interest rates charged by pawnbrokers to their customers and the wide margins expected by dealers on buying and selling goods, both these operations form highly profitable businesses. But, above all else, they need substantial working capital. The Cash Converters group has gone beyond the simple practice of pawnbroking and dealing to develop the concept of packaging and franchising those activities.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are a handful of key individuals whose influence on the organisation is all&amp;hyphen;pervading. Brian Cumins is the founder of the business. He personally opened the first Cash Converters pawnbroking shop in Perth, Western Australia. George McIntosh Smith was involved formerly with Brian Cumins in his Bed Shed business. He is a director of Kundahera Pty Ltd, the franchisee of Cash Converters Subiaco; a director of Cumbri Enterprises Pty Ltd, the franchisee of Cash Converters Fremantle; and a director of Sunvale Pty Ltd, the franchisee of Cash Converters Bunbury.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Craig Eric Green operates franchises at Melville, Cannon Hill and Stones Corner in Queensland. Peter Cumins is the younger brother of Brian Cumins and a qualified accountant with a civil service background. Michael Ian Cooke is a solicitor who has practised for some years in Western Australia. His practice has handled Cash Converters' non&amp;hyphen;contentious legal work since 1992. Wayne Hubbard and his brother Russell are the largest franchisees in Australia, having numerous stores in Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria.

         I would now like to highlight some accounting and administrative irregularities. First, the cost of establishing each new trading outlet is typically between $200,000 and $500,000. Apart from initial setting&amp;hyphen;up costs and usual business overheads, trading itself makes enormous cash demands—at least during the first two or three years. The operation was only established in
         <break page="2111" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          1988 and it now has nearly 200 outlets around the world. This has required far more money than is disclosed anywhere in the accounts of the various group companies lodged with the Australian Securities Commission.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Second, individual bookkeeping irregularities are necessarily complicated to demonstrate, but are to be found throughout the companies' financial documents. For the sake of convenience, these are highlighted as and where they have been discovered among the case histories of failed franchises set out in appendix 6 to the report by Terry Donnelly.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Third, there is a curious anomaly in the April 1994 prospectus concerning the finance company. In it, the auditors are shown as Messrs Murphy Sherry and Co., 1st floor, 885 Albany Highway, East Victoria Park, Western Australia. The independent auditors' report is provided on the letterhead of Messrs Murphy Sherry and Co. showing their address as 305 Abernethy Road, Cloverdale, Western Australia, and giving telephone numbers pertinent to Accountancy WA and Half Price Accounting, of which R.J.Murphy is the principal.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The reality is that Murphy Sherry and Co. did not move out of the Victoria Park address—Cash Converters' own main office—until after or about April 1995. The false statement maintained, over a very long period, the illusion of the auditors' physical separation from the trading company. It ought to be a matter of concern to the ASC that this irregularity was allowed to persist in the important area of information provided in a registered prospectus.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Fourth, when the holding company's shares were floated in late 1995, Henderson Crosthwaite, as the company's UK institutional directors, correctly stated on behalf of the holding company that the potential for its continued growth depended on the requirement that `all existing outlets continue to trade, and continue to make their contracted weekly payments.'
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Similarly, the directors of Franchise Investments International Ltd—another group company—stated at pages 25 and 26 of their prospectus, dated 24 July 1996, that the risk factor of investing in their company was `the financial security of Cash Converters International Ltd and hence the reputation of the Cash Converters system is substantially dependent on the continued success of the Cash Converters franchised outlets' linked to `the continued ability of franchises to pay contracted fees to the company as and when they fall due'.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Notwithstanding the above statement contained in prospectus documents for the information of potential investors, the accounts of the holding company prior to its flotation failed to make any provision for the fact that by October 1995 the company's Victorian franchisees were in arrears to the extent of over at least $400,000 and that the majority of its Victorian franchisees were struggling to meet their obligations. Those same facts were not made public in the holding company's prospectus dated 16 October 1995, which was approved by its directors, its auditors and both the Australian stockbroker, Morgan Stockbroking Ltd, and the UK stockbroker, Henderson Crosthwaite Corporation Finance Ltd.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Franchising, as a business solution to the inherent problem of expanding while under&amp;hyphen;capitalised, was explored for the trading company in a thoroughly researched feasibility study prepared in 1988 by Penny Kirby of All Media Direct. She is the wife of Barrington Kirby who was originally a director of the trading company but had resigned in 1990. In the `Cash Converters story, 1995' at page 64, Brian Cumins lists the common benefits of franchising as follows: first, the franchisee gets to operate under an accepted and well known trading name. Second, a business management system which is proven and tested is supplied. Third, head office makes sure that physical support is available during the commissioning process of a new
         <break page="2112" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          franchise. Fourth, information on how to handle legal, accounting, taxation and employment regulations is immediately available. Fifth, training is provided and professional marketing services are handled on a centralised basis which allows for economies of scale. Sixth, it is in the interests of franchisors to make their businesses work, it is against their interests to allow a franchisee to fail, and they tend to react accordingly. Seven, new franchisees are chosen with great care, and not simply because they have the licence fee available. This has the effect of screening out those who are patently unsuitable. Eight, statistics show that 90 per cent of franchised businesses survive and flourish.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Such ideals have not characterised the Cash Converters system of franchising. Nearly 70 per cent of their Victorian franchises have failed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Subjugation by debt has been achieved by Cash Converters Pty Ltd by enforcing the following key elements: first is the enforcement of initial and weekly licence fees, the former being known as a fixed fee, though in reality it is a sum of money ranging from $50,000 to $200,000 per store, apparently based on no better criteria than what each franchisee could bear. The weekly fee tends to start at around $500 and rise annually to $1,500 reviewed thereafter on CPI changes.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Second is the enforcement of a training levy debited monthly to the franchisee whether or not he uses the Cash Converters training program. Third, there is an advertising levy of 7.5  per cent of gross bookings charged to each franchisee. Such advertising is controlled entirely by the trading company, which retains any discounts obtained and fails to account properly for its charges. Some amazing calculations and extracts from the trading company's standard franchise agreement are set out in appendix 5. The real effect is that the genuine franchisees are in fact subsidising the advertising costs of those outlets under the control of the trading company's core directors.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Fourth, every franchisee must initially invest $5,000 in the Cash Converters finance company and agree to vest all share voting rights and interest earned in Cash Converters Pty Ltd. In addition, each franchisee must advance to the finance company a monthly sum to build a capital fund to enable renewal of the franchise on expiry of the prior term. These payments are received by the finance company as subscriptions for unsecured notes, and therefore constitute an interest free loan to the finance company. The right, title and interest of the franchisee in and to the notes is assigned and mortgaged to the franchisor.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Upon assignment, expiration or termination of the franchise agreement, the franchisee is required to sell his shares to the franchisor for $1 per share. Ostensibly, these payments are for the renewal of the franchise at the end of each 10 years. In fact, with the constant turnover of franchises, this scheme allows the key players access to a massive ongoing cash flow—an enhanced debt subjugation of the franchisees. Most loans that the author of this report has cited have been made to enable franchisees to pay arrears of advertising and franchise fees.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Brian Cumins has often remarked that Cash Converters franchises are sold on the sizzle and not the sausage. Much of that sizzling has occurred in Victoria, which was targeted by the company following Mrs Kirby's bullish feasibility study. Some of the result in human cost is exemplified in the case history summarised in appendix 6. These represent just a handful of the many franchise breakdowns where the only beneficiary was the trading company or one of its associated companies.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It can be argued that the franchisees entered freely into their standard contracts and have to accept them. Against that, all the evidence is that it is the policy of the trading company
         <break page="2113" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          to dissuade incomers from taking independent legal or accounting advice. The accounting practices are unfair; the contracts themselves deliberately fail to provide any dispute resolution procedures or arbitration clauses; and the manipulation of the contracts by the trading company amounts to systematic oppression of those who are in a manifestly weaker bargaining position.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the main themes of the report has been the inherent commercial impossibility of expanding so rapidly a cash hungry business that has no obvious sources of funding. The existence in Australia of large sums of black money is an officially acknowledged fact. Money laundering, in the sense of trying in financial terms to legitimise such cash in the hands of its possessor, is a task that occupies the minds and ingenuity of many. One typical way is to feed the cash into an apparently respectable business so that it can be drawn out again in what appears to be a lawful payment or expense.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is from sources such as those that Brian Cumins was able to borrow, at interest rates of around 40 per cent per annum, the funds that would be lent through the stores that he and his fellow directors controlled. As illustrated in appendix 2 of the report, the same funds would be lent to Cash Converters' clients, borrowing at interest rates of 30 per cent per month.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Even on the evidence of disclosed accounts, huge amounts of cash have been injected into Cash Converters' businesses, always provided that they have been stores in which Brian Cumins has had a personal financial interest. This happened systematically during the  companies' expansion in Victoria during 1991. As then managing director of the trading company, Brian Cumins lent or invested cash sums totalling not less than $634,043.62 in Cash Converters stores at Dandenong, Moonee Ponds, Preston, Clayton and Forest Hill—all of them stores in which he was financially involved. The details of these are listed in appendix 7.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Over the past seven years there has been a sharp increase in the nation's crime figures, particularly those involving juveniles. In Western Australia, where Cash Converters has its roots, the number of offences relating to stealing and breaking and entering rose from 87,238 to 133,247—an increase of 65 per cent. In order to fund their expensive habit, young drug addicts steal—often from family and friends—and take the goods to Cash Converters and other pawnbrokers and second&amp;hyphen;hand dealers. Within two hours of committing a break, young criminals have sold the goods, organised their drug purchases and hit up.

         Modern homes, as we all know, brim with smart items—television sets, computers, hi&amp;hyphen;fis, videos and camcorders—whose great merit is that they are portable, valuable and instantly marketable—as good as cash, in fact, just waiting to be converted. In its simplest form, a desperate addict with a $600&amp;hyphen;a&amp;hyphen;day drug habit will steal goods worth several thousand dollars and pawn or sell them for a few hundred.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When South Australian police raided a Cash Converters store in Gouger Street, Adelaide, in April 1996, they found that 40 per cent of the goods held there were reported stolen. The store had been open for four months, but still its opening stock had not been recorded in its books, as legally required. Peter Cumins admitted later that the franchisee at Gouger Street failed to follow the proper procedures in this respect. You can only ask what the proper procedures might be!
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another police operation in New South Wales, known as Operation Basalt, led to 135 people being charged on a total of 2,612 counts involving stolen goods worth about $2 million. The much heralded and publicised Cash Converters ID card has not reduced crime against property. Rather, it has led to an increase in the volume of stolen goods being processed through Cash

         The reality is that almost anyone can pass the 100&amp;hyphen;point test to get the ID card and, once in possession of it, there will be few—if any—checks on whether its holder is selling stolen goods. The words of the many innocent victims, helpless in the knowledge that the loss of their possessions has been facilitated by an apparently unregulated system, are represented by the examples set out in appendix 9 of the report. Their names have not been divulged, but all such details are available with supporting documents.

         On Thursday, 30 November 1995, the holding company, Cash Converters International Ltd, was launched on the London Stock Exchange. In the light of all the comments above and the criticism at the time in the Australian parliament regarding Cash Converters' operations, it is surprising that the flotation went ahead and was counted a success. Apart from all other considerations, why should the controlling directors want ownership of the phantom money in the group to pass to outside shareholders? The answer is that it did not. When you have phantom money, it is best to have a phantom flotation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Appendix 10 shows a list extracted from the holding company's register of shareholders following the flotation. It reveals that of the 34 million shares issued by the holding company more than 73 per cent are held behind a screen of nominees. A further two per cent of the floated share capital is owned openly by Brian Cumins and his co&amp;hyphen;directors, Peter Cumins and Michael Cooke, or his other close associates, Simon Martin and Russell Hubbard. All of this, of course, excludes the retained 66 million shares, which remained at all times in the hands of the controlling directors and their associates.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In conclusion, having obtained the accolade of a Stock Exchange flotation, the holding company is anxious to press ahead with the marketing of its franchises internationally, but indications are that this is proving more difficult than expected in Europe and the United States of America. It is easy to find victims in the pages of this report: those who have been unwise enough, as outsiders, to invest money as franchisees in the Cash Converters group; those whose goods are stolen, often by family and friends, to provide the raw stock for the pawnbroking and dealing trades; those who pay their taxes knowing that others in their midst are above such concerns; even those with a dependency on drugs who remain beyond help while such a well&amp;hyphen;organised system makes it easy for the desperate to get what they think they need.

Surely, when a school's engravings are on the equipment, plus the installed software, then why weren't they contacted to determine if the school was missing the equipment before they put it on sale.

          —I wish to speak on the appropriation bills on the matter of the economy, with a focus on regions and, in particular, Tasmania. I recently submitted a paper to the Nixon inquiry, which is an inquiry into the Tasmanian economy. I believe that we have to consider the implications of past, current and future policy on the direction that can be taken by areas outside the urban fringes. Tasmania is a good case study, as it holds many of the problems that other states also face.

         Australia has had a number of challenges over the years. Change has been massive in the past three decades, with technology changing as rapidly in the past 10 years as it has in the past 100. Politicians need to understand the processes of change to adapt their strategies to cope with the results of that change. It is often a fine balancing act of knowing where and when to intervene and when not to, and this is particularly poignant in Tasmania because of its small population and isolation. It being my home state, it must be my prime consideration. However, I am interested in the overall regional economic questions for the country.

         Current trends in regional development which affect the economic wellbeing of rural and regional areas are infrastructure, transport, unemployment, communications, health, education, energy, banks and commerce, changes in the major industries, growth or decline of regional markets and foreign markets, exports and tourism—to name the major ones. There are also the difficulties of cutting back the public sector without replacing it with some mechanism to assist those who live and work outside urban areas. We should look at the implications of social and technological change on our major resource industries. The sale of government assets—and the impact of the Hilmer report on a community that cannot benefit by either the public or the private sector's economies of scale—is considerable.

           Federal government policy on tariffs will be of great significance to regional manufacturing investment. There needs to be a politically bipartisan approach in considering the tariff threshold. Tasmania can be the hardest hit when tariffs are lowered or abandoned when overseas competitors are comfortably subsidised. Areas such as dairy produce, car parts manufacturing, clothing and textiles, for example, are having difficulties competing in the export game when they are up against very differently structured and protected competitors.

So those companies that are still operating successfully need to be encouraged to stay in the country and maintain job levels.

           There has been some deep concern also at the way that the Hilmer report has been used. Hilmer stated that competition is an important and powerful force for economic efficiency and he concluded that economic efficiency generally was a great benefit to consumers. He went on to say:
          </para>
          <para font-size="-=2">
           We recognise that competition might not always be effective in achieving consumer benefits or that it might lead to conflicts with other social goals. Competition policy thus aims to produce guidelines that determine the nature and extent of competition and the ways in which possible conflicts between results of competition, economic efficiency and other social goals are to be handled.
          </para>
          <para style="Para">
           Those who have taken on the Hilmer ideas without reading what he was actually saying have come to interpret his paper as saying that competition is de rigeur without considering the possible conflicts with other social goals. In the public sector, which includes local government and all the other levels, sometimes competition is not the most efficient way to deal with efficiencies. Tasmania is not an easy state to apply competition policy in its completely deregulated sense. There are other factors where the marketplace cannot assist.

           Other commentators have also been addressing this issue and have come to the same conclusion. The local community is best placed to develop solutions to local problems.

This government does not appear to have anything that will really deal with the ills that have beset this country in the last few months.

I am conscious of that problem. So was the former government for 13 years, frankly.

It is a question that frustrates everybody in the federal parliament, and I suspect our state colleagues as well. It is a question that has very little to do with trade and trade policy and a great deal to do with technological change.

           I stand alone on this matter. The truth is that it was, in fact, a Labor administration under Gough Whitlam that pruned the first substantial 25 per cent out of the tariff reductions. It was the Hawke and Keating governments that subsequently put us onto an arrangement that saw tariffs falling progressively from as high as 57 to 60 per cent in the automotive industry down to 15 per cent now. The debate now is about what happens to the remainder.

         I know this and I feel passionately about it because the industry with which I have been most involved—the citrus industry—itself enjoyed tariff protection of something like 45 per cent which was phased down to five per cent—not by the present government but by the former government. Let Australia be aware: this is not an issue that we have initiated. But let us be fair as well as aware. This is an issue that we, in opposition, were supportive of. It is time that the now opposition paused and asked itself what it was like to be in opposition from 1983 until 1996 in the face of these tariff changes and to say that the then government was doing the right thing.

Mr McArthur said what he said to him was, `A tariff is just like me saying to the plasterer in a country town "We won't allow anybody else to come into the town and do any plastering unless their costs are raised by 20 per cent."' If you are the local plasterer that is good news. But, over time, if every one else in the town wants a plastering job done the local plasterer does not have to be as efficient and the costs go up.

          The member for Lyons made so much of regional unemployment. The only way in which we can really solve the problem of unemployment in the regions, or in the urban areas, is obviously to have people employed in world competitive industries. We do that not by increasing tariffs but by ensuring that we are doing what we do better than the rest of the world. Do you want an illustration? Take a look at my state of South Australia where the wine industry is currently an export leader without any tariff protection at all. Why is it an export leader? It may not be the best illustration of a labour intensive industry, but it certainly is relatively labour intensive and it is a value added industry. Effectively, here we have a business in which the value&amp;hyphen;adding is occurring in Australia and yet exports are opening up every day. It is an illustration of the fact that industries can be cultivated in Australia without specifically having tariff walls in place.

          I do not want to delay the chamber, but I do want to make the point that the World Trade Organisation obligations that the previous government entered into—obligations endorsed by this government—should not be questioned by members of the previous government now that they are in opposition. Those obligations, while they have brought with them a good deal of discomfort for some industries, have also given Australia enormous market access that would otherwise have been denied it. It is too easy to paint a picture of Australia as being the only country that adheres to the WTO guidelines. The facts are that every signatory to the WTO agreement is obliged to  lower their tariffs and increase their market access.

         I now turn to the appropriation bills and, in particular, to appropriations under the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Airservices Australia. In speaking to these appropriations, I think it very appropriate that I lament the lack of appropriations given to the people of Kurnell  as recompense for the amount of aircraft noise they have been expected to endure since the opening of the third runway. I have written to my colleague the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) in his capacity as Chairman of the Sydney Airport Community Forum, and also to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), following the release of the long&amp;hyphen;term operating plan for Sydney airport, in order to raise with them the compelling case for recognising the unique exposure of Kurnell residents to aircraft noise, and to ask for special consideration for the Kurnell village.

         It should be noted that the Airservices Australia report contains recommendations only. However, it seems that all possibilities raised or canvassed for flight path modes of operation see the residents of Kurnell affected. Indeed, in the preferred mode of operation advanced by Airservices Australia, the residents of Kurnell will experience a minimum of 55 per cent of all non&amp;hyphen;curfew flights. Kurnell residents already experience curfew flights and will be expected to continue to bear this burden. In this respect, Kurnell residents are in the unique position of being potentially exposed to aircraft noise at any time in a 24&amp;hyphen;hour period.

         I refer to the Airservices report and, in particular, to recommendation 4.

It is also stated that we should interchange use of the other modes to ensure a fair sharing of unavoidable aircraft noise subject to weather and traffic demands—a fair sharing. However, they say that at any time that weather conditions permit—thank heaven for the weather—and traffic levels can be sustained, mode 4 or runway 16L departures/runway 34L arrivals will be the nominated runway.

         It seems that the Kurnell residents will be subject to noise. They will be the preferred people to be subject to this noise if this report is adopted.

         The unique and special claims of the village of Kurnell are only too apparent. The acceptance of its unique position is evidenced by the establishment of a committee purely to examine in detail the plight of Kurnell residents. In the past Kurnell has received no compensation apart from the insulation of Kurnell public school. This injustice has occurred because the official Australian noise exposure forecast contour maps preclude Kurnell from the compensation regime. Indeed, in the Airservices report it is noted that the Sutherland Shire Council said the Kurnell peninsula had been particularly heavily impacted by the third runway, which placed the centre line directly over the village.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The council submitted that residents who lived west of Dampier Street, Kurnell, have borne the brunt of night time aircraft noise for many years, particularly from small aircraft, and that the provision of insulation should be considered for their sleeping areas to alleviate the disturbance created. The Kurnell situation clearly sets it apart from other claims for consideration. Apart from the unique impact of aircraft noise, Kurnell is an isolated community with one road access, sharing the peninsula with a major refinery. The re&amp;hyphen;installation of the public wharf at Kurnell with an embarkation point at La Perouse is essential to provide alternative egress and access. In view of the looming Sydney Olympics and Kurnell's status as the meeting place between Captain Cook and indigenous Australians, the potential for a ferry route across the heads is enormous.

         The special circumstances of Kurnell demand access to funds established from the noise tax. As the land values of Kurnell have dropped substantially following the opening of the third runway an ongoing program of community enhancement measures should be pursued to examine ways of improving land values and quality of life in Kurnell. There are a number of other things that could be done to enhance the community of Kurnell and I think that access should be provided to the noise fund to look at ways of improving this amenity to improve the quality of life of these people who have borne the brunt of this noise. We need to carefully consider the option of funding low interest relocation loans from the noise fund for those who cannot cope. I would like it to be properly examined.

         Finally, it is imperative that we conduct a study into the effects of airport associated pollution on this community, which is adjacent to the airport but for water. It is said that water acts more as a conduit than a barrier in those circumstances and I believe that such a study is warranted. Another matter that has been of considerable interest to me is the proposal for aircraft departing to the south to turn east out to sea over Bait Bay after passing to the west of the Kurnell village. I have been pushing for the consideration of this out to sea proposal ever since I was elected on 2 March last year. It has been the subject of numerous letters to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Indeed, at times I think the minister's staff see me more in the line of a vexatious letter writer.

          —Before the suspension, I was referring to the out to sea proposal, which I have been fighting for assiduously for the people of Cronulla. On 4 July, the minister wrote to me in response to one of many representations I have made on behalf of constituents. He wrote:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         You will recall that the original proposal which was rejected involved aircraft making a 3 degree turn away from the coast, from the 163 degree to the 160 degree radial. CASA has now suggested a new option which increases the turn away from the coast from 3 degrees to 13 degrees (ie a turn from the 163 degree to the 150 degree radial).
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         This turn would take aircraft approximately 3 kilometres further off the coast at Bundeena than is currently the case on the 163 degree radial. I am advised that this new proposal would lead to noticeable reductions in noise levels at both Cronulla and Bundeena.

        <para style="Para">
         Of course, my considered response to that was: Yes! Yes! Yes! We are still waiting for the out to sea proposal to be implemented. Although I would have liked earlier progress on this issue it was not, I was advised, possible to pre&amp;hyphen;empt the deliberations of the task force.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If the recommendations of the task force are accepted by the minister and, in particular, the rejection—touch wood—of mode 2, then there is no reason why the simulated testings required cannot proceed post haste. Although this is not soon enough for some, including myself, the progress made thus far is in the right direction.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the positive aspects of the task force report is the rejection of mode 2. That mode would have seen jet and non&amp;hyphen;jet departures cutting through the heart of my electorate and all landings on 34R directly over the Kurnell village. In the words of Airservices Australia:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         This would place aircraft very close to or over Cronulla and would negate any initiatives discussed above to move aircraft further to sea off Cronulla.

         They also say:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         It is not proposed that this mode be included in the plan due to the unique airspace arrangements that would need to be employed and to limit the number of runway modes to limit complexity of the airways system to maintain a safe operating regime.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         On an ominous note, they go on to say:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         However, this Mode could be the subject of further consideration if the noise sharing objectives of the plan cannot be achieved with the proposed modes. The need for this mode would be obviated if Mode 4 can be optimised to achieve similar traffic capacity.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         I read that very much as a rejection of that mode—and I hope and pray that is adhered to—because it would be a total disaster for the people of my electorate.
        </para>

         A further matter that concerns me is the comment on page 46 of the Airservices Australia report. That says:

         <para font-size="-=2">
          The proposed operational modes for Sydney Airport will at least be valid until the second airport is ready, which will not be before the early years of the next century. When the second airport is ready it will be necessary to review the airspace management arrangements for the Sydney region and this may lead to changes to the flight paths for Sydney airport.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          Preliminary work on the airspace management arrangements for the second airport is being undertaken for the EIS by the Department of Transport and Regional Development, in conjunction with Airservices Australia.

          It seems to me that we need a second major airport to service the Sydney basin. Not least among my concerns is the increased use of Sydney airport and the additional pressure that this will place on surrounding suburbs. This does not mean that the hourly cap will not be able to be maintained, because additional aircraft may be accommodated by a pre&amp;hyphen;arranged slot system.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Nevertheless, without a second airport there will be greater pressure on KSA. I am concerned, however, that the Holsworthy options, particularly the northern Holsworthy option, are just too close to KSA. We have gone through considerable anguish already in trying to come to grips with modes of operation for KSA. When these are finally determined, I think it would be a shame to have to go through the process all over again, if that is indeed what the Holsworthy option would necessitate.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I wanted to raise these matters today in speaking to this bill because they are of considerable interest to many of my constituents. Of course, the people of Kurnell, who have borne the brunt of aircraft noise and under this report would be expected to continue to bear the brunt  of aircraft noise, need and deserve some consideration. It is interesting that if you look at runway movements in the past, also reported in the report, the modes that are nominated as being the actuals very much include the Kurnell Village. Mode 10, for instance, accounted for 65 per cent of actuals in 1995. That involves departure jet tracks around Kurnell Village. If you look at mode 9, that involves arrivals over the Kurnell Village.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There has been a lot of criticism of Airservices Australia. I have not been indiscriminate in my criticism. I think that it has been a very difficult task to come up with the report they have come up with. In some instances I can see that they have tried to consider the individual case of Kurnell residents. For instance, if you look at mode 9 arrivals on 34 left and 34 right, you will note that the jets, instead of coming in on the third runway, are tracked to come in on the second runway. I think this has been done as a deliberate attempt to show some consideration for the sensitivities of the people of Kurnell. I know that the representative of the Kurnell community, the Kurnell Flight Path Action Committee, Kevin Hill, who is also my nominee on the community consultative forum, is working very closely with Airservices Australia to try to achieve the best result for the people of Kurnell.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          But that is around the edges. What we need is particular consideration for those people, and I think they deserve access to the noise fund that has been established for the very purpose of looking after people who are expected to bear more than their fair share of aircraft noise, and that certainly applies to the people of Kurnell. So I put it to the parliament and to the minister: it is about time the people of Kurnell received the consideration that they deserve, and I commend that to the House.

          —Speaking on Appropriation Bill (No. 3), it is a pleasure to rise and make a few general comments. I guess over the last 12 months it has been a very active parliamentary year. The government inherited some well documented facts of life when it first came to office. I will mention basics: $100 billion of Commonwealth debt, with just
          <break page="2128" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           under $10 billion of interest. Faced with that dilemma, as well as the $8 billion deficit, the efforts that have been made by the government are highly commendable. The budget of August last year focused on a whole range of issues. If I were to name three things, they would be a better balance in our overall economy, a stronger investment climate and a focus on stronger wealth creation, leading to attacking the whole issue of unemployment.
          </break>
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other subsidiary issues, if you like, are those issues like native title, tariffs, the funding of the ABC, and smaller issues like the earning credit scheme, education in regional areas, investment, telecommunications and the general direction of the government. These are some of the things that I will address in the time allocated today.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The issue of native title, particularly with the Wik judgment is, I think, much underrated by too many Australians. It impacts on an electorate like Grey in a way that most urban Australians could not contemplate. For example, I have had a number of representations from people wanting to explore a small gems field and who can no longer do it. Things that people have been taking for granted for 100 years or more are now restricted, or just stopped. People are at a total loss to understand why.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are bigger implications. We have a hope of some expansion at Woomera with the use of the rocket range there. Yet, there is that doubt arising from native title. I hope that can be resolved before a decision has to be made within the next few weeks. In my electorate of Grey, which is 92 per cent of the area of South Australia and about 900,000 square kilometres, more of it is actually under native title claim than actually exists. People are bewildered about what  it means. It is an issue that the Prime Minister and the parliamentary secretary Senator Minchin and many others have been attempting to wrestle with in these recent months.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I believe that if native claims were put over the central business districts of Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart, and Perth, there would be a stronger national will to come to an arrangement which would recognise prior occupation in a much more expeditious manner. The fact that terra nullius has been pushed out into the regions and that the majority of Australians are able to escape the impact of native title—remembering that the tribunal has not yet had one successful resolution on mainland Australia—I think highlights the fact that there is subtle constant pressure on regional people which urban people do not appreciate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The next issue that I would like to touch on is the issue of tariffs. There is a very good little document called

          One shoe per person
         </emphasis>
         , which takes its name from the fact that we could, apparently, up until recent decades, import only one shoe per year per person. From the introduction of this very well written piece by David Pearce and Andrew Stoeckel I will quote the first paragraph which I think sums up the Australian context over a longer period of some decades. It says:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Australia's policy on protection for the manufacturing industry has had a long history of debate. It is undergoing another debate right now as a result of two things. One is the uncertain legality of some subsidies Australia uses to protect industry, which has been `solved' by negotiation—the so&amp;hyphen;called Howe Leather case. The other is the change of government in March this year. While the stated policy of the new government has been supportive of free trade, the media headlines have carried stories of finding alternative ways to compensate industry for the removal of subsidies and the need for `reciprocity'—that we should not liberalise further unless our trade partners do. The charge has also been put that the benefits of free trade have not been fully explained to the wider community.

        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         The car and textiles, clothing and footwear industries are the most highly protected manufacturing industries in Australia and the current protection arrangements apply to the year 2000. What happens beyond that is up for review by the government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We go now to the 1981 issue of one shoe per person. At the same time we were limited to one imported car for every 190 people. Clearly, these limits were put there to offer protection to the manufacturer, although even in those days there were people questioning that policy.

        <para first-indent="16">
         If we look at the export subsidy debate, and that includes Australia's export facilitation, we have imports of something like $12 billion. Consumers then pay about $13.8 billion. The government tariff revenue is about $1.5 billion. The producer, that is, the exporter, has exports of $2.8 billion, which means an export subsidy of about $0.3 billion. Those old arguments on agriculture back in the 1970s are well gone and there is negligible subsidy for agriculture now. However, those debates of the 1970s are still very much there for our manufacturing industry in the 1990s.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The real tragedy of this whole tariff debate is summed up in the epilogue by Pearce and Stoeckel where they say:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Sadly, the benefits that the protected industries receive do not translate into more employment in those industries. The experiment of lifting protection in order to save jobs in those industries has been tried and the facts show that it has failed.

         I do not pretend that it is ever easy to reduce tariffs or even to hold the line with tariffs when you have a very competitive world market. But those fundamental truths that are in this  document prepared by the Centre for International Economics are still as true today as they were 30 years ago when people like Bert Kelly were advising us of the wrong-headedness of excess protection. I think that the government and the parliament will need to show great consideration in the interests of the overall community because we know at the end of the day that a tariff, by any other name, is a subsidy and a tax.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I want to move on to another issue, the issue of local government and the financial assistance grants. In the budget there was a four per cent increase that brought the amount to about $1.2 billion. About 77 per cent of that went to regional and rural Australia, which meant about a $35 million increase in financial assistance grants to rural and regional councils.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The point I want to highlight here is that there has been some criticism of the Commonwealth government for the withdrawal of REDOs, the Regional Economic Development Organisations. These organisations were funded by the previous government for only four years and then they were expected to go on their own way and be funded from within their own resources. There was a sum of $150 million over four years of which about 50 per cent was to go in administration and 50 per cent to projects.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If you do your sums, you will find that the increase in the financial assistance grants to regional and rural councils is at least as much as what was being received in REDOs, which many councils felt were simply duplicating the role of organisations like local government and state based regional development organisations. So, in one stroke, the new government has been able to reduce duplication and offer more money to local government for specific purposes in their own local government areas.

         I have a university in the electorate at Whyalla. There has been some speculation which appears to be somewhat politically based. The percentages used in the debate on universities are somewhat specious when you realise there has been a five per cent cut over three years.

         The one comment that I would make on the universities is that there is about a 75 per cent taxpayer subsidy to university education. If you look at training, apprenticeships et cetera across the nation I doubt whether there is that sort of support and subsidy to the balance of those people seeking to get training to get into employment. I would say to the university that it is always regrettable that budgets need to be cut but I would also ask them to consider their fellow countrymen and their access to training and well paid employment. It is accepted that if you have a university degree you will go on and expect to do somewhat better in life than those of us who do not have that same privilege.

         I will touch on the ABC and the funding cuts. I would simply say to those in the ABC that they are part of a $700 million organisation of which $500 million is provided by the taxpayer. The one fundamental difference—although they may not agree with it—between them as paid employees of the ABC, not all of them but many of them, and me as an elected member is that I have a constitutional responsibility based on our democratic system. They are simply accountable to their employer. I would say to any person in the media—I have said it about our main chamber—that if there was a design fault it is that the media sit above us and not on the same terms as us and at the same level. I do say quite sincerely that we are constitutionally elected, we have the responsibility of government under a democracy and I would ask them always to remember that.

         One small issue that has been troubling some of my constituents is the earning credits scheme. In our great thrust for efficiency, this earning credits scheme was abolished in the August budget and perhaps for good reason.

         Finally, the good news in the electorate of Grey has been undoubtedly the remarkable investment by Western Mining in the Olympic Dam project.

         Another good news story is the government's telecommunications infrastructure fund—$250 million throughout Australia and $26.5 million to South Australia. The electorate of Grey can expect to pick up a lot of that. The issue of mobile phones has always been contentious. Telstra has sadly fled to the cities to compete with Optus and others for the digital market and has overlooked many of my constituents. We hope that the new regime starting in July will give greater opportunities. We know that the $5 million per year over the next five years will provide opportunities for investment which will provide fairer access to telecommunications in the electorate of Grey.

         I have been involved in cricket as a player and spectator for 36 years. An ugliness began creeping into cricket with the Packer circus in 1977. Unfortunately, that ugliness has reached a stage where the Australian captain is saying that sledging is part of the game. I totally and utterly reject that notion.

         During the course of observing cricket matches in my electorate—and I am quite keen on such teams as the Pine Rivers cricket sides and the Lawnton Taverners—I have stressed wherever I have gone that sledging is not part of the game. In fact, I would use the old phrase, `It is simply not cricket.' We must get back to that. The phrase seems to have slipped out of our culture because of the influx of commercialism.

         We have seen in people who have played sports such as tennis—John McEnroe, for example—the quintessential ugly sportsman who is there abusing and criticising every decision of the umpire. That is simply not on. As I said, I think it is deplorable to have that as part of our Australian macho style. It is not part of being Australian. I fear it is being combined with the commercialism that we are seeing in both cricket and rugby league and that, generally speaking, this show biz, this yankee style, is seen as the best way of looking at things.

         For example, I was at the Gabba late last year watching a day&amp;hyphen;night game and I wondered what all these black boxes were around the ground. To my horror, I soon found that the cacophony of noise that was booming out of them, assaulting my ears, was little bits of theme music being played in between overs—extolling the theme songs of various players and so forth. To me, it was ruining the game as a spectacle. In other words, I felt I had to leave

          because I was being assaulted with these Americanisation symbols: that we have to have this show biz, this razzamatazz and this sort of cacophony being a part of our culture. Well, it simply is not, but it has crept into it. It is a very unfortunate part of cricket, along with the inane comments of the commentator. Once upon a time you could watch cricket; you could discuss it; and you could talk about the various scientific aspects of it. But now you cannot even hear yourself in between overs with the noise coming out of these black boxes, which I initially thought might have been some sort of black picket fence but, to my horror, they were not.

         As far as rugby league is concerned, probably one of the greatest commentators in rugby league was George Lovejoy and he coined the phrase `the greatest game of all'. Likewise, having seen a little bit of the ugly super league spectacle, we are now seeing everything other than rugby league. What is wrong? Why do we have this cultural cringing towards America? Why do we say `broncos' instead of `brumbies'? The term `brumbies' is Australian. Why do we say `cowboys' instead of `farmers'? There is something wrong with our view of ourselves if we have to pull in these American symbols. It is a great pity.

         I now turn to the issue of legal aid. In my electorate of Dickson, over the years a great number of people have needed to access the legal system. Unfortunately, the fact is that legal aid has, over a number of years, particularly in the last decade, turned into almost a crisis. You see, as I did in my legal practice, numerous cases that cry out for attention but do not get it. There was an old saying that justice delayed was justice denied. What then is the concomitant of justice denied? That is what is happening now.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Law Council of Australia has estimated that the restoration of legal aid funding to the 1988 level would take an annual commitment of $55 million. The August budget announcement that legal aid funding would be reduced by $33.2 million a year for the next three years, in effect, signals the death knell of the current system, which had become unviable in any event.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Under the current legal aid agreements, the states and territories are subsidised by the Commonwealth which provides 55 per cent of overall government funding. The 45 per cent provided by the states and territories includes the statutory interest on client funds held in solicitors' trust accounts so that, in real terms, only 36 per cent comes from the funds of the states and territories. Further, a disproportionate amount of funds has been used on state and territory matters at the expense of Commonwealth matters. The Attorney&amp;hyphen;General recently stated:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The impact of this diversion of Commonwealth funds is severe. For example, data provided by legal aid commissions shows a drop of over 25 per cent in the number of grants for assistance and expenditure on family law matters by commissions over the five&amp;hyphen;year period from 1991 to 1996.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         States and territories have traditionally shown a reluctance to pull their weight, so the erosion of legal aid facilities is set to continue. In Queensland, the legal aid office has been distributing letters to participating solicitors to the effect that funding from 1 July 1997 cannot be guaranteed, notwithstanding that a matter may still be current at that time.

          While the present system favours matters within the jurisdiction of the states and territories, the discrimination does not end there. There is also a definite bias against matters which, though meritorious, are considered by the various legal aid offices to be difficult. The classic example is the medical negligence claim. As a result, many deserving applicants fall through the safety net and thus are unable to pursue their claims unless their legal representatives are prepared to act for them on a speculative basis. In effect, the way the legal aid system is going, only criminals will get legal aid.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          A lawyer's decision to conduct an action on a speculative basis raises two very important questions. Firstly, is it champertous? Champerty describes a proceeding which is conducted by a person who has no legitimate concern in the suit and who bargains to carry on its prosecution in consideration of receiving, in the event of success, a share in the matter of the suit. It is prohibited at common law. This is an issue which has largely been ignored by practitioners at their peril.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Secondly, during the conduct of the action, will a situation arise where the duty of a lawyer to the client conflicts with the lawyer's personal interest in receiving payment for the professional fees that have been generated to date? Many settlements are reached at the door of the court after years of delay. Legal representatives by that stage have made enormous investments in terms of fees and out&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;pocket expenses. An ordinary offer of settlement may suddenly appear very attractive—the chance of getting paid for years of work, as opposed to  the uncertainty of trial followed by months of waiting for the judgment, taxation of costs and, finally, payment.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is manifestly unreasonable to expect lawyers to assume responsibility for conducting speculative actions on behalf of those people who are unable to access legal aid facilities, particularly when one considers the ethical dilemmas involved. There is an alternative. An organisation independent of the legal aid system could be established with the primary objective of providing assistance, subject to the satisfaction of merit and means tests, to two categories of applicants, namely: those who have been unable to secure legal aid through the normal channels and those who have been unable to secure legal representation on a speculative basis. For ease of reference, I will refer to this organisation as Equity.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Equity would be established by a one&amp;hyphen;off injection of funds from federal, state and territory governments. A modest filing fee on all process filed throughout all jurisdictions could assist to replenish Equity. To provide an ongoing source of funding, a percentage of the fruits of all successful actions would be deducted and reinvested in Equity. Legal fees would be paid upon settlement or finalisation of an action, regardless of the outcome. Fees would be assessed on a solicitor and client basis. Normal taxation of costs provisions would apply. Professional access to Equity would be limited to solicitors and barristers who had been appointed to a panel of approved lawyers, the criteria for which would involve a consideration of such factors as years of practice and areas of expertise.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The management and administrative structure of Equity would be minimised in keeping with a general policy of cost&amp;hyphen;effectiveness. An applicant for assistance from Equity would be required to pass a merit test involving satisfaction of either of the following criteria: is the issue one of importance—for example, in the public interest—or of particular precedent value; or are there reasonable prospects of success? Decisions with respect to merit would, in the first instance, be made by case officers, with avenues for appeal to an honorary committee of suitably qualified individuals.

         <break page="2134" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          <para first-indent="16">
           In addition to satisfactory passage through the merit test, an applicant would also be required to pass a means test. Hardship would be the basic criterion. Neither of the ethical problems which currently confront legal representatives undertaking speculative work, that is, champerty and potential conflicts of duty and interest, would arise—and, believe me, I am aware of those conflicts; I have encountered them many times. Because legal representatives would be guaranteed payment regardless of the outcome of the proceedings, potential conflicts of duty and interest would be eliminated.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           A dispute resolution procedure could be established to cope with disputes which may arise from time to time between litigant and legal representative. At the outset, applicants would be advised that, upon acceptance of Equity's assistance, they would have a concomitant obligation to accept the reasonable advice of their legal representatives. This would be a particularly important issue in the context of settlement offers because of Equity's financial interest in the fruits of the action. In the event of a dispute between a litigant and his or her legal representative, the matter would be referred to an independent arbiter for resolution and determination.

           There are so many cases that are slipping through the net; there are so many people who do not bother to contest matters because they cannot get legal aid that justice is being totally denied.

It will not solve it but it will assist to address it and take the weight off applications for legal aid generally.

           In relation to foreign policy, I stress part of what I said earlier about promoting the Australian image. In my view this falls very much to the Australian government. It is important in my view to advocate a much more proactive foreign policy as part of that process. Australia must be seen to be a significant power in the region. For years, previous Labor governments presided over an innocuous foreign policy—indeed, one that became almost fossilised. Would, for example, Papua New Guinea have sought assistance from mercenaries had Australia been a much more proactive country? Would not Papua New Guinea have come to seek Australia's assistance in relation to this particular matter if we had promoted ourselves as the significant power in the region? This is what I am saying.

Since the December 1972 communique, much has happened in the Republic of China on Taiwan. There are 21.5 million people living there; it has been a democracy since 1996. Why do we not practise a similar philosophy to Taiwan that we do in other countries? Why do we say that because Taiwan is small we are intimidated by big brother on the mainland?

           Turning to Aboriginal matters, I have always regarded the comment by my jurisprudence lecturer that metaphysics does not boil cabbages as a very significant statement in relation to life generally. I have always had a concern about the notion of reconciliation. I have always
           <break page="2135" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            questioned it. The notion implies a division; so you start with a division between people. You manufacture a concept that we need to reconcile because there is a division. There are many Australians who do not think there is a division and who are offended by the concept. I think since the concept has been floated, in 1991, I have never seen more division in this country between black and white. That is a tragedy because—getting back to the point that metaphysics does not boil cabbages—we are not helping the people at the coal face by floating these concepts, in my respectful view.

          </para>

           There is going to be a reconciliation conference in a couple of months. I have seen some enormously expensive and glossy material about this. Why on earth are we doing this when we will not achieve anything in terms of helping people on the ground, which is what we should be doing? Rather, it will be a feelgood talkfest where a lot of money will be spent flying people from all over the countryside. What will it achieve? I suspect little, if anything. When you ask yourself what is reconciliation—what do they define it as—you start seeing the holes in this particular proposal.

          <para first-indent="16">
           For example, it is said that it provides five so&amp;hyphen;called steps for reconciliation and, worryingly, it speaks of arriving at some sort of settlement. What form this might take is part of the charter of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. It proposes such things as national agreements  or a series of agreements, whatever this really means. I am afraid it is the language of division which will promote even more division.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           For example, I do not think anybody really considered the words `indigenous' and `non&amp;hyphen;indigenous'. Now we have indigenous Australians and non&amp;hyphen;indigenous Australians. We are all Australians, yet we have this division since the reconciliation concept. I think it is absurd, and it promotes division. I have people saying to me, `I'm indigenous. I was born here.' Look up the dictionary meaning of the word: it means people who are born here. It is causing friction in the community, when we should be identifying the real needs of Aboriginal people. My work in the Aboriginal area, particularly at Cherbourg, identifies those needs, but these sorts of glossy concepts do not help.

          <para first-indent="16">
           For example, one of the five elements says this about reconciliation: `Identifying what more needs to be done and making changes within Australian society.' How will that promote a settlement of things? That could go on forever. So forever we have got this notion of reconciliation, forever we have got people looking sideways at each other over a non&amp;hyphen;achievable goal. It is not going to help the people on the ground, or at the coalface. That is what it is all about—helping those people in health, housing, education and employment. Get those basic things right and we can do all the feel good things we like; but if we do the feel good things and do not solve the basic things, we are going to have problems. We see that all the time.

           Lastly, I am going to talk very briefly about the notion of haves and have&amp;hyphen;nots. I think it is something that we have to be very careful of in this society, that we are developing a society where a large number of people are unemployed and on the other side of the coin we have people who are doing very well from the system. I had a very interesting letter sent to me by Bishop Wicks recently about this concept, how we are promoting this situation where there are a large group of unemployed who are very much at the margins, but on the other side of the coin people who are very well off. I do not think that that situation can continue without our suffering as a nation, and suffering very much in the eyes of the international community.

In terms of a small business  variable loan, the small business person would be $4,000 a year better off. In fact, the Treasurer said the other day in the parliament that the variable loan rates were the lowest since 1974 and, when one considers the no frill rates, at their lowest since the 1960s.

         Industrial relations is another very important part of the process of the year. I pick up one particular point, the unfair dismissal clause that was in the earlier legislation. That has now been abolished. It is interesting to note that between January 1996 and January 1997 the unfair dismissal claims have been reduced by over 60 per cent. It will be very interesting to see what the percentage will be in January 1998.

         That is good news for employers because prior to the abolition of that particular unfair dismissal clause territory employers were very reluctant to take on staff. They are a little different from their southern counterparts because the territory has a floating population and sometimes the people will tell an employer that they are going to stay for five years and they are really going to be there for only five months or even less. There were some problems posed when some of the employees were not doing the right thing and it made it very difficult for employers to take them on. But now that we have the new legislation in place it is certainly going to be a boon for small business in the Northern Territory. We have always said that the small business community in Australia is really the engine room for creating employment. I support that particular comment.

I am pleased to advise the committee that over the next four years some $2.24 million is going to be made available for black spot funding. That, obviously, will be very good in terms of identifying road safety elements and dangerous roads. The committee has met already and has put a proposition to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp). We are hoping to get an answer from him in the next couple of weeks because the funds we have put a bid in for this year must be expended this financial year—that is, additional funding for roads that have particular problems in terms of the safety component.

         One part of the budget that I was disappointed in was a reduction of about $10 million in the budget for rural roads in isolated communities. I made a representation to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development and other ministers because, whilst $10 million might not seem a very large amount in the overall scheme of things, in some of those communities it is a large amount. Over the years those people have accumulated equipment for repairing and maintaining roads. If those funds are not available through the local government association or through direct funding for roads, the equipment that they have invested quite a bit of money in is going to become useless.

I mentioned that we inherited a black hole of some $8 billion and that communities have to tighten their belts.

         The diesel fuel rebate has been maintained. That is very important for rural communities. The coalition has put in place policies for major reform to reduce the gap between rural and city pricing of fuel. It is of great concern to me that I must stand here today and talk about the price of unleaded fuel. Unleaded fuel in Port Augusta and South Australia is 77.9c per litre. In Kimba, which is 171 kilometres up the road, it is 89.2c per litre. In Alice Springs it is 88.4c per litre. Super is 90c per litre and diesel is 89.5c per litre in Alice Springs. The price varies between Alice Springs and Darwin.

In addition, the attention of the House of Representatives is drawn to the current tax of 34.18 cents per litre on diesel and that the percentage of excise tax utilised for road funding is now less than 10% of that collected as compared to a maximum of 70% in 1981&amp;hyphen;82.

We will see something like 85 per cent of regional exchanges converted to digital by the end of 1997.

         The other item that I wanted to speak about this afternoon concerns Aboriginals in the Northern Territory. Of course, I am very pleased that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Herron) has in the last 12 months placed his portfolio to the forefront in this parliament. Most members of parliament are now aware of the problems that exist in the remote parts of Australia in terms of the living conditions, the health services, and education facilities for our indigenous community.

         The government has focused on providing health and housing services. As you would be aware, in the 1996-97 budget the funds to ATSIC for these particular programs—health and housing—were quarantined by the Commonwealth government. Also, as you heard me say earlier today, Senator Vanstone did provide additional funds for indigenous education by presenting this parliament with a supplementary education bill.

         The important thing to note is that there are many communities that are in desperate need of services. In fact, I had occasion to bring to the minister's attention something that concerns me greatly. Given that ATSIC makes funds available to regional communities and that there are also housing authorities—both Northern Territory and Commonwealth housing
         <break page="2140" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          authorities—handling funds for communities, I find it quite difficult to understand how we can go into a community and construct 15 new homes and yet not provide power.

         As I said to the minister and to other members who were there, it would be better if the housing authorities built one fewer house. They could build 14 houses and give them the funds to put in a 38 kVA, wind&amp;hyphen;driven generator which could provide some electrification to that community. It is not just one community, it is in a lot of communities. Funds have been made available for housing but there are no back&amp;hyphen;up services.

         In fact, there is one particular community that I am going to be visiting next week, a place called Aileron, and that is exactly the problem that they have got. There are 12 houses there. The funny part about it is that they have additional funding in the 1997&amp;hyphen;98 budget for another six houses. They are also going to get a mobile health clinic. What is the good of having a mobile health clinic and what is the good of giving them additional funds for another six houses if there is no electricity there to give them power, to keep their food in the refrigerators and, obviously, to give them a better standard of living?

         The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has said that he would take on board my comments about housing and that he would speak to the relevant department and ATSIC to make sure that where funds were going into communities they should make sure the provision of services  is there before any other infrastructure is put in, otherwise the infrastructure is not going to be used and will certainly be a waste as far as the Australian taxpayer is concerned.

There has been universal approval throughout the community for the way the government has tackled some of the difficult jobs that it has had in the first 12 months and for the fact that it has kept the confidence of people in Australia at the same time. While you can look at the opinion columns in certain newspapers, most of those are fairly predictable and come from people who have great difficulty in covering up their personal prejudices rather than looking objectively at what the government has done.

         There is no doubt that many building blocks have been put in place for a sustained recovery. We are building on the opportunities that the government has given us to repair some of the problems that were handed on from the Labor Party, particularly some of the budgetary problems in the black hole that has been referred to on many occasions. It is worth reminding all honourable members that it was a massive problem of at least $8 billion. The galling thing about it all was the way that even today the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) cannot stand up and say, `Yes, I did not tell the whole truth prior to the election. I did not admit what I really knew, that in fact it was there.' Instead, he and the former Prime Minister continued to pretend right throughout the election campaign that it was not so. Yet it was pretty obvious there was something amiss, and certainly, when the change of government came, it became blindingly obvious.

          Today I would like to talk a little about some of the situations that we now confront in regional and rural Australia, particularly as we look, one year on, at some of the changes that have occurred and that will be occurring under this government. I want to put this up against the backdrop of a report that I was involved with.
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Striking a balance

          was put together by the Liberal Party's regional and rural committee, and it highlighted in many different areas just how much the Labor Party had neglected regional and rural Australia when it was in office—and, as my colleague reminds me, yes, it was very much so. I think it was a shameful situation that we inherited from Labor. After 13 years, the neglect of the country had really got to the stage that it was nothing short of a national scandal.

          What this report,
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Striking a balance
          </emphasis>
          , showed was that Labor had effectively left out of the policy process many parts of the services to regional and rural Australia. I guess this shows why, in the last election, there was such an enormous swing in the country areas. There was a significantly bigger swing there than in the city areas because the Labor Party had neglected them so much.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I will just quickly touch on a number of those areas. Unemployment was certainly number one on the list. People in the country were very much more aware than those in the city of just how much it was affecting their local communities, particularly amongst the young. We saw that while national youth unemployment exceeded one in four in some parts it was as high as one in three. But in parts of country Victoria, for example, it was even higher. In Western  Victoria, youth unemployment hit 36 per cent and at one stage in the Mallee it hit a staggering 66 per cent. While these are the official figures, I think we all know that probably behind them the story is even more grim than those official figures show.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          One of the first things that the Howard government has set about to do is to put in place the building blocks for not only jobs but sustained growth in jobs. So we have seen a number of very positive moves. We have got the work for the dole scheme that has been announced and has been so well received right throughout the community. It has been so well received by everyone but the Labor Party. The Labor Party just does not like it because it shows them up for their inadequacies while they were in government.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The second thing was the change to industrial relations. The changes to the unfair dismissal laws have certainly started to give small business in particular, but other businesses as well, a bit of confidence in starting to employ more people. That, as much as anything, will start the change for some new growth. Small business has also been given a number of incentives. In country areas we can identify more than 100,000 small businesses and they are starting to see some of the benefits not only from the industrial relations changes, but also from the rollover relief from capital gains tax, which has just gone through the House, from the cuts to the provisional tax uplift factor and—as we are going to hear later this month—from the way we are going to reduce the burden of red tape and paperwork on small business. Talk to anyone in small business and they will tell you what a problem that is.

           Another aspect I would like to touch on quickly is the provision of health services in country areas. Unfortunately, contrary to what many think, while the country may have many attractions, the statistics show that in many cases the health of people in the country is not as great we would like it to be. Without going into too much detail on that, I think part of the problem, as we all recognise, is the difficulty of providing services in the country and, in many cases, just attracting doctors to some of the country centres.

          <para first-indent="16">
           Again, this is an area where the previous Labor government certainly neglected the country. While one could not say that they actually did nothing, we did see during the last four years of the Labor government the most amazing thing: every time there was a problem, we would have a conference. Or we would set up the National Rural Health Alliance, or we would have the National Rural Health Strategy, and then we had the Australian Rural Health Institution. It made everyone feel good but, unfortunately, it did not really tackle the major problem. As the Department of Human Services and Health told the previous government, the problem was quite simply that we needed at least another 300 GPs in country areas.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Contrast this with what the coalition government is doing. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has been quick to act, setting up a number of private health initiatives. Firstly, he is researching and monitoring the profile of the rural medical work force to find ways and means of trying to get young doctors to take up some of these places in the country. Secondly, there are scholarships for medical students to work in country areas. Thirdly, there is the creation of university departments of rural health—there will be one in each state. I am looking forward to the announcement of what is going to be occurring in my state of Victoria, particularly some of the positive aspects for my electorate of Wannon. And the new Medicare agencies will make access to Medicare much easier.

           Looking at education, it is most disturbing to see the difference between the participation rate and the retention rate for year 12 students in the country and the city. We find that year 12 country students have fallen behind their city cousins, 52 per cent compared with 66 per cent. In tertiary education, the really disturbing thing is to find that, between 1989 and 1995, the number of country students fell from 25 per cent to 16 per cent. Sadly, country students are 60 per cent less likely than city students to take up tertiary education. Despite all this, Labor refused to face the major cause of this problem. Basically, it boils down to one simple thing: that it costs more to get education for country students than it does for city students. That is one of the major problems we are facing. Already, we are seeing that the coalition has increased access to tertiary and vocational education for thousands of country students. We have seen $2.3 billion in extra funding for government schools—many of them are small schools in country areas.

          <para first-indent="16">
           We are also seeing $187 million allocated to strengthen the ties between schools and business. We have seen an increase in the basic boarding allowance for isolated children. We

           I will touch quickly on a couple of other transport issues. Roads in the country have been sadly neglected. This is being addressed by the government to some extent through the black spots program. It will take some time to turn around the neglect that occurred under the previous government, but there is an increase in funding. A number of projects in my electorate, as well in other parts of Australia, are attacking the problem.

           We have also tackled some of the difficulties facing people who have been affected by severe droughts. I would like to talk more about what is happening in rural Australia, but I will just touch on the issue of the speeding up of the modernisation of country telephone exchanges—something that was long overdue. We are very pleased that, by the end of this year, 97 per cent of telephone exchanges will have been modernised, which is bringing forward the previous government's program. That recognises that people in the country deserve access to services similar to those in the city.

           In conclusion, this government has tackled some of the major problems facing country areas in terms of massive budgetary problems and the neglect of regional and rural Australia. There  are also a number of very exciting programs coming on, such as the Natural Heritage Trust, the national landcare program and the Prime Minister's initiative on the supermarket to Asia.

That initiative was about confidence, about a government getting in and making positive announcements.

I get a bit concerned when I see quotes such as that from the member from Batman when he was talking about the work for the dole scheme. I was very disappointed, and I believe people around Australia will be too, to hear the opposition spokesman talking in these terms. When he was talking about opposing work for the dole, he said:

         I think it is pretty disappointing that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) also seems to have been trying to score a political point. I hope that is not the reason for his saying this, but you have to suspect that maybe it is. He said that Labor's billion dollar training programs were successful not because they led to jobs but because the unemployed `weren't around the  streets bothering everybody else'. I cannot for one minute believe that my honourable colleague opposite would condone those sorts of comments, because I think that denigrates the very people that we should all be working to support. The member for Lyons (Mr Adams) and myself know that the 100 jobs that will be created in places like Ballarat and in his electorate are absolutely critical to the ongoing success of those regions.

         At 4.12 p.m. on Wednesday, 19 February a small aviation company by the name of Wingz North Aviation was thrown into total turmoil when it was advised, via the fax, that its charter licence had been suspended immediately for alleged breaches of safety regulations.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Wingz North is a small family company with an excellent reputation and this has been confirmed by the overwhelming community support that I have received in the past two weeks. I have received petitions containing over 500 signatures of citizens of the Torres Strait. Add to this numerous letters of support from other small businesses and you can see clearly that Wingz North enjoys unprecedented support from the community it serves.
        </para>
        <break page="2146" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          Wingz North was established in February 1991 and is still operated and owned by its original founders, Gary and Tamara Maile. From what started as a three aircraft operation, it has grown to 12 aircraft based in both Cairns and Horn Island in the Torres Strait. The company employs 12 full&amp;hyphen;time pilots, between them totalling 22,000 flying hours, and eight full&amp;hyphen;time support staff. They have a wage bill of some $500,000 a year, a maintenance bill of over $900,000 a year and their annual turnover is in excess of $4 million.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Mr Deputy Speaker, this is not a little backyard operation, but an efficient, successful family business. In the past six months they have carried approximately 2,000 passengers per month and made over 2,000 take&amp;hyphen;offs and landings per month without any serious incident.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Of the 33 non&amp;hyphen;compliance notices served on Wingz North, some dating back to October 1995, 22 were of a minor administrative nature. They included, for example, incomplete signatures on the rear of forms, all of which were rectified immediately on advice; three minor maintenance breaches when 50&amp;hyphen;hour visual inspections were less than two hours late; a further maintenance breach when a 100&amp;hyphen;hour service was overdue by approximately one hour—it should be noted that the service fell due during a four&amp;hyphen;hour flight to Cairns for that maintenance—an overload problem in October 1995, for which the pilot was suspended and CASA expressed satisfaction with the outcome; and one case of unrestrained luggage involving two pillows and a bag of disposable nappies.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          All the breaches that I have mentioned here are over an 18&amp;hyphen;month period and all were rectified immediately when they were brought to the attention of the company. Of the other five breaches, there were three overload allegations of which two are being strenuously denied by Wingz North. The other two, a dangerous goods breach and a roster discrepancy, were based on allegations by a disgruntled ex&amp;hyphen;pilot and were made months after the termination of his employment. I might add that this pilot is currently pursuing an unfair dismissal claim against the company while defending legal action by Wingz North for fraud allegations. Based on these breaches, CASA has embarked on a heavy&amp;hyphen;fisted and bloody&amp;hyphen;minded campaign to totally destroy this business, and I have been advised late this evening that an appeal by Wingz North against the decision has been overturned. There is every possibility that this business will close down permanently on Friday because of CASA's actions.

          We can never compromise on air safety, but it is important that air safety authorities remain ever diligent. What I cannot accept is a bureaucratic, authoritarian regime that, from evidence I have received, is prepared at worst to overlook and at best to offer wrist slaps to very serious breaches of safety by other operators, while at the same time targeting an individual in what would appear to be an over&amp;hyphen;reaction in a very heavy&amp;hyphen;handed attempt to make a statement. I do not make these allegations lightly, but I have been made aware of serious and dangerous breaches to air safety by other operators which have been brought to the attention of CASA, but which, for whatever reason, they have decided to either ignore or wrist slap.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Just to make you aware of the seriousness of the issue: as recently as 18 February this year, an aircraft taxiing at Badu Island for take&amp;hyphen;off hit some fibre board markers which were thrown through the propeller and smashed to pieces. The pilot did not stop to check the damage but continued to take off. This airline is still flying.
          <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
           Another charter operator, on 30 January 1997, ran off the end of the airstrip at Kubin Village on Moa Island causing damage to the propeller. This aircraft was then flown back to Horn Island before any maintenance was attempted.

           I have what is called a SNAG in the industry, a defect report on a particular aircraft showing some 25 defects, some of which are quite serious. Yet that aircraft from another airline was still allowed to continue to fly. I have many more examples of serious inconsistencies with regard to CASA's operation in Far North Queensland, many of them equally as serious as those that I have already mentioned. But I guess one of the classics was an aircraft bound for Horn Island broadcasting through a radio on the wrong frequency, creating a potential near&amp;hyphen;miss situation. This aircraft, I have been reliably informed, was flown by none other than CASA flight operations inspectors. It certainly raises the question of competence.

           Light aircraft travel in the Torres Strait region is a lifeline for the Torres Strait people. It is an essential service, not unlike the buses and taxi services of our metropolitan cities. It is a very difficult area to fly in and a hazardous one, given that some of the airstrips are the shortest in Australia and there is very little room for pilot error. On the island of Mer, the airstrip length is only 525 metres; on Darnley, it is 440 metres, and on Mabuiag, it is 420 metres. You can see that there is real skill required to negotiate these strips. I guess what is most important is that the local residents need to have total confidence in their airline and the pilots, and it is patently obvious from the petitions and signatures that I have received to date that Wingz North enjoys that support.

          <para first-indent="16">
           Torres Strait, and for that matter, most remote air charter services, are very different from the metropolitan commuter services, as are the people with their special needs that access this service. And those needs should be taken into consideration by any safety authority.

          <para first-indent="16">
           Many of the breaches I mentioned before, while not of a serious technical nature likely to cause disaster, certainly need to be brought to the attention of the operator. Given the nature of the work that the operators do and the areas in which they operate, I have no doubt that they were genuine oversights, or in some cases, misjudgments by pilots working under difficult circumstances and certainly not deliberate attempts to flout regulations. I think that it is certainly evident by the fast and positive response by Wingz North in dealing with and rectifying these problems.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           I see nothing in the evidence presented to me that could in any way be interpreted as a hanging offence and, make no bones about it, this is exactly what CASA is trying to do with Wingz North. The final word should go to Martin Keating, the operations manager for Wingz North, who said in a recent letter to me:

           At Wingz North I have discovered an operator/owner, Mr Gary Maile, who was strictly by the book. The difference at Wingz North is that Gary owns or is paying off all the aircraft. Any defect reported on any aircraft is attended to immediately. No mean feat when you consider half the fleet is based 800 kilometres from any spare parts department in Cairns.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
           Gary is the fairest businessman I have ever come across, to his staff and his customers. Gary has a great empathy and understanding of the Torres Strait people. It is a difficult place to live and work in by virtue of its remoteness. It is unlike the mainland as far as the services are concerned  and the service that Gary provides is a vital link to the population.
          </para>
          <para style="Para">
           By their actions, it is little wonder that CASA and many of its representatives are currently held in contempt by a large section of the aviation industry. I can certainly see why there is such a strong call for CASA to be purged of all its incompetent representation and to have them replaced by capable professionals with working knowledge of an industry that they are engaged to administer. I call on CASA to let common sense prevail, get Wingz North into operation and not destroy it in an effort to try to justify their own existence.

I am sure it has given many members traditionally the opportunity to make remarks and air their views on the general state of the economy, the prospects for our future, the administration of a large number of government programs, as well as on specific appropriations for various organs of the government.

         That said, we have before us Appropriation Bills Nos. 2, 3 and 4 and these together comprise the additional estimates for this financial year, 1996&amp;hyphen;97. These additional appropriations total some $1,402 million. However, they are partly offset by savings made in Appropriation Acts Nos. 1 and 2 last year reflecting the government's determination to improve the efficiency of continuing programs. These savings amount to $343 million and, after allowing for these, the total appropriations sought represent a net increase of $1,059 million for appropriations in this financial year, an increase of about three per cent on the amounts that were made available through the annual appropriations at the time of the budget last year.

         Obviously, the debate has given many new members a second chance to comment on the government's management of the economy since the election in March last year. I am sure it has given members of the opposition the chance to reflect on the enormous folly of some of the things that were done under the previous government. Indeed, it has perhaps given them the chance to bathe in the crystal clear waters of honesty and forthrightness which they were not allowed to do when members of a government. I hope this has given them a refreshing opportunity, such as the one experienced by members of the government.
