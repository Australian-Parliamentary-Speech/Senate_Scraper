         The member for Hotham has been for 20 years part of the problem that caused the Newcastle BHP plant to close down. You were part of the problem when you ran the trade union movement and you were a major part of the problem when you were a member of the Keating and Hawke ministries.

         No talk there about the Labor Party's alternative industry policy. No suggestion that if Labor were in office they would have such an attractive industry policy.

         But can I say to the member for Paterson that I had a meeting last week with the Premier of New South Wales regarding a proposal that he has put forward which would involve a contribution by the federal government, a contribution by the state government and also a contribution by BHP. Let me say in relation to that that the federal government has decided to commit some resources towards programs to deal with the particular problems that have arisen. We are not attracted to the proposal put by the New South Wales government. The proposal put by the New South Wales government is short term, it is gimmicky and it will not provide any long-term relief.

         We also believe that BHP has a very significant responsibility. BHP—although warning governments of both persuasions, as those on the frontbench well know, that steel making was not going to continue indefinitely at Newcastle—failed to give adequate notice of the particular date of the closure. Despite all the lofty rhetoric and all the gimmicks that are coming from those who sit opposite, they

Your decision to block that unfair dismissal proposal will cost thousands of jobs in small business. If you disagree with me, you ought to remember the criticism of the Premier of New South Wales, who at least speaks from the authority of elected office, of the unfair dismissal laws.

         What we proposed was a measure whereby any small business employing fewer than 15 people would be completely exempted from the unfair dismissal laws in relation to people who had been employed for less than 12 months. What this did was to introduce a very effective level of flexibility, a very valuable incentive for small business to take on more staff. I want to say to those who sit opposite that this is the most anti-jobs decision you have taken in the 13 months you have been in opposition. You stand up in this parliament and you talk about Newcastle. You stand up in this parliament and talk about job creation schemes. But you have an opportunity to support a measure that is going to create thousands of jobs in the small business sector and what do you do? You roll it over and you say no.

         Unfortunately, the Labor Party have announced today that they are not prepared to support this measure. I must say, I am absolutely amazed. Let's remember the potted history of the unfair dismissal law. Before the 1996 election, Keating said that industrial relations would be the big issue for Labor during the 1996 election. As a result of the very strong opposition and concern in the small business community about unfair dismissal, Keating had to announce a review of Labor's unfair dismissal policy during the 1996 election campaign. In 1996, we introduced a remedial set of reforms to the unfair dismissal law. You opposed the sensible measures to clean up the mess that you had created and now, when we introduce a sensible measure, against the political advice of your own spokesperson for small business, you have today announced this policy.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We already have exemptions in the unfair dismissal law. Even in the faulty, deficient, hopeless scheme that Labor had, they had exemptions for certain categories of employees. The idea of exemptions is nothing new. What we are proposing is consistent with the international standard. We are not alone on this. There are Germany, the UK, Italy—you name it. Many others with similar standards to us who also adopt international standards have exactly this exemption.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the overall, the changes that we have made in respect of unfair dismissal have been a tremendous boost already to small business. We have seen in the federal jurisdiction the

          introduction of a filing fee, we have a cost jurisdiction against vexatious applicants and we have seen across the board a 56 per cent drop in federal applications. All of that is a much better deal for small business.

We are not going to let this issue go. The fact of the matter is that this is a fair deal for both employers and employees. We are doing this because, unlike you, we are interested in genuine measures that are going to help in the creation of jobs in this country and we are not going to let you forget it.

I invited him to give me any evidence of where there was any breakdown in the process. I have not received any, and I do not expect to.

What they have done is to jeopardise the fastest growing industry in Australia and the best providers of jobs for young Australians. What they have done is to place at risk future investment in this industry. Just to demonstrate this, I quote from the ASX's tourism and leisure price index, which has dropped over 80 points since the 10 per cent bed tax came in. The New South Wales government will raise approximately $64 million by this action. It will be applied to consolidated revenue and to reducing their debt structure, not to promoting the tourist industry, which it should be doing. As a consequence of that lack of promotion for tourism in New South Wales and the extra tax which has been placed on it, the government should recant and reverse its position.

          —I would like to thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question and, if I may say so, for his enduring interest in foreign affairs and trade issues. As the member suggests, I did attend on behalf of the Australian government in place of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade the APEC trade ministers meeting in Montreal at the end of last week. The Australian government's objectives at the APEC ministers meeting were very much fulfilled. One of our key objectives was to ensure that there was an improvement in the individual action plans that the 18 member economies had put forward, and it was agreed at the APEC trade ministers meeting that improved individual action plans would be put forward to the August senior officials meeting so that, by the time the leaders meet at the end of the year, those improved individual action plans can be presented to them.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second achievement of the meeting, which was an important achievement, was to agree to develop further sectoral initiatives for what you might call turbocharged trade liberalisation. The Australian government suggested that amongst the sectoral initiatives included should be initiatives in the area of energy—and I think there was good support for that—and also processed foods, non&amp;hyphen;ferrous metals and one or two other sectors as well.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the end, it was decided that senior officials would give consideration to what sort of sectoral initiatives could be taken up. By the time the leaders meet in November of this
         <break page="3355" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          year, it will be possible for the leaders to agree on work in particular sectors so that APEC does not just depend on the individual action plans but has accelerated areas of activity. We saw some of that last year with the information technology and basic telecommunications agreements, and I think we will get more progress this year in some other sectors.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Thirdly, the Australian government has for some time, including under the previous government, promoted a concept called the APEC business travel card. Contrary to a report that appeared in a newspaper a day or two ago, the APEC business travel card is gradually being endorsed by an increasing number of economies. Already Australia, the Philippines and the Republic of Korea have adopted the APEC business travel card and a trial for that travel card is now beginning. It was indicated to us at the APEC meeting that Hong Kong would certainly be adopting the business travel card, and Chile and Thailand as well are looking at doing so. So, although it perhaps has not developed as fast as one might like, it is certainly developing and developing successfully.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Finally, and I think this will be of interest to all members of the House, the Australian government promoted at the meeting an initiative, which really came from the Prime Minister at the time of the APEC leaders meeting, for APEC economies to promote the merits of trade liberalisation. It was agreed that senior officials would consider how this could be done.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Two aspects of it, I think, are very important, and I made this point clear to the APEC trade ministers meeting. First of all, people around the APEC economies need to understand the direct benefits to them of trade liberalisation. But, secondly, people around the APEC economies need to understand that each of those 18 economies is going through this process of liberalisation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the most common reactions from APEC trade and foreign ministers during this meeting was that they heard from their own constituencies the cry, `Why are we liberalising while no&amp;hyphen;one else is?' They all hear this from all of their constituencies. The fact is
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          that all APEC members are going through this process of liberalisation and the problem is that there are, in each of those 18 economies, a few people who choose not to understand what liberalisation is taking place in the rest of the region.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This project will help to explain that, even to the simplest of people who do not wish to understand the benefits of trade liberalisation. The meeting was a great success. Australia's objectives were all fulfilled and I believe that APEC is developing very strongly and very successfully.

If there is anything in those guidelines remotely consistent with what the honourable member has said, I will be amazed but, more importantly, I will see that those guidelines are changed so that that kind of insane politically correct nonsense is not allowed to go on in this country.

          —I thank the member for Parramatta for his question. During the parliamentary break, the Leader of the Opposition made the long expected decision to dump the former shadow minister for education, the member for Sydney. He was not much good in that portfolio, I suppose. He had asked, I think, five questions on higher education during his time in the portfolio. During that recess, the Leader of the Opposition appointed the member for Werriwa, a protege of former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Unfortunately, the new shadow minister has got off to a very bad start. I recall that on 20 August last year the member for Werriwa said that battling families would have to face the prospect of a two-tiered higher education system in which in Australia 35,000 growth places would be lost to the sector. I have to say that, throughout the last four or five months when he has been moving in on the member for Sydney as the opposition spokesman on education, he has been one of those voices baying against the reforms that have been put in place by Senator Vanstone in the higher education sector.

         He has been spreading the notion that places are being restricted, that access is being restricted to students wanting to enter Australia's universities. Nothing could be further from the truth. Let me inform the opposition and the member for Werriwa that, on the most recent information available to the government, there has been an increase of almost 12,000 undergraduates in Australian universities this year. Universities have overenrolled some 26,500 undergraduates. So much for restricted access to Australia's universities! Not only that, the total funding available to Australian universities has also increased over last year. Total Commonwealth operating grant funding for universities in 1997 was up $147 million. Indeed, the government estimates that the university sector is now deriving some $250 million
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          more revenue from teaching activities this year than last year.

         Last year when the government brought down its reforms, it informed this parliament and the Australian people that its reforms would mean more university places and more funding for Australian universities by giving the universities the flexibility which your party, the Labor Party, consistently denied them. The fact is the government has delivered on that promise. Senator Vanstone's reforms, the government's reforms, have worked. There are more undergraduates in Australian universities today—12,000 more than there were last year—and total university resources are up. That is a very bad start for the new shadow minister for education.

          —My question is to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Small business in my electorate of Petrie has very much welcomed the small business statement, but many tell me that they are still doing it very tough. I know you have been out visiting small businessmen and women discussing the package of measures contained in the statement, which included a recent visit to my electorate of Petrie. It has now been two months since the government's small business statement was announced. Can you please outline to the House what the reaction of small business in Australia has been to the package of initiatives, and are there signs of a pick up in this very vital business sector?

These small businesses have welcomed the government's initiatives—particularly, I might add, in the area of the capital gains tax.

         The capital gains tax provisions will soon flow through. Small businesses appreciate the flexibility to grow their businesses but, more particularly, they appreciate the opportunity for them to build-up their small businesses for

         What small businesses are bitterly disappointed about particularly is the Labor Party's decision to block our unfair dismissal provisions. When meeting the small business community in Petrie, they told me that that was the greatest block to them employing young Australians. I might add that the shadow minister recently said that he suspected, `A lot of political heat might be generated against us if we take a negative view on this particular provision.' You are quite right. The small business people want this provision.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But the previous shadow minister, Senator Cook, in answering a question at a doorstop said that, before taking a position on this matter, he would consult the small business community. I would love to know who the small business people were he consulted who told him that they were quite happy to leave in place the unfair dismissal provisions that Labor put in place.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In fact, the small business community wanted the unfair dismissal provisions stripped away—just as the Prime Minister has provided for small business in other ways, including the capital gains tax rollover, the small business innovation fund and the cutting of red tape and compliance. Small business has recognised that we have cleared the way. The initiatives are in place. Low inflation and low interest rates are locked in.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         They are now starting to see the benefit of that growth, the benefit of those initiatives, the benefit of the stripping away of the unfair dismissal provisions—the compliance provisions that we are stripping away and that you are voting against—and of course the benefit of the capital gains tax rollover. Confidence is returning to the consumer and small business markets, and it is about time the opposition stopped knocking small business.

The government has made a decision not to close any Medicare offices in rural areas, and we have done this after very strong representation from the rural members of the Liberal and National parties. In particular, I thank the member for Mallee for his representation on behalf of his constituents. One thing that was put to me continually by local members was that if you are going to close an office in a country town there is no prospect of the jobs being relocated within that town and that some country people have to travel very substantial distances to get to another Medicare office.

         What we are looking to do here is to diversify the way claims can be made. We have electronic data transfer and we have a greater portion of doctors bulk-billing. With the Medicare cash rebate being lost to Medicare offices from 1 January 1998, the volume of claims in Medicare offices is going down—so much so that one office that we are looking to close in metropolitan Australia was handling only 28 claims a day. Clearly, that is not justifiable.

         So the government has decided to close 43 Medicare offices in metropolitan areas. I make no apology for this. This is very simply a transfer of resources from the city to the country. It is very simply an attempt to make sure that all Australians have fair and reasonable access to Medicare claiming. I make no apology for trying to do something to assist people in rural Australia to have better access and to address the neglect that was a result of 13 years of Labor putting Medicare offices in Labor Party seats.

Is it true that agreement was reached before the Industrial Relations Commission to ensure that the cleaners who work in this building are replaced when they are on leave? Is it also true that the company has failed to implement this agreement? Does this mean fewer jobs for cleaners, more stress and pressure on the remaining cleaning staff and a reduced standard of cleaning? Has this led to a proposed strike by the cleaning staff from midnight tonight? Can you and the President take some measures to ensure that companies contracting to the parliament meet reasonable industrial relations standards in the treatment of their workers?

          —The government's failure in Newcastle reflects a general failure. It is a failure on the part of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to give leadership, it is a failure to produce a steel plan and it is a failure to produce an industry policy. What we have is a government with no commitment, no compassion and, listening to the answers today from the Prime Minister, no comprehension as to the problem.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Prime Minister railed today on the basis of asserting that what happened with BHP's announcement a fortnight ago would have happened anyway. He challenged Labor to say how it would have been different. The fact of the matter is that as recently as 1995, when Labor was still in office, BHP recommitted to continuing the steelworks at Newcastle and also to implementing new arc furnace technology either before or thereafter—in other words, it was a commitment by BHP under Labor to keep steel going in Newcastle.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We also have the circumstances where the Prime Minister wants to tell us about the 54,000 people employed in BHP in 1982 and the numbers now, but the simple fact is that, if they had been returned to power in 1983, BHP would have been out the door then. In 1983 BHP was threatening to close Newcastle, to close Whyalla and even threatening to close Port Kembla. So the 54,000 jobs would have gone to zero had Labor not been elected.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         With Labor being elected in 1983, we sought immediate talks with BHP. We developed the steel plan and we saved Newcastle. We saved Newcastle and we saved Whyalla. We not only saved them but we saw significant new investment into steel making in this country—investment in steel making and growth in steel exports. Steel exports are still Australia's No. 1 manufacturing export, so there is a demand for our product. We can be there and we can be competitive, but only if you have a government prepared to back the industry in this country. This is a government that will not do it.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          We had the circumstances in 1983 where Labor saved Newcastle. Had Labor been returned at the last election, we would have saved Newcastle on this occasion. Why? Because we would have held BHP to its commitment made in 1995—a commitment to keep steel making going in Newcastle. Is that the approach this government takes—this hands-off government, this rudderless government, this government that shows no leadership on anything that counts in this country and this government that is only ever forced to do anything in terms of jobs or industry when Labor pushes them to the barrier?

          Look at the example of the shipbuilding industry, where we had the minister time and time again getting up and saying, `We are going to abolish the ships bounty; they don't need it.' Who was at the forefront of that campaign? It was Labor, and we got it restored.

          Let me have a look at the Prime Minister's role in this regard because he is the one to blame. He is the one who has to assert leadership because of the incompetent Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), who is at the table, not having any ability to win an argument through the cabinet. We have John Howard, the Prime Minister of the country, oozing concern at the closure of Newcastle. This is what he had to say; this is his pathetic response the day after the Newcastle closure.

          This is a Prime Minister acting true to form. Back in 1982, when BHP was threatening the Fraser government with closing its steelworks at Newcastle, John Howard, then Treasurer, was in hiding. We know at least Malcolm Fraser had a bit of commitment to the manufacturing industry in this country. He was a bit of a supporter of some intervention in industry, but the Prime Minister was under pressure not to help BHP. He took the unusual step of insisting upon a vote in the cabinet—a vote of every member so he would not be left out on a limb. Who was absent? The present Prime Minister.

          The Prime Minister tells us today that he was not absent. I would like him to check the record or at least check with Mr Alan Woods, who has written this piece. But more to the point: if he was there, how did he vote? I bet he voted against Newcastle because he is voting against them now. He says that he has compassion for the workers of Newcastle, but he won't attend, won't lift a finger for them, won't do a thing. He hid then and he is hiding now. He simply is not on the landscape so far as Newcastle is concerned.

          The Prime Minister also tells us that he has known for ages that this was going to happen. It makes the crime even worse. If he knew for all that time, why didn't he lift a finger? Why didn't he actually get BHP to the table and ask what we could do to secure the future of the steel industry in this country? BHP has invested in an arc furnace, but where has it

I tell you what, Minister: there is a decent flock, in plague proportions in your case, heading to Canberra, but you would not know because you are either out to lunch or ensconced over in the Commonwealth Club. We know about the minister's discussion at the Commonwealth Club with the Treasurer (Mr Costello) about the future of the car industry. The discussion was, `Let's let Mitsubishi go.'

This minister is about dinners at the Commonwealth Club, port and cigars, early retirement to bed—or at least not having to travel too far. But this day he was at The Tryst for

At the end of the day he finally put out a press release in relation to BHP at Newcastle which said, `It is regrettable but we cannot interfere in BHP's commercial decisions.' In other words, what matters is the share price, not the people. The only reason the share price matters to him is that he is into share trading.

Do honourable members know what his excuse was when someone from Newcastle rang two days before to ask whether he was coming? He was told, `No, the minister won't be there.

         The problems of the steel industry, as with so many other industries, reflect the failure of the industry policy of the last government, of which the member for Hotham was a member. If Labor's policies were so great for the Australian industry, why has BHP made its decision in Newcastle? The so-called Button steel plan did nothing for Newcastle. The economic policies of the last government did nothing for Newcastle. The industry policy of the last government did nothing for Newcastle. The stunts of the member for Hotham do nothing for Newcastle. Yet, he has another steel plan for Newcastle. As the Premier of New South Wales said, international factors, not government policy, are the critical influences in retaining a viable steel industry.

         Let me look briefly at the record of the Button plan, and this is very interesting. You should listen to the record of the Button plan. In the year prior to the plan, 4,000 jobs had been lost in the Newcastle steelworks. You would have thought that the Newcastle area would have been a priority of the previous government at that time. Much has been said about the importance of the Button steel plan to Newcastle.

         Since the end of 1982, the last year of the Fraser government, BHP steel employment Australia-wide has been reduced from 53,000 to only 30,000. In the year prior to the plan, 4,000 jobs had been lost at the Newcastle steelworks. You would have thought that the Newcastle area would have been the priority for the previous government. Much has been said about the importance of the plan. The steel plan itself applied bounties to five different products. Only one of these was manufactured in Newcastle. Not only that, not one cent was ever paid over the life of the plan to Newcastle for the manufacture of steel product. That stunned you. Not one cent was paid to Newcastle. This is the plan that you are talking about saving Newcastle. Not one cent was paid under the bounty system.

          Clearly, they saw some political opportunity in calming militant unions at Port Kembla and assisting the campaign of Bob Chynoweth in Flinders as far more important than securing jobs in the Newcastle steelworks. Then, as now, the Labor Party attempted to make political mileage out of Newcastle. What Newcastle really needed then was investment in new technology, and the previous government did nothing about that. The fact of the matter is that the Button steel plan failed Newcastle. Let me draw two quotes from the architect of the plan, John Button. He said:

          The steel plan is predicated on the assumption that we will have a smaller steel industry than we have had in the past.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          That was John Button when he launched the plan in the 1980s. Well, Button got his wish because, as a result of his government's lack of foresight, political objectives overrode prudent investment and planning and now, if the latest BHP objectives are carried through, Newcastle will have no steel industry by 1999. The steel plan was designed purely to overcome the political hurdles of the day. It had no intention of delivering long-term outcomes for the Australian steel industry. Button's own words confirm that. His steel plan did nothing for Newcastle. Not one cent of the bounty went to Newcastle. Clearly, the last thing Newcastle needs is another steel plan. BHP have said that, the Premier of New South Wales recognised it, and the government knows that.

          What Newcastle needs is a government which will not only help the people of Newcastle through the transition but also ensure that there is a sustainable future as well.

          Mr Speaker, the opposition clearly do not know which issue they want to follow. They are proposing a steel plan which they know nothing about and which will do nothing for the industry or for Newcastle. As I have already said, neither BHP nor the New South Wales government believe that government intervention could change BHP's direction. Unlike the opposition, the government is concerned about practical support for the people of Newcastle and internationally competitive policies for our industry. What every person who cares about Newcastle wants is a program which ensures a smooth transition for those wishing to relocate, reskill or retire and a program which builds upon growth and investment in the Hunter region.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          BHP have a comprehensive program in place to deal with the announcement. The government will be working with the company when necessary to ensure that the

           benefits of that program are maximised. This decision by BHP was becoming a possibility as far back as 1995. The previous government did nothing then and they have done nothing since to deliver a plan which benefits those affected by this decision.

You just said, as did the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) earlier, that at the end of 1982 BHP employed 54,000 people. Let me tell you, by May 1983 they employed 25,000 people. The works at Newcastle had dropped from almost 12,000 in 1981 when John Howard was Treasurer to 6,500 by May 1983. The cabinet meeting that has been spoken about earlier was the one when BHP announced the retrenchment of 5,000 people in mid&amp;hyphen;1982. John Howard was Treasurer, but where was he?

Money went into TAFE, into improved training, into a whole range of activities which is why our economy is now much stronger—$45 million in 1983 dollars. We are supposed to be grateful now that the Prime Minister is going to lob up there with some lolly jar of $10 million in 1997 dollars—$45 million in 1983 dollars compared to $10 million now.

Since 1983, BHP have been considering the future of the Newcastle blast furnaces. That consideration took in a lot of opportunities and a lot of choices. At one stage, there was a strong proposal for Corex, which we were briefed on as parliamentarians in 1991. That was not proceeded with but eventually on 30 June 1995, in a quite major statement, John Prescott announced the commitment of half a billion dollars to new steel technology in Newcastle to be operational by 2002.

We are talking about Australia being a net importer of steel by the year 2000. We currently export about 130 million tonnes of iron ore a year worth about $40 a tonne. We currently export three million tonnes of steel, earning us $1.5 billion in export earnings. By the year 2000, we will have reduced our net exports by 1.8 million tonnes of production.

          On 29 April, the biggest manufacturer in this country, with a capital base of $8 billion to $9 billion, said that they will be investing in that capital base at a rate below the level of depreciation, which will lead to a significant reduction of the capital base over time. They announced a reduction of 5,000 jobs across Australia. Effectively, they announced a worsening in our balance of payments of at least $1 billion. Two things happened after that: the investment market cheered and the shares went up; and the government said, `It is none of our business.'

          —It gives me great pleasure to stand in this matter of public importance for the concerns of the people of the Hunter. Indeed, today in the audience and the gallery we have many members from the Hunter who have come to hear the budget to be laid down by this government—a budget which will enable the future of Newcastle to go ahead.

         Former President of the United States Thomas Jefferson once said, `I like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past.' I can particularly relate that to the statements made by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), the diatribe and carrying on in his speech, where, in particular, he said nothing about what he would do about the problem. Another steel plan? I remind people that absolutely no financial assistance from that steel plan came to Newcastle—no dollars at all. All they delivered was rhetoric.

         The steel plan applied bounties to five different products, only one of which was made in Newcastle. But, over the life of that plan, not one cent was paid to Newcastle for the manufacture of that product. By far the bulk of the money went to Port Kembla and Western Port. Perhaps it was because of the quality of the representation of the people in those areas that they got more for their areas than we got in the Hunter.

         It is important, though, that we look at what BHP has done. We notice that the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) has not been on his feet screaming about the industry decision, nor has the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). Why? Because they have benefited from BHP's decision to relocate the steel making facility that came out of Newcastle in their electorates.

The grim reaper talks about the sky falling in and is fully supported by his friend the member for Hotham who, as I said, has said absolutely nothing about what he would do other than put another steel plan together—a steel plan like the one that oversaw one of the greatest percentage job losses at BHP Newcastle in the entire time that he was in government.

He had been absolutely silent on the prospects of BHP and where it was going. But, again, we have heard the grim reaper—a name that suits him—talk about the negative future for BHP in Newcastle.

         What we need to consider is that now is the time to go ahead in the Hunter. I have had a lot of phone calls to my office from people who have said, `Thank God BHP has finally made the decision.' When we talk about the 1995 release by BHP committing it to an electric arc furnace, the point that seems to be ignored here—the consideration that nobody raises when they keep expounding this—is that, if an electric arc furnace had gone in, there would have been downsizing in the company because the number of people required to operate that would have been a lot smaller than the number of people required to operate the fully integrated steel making facility. But do they raise that? No.

         If there was a genuine commitment by BHP in 1995 and if the member for Hotham and his team were so hot to trot and able to deliver, why did they not get contracts signed? Why were the contracts not in place then, so that they could not back out? The bottom line is, BHP has made a commercial decision. It is a decision that I do not like, that the people of the Hunter find hard to accept, but one that Bob Carr supported in his statement on 2GB on 29 April 1997, when he said:

         It has got to be said that this is being done predominantly because of BHP's assessment of global factors.

         It is nothing to do with politics. It is all to do with the steel industry and where its global position is. BHP have said that their export product was around 42 per cent of their volume. Because of global economic demands, that has been downsized to around 37 per cent. But, as I said, the steel making is going to areas such as Port Kembla and Whyalla. We have heard nothing about the people there. We have not heard them get up and scream, `BHP, take it away from us and give it back to Newcastle.' No, not at all.

          —Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, let me tell you that the people of Whyalla have refused to go on strike. Why? Because they have got a direct benefit. Quite simply, BHP at Newcastle is going to expand slightly. They are going to concentrate their wire making facilities and they are also going to bring to Newcastle the rolling that was done at Geelong. That is not a lot of benefit, but at least it is something. If you listened to the member for Newcastle and the member for Hotham, you would consider that the whole of BHP was going to close in Newcastle, when it is only one facility that is going to close. Incidentally, one of the reasons they are winding back—and it is something that needs to be considered—is that they were presented with an option paper to clean up the site so that they could operate within environmental guidelines. Justifiably so, but it would cost them somewhere between $70 million and $100 million just to get going.

         The member for Newcastle was quite right when he said that he sought out a steel industry inquiry. That steel industry inquiry has been supported by both Senator Tierney and me, and by other members of both the coalition and the opposition. But that steel industry inquiry has taken a long time to get to its report. In December, the report began to be put together and, as the minister has quite rightly said, he wrote to the shadow minister, the member for Hotham, asking him to nominate people. The reason the report has taken so long is, quite simply, that it took the member for Hotham nearly three months to nominate people for that committee. Why did it take so long? Because he had absolutely no faith at all in the grim reaper. Why did he have no faith in the grim reaper? Because he knew that, over the previous 13 years, he could deliver no outcomes that were successful.

         BHP going out of Newcastle is sad, but there are a lot of opportunities. There are a lot of opportunities because we have things such as the advancement of Williamtown RAAF base. As the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) said in her recent visit to the Hunter—again playing down the grim reaper's attitude that the world
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          was about to end and the sky was falling in—RAAF base Williamtown has the opportunity to become a super base that will employ up to 5,000 people whose income will go through the electorate. At the moment, we have around $2 million a week of spending from the incomes of that RAAF base; with the expansion, that could go up to between $4 million and $5 million per week of income spent. Then we have the British Aerospace role there, injecting a billion dollars into the aviation industry by the construction of the Hawk leading fighters.

         Conflict is what it is always about. To sum up, this government is looking for the long&amp;hyphen;term answers—not short&amp;hyphen;term shooting from the hip answers—that will hatch the egg from which the phoenix will rise from the ashes. Newcastle will go ahead. The people of the Hunter will not allow the area to die. For a long time BHP has not been the major employer in the Hunter. It is ranked at about number four or number five now and, when it has made its decision to go out finally, I am sure that other players and other industries will take over that role.

         The problems for Newcastle probably started back in the 1970s when the World Bank advanced $700 million to establish a steel industry in Korea, to which I understand Australia contributed $50 million. That was a long&amp;hyphen;term loan at 4&amp;half; per cent with no repayments for 10 years. It would be very nice to be giving that to our industry.

         What could BHP have done? It would have helped, of course, if the government of the day had built the submarine at Newcastle, where it should have been built, but that would have necessitated building it from a proven British design. Instead, for largely political reasons, it was moved to Adelaide and an unproven Swedish submarine was chosen that has already cost a fortune and is, without a doubt, a lemon. The quoted price by the British to build that submarine—all six in Australia—was $3.1 billion. We signed the contract with Sweden at $4.2 billion. It has already gone through $6 billion. There is $3 billion there that could have been invested in the steel industry.

         BHP could have done a lot of things on its own account though. It is clear this thing has been happening over time and that BHP has not kept up the maintenance on its plant in Newcastle. In Australia there is a need for specialised steels. A lot of people do not realise that we import just about all the specialised steel that we need. Newcastle, with its expertise in steel, could have developed these specialised steels, something which the whole economy of this country requires.

         It has been said that only BHP shareholders are considered, that they are the criterion in this decision. That, I believe, is not true. The shareholders of BHP have benefited enormously from the stability provided by government. There is the security of BHP's many leases provided by the government. They have received grants from the government. The shareholders of BHP, like the company, have a responsibility to this nation and to the people of this nation.

         If the government developed an industry policy—and this goes as much for the previous government as it goes for this government—far more steel would have been used in the economy. There would have been a greater demand for steel and BHP would then have had far less reason to close down its operations.

          —In 1897 and 1898, Australians from all the colonies, except Queensland, gathered in Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne to hold a constitutional convention that led Australia down the historic path to Federation. The founding fathers did so in a spirit which, despite the many divisions that existed in their respective home colonies, had at its core the belief that they were involved in the task of nation building, of shaping the form that a new Australian federation would take. It was a task they took on regardless of their personal views as to whether the Australian colonies should take the final step towards nationhood.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A century later, this government has no such vision, no such spirit. It has designed a process for constitutional reform based on fear. It is a process that is designed to pull Australians apart, not one which is designed to bring them together. It is a process that will entrench division rather than promote the consensus the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) claims he wants. Rather than embrace and consider change in an open and constructive way, this government and, in particular, this
         <break page="3377" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Prime Minister have been dragged to adopting a process for constitutional reform that is and has been all about avoiding the very reform that is sought.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is a process designed to alienate Australians from both the process and the outcome. It is designed to minimise their involvement so that this government can disregard and discredit the genuine desire that Australians have to resolve this issue. It seeks to take from the hands of ordinary Australians the decision they most want to make themselves—that is, whether we as Australians have a right to aspire to the highest office in the land, whether we want to become a republic.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is no denying that the people's convention is not the Labor Party's preferred means for achieving the republic. We believe that the best way to do this is to put the decision straight into the hands of the Australian people through an indicative plebiscite and, ultimately, via a referendum. Realistically, however, the people's convention is the only option that we who unequivocally support the republic have if Australia is to make the change that we believe is both important and inevitable. That is why the Labor Party supports the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill and supports the people's convention.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But our support is not unconditional. We will be seeking to make changes to this bill both here and in the Senate which will make the convention fairer, more democratic and reflective of community opinion. They are changes that the government will ignore at its peril for we will not take part in a process that is ultimately designed to destroy the very idea we strive for. If the decision Australians make whether to become a republic or not is to be judged as fair dinkum, it is critical that the process to get us there is fair dinkum too. That is where our concerns about this bill begin.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         You only have to look at recent political history to see why this bill is before us in its present form. What has brought it here? Why is it our last best hope? It is no secret that in 1994 the then Leader of the Opposition, the now Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer,
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          was in a pickle. The coalition looked like losing the next federal election, and one of the factors creating doubt in the electorate's mind was the inability of the coalition to resolve its internal squabbling over the republic.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When the current Prime Minister, a renowned monarchist, inherited the leadership, the idea of a people's convention served him well as a means to neutralise the politically damaging issue the republic had become. But he did not embrace the idea of a people's convention because he wanted to embrace the discussion of constitutional reform. No, once again, it was a means of avoiding the destructive, internal party infighting and the damaging political effect of this issue both to him personally and to the coalition as a whole.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As a result, the whole idea of a people's convention has been poisoned since its inception. It has been contrived in fear and timidity, not in hope and vision. Rather than a means for considered deliberation of constitutional reform, it has always been a means for the coalition to avoid making a decision on this issue.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When earlier this year the Prime Minister decided to push ahead with the convention—to keep his election commitment—it was once again not because he was prepared to consider change but rather because he feared what would happen if he was seen to be resisting that change. It is fear that has motivated the government's policy on this issue from the beginning. Unlike the founding fathers a century ago, who embraced the processes of change that led the nation to Federation, this Prime Minister fears change. He refuses to lead. This bill is weak and sneaky. It reeks of the Prime Minister's fear of tackling the republic head-on.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is nowhere more evident than in the Prime Minister's second reading speech. In a speech where he could have outlined his clear vision for Australia's future, our destiny, our place in the world, what did he do? What does he always do when the issue is big? He equivocated.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Only in two paragraphs of his speech—the first and the last—did he describe the nature of the choice to be put before the people's
         <break page="3378" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          convention and, even then, only in a formal way. He devoted three paragraphs to discuss the reluctance of both him and his government to change our constitutional framework. In the remaining 18 paragraphs—yes, 18 paragraphs; 78 per cent of his speech for the statisticians amongst you—he described in mind&amp;hyphen;numbing detail such amazing relevancies as whether the ballot papers would be bar&amp;hyphen;coded, the size of the ballot paper and whether appeal processes under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 would apply.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is the extent of the leadership and vision of our Prime Minister. No-one expected the Gettysburg Address, least of all from this Prime Minister, but the Australian people both expected and deserved something better than this.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This lack of leadership and vision manifests itself in every clause of this bill. The whole thing is designed to leave the government with a way out—regardless of the result of the ballot to elect delegates to the convention, regardless of the result of the convention's deliberations, regardless of the will of the Australian people.

         How? Firstly, because the bill is undemocratic. It is a dangerous experiment in voluntary voting which seeks to disempower millions of ordinary Australians by ensuring that as few of them as possible express their view on this important issue. Secondly, because the government sought to defy convention. It has sought to rig the appointed delegates to the convention, especially the parliamentary delegates, to favour the coalition. In doing so, it seeks to prevent consensus—the test the Prime Minister himself has laid down for determining the convention's success. Finally, because the government has failed to set up a framework through which the convention can undertake its deliberation on the issue of the republic.

         As for the voluntary postal ballot, the first indication of the government's contempt for the Australian people over this issue is its decision to have a voluntary postal ballot to elect delegates to the convention. If a voluntary postal ballot is held, it will be the first time a Commonwealth election, plebiscite or referendum will have been determined by this means.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government claims to support this approach because of the cost. The government is currently arguing that a voluntary postal ballot will cost approximately $40 million, compared with $49 million for a compulsory attendance ballot. This cost differential is still the subject of considerable dispute, with the final cost of a compulsory attendance ballot likely to be considerably less than the amount claimed and the cost of a voluntary voting ballot likely to be considerably more. In any case, the cost of democracy has never been an issue and should not be one now.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government has also argued that Australians should not be compelled to vote at a ballot for a convention that is not binding. Yet the convention will be binding to the extent that its recommendations will form the model of the republic that will ultimately be put to the people at a referendum. Furthermore, voluntary postal voting sits uncomfortably with the Prime Minister's commitment to consult all Australians at the beginning, the middle and the end of the process. How can we truly describe this as the people's convention unless all Australians have participated in the process?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">

         Further, material about the ballot will only be available in writing and in English.

         A postal ballot will also not be distributed to approximately 200,000 Australians who are likely to be overseas at the time of the ballot. Many of those Australians would otherwise vote at an overseas polling booth. A voluntary vote is also likely to be used by those within the government, such as Senator Minchin, to support their ultimate desire to see voluntary voting introduced at federal elections. Recent opinion polls show that 72 per cent of Australians support compulsory voting.

         The history of voluntary voting postal ballots in this country, which have only been used for local council and trade union elections, is not good. Recent experience in both Victoria and South Australia is testament to that. At best, the experience of voluntary postal ballots shows that only 60 to 70 per cent of Australians are likely to vote. The more usual figure is a 30 to 40 per cent turnout. This will be used by some to discredit any message sent by the electorate through its preference for pro-republican or monarchist  candidates.

Instead, voters will have to refer to an accompanying booklet and their names cross&amp;hyphen;referenced to a number on the ballot paper that will have to be numbered if a voter wishes to vote below the line.

Naturally, this will result in an increase in the number of elected delegates to ensure that half the delegates are elected and half are appointed. Accordingly, we propose that the number of elected representatives per state be divided as follows: New South Wales, 22; Victoria, 17; Queensland, 14; Western Australia, nine; South Australia, eight; Tasmania, six; Australian Capital Territory, two; and the Northern Territory, two—a total of 80.

Sir Anthony is an outstanding Australian whose long service on the bench has done enormous credit both to him and to the nation. He has consistently demonstrated himself to be fair in his dealings with all sides of politics, and his candidacy should have no problem drawing support from all sides of politics.

During the 1890s three conventions were held. It was at the first of these conventions—the National Australasian Convention in 1891—that our constitution was drafted. At the Bathurst People's Federal Convention in 1896 the draft of our constitution was reviewed. From 1897 to 1898 the Australasian Federal Convention was convened, and it was here that the concept for an Australian federation was resolved.

         Integral to this independence is the question of whether or not the British monarch should be removed as Australia's head of state. The very existence of an unelected head of state whose title is hereditary is complete anathema to the Australian concept of a fair go for everyone. Presently our Governor-General may be appointed on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. But he or she still represents the British monarch. As Professor P.H. Lane rightly points out, `The monarch is only a shadow over a de facto republic. The Governor-General is a de facto president appointed by an elected Prime Minister and answerable to this Prime Minister, almost invariably acting on his advice.'

         However, the inescapable fact is that our head of state remains the Queen of England and her successors, irrespective of the limited nature of her influence in Australia. This very fact, in my opinion, is an affront to the fundamental concepts of liberalism. No-one deserves the right to be my—indeed, Australia's—sovereign by virtue of birthright alone. Essentially, the concept of hereditary title is incongruous with Australian beliefs that it is possible that any Australian can one day lead this country, whatever his or her background may be.

         The Australian constitution of today, when all relevant High Court interpretations are taken into account, is almost unrecognisable from its first draft. However, proponents of the constitution often recite in its defence the phrase `if it ain't broke, don't fix it'. Apart from being a trite mantra that supports mediocrity, this seriously misrepresents the true status of our constitution. It is a piece of British legislation that is more suited to the 1890s. It is antiquated and parts of it are unworkable.

Contrast this with the fact that since 1790, which is a period of some 200 years, there have been 853 cases where constitutional matters have been considered before the US Supreme Court and, unlike that court, our High Court cases are not decisions related to what could be called the `teething years' in the history of the constitution.

Ultimately, the judges of the High Court have sought to expand constitutional powers by simply divining the intent of our founding fathers. These are the same founding fathers who, when drafting the constitution, would have had no concept of international human rights, Aboriginal reconciliation, ecologically sustainable development and other issues, including the importance of telecommunications for the future of Australia.

         It is fair to say that the Statute of Westminster 1931 and the Australia Act 1986 have transformed the constitutional relationship between Britain and Australia. This severing of legal ties with Britain not only gave Australia the impetus to seek a new sphere of influence in Asia but also paved the way for a divergence between Australian and British laws. Under British law, our head of state in Australia cannot succeed if he or she is any religion other than Protestant. In addition, males enjoy succession in preference to females. Both of these concepts are at odds with the Australian laws protecting equal opportunity and ironically section 116 of the constitution, which states:

But to effect this revamp would be tantamount to a rewrite. Indeed, to use the constitution as it stands today as the basis for a minimalist republican constitution would require over 70 changes.

          One area where constitutional change may be required is in relation to the reserve powers. The reserve powers held by the Governor&amp;hyphen;General are uncodified and therefore discretionary, and convention dictates that they should be exercised on the advice of the Prime Minister. However, the potential exists for these powers to be exercised contrary to this advice, as occurred in 1975.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          A number of republican constitutions, such as that of the Irish Free State in 1922, have codified the reserve powers. It is therefore preposterous to argue that keeping these reserve powers unwritten and subject to only the dictates of convention will ensure that the constitution remains fluid. These unwritten laws are too rarely used to support this argument. Perhaps the most cogent argument for ensuring that these laws are written down is that it then becomes possible for judicial review of actions to take place.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There are usually four arguments propounded in support of reserve powers, each as insupportable as the next. Firstly, it is argued that reserve powers are required to deal with a government which acts illegally. Apart from the existing judicial review procedures, a republican head could be given the authority to deal with such a government should the illegality go too far and, should the republican head act illegally, he or she could be impeached according to a written code.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Secondly, the situation might arise where no party has the majority in the House of Representatives, resulting in a voting deadlock. There are obviously only two ways to deal with this situation; namely, political accom

          Thirdly, parliament may be acting unconstitutionally. In Ireland, if the President is convinced that a bill is unconstitutional, after consultation with the Council of State the bill can be sent to the Supreme Court for a constitutional test. If the court decides that the bill is constitutional, the President can sign it. This procedure could in fact make extensive and costly constitutional litigation in our own High Court a thing of the past.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Fourthly, what constitutional options are available when the Senate is blocking supply? The founding fathers did anticipate a situation where a contradiction might exist between the Senate and the House of Representatives and allowed for a joint sitting of the parliament. Only once, in 1975, has the opposition used its majority in the Senate to force a government out of office. We have seen many instances where the opposition parties control the Senate, but there has never been the corresponding demand for a role in government formation.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The solution lies in an amendment to the constitution to say that the government must have the confidence of the House of Representatives and that the Senate must not use its power to overthrow the government by blocking supply required for, in the words of Alan J. Ward, `the ordinary annual services of government'. With the exception of Italy, this standard is the minimum standard recognised in every bicameral parliamentary system in the Western world. I find it patronising and a little insulting to think that lurking in the shadows and corridors of parliament are these unqualified, unwritten powers which can be swung into action by a person elected by no-one to reprimand the popularly elected Australian representatives.

          A further argument used against constitutional change is that it will lead to political instability. Our current head of state is not the source of our nation's political stability.

          It has often been said that a republic in Australia is inevitable. This may be so, but a republic will not come on its own. It requires impetus and it requires discussion in every quarter of our land. This bill before the House today is the first step in deciding whether or not Australia should become a republic. The constitutional convention itself will be an important opportunity for reaching broad agreement on suitable changes to the Australian constitution which may be acceptable to the Australian people at a subsequent referendum.

In fact only eight from 42 proposals for reform of the constitution have been accepted by Australians since 1901.

          Prior to the first conventions at the end of the last century which led to our Federation, Sir Henry Parkes had great difficulty in encouraging the states to come to the table and to talk about the future. The states were preoccupied with dealing with the Great Depression of the 1890s. It was only as the effects of the depression began to wane that the states decided to turn their attention to a possible federation. One hundred years later—and ironically the circumstances are not so different—the issue of a republic is at the forefront of constitutional debate across the country—in parliaments, in the media and in the homes of many Australians. We therefore once again have the opportunity as a nation to shape our constitutional future.

This debate is about changing our current head of state from a respected person who is the ruling monarch of a distant land to an Australian—one of us, a leader from our own land.

It is not even about whether or not the current arrangements we have in place in regard to our head of state are suitable to this nation's needs as a modern, outgoing, industrialised Western nation. It is none of these things. Today's debate is about brass tacks. It is about the mechanics of how best we go about deciding for ourselves once and for all whether or not we want to become a republic.

          The difference between the main parties on this question is clear and has been for some time. Labor's plan, as unveiled by the former Prime Minister, was to offer the people of Australia a direct choice on the matter, right at the beginning of the whole decision making process. A national plebiscite was to be held which asked one question, `Do you want an Australian head of state?' If the answer came back with a majority yes vote, then the number of proposals for adjusting the constitution would then be discussed, decided upon and then put to the people in a referendum as a final step towards becoming a republic—very simple.

          The coalition's plan, which we have now seen unfold over the last year and a half, is a decidedly more complex, more cumbersome and less democratic arrangement. It is an arrangement—conceived out of political desperation, born of political opportunism—which is seriously and fundamentally flawed. The people's convention of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was dreamt up by the current Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) when he was opposition leader in an attempt to bridge the deep divisions which exist in the coalition over the republic. Their plan was never designed solely for providing Australians with the most coherent framework possible to begin the decision making process surrounding the republic.

          For the current leader of the coalition, the Prime Minister, the Hon. John Howard, the people's convention holds other attractions, more personal attractions. He sees it as an opportunity to embroil the whole issue in political controversy and animosity. He hopes that, if it degenerates into a political squabble, the convention will give the appearance of division in the community on the republic and create among ordinary Australians a level of distaste for the whole debate. For the Prime Minister, such distaste and frustration is just one step away from a vote rejecting a republic in any future referendum; yet flawed as the plan may be, devious as it may be, it is what we are left with at this moment.

            We can kick the whole thing into touch by calling for a people's convention. The people's convention is a perfect talking shop. It will keep the issue off the party political agenda and the election agenda. With the people's convention up and running, the Liberal Party wouldn't have to say or do anything about the republic. It would effectively bury the issue for as long as we want.

Apparently not, and anyone who reads the bill before the House now will agree with me.

          —The contributions that have been made so far in this debate on the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill really highlight the division that exists across all political boundaries on the wider issue of a republic. I do not approach this bill with any great enthusiasm, I must concede. I do not think that what Russell Ward described in his book as the Australian legend will come to fruition with the vehicle of this sort of legislation. If anything, in the 20 years since I read that book, Australia has moved away from the notion of an Australian legend more than it has at any other time in its history.

         As I noted in my maiden speech, the Americanisation of our culture concerns me. If the movement to a republic, which is being championed by a number of people who firmly believe that it will assist Australia to grow up, will assist in the process of the Australianisation of our culture, rather than an Americanisation of our culture, then I would be firmly in favour of it. However, I really do not see that happening. Perhaps I am a cynic.

         I believe somewhat cynically—perhaps it might be said cynically anyway—that this sort of money ought best be spent on our foreign aid budget than on a process such as this. Having said that, I understand that an election commitment was made and this is a realisation of that commitment. But I am sure that the people in the Horn of Africa, the Aboriginal communities in our society and other places might well scratch their heads if we sat down and explained this to them.

         The main purpose of the bill is to establish the process for the election of 76 delegates to the constitutional convention in December of this year. The salient features of that election process are that it is voluntary, of a Senate style and conducted by secret postal ballot. Of course, the legislation does not deal with the agenda for the convention. Just what is going to happen at the convention has obviously excited quite a bit of debate. The legislation does not deal with that, of course, but with the delegate election process only. It is clear, however, that the key questions for examination by the convention are should Australia become a republic and, if so, which republican model should be put to the electorate?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Before commenting on the republican side of it a little bit more widely than I already have, I should make a couple of comments. The election process would cost about $35.6 million. That is the estimate made by the Electoral Commission, but approximately $40 million might be a more realistic assessment, as was mentioned by the previous speaker. However, an attendance ballot would cost at least $55 million. So I suppose the financial impact of the postal ballot can be defended on that basis alone. Of course, voting for the delegates is not compulsory. This is entirely appropriate, in my view, in the circumstances because the convention will not have decision making powers.

          It is perhaps interesting to note that what may well be a reasonable barometer of public interest in the republic  debate will be the voter turnout itself. I will be very interested to see what sort of voter turnout will emerge on that aspect. In the election campaign and since I think that, of the thousands of people I have spoken to and communicated with, I have had only two people in my electorate speak to me about Australia becoming a republic.

          Likewise, I suspect that members in similar electorates to mine may well have had a response of that nature.

The degree of support and interest in his electorate is of a larger magnitude.

          The government is committed to unity and not division. So, if there is to be constitutional change, it must be achieved through a process that unites rather than a process that divides the community. The constitutional convention process is a high form of community consultation, and it will facilitate the ventilation of a disparate array of views. That is quite clear, as has already been mentioned and as already appears in some of the statements of honourable members who have spoken. There will be differences of opinion, but that does not mean that ultimately there will be division arising out of it. Far better that the wide range of opinions that I am sure will emerge at the convention are ventilated and aired in the community.

          Of course, 106 years ago the first National Australasian Convention met in Sydney. That was on 2 March 1891. The purpose of that convention was `to consider and report upon an adequate scheme for a federal constitution'. There were seven delegates from each Australian colony and three from New Zealand, although the New Zealanders were bystanders. They never took federation with the Australian colonies seriously. The 1891 convention was the brainchild of Sir Henry Parkes, an English immigrant, whom Alfred Deakin was to describe as `a large&amp;hyphen;brained self&amp;hyphen;educated Titan'. I am sure, Mr Deputy

          At the commencement of the convention, Sir Henry Parkes put to the delegates a number of resolutions relating to the proposed federation of the colonies but qualified his submission thus—and it is an important quote which I will extract in toto:

         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          That is an important principle, in my view, when considering how this convention should proceed. If the republican issue is freely and unfearingly discussed, amended, negatived and dealt with in whatever way the delegates to the 1997 convention choose, it will be ultimately a process that many would consider worth while. There will be differences of opinion, naturally, but it is the spirit in which one enters into that sort of convention which is important.

          However, as I said earlier, my main reservation in the republican debate is whether it will lead ultimately to an Australia which is merely a mirror image of the USA. As I said in my maiden speech—and I repeat—I do not favour Australia becoming the 51st state of the Union, nor do I want a US style republic for Australia. Australia will remain a constitutional monarchy, if the people of Australia so determine. An Australian republic is not a fait accompli.

          It is also important to remember the magnificent contribution—during almost all of my life—of Queen Elizabeth II, a person whom I hold in enormous esteem. It is nothing to the point to say that she is an English monarch who has occupied that seat by virtue of the hereditary monarchy. We are talking about a person who has brought great credit to an enormously difficult office. Throughout her lengthy reign, she has given us a quiet stability. She has not been undermined by the gutter press and has maintained her dignity through

         <para first-indent="16">
          Can we expect to get that from an elected individual? Are we more likely to get it from someone like Queen Elizabeth II? We know we have got it from her; it is clear. When I look at appointees to represent her—particularly those that have emerged in recent times—I question sometimes whether those appointees are the sorts of people who bring the unity that is needed to this country. It is very important for the appointed head of state to be apolitical and not to embark upon areas which will bring the Australian community into some form of division. That is why he or she—presently he—has to be so careful to behave in that office in a way that will not bring the office into disrepute. It is the same in relation to people like judges as well. But that is another issue.

          It is so important, in my view, to be totally divorced from politics. I would hate to see a situation where a third arm of government emerged with a president running around the countryside issuing statements on various matters, unfortunately in conflict with—or seen to be in conflict with—the government of the day and causing division in the community. It is important that he does not do that because, ultimately, and I suppose in the case of the present system—my honourable friend from North Sydney touched on this—the Governor&amp;hyphen;General may have a role in exercising the reserve powers.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It has been said by others, not only in this debate but in other places, that those powers should be codified. As someone who lived through the 1975 situation, I tremble at the thought of codification of the reserve powers. In my view, in that very delicate situation at that time, the Governor-General acted quite appropriately. He was put in an intolerable situation by the government of the day and he was made to make a decision.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Indeed, I argued at the time that the then Prime Minister deliberately put the Governor&amp;hyphen;General in that position because the Prime Minister knew that he could not win an election unless he got a sympathy vote of some sort. The Prime Minister knew that his
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           course of action would lead to his dismissal. Those who lived through it will remember the enormous tide of support that rose for Gough during that period. On its face, it seemed overwhelming initially. The Governor&amp;hyphen;General at that time gave the people of Australia an opportunity to decide the issue. When people came to vote, we saw the result.

          I also wonder about this question of remoteness. I do not want to sound like an apologist for the monarchy. I want to be persuaded that there is something better than we have got—it is as simple as that—and that it will foster an Australian image, the development of an Australian identity. I remain unconvinced at the moment, but I am open to change on the issue. I really wonder, when one talks about the remoteness of the Crown, what has happened to the process in this country over the last 20 years in particular. I presume governments have decided not to have the Queen come here to visit. Once upon a time the Queen came here and opened the parliament regularly. She came to open various buildings and those sorts of things. That inspired interest in the monarchy and it inspired the monarch to be closer to the people than she seems to be at the moment. But we do not have that now. Is that part of the process? It is something that has happened over time. We have said that she is remote, but she is made to be remote by the government of the day. Canberra politicians are said to be remote from the community because they are down here. Public servants in Canberra are claimed to be remote because they are not out there in the community. It is getting out there in the community that brings it all together.

If we do not want her, of course we do not have to have her. But why don't we recognise that, as Queen of Australia, she should be part of such significant events as the Olympic Games opening and the opening of parliament? But we do not want to do that for some reason. We had the President of the United States walk in here, though, and give a speech to the parliament. Why not the Queen of Australia?

          Tonight I announce the Government's plan to reduce the tax on saving.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          Every Australian will be eligible for a 15 per cent tax rebate on their savings. The measure will be introduced in two stages with a 7.5 per cent rebate from 1 July 1998 and the full rebate from 1 July 1999.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          The rebate will apply to the first $3,000 of taxable income from savings however derived. For example, the rebate would apply to the

           whole of the interest earned on $60,000 invested at 5 per cent.

         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          Alternatively, the rebate can be claimed in respect of any payment of personal contributions into superannuation up to $3,000. A person who pays $3,000 into superannuation will get a $450 tax rebate.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          The 15 per cent rebate applies to the marginal tax rate. For a person on the 20 per cent tax rate it will mean the income they put into superannuation is taxed at just 5 per cent.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          Mr Speaker, the savings rebate will benefit around 6 million taxpayers. The bulk of the benefit will flow to individuals with taxable income under $40,000. It will benefit current savers and encourage new savings.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">

          The savings rebate takes the place of Labor's L&amp;hyphen;A&amp;hyphen;W tax cuts which were never paid. This brings to an end that tawdry episode. Other Labor schemes to deduct contributions from take home pay and make Government payments into superannuation couldn't have worked. And they were discriminatory—to one class of saving (superannuation)—and to one part of society (those in the workforce).
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          The Coalition approach is universal—open to all Australians and all types of saving. In particular, older Australians who have saved for their retirement are brought in from the cold. They are given the chance to take up the savings rebate.

          The savings rebate is estimated to cost $350 million in 1998&amp;hyphen;99 and $1.4 billion in 1999&amp;hyphen;2000.

                This Budget continues the Government's commitment to reducing tax compliance costs for small business.

               <para style="Para">
                In March this year, the Prime Minister announced the Government's response to the recommendations of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force. That response included a number of taxation measures designed to assist small business. It built on measures to free small business from capital gains tax on rollover of assets or business. It provides a record keeping exemption available to up to half of small businesses paying fringe benefits tax.

               <para style="Para">
                Tonight, I am pleased to announce changes to withholding tax arrangements to further reduce tax compliance costs for small business and reduce the frequency of transactions between business and the Australian Taxation Office. From 1 July 1998, businesses with an annual tax withholding obligation of $25,000 or less, under the Pay&amp;hyphen;As&amp;hyphen;You&amp;hyphen;Earn, Prescribed Payments and Reportable Payments systems, will have the option to remit these payments on a quarterly, rather than a monthly, basis. This measure will allow in excess of 300,000 small businesses the opportunity to defer the remittance of $500 million in withheld amounts in 1998&amp;hyphen;99.
               </para>
               <para style="Para">
                In addition, and in step with commercial trends, payments by large withholders (that is, those with annual an withholding obligation in excess of $1 million) are to be made earlier and by electronic means. The revenue bring forward from this change will offset the revenue deferral costs associated with the new arrangements for small business and provide a one&amp;hyphen;off gain in 1998&amp;hyphen;99.

                I am announcing tonight a range of further measures to enhance tax system integrity.

For example, I am announcing measures to protect the integrity of the company tax imputation system, to deal with dividend streaming and franking credit trading.

               <para style="Para">
                The stronger outlook for 1997&amp;hyphen;98 reflects stronger private consumption, the recovery in the housing sector and continued strong business investment. Business investment is expected to rise by around 8 per cent following exceptional growth in 1996&amp;hyphen;97.

                Despite the expected pick&amp;hyphen;up in activity and stronger investment, the current account deficit should increase only slightly as a share of GDP. That, in part, reflects the positive effect of the increase in public saving from Commonwealth debt reduction.

There are three major components: a range of superannuation options from a total lump sum to total pension depending on the circumstances of the individual; a severance benefit equal to two weeks salary for each completed years of service plus pro rata for completed months subject to a minimum of four weeks salary, a maximum of 48 weeks salary and a payment in lieu of notice arrangement; and payment in lieu for unused annual leave and long service leave.

        (1) Yes. The Government is very aware of community concerns about the environmental impact of telecommunications facilities roll out by the carriers. The Government has taken legislative action to address these concerns.

        (2) Network deployment decisions (what to build and when and where to build it) are matters for the commercial judgement of the carriers and their associates. Additional infrastructure investment will not occur unless there is an expectation of user demand for the additional capacity, and a commercial judgement about the need for a carrier to control its own facilities rather than simply interconnect with those of another carrier.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        It should not be assumed that competing telecommunications facilities necessarily duplicate each other. The rapid changes in technology and customer demands that characterise the telecommunications industry provide significant incentives for carriers and service providers to continually explore new and differentiated product applications, and therefore different (but in some cases superficially similar) forms of infrastructure.

        Facilities based competition (under which each carrier builds its own facilities to carry at least some part of its services) has been central to the development of open telecommunications in most countries. In Australia, in the case of telephony, it has delivered lower prices for consumers, greater investment in equipment and a wider range of choices of services for consumers.

        A new Telecommunications Bill 1996 was recently introduced into Parliament.

Depending on what the applicable State or Territory law says, a particular telecommunications facility will need planning approval from either a State or local Government body. There will be only three limited exceptions to this rule. Under these arrangements broadband cable will not be deployed aerially without the agreement of the relevant State or local authority.

        Employment protection is a major issue, with the interests of Reservists, their employers, and the ADF to be taken into account. The matter also needs to be placed within the context of the Government's wider industrial relations reforms. While the Government is considering the issue of employment protection for Reservists, given the stage of these considerations, I am unable to provide the details the honourable member seeks. Any decisions on this issue will be taken after broad consultation with those concerned.

         (3) There are no recent estimates of lost export income as a consequence of USA tariffs and duties. A study on the cost of US apparel protection arrangements to Australian wool growers was conducted in 1991 by ABARE and published in the Agriculture and Resources Quarterly, Vol 3, No 1, March 1991. The study concluded that if the US eliminated its apparel protection (i.e. tariffs and quotas), the estimated net returns to Australian wool growers over twenty years could be $450 million (in 1991 dollars). There are no quotas imposed by the US on imports of Australian wool or woollen textiles and clothing. However quotas are still imposed on imports of textiles and clothing from certain developing countries, many of which are among Australia's best customers for wool. These quotas reduce demand for Australian wool by reducing US textile and apparel import demand from other countries which import Australian wool. The United States is committed to phasing out import quotas on textiles and clothing products by 2004. In the implementation of these commitments, a majority of wool products are in the latter stages of the phasing out period.

          Australia has repeatedly raised in its bilateral consultations with the United States the high tariffs facing our wool exports. Wool was identified in the Trade Outcomes and Objectives Statement released in February 1997 as one of the key sectoral priorities for Government efforts in the US market over the next two years and the issue will be on the agenda of the next officials consultations on agriculture planned for the second half of this year.

         On the multilateral front, Australia will be promoting efforts to liberalise wool tariffs in the next round of multilateral agriculture negotiations scheduled for 1999. Australia is taking a leading role in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in pressing for comprehensive negotiations on industrial tariffs, including tariffs on textiles and clothing. Once these negotiations are joined by member countries, Australia will be seeking to direct attention to the tariff and non&amp;hyphen;tariff barriers restricting the trade of woollen textiles and clothing in all countries, including the USA.

         Another outcome of the Uruguay Round is the phasing out by the end of 2004 of quota restrictions on textiles and clothing under the Multi&amp;hyphen;Fibre Arrangement (MFA) and integration of this sector into World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. This will have an indirect benefit for Australian wool exports to developing countries, some of which are among our major customers for Australian wool. In the long term, these countries will have greater access to the US and other markets. The proposed timetable, however, discriminates against wool as the US has decided to integrate the majority of wool products in the last stage of the phasing out period. Australia will continue to urge the US to reconsider its phase&amp;hyphen;out timetable.

         At the December 1996 WTO Ministerial Conference in Singapore, I emphasised the disadvantages faced by wool exporters due to trade restrictions on woollen textiles and clothing. I urged WTO members, including the USA, to fully implement their Uruguay Round obligations. The Ministerial Declaration of the 1996 Singapore WTO Conference highlighted the importance of woollen products for developing countries&amp;hyphen; our export customers for wool. The issue has also been raised by Australia in the context of the WTO Trade Policy Review Mechanism which reviewed US trade policy in November 1996.

         increasing indirect exports of Australian wool into the US market in the form of textiles and garments manufactured in Mexico. Bilateral trade negotiations between Australia and Mexico in 1995 resulted in Mexico eliminating its 10% tariff on scoured wool and wool tops. This development has significantly improved the prospects for increased processed wool exports to service Mexico's growing wool textile industry which under NAFTA has increasingly liberal access to the US market (for wool textiles and apparel). Following further bilateral trade talks in 1996, Mexico eliminated its 10% tariff on wool noils (wool removed during combing) and waste. These developments will mean a significant boost to Australia's wool exports to Mexico and will benefit the industry as a whole.

        (b) Australia independently formed the view that trade and labour standards was not an appropriate subject for the World Trade Organisation. As it happened, the vast majority of other WTO members arrived at a similar view. It was therefore not a question of Australia supporting the views of ASEAN or any other countries on this subject. The United States was in favour of a work program on trade and labour standards in the WTO and made this known to us, both multilaterally and bilaterally.

        (5) Yes. There has been some correspondence with the United States (and other countries) on these issues, outlining positions taken, as you would expect on matters concerning international organisations such as the WTO and ILO. Australia developed its positions taking into account all the relevant issues, and I do not see any need to provide a copy of this correspondence.

        The Department did not contact the clergy of the recognised denominations directly but their nominating authorities received a letter in July 1991 notifying them of the amendments and asking them to notify the authorised celebrants in their organisations. The Department became aware that some nominating authorities may not have advised their organisation's marriage celebrants of the amendments and on 23 October 1991 again wrote to the nominating authorities requesting that they so inform their members.

        (1) The Runway 16L/34R is 2438m long and was designed and built to cater primarily for domestic sized aircraft such as B767s and B737s, although in terms of width and physical separation standards, it meets the requirements for B747 operations. The declared landing distance available is 1920m for Runway 16L, and 2400m for Runway 34R, which means it is suitable for landings by B747 aircraft in some circumstances.

When advised of my view on 23 December 1996, Foxerco requested—and I agreed—to keep negotiations open. Negotiations between OAS and Foxerco re-commenced early in January 1997 at which time Foxerco made a revised offer which was acceptable to the Government.

The Commonwealth will also receive a commercial proportion of future revenue growth generated at Avalon Airport This represents some $1 lm in net present value terms (over 20 years) based on current revenue projections and is an acceptable economic return on these assets for the Commonwealth.

        (4) Yes. Short-listed parties, which included Westgate and Foxerco, were provided with sufficient opportunity to make a commercial offer. They were invited to submit initial expressions of interest by 25 January 1996; conditional indicative offers by 17 June 1996; and after undertaking detailed due diligence, final offers by 24 July 1996.

        (1) The amount of money a person is required to pay to be registered as an agent varies and depends on the category of registration being applied for. The current scale of fees for registration as a migration agent is set out in the table below.

        (2) (a) Yes. There is no provision in the Migration Agents Registration (Application) Levy Act 1992 (the Act) to refund registration fees.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (2)(b) The fees levied for registration as a migration agent were set at the time the Migration Agents Registration Scheme (the Scheme) was established in September 1992 and are increased in line with the formula set out in section 6 of the Act. Registration fees have not been calculated according to costs for processing individual registration applications.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Rather the Scheme has been designed to operate on a full cost recovery basis. Thus registration fees have been determined on the basis of the total cost of administering the Scheme, including registrations and a complaints investigation/determination mechanism, as well as funding grants to assist  voluntary agencies to provide free immigration advice.

        (3) It would be necessary to amend the legislation to allow refunds of application levies for registration and renewal of registration as a migration agent. The Government has now decided that the migration advice industry will move to self regulation.

        New legislation will be prepared to enable a two year period of statutory self regulation from March 1998 in which regulatory power will be delegated to the industry association, the Migration Institute of Australia. In developing the new arrangements, the matter of refund of fees will need to be considered by the Migration Institute of Australia.

        There was a lithium battery explosion at Simpson Barracks, Watsonia near Yallambie, Victoria (not Yallambie, WA) on 4 February 1997. The incident occurred while a manpack radio, with battery attached and fitted into a backpack carrying harness, was being prepared for a forthcoming exercise. The battery exploded after the radio had completed a transmission and was about to be turned off. While there was some fragmentation of the battery, this was completely contained in the backpack. There were no persons injured; however, seven soldiers were taken to the local hospital as a precaution but released without the need for treatment.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (1) The decline in abundance of many species of native fauna and flora is due to a range of factors including the impact of feral animals. While a
        <break page="3439" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         number of studies have indicated the impacts of individual species of feral animals on some native species there are no comprehensive figures available which would enable the allocation of total impacts of individual species of feral animals on all native species, nor the separate allocation of declines in individual native species to the particular feral animals which may have an impact on them.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        There is clear evidence, however, that feral predators such as the feral cat and European fox have caused the decline and extinction of native animals on islands. They also have been shown to prevent the re-introduction of native species on mainland Australia. Feral herbivores are known to compete with native animals and cause land degradation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        The capacity to measure impacts is complicated by the extent of land use changes since European settlement. Thus the difference in some extinction rates may be attributable to changes and differences in habitat rather than indicating that there is a direct cause and effect. For example, the introduction of rabbits had three effects. Firstly, rabbits competed with native animals for food, especially during drought . Secondly, they displaced certain burrowing marsupials. Thirdly, the spread of rabbits has provided a ready food source for introduced predators, thereby contributing to the maintenance of high densities of such predators.

        (a) and (b) The department has implemented a downsizing strategy in order to meet a two percent reduction in running costs plus a portfolio specific savings target. The department intends to reduce its staffing level by 95 before the end of June 1997. To date, 81 staff have accepted voluntary retrenchment through the provisions of the APS General Employment Conditions Award. Of these, 76 have been from within the department and five through inter-agency swaps. All positions are located in Canberra. It is intended that the positions vacated will be abolished on completion of the downsizing exercise in June 1997.

        (1) The Queensland Department of Natural Resources estimates that Rubber vine densely infests over 700,000 hectares of tropical and sub&amp;hyphen;tropical Queensland between the 400 and 1400 millimetre isohyets but is present across 34.6 million hectares. The major infestations are in the catchments of the Gulf rivers (from the Mitchell to the Northern Territory border), Burdekin River and lower Fitzroy River. Scattered infestations occur in the Lake Eyre and Murray&amp;hyphen;Darling Catchments and coastal rivers south of Rockhampton. Rubber vine has the potential to spread to the Northern Territory, tropical regions of Western Australia and other parts of Queensland.

A National Weeds Strategy Executive Committee comprising State and Commonwealth representatives from agriculture, environment and forestry interests has recently been formed to oversight implementation of the National Weeds Strategy. One of the first tasks of this Committee has been to review the existing strategy for Rubber vine as a precursor to seeking funding support to implement elements of the Strategy.

        (2) Yes. I have received briefings from the Chief Government Information Officer from the Office of Government Information Technology (OGIT), who first brought this issue to the attention of all Commonwealth agencies in May 1996. Year 2000 compliance plans are currently being lodged with OGIT. OGIT keeps me informed and is in constant liaison with the US and UK governments, industry associations, the Reserve Bank and other major banks, suppliers and Year 2000 service providers

        I have had discussions with a senior official from one of the major banks and with the UK's Chief Scientific Adviser. OGIT has formed a Commonwealth&amp;hyphen;State Committee which will be reporting to the On&amp;hyphen;Line Government Council. The Committee aims to assist agencies to resolve the Year 2000 date issue on a whole of Government basis and avoid duplication between State and Commonwealth activities. The Council considered this issue at its recent inaugural meeting. Arrangements are in hand to form a peak body of industry associations and government representatives to keep me advised and to ensure progress is sufficiently rapid across all sectors.

        (3) I have not held discussions on this issue directly with CSIRO or the universities. OGIT has been contacted by a number of financial institutions. Advice to date indicates that the finance industry is well aware of the Year 2000 problem and corrective action has been or will be taken in good time. Other large private sector businesses also appear to be moving on this issue but there may be insufficient awareness by smaller enterprises. Accordingly, I addressed the National Small Business Forum in November 1996, provided an article to the National Small Business Newsletter and have issued several media statements on this topic.

        The measure to introduce a single classification system and assessment instrument across the residential care sector from 1 July 1997 will ensure that residents will be funded according to their care needs no matter where they are. The development of this new instrument will take proper account of both the physical and mental frailty of residents and match this to an appropriate level of funding. Consistent with and complementary to the Reform Package is the National Carer Action Plan which aims to improve support for carers, including carers of PeoPle with dementia.
