         —I know that all members of the House will be particularly concerned about the very disturbing events in Papua New Guinea over the last 48 hours. Since becoming independent, Papua New Guinea has adhered—often in very difficult circumstances—to strong democratic principles and has acted in accordance with the provisions of its constitution. A central element of that democratic tradition has of course been the absolute authority of the civilian government over military authorities. I should, therefore, make it very clear on behalf of the government—and I believe on behalf of every member of this House—that we utterly deplore the attempts of the former Commander-in-Chief of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force to defy the authority of the duly elected government of Papua New Guinea.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the circumstances, the action taken by the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Sir Julius Chan, to remove the head of the defence force was both understandable and justifiable. I certainly express the hope, on behalf of the government, that there will be a proper, peaceful and normal return to the constitutional processes of that country. Our
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         position on this subject was made crystal clear in public comments yesterday and our High Commission in Port Moresby has conveyed our position to the Papua New Guinea government and is also conveying our attitude to the current acting commander of the defence forces in that country.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is not an occasion for overblown rhetoric or unduly bellicose statements. The domestic situation in Papua New Guinea is fragile. The government there does have a very difficult domestic problem in relation to Bougainville. My government and the government led by my predecessor as Prime Minister grappled with that issue over a period of time. There is no easy solution and anybody who understands circumstances in New Guinea will know how difficult it is for any government of that country to resolve that particular issue.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Having said that and having fully expressed the view that the civilian authority of the elected government of New Guinea should prevail over any statements of the defence force, can I make it clear so far as the other issue in our relationship with Papua New Guinea is concerned—that is, the potential use of mercenaries on Bougainville—that the attitude of the Australian government that that would be a retrograde and an extremely regrettable step remains completely as it was before the events of the last 48 hours.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As members will know, I met the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Sir Julius Chan, in Sydney last Sunday week. During a discussion of some 4&amp;half; hours, which traversed the full gamut of the bilateral relationship, I made it very clear to him that Australia remained very strongly opposed to the use of mercenaries on Bougainville and that, if the use of those mercenaries took place, there would be consequences of a serious kind so far as the relationship between Australia and New Guinea was concerned. I take this opportunity of reiterating that position on behalf of the government. I make it plain that the alternatives to the use of the mercenaries, which I outlined to the Prime Minister on 9 March, remain on the table and I draw the Prime Minister's attention to the existence of those alternatives.
       </para>
       <break page="2264" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The final point I want to make is that the primary concern of the government at present is the safety of Australian citizens in Papua New Guinea. That is a situation which has remained under very close attention over past weeks, particularly over the last 48 hours, and, as would be expected, the government is very closely monitoring that situation. All appropriate measures will be taken to ensure that if there is any threat to those people—and I am not advised that there is any threat of consequence at present—every available opportunity will be taken to continue monitoring and, if steps are necessary, they will be taken.

         —The opposition agrees basically with the sentiments expressed by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), including in particular the strictures that he made on the question of the authority of civilian rule over military predilections at any point in time in Papua New Guinea and also the questions he raised in relation to the difficulties that are being confronted by the Papua New Guinean government.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I also note and appreciate the fact that he made reference to concerns on his part that, should a situation which does not now exist occur at some point in time in the future where more concern might be exercised in relation to the presence of some 10,000 Australian nationals who live and work in Papua New Guinea, he is bearing their concerns and the question of their safety in mind. That is important, particularly in the context in which we are making statements to the Papua New Guinean government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I also recognise that there are occasionally situations in international diplomatic circles when governments can make statements behind doors, not publicly, but oppositions are not in that same position. So let me make a few. I think it has to be made absolutely clear to the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea that we regard the persistent attitude on his part to the continued or the possible use of
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         mercenaries in Bougainville to be completely unacceptable and as drawing consequences in terms of the relationship between Papua New Guinea and Australia should that situation obtain. Those consequences would go to the defence cooperation program and to the aid budget. He should be placed clearly on notice that we have those concerns and that those concerns will produce those consequences if that is persisted with.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is not simply a question, important though it is, of the use of mercenaries in that situation in Bougainville, nor is it simply a question of Sandline International. There are other mercenary groups operating around the globe as well as them. The question of how they are utilised on Bougainville is of concern to us, but the introduction of mercenary forces into the political and military equation in South Pacific island states would be absolutely devastating, not simply in Papua New Guinea but elsewhere through the South Pacific. A line is being, and ought to be, firmly drawn by the Australian government in relation to the Papua New Guinean government as far as that is concerned, not only because of the issue on Bougainville but because of the general concerns that prevail in that regard.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have had a bit of gratuitous commentary from Sir Julius Chan on the attitudes of the Australian government since the Australian government has made its views clear. The Australian government has every reason to believe that Julius's nose has been thumbed at it from the outset on this particular occasion, starting with the foreign minister's appearance in announcing a $4 million aid package for what was then apparently Papua New Guinean government strategy some four days before the hiring of Sandline became evident and followed by an appearance that guarantees were being given that mercenaries would not be serving on Bougainville and then some days later a firm statement was made by the Papua New Guinean government that in fact that was not the case and they would still continue to be used there. Quite clearly there is an erratic response forthcoming from the Papua New Guinean government to the positions that have been put
        <break page="2265" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         forward to it and apparently undertakings given to us by the Papua New Guinean government.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I noticed in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Sydney Morning Herald
        </emphasis>
        a particularly gratuitous piece of commentary from the Papua New Guinean government, if it is an accurate reflection of the press conference of the Prime Minister yesterday, and that was a suggestion, evidently in a question, that somewhere or other the reaction or activity of the Papua New Guinean defence forces was related to a threat that was issued by the Australian government that aid issues, military and civilian, were on the table and whether or not that might have motivated the general then in charge of the Papua New Guinean defence forces to do what he did.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One would have expected, I think, from the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea that there would be a firm rejection of any such suggestion. There was not. In fact, what he had to say was `probably' there was a relationship between the two. Again, that is not an acceptable suggestion, I would have thought, as far as the direction of policy of this country was concerned in our relationship with Papua New Guinea. We have always made it absolutely clear cut in our relationship with the Papua New Guinean defence forces over the years that we see no political role for them whatsoever when these issues from time to time have arisen. They have never arisen as dramatically as they have in the last couple of days, but whenever they have arisen in the past that has been absolutely clear cut on our part.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So this is a situation which is going to continue for some considerable time and is going to require very considerable diplomatic resources for the Australian government to deal with it. The Australian government will have the backing of the opposition in any stand of absolute firmness as far as this is concerned. We absolutely believe that there is something of a threshold being reached here in a number of issues, and that threshold having been reached we must be absolutely certain that it is not crossed or advanced upon in a way that in the long term both Papua New Guinea and ourselves find it very difficult to live with.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         I believe the lines that are being pursued by the Australian government are correct. I cannot see, of course, the way in which their diplomacy in relation to it is being pursued. All I can say is that, to this point of time, the way in which we have pursued it does not necessarily seem to have had very much effect. That means that I do believe that the bunsen burner needs to be turned up a little in relation to the relationship with Papua New Guinea.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I might say too—and this absolutely in no way whatever excuses the actions by the brigadier yesterday—that part of this mess is a product of the insufficient support given to the Papua New Guinean defence forces by the Papua New Guinean government over a period of time. Really that is a situation which could have been very easily addressed by the $38 million that went to Sandline. There are many issues around that $38 million where legitimate questions are being asked of the Papua New Guinean government and ought to be answered.

The government did not have any forewarning of the actions by the commander of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force or soon to be former commander of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force. Clearly, since the announcement by the Papua New Guinea government or, should I say, the revelation in the media that the Papua New Guinea government was to employ Sandline International, there has been no doubt some debate within the Papua New Guinea military about the wisdom or otherwise of that. I do not really propose to go into a commentary on that. The chief of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force has made his own statements about the attitude of his defence force and that is really a matter for Papua New Guinea to debate and a matter for them to contemplate.

Since becoming aware of those developments, Australia's views on these matters have been made clear in the Prime Minister's statement today, as well as in the comments that were issued through a spokesman yesterday. The government clearly firmly opposes any unconstitutional moves against the Papua New Guinea government. The government would like to see the Papua New Guinea government resolve this matter as soon as possible, peacefully and in accordance with Papua New Guinea's constitution.

         Why we are doing this is quite simple. It is because we believe that access to a Medicare provider number involves a degree of mutual obligation—that, if medical practitioners are to be given access to Medicare for life, they in return have a responsibility to ensure that the quality in general practice is as high as possible and that we can do something to get more doctors into rural areas. Both of these are important; both of them the government

          makes no apology for; on both of them the government has no intention of backing down. It may be that, with respect to the implementation of this, there are a few issues on which I can put young doctors' minds to rest. I am happy to try to do that, but I make it very clear that we do not give in to thuggery, we do not give in to bullying—and the legislation has passed the parliament. Industrial action in itself is rather strange. It is a bit like two football teams having a match. One football team wins, it leaves the field and the crowd goes home. The other team keeps playing, keeps kicking goals and keeps cheering themselves. The fact is this legislation passed the parliament on 14 December. It received royal assent on 17 December.

         I can understand the concerns of the younger doctors, though, because there have been some very wild claims relating to this legislation. These were also repeated in the article in the

        <para style="Para">
         These are claims that have been made since September last year. These are claims that are demonstrably false. The fact is that we are already into the first year of the legislation where we are supposed to have 400 to 500 doctors without access to training positions, and the fact is there are training positions available in Australia that we cannot fill. The last time I checked, which was 1&amp;half; weeks ago, there were 22 training positions in New South Wales, Queensland and the Northern Territory that someone could walk into tomorrow that are unable to be filled. So, far from being 400 to 500 doctors who do not have access to training, there is no doctor who wants training and is prepared to move that does not have access to it and there are, in fact, training positions that are unfilled.

As Chairman of the Sydney Airport Community Forum, he has had a leading role in trying to resolve some of the problems that this government inherited when we came into office in March of last year—problems which were created by the ineptness and mismanagement of the previous Labor government that left Sydneysiders with an enormous problem dealing with aircraft noise which this government, with the assistance of the honourable member for North Sydney, has been working very hard indeed to try to resolve.

         The issue that the honourable member for North Sydney refers to is one that has caused some considerable interest in recent days. When the new third runway was originally constructed, for reasons best known to the former Minister for Transport, the threshold, which is the point at which aircraft land on the runway, was not placed at the end of the runway but was moved some 500 metres in from the end of the runway. This meant that the operations of the airport were unbalanced and this decreased the efficiency of the operation of the airport which caused an increase in delays and in inconvenience for those people who use the airport.

I have, though, been approached by the member for North Sydney, in his capacity as chairman of the Sydney Airport Community Forum, and he has said to me that members of the Sydney Airport Community Forum have resolved that the threshold issue should not be dealt with at the present time and that the threshold should not be looked at unless it is looked at in light of the long&amp;hyphen;term operating plans for the operation of Sydney airport which the government is currently dealing with.

          In relation to the implementation of this scheme, it builds on the current scheme. The current scheme in relation to employer contributions has the assessments paid by the superannuation funds—exactly the same system.

         What that quote shows is that Labor moved to enterprise bargaining as the centrepiece of their scheme. The reason they did so was in their very own statements. Prior to the last election they said that the reason you would move to an enterprise based system in industrial relations was that it could produce dramatic gains in productivity and better paid and more secure jobs for workers. That is the reason you would do it. So why is it that they are now moving away from it? The then Labor government, in its platform for the last election, said that the Industrial Relations Reform Act entrenches workplace bargaining as the centrepiece of Australia's industrial relations system.

         The reality is that Labor has moved away from that which it said was important. It follows a long history. Before the 1990 election they were opposed to enterprise bargaining, but after the election they moved to implement it. In the 1993 election they
         <break page="2275" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          were opposed to our policy to further it, but after the 1993 election Keating endorsed it. In the 1996 election they were in favour of enterprise bargaining, and after the election they are now apparently opposed to it. The reality is that they are not interested in the welfare of Australian workers. There is only one explanation for this shift, and that is that it is an opportunistic shift which they think might curry them with some favour, particularly with the ACTU.

         This government is determined and resolved.

When we were elected to government some 12 months ago, we found no less than three statutory authorities underpinned by Commonwealth legislation. We had the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, the Meat Research Corporation and, overarching them and telling them what to do, we had the Meat Industry Council, which of course had been the previous government's very inadequate response to their own Industry Commission's major inquiry into the problems in the red meat industry in Australia.

         It was unquestionably an awesomely cumbersome and inefficient set of arrangements. It was the subject of a great deal of criticism by producers feeling, of course, enormous economic strain with low prices about the lack of ownership, the lack of control and the lack of direction that they were able to exercise; and by processors as well, who, as heavy levy contributors, felt that they had no control over promotion campaigns that were of no relevance to them.

         So I initiated a major review of the whole set of arrangements last year. I received that towards the end of last year. After a very extensive consultation—and that was important because this is a historic opportunity to get something right that has been seriously

         The policy direction and leadership for the industry must be, should be and will be increasingly provided by the appropriate bodies, that is to say, the peak industry councils and their state affiliates—without the confusion of recent years.

There will be no more muddying of the waters, so long a cause of complaint.

He does not have the courage to come out and say to low income earners in Australia, `For 13 years we presided over an unfair system and we liked it, and we'd like it to continue.'

           —I understand the thrust of your question, but the further offence was committed on the way out of the chamber. So, while standing order 304A pertains in the sense that the member removes himself from the chamber forthwith, if he commits another offence of a more serious nature, I reserve the right to name him, which I did, and as he had not physically left the chamber at the time I think it is appropriate that he be involved in the vote.

         The one-third sale of Telstra will ensure the future success of Telstra after the introduction of the post-July 1997 regulatory environment and the entry of new international competitors. The partial privatisation will introduce much needed private sector disciplines of reporting and of resource allocation. The head of Telstra, Mr Frank Blount, said only last week that part-privatisation would make Telstra more flexible and efficient while planned incentive schemes for management and staff would drive motivation and deliver direct rewards for higher productivity.

Is this the same European Bank of Reconstruction and Development that in its first year of operation spent more money on tarting up its London headquarters with Carrara marble and sycamore panelling than it lent to the whole of central and eastern Europe, which is the purpose for which it was established? Is it the case, furthermore, that the Treasurer's advertised job specifications required, among other things, `a strong record of . . . leadership, judgment and management experience, as well as conceptual and analytical abilities of a high order'? Is his appointee the same Senator Jim Short who was forced to resign from the frontbench last year after what he himself described as `a careless oversight' in which he forgot that he had issued, while he was responsible for banking matters, a banking licence to ANZ Grindlays?

Lack of literacy skills amongst young Australians has been one of the most serious issues with which this government has had to deal after 13 years of Labor Party administration. As the member for Dunkley says, after 13 years of Labor, some 30 per cent of 14-year-olds could not read adequately and boys' reading capacity had actually declined quite significantly over this period.

         New research that I released last week showed that boys with very inadequate literacy skills had less than a 50 per cent chance of completing school and were more than twice as likely to be unemployed as those with good literacy skills. Lack of literacy skills does not cause unemployment, but it is very much related to the disadvantages which young people face in the labour market.

         After 13 years of drift on this very important matter, the government took the view that this situation could not be allowed to continue.

         I am pleased to inform the House that last Friday, in an agreement which some have hailed as historic, the Commonwealth agreed with all the states and territories that from 1998 every child commencing school will achieve a minimum standard of literacy and numeracy within four years. There was agreement that from 1998 students would be assessed against a national literacy standard or benchmark for reading, writing and spelling. Queensland and Western Australia have agreed to move from sampling measures to universal testing of students.

         All children entering school from 1998 will be assessed as soon as possible to determine their literacy level and teaching needs.

An important aspect of this agreement is that the states and territories have agreed to set aside out of their own resources the money necessary to provide the professional development for teachers to make sure that this goal is met. There will be national reporting of the results for each state and

         This historic agreement means that for the first time since Federation there is now a national commitment on the part of all Australian governments to provide all young Australians with the skills they need to provide a foundation for their later lives. Let me make it quite clear, and underline this, that this is part of the delivery of the government's promise to address the fundamental obstacles which are faced by young people in getting jobs and in getting on with their adult lives.

          Most importantly, though, last year on 13 December the Prime Minister announced that, after advice from a detailed committee, this government would proceed with the erection of the National Museum of Australia on the Acton Peninsula site. That is a decision that we are very proud to make. It was a decision that we made in the election that we would proceed. It is in contrast with what has happened when the opposition was in government. In every election for the last 12 years you raised the prospect of there being a National Museum of Australia. You never ever delivered on it. This government made an undertaking. It has delivered and it will deliver. I am now pleased to report that that agreement, so essential for its erection, has been completed.

          —In early 1995, we on this side of the House were quite pleased that Dr Wooldridge, the member for Chisholm, became the then opposition spokesman on health. He had a pretty reasonable reputation on our side of the House as a decent person. We were also quite pleased that he just happened to replace the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) as the then opposition spokesman on health. You can imagine why we thought it was an improvement when it went from Mrs Bishop to Dr Wooldridge.

         In the time that Dr Wooldridge has been the Minister for Health and Family Services in Australia, we have come to raise a number of questions about decisions that have been made. You can understand why John Howard—the current Prime Minister, the then Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong—picked Dr Wooldridge, the member for Chisholm, as their spokesman for health. The member for Bennelong was compromised on his policy on health care. He was already on the record as saying that he wanted to pull Medicare apart and that he thought bulk&amp;hyphen;billing was a rort. What he needed was someone warm and cuddly who could try to convince the Australian people that the Liberals could be trusted with health care. They thought that, in the member for Chisholm, they had the person who could do that. The honourable member had been dumped as the deputy leader for Peter Costello, the current Treasurer, but he had been resurrected by the member for Bennelong to try to convince Australians that the Liberals could be trusted with health care.

         I would like to begin this analysis by starting with public hospitals. It is our public hospitals that are the pressure point, the crisis point in our health care system today. Before the last election, the coalition made a number of undertakings on public hospitals. They said that they would maintain the federal funding for our public hospitals. The current Treasurer even said that he would provide a guarantee that there would be a net increase in health spending. Those were the promises made before the election—to maintain the spending on public hospitals, federal funding for public hospitals.

           The member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) might not know it but the government of which he is a member cut back federal funding for the states by a massive proportion. It was agreed by the states and the federal government at last year's Premiers Conference to cut over a billion and a half dollars. If you look at the current proportion of state spending that goes to public hospitals, you will see that the Premiers Conference cost the public hospital system at least $500 million.

I would encourage the member for Mallee, when his local public hospitals tell him that they are under pressure, to ring up Dr Wooldridge, ring up the minister for health.

          He also went on to attack some of the states as a whole. He was not prepared to attack Jeff Kennett and his own state in particular, but I will get on to that in a minute. He said that the states have `pulled out about a billion dollars over five years'. I happen to agree with the minister that some of the states, almost exclusively coalition state governments, have cut back state effort for public hospitals, and that is something that should be changed. That is why we welcome the fact that in New South Wales Andrew Refshauge has increased that state's funding for public hospitals by $600 million over the last few years.

           What we find even worse is that before the election, this minister made a guarantee to the people of Australia. He said that they were going to come up with a new you&amp;hyphen;beaut solution to every problem in our health care system, and it was called a tax break for private health insurance. Sure, it was going to cost $1.5 billion but he would make sure that there were no cutbacks in public spending to pay for this new incentive for private health insurance. He promised there would be no cutbacks in funding for public hospitals to fund the private health insurance initiative.

           What we find galling is that when you look at the cuts that were made last year, they have done exactly that: an $800 million cut in federal funding for public hospitals, a $400 million reduction in the Commonwealth dental health program, and a $500 million reduction in Commonwealth assistance for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. When you add those three together—your cutbacks in federal funding for public hospitals, the Commonwealth dental health program and the PBS—you made reductions that total $1.7 billion. That just happened to balance the very tax break that this minister is prepared to pay the private health insurance industry.

           The problem that the minister has is that everyone is walking away from this government's centrepiece of its health policy. We even get the minister's close personal friend, Jeff Kennett, saying that this private health insurance initiative is money down the drain. We get the AMA saying that this initiative is poorly targeted. We get the government's own inquiry saying that the government is spending $560 million a year to save only $240 million. They spend $560 million to save only $240 million. So when Jeff Kennett, the AMA, and your own inquiry all say that the centrepiece of your health policy is a failure, why aren't you prepared to look afresh at your measure? Why is there so much arrogance in your administration that you are not prepared to admit the fact that the $1.7 billion private health insurance initiative is a failure? Everyone else acknowledges it is a failure.

           The argument that they put to us before the election was that this tax break would lower
           <break page="2286" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            the cost of private health insurance and in some way that would increase the number of Australians with private health insurance and, therefore, reduce the pressure on our public hospitals. But what have we seen in the last 12 months? We have seen increased premiums and dramatic increases in the cost of private health insurance. Those increases have swallowed up most of the benefit of the tax rebate and, even before the rebate starts to be paid, we have got 800 people a day leaving private health insurance. We have got people leaving private health insurance because of all these changes. And if the minister will not listen to us—and you will not listen to Jeff Kennett and you will not listen to the AMA, and you will not listen to your own inquiry—then why don't you perhaps listen to your good friends at MBF, who produce this survey on private health insurance every quarter? Because even though the MBF is not considered to be exactly a strong supporter of Medicare and the views that this side of the House advocates, the MBF survey has shown in its latest research that the proportion of current fund members who say they will be encouraged by your tax rebate to maintain their private health insurance has fallen dramatically from 82 per cent to only 57 per cent.

           In an area like public health we had Australia ranking third worst in the Western world for completed childhood immunisation, something that has been confirmed as late as the September quarter last year. We had diabetes, in spite of numerous reports—the most recent being the rise and rise of diabetes—and something which is responsible for a very large proportion of Australia's health care costs, completely neglected. It was not one of the country's major health priorities. We had hepatitis C, about which there has been substantial publicity in recent days, completely ignored.

           The shadow minister makes much of 800 people a day leaving private health insurance. Yes, I am concerned about that. But what he did not say is how many were leaving prior to 1996—about 1,300 to 1,400 a day. So, in fact, the rate of decrease has halved over the last two quarters as people are waiting for the private health rebates to come in. That is important because there is a very large number of Australians, probably over 700,000, who have incomes under $20,000 a year and who have private health cover. What were you offering them? Nothing at the last election. Nothing, because they didn't fit your demographics of the voters you wanted to attract with your private health insurance bribes that you are now criticising us for trying to implement. But these rebates are fair because they cover a much higher proportion of the population.

         In the last budget we also saw the government make a massive attack on pensioners and their health. The government has made cuts to schemes such as the Commonwealth dental program, which the Labor government introduced. We heard National Party members tell us in this House year after year that that was a good scheme; in fact, I think Mr Deputy Speaker I recall you saying that. But what has happened to that now? After 1 January this year that has gone, as has gone the dental health of older Australians and the unemployed and people on health care cards.

         Before this scheme was brought in, the statistics of the Labor government supported the fact that the only access most people who were pensioners or on health care cards had to dental health was, in the main, to get their teeth out. In fact, that group of people had 87 per cent more extractions than any other part of the community. What has happened now? They are back to having to have their teeth out.

         The trouble is that none of these people even care.

         When we were in government, we decided that we should do something for hearing services. But what has the current government done about that? By introducing the Hearing Services Administration Bill 1997 and the Hearing Services and AGHS Reform Bill 1997, the current government will be denying many Australians the right to hear properly, for a paltry saving of $1 million—and it calls that a reform. This legislation will cut off 19&amp;hyphen; to 21-year-olds from access to Australian Hearing Services, and it will cut off about 30,000 seniors card holders from Australian Hearing Services. Thirty thousand people will no longer have access to the hearing service, for the saving of a lousy $1 million.

Low income earners especially will be hit by this measure, but they will not be the only ones.

When are they going to hand in their provider numbers? When are they going to do that? If they do not believe that ordinary young doctors should be able to get provider numbers, when is it going to be good enough for them to hand their's back. But, once again, we hear the minister falling back on his mealy&amp;hyphen;mouthed response when he says, `Of course, I could give my provider number back in, but then the law let's me reapply for it.'

         That is the government's policy: keep the public system poor, ensure that the poor do not get a fair go in this community, and look after their mates.

There are nine private hospitals in the electorate of Mallee covering 26 per cent of Victoria. The people in these isolated communities that support their private hospitals know jolly well that, without their private health insurance, they will lose their hospitals—because they cannot accept public patients.

Where was the Labor Party for 13 years when my 22 hospitals were struggling to attract Australian doctors? I have been in this parliament for four years. Thirteen of those hospitals have gone through the trauma of trying to attract a doctor in the last 13 years. Of those 13, nine of them had to get foreign doctors because the previous government did not have a comprehensive policy to address those issues. This government does. We are about making it happen.

All of a sudden, because there does not seem to be anything else to attract the attentions of the Labor Party, they want to raise this issue. Where were you for 13 years?

We are now talking about a participation rate of 33 per cent. That is why there are waiting queues in public hospitals in the big cities.

         Nor should they, for they have no experience when it comes to business. It is not their fault; it is just that when they take risks they would prefer to take risks with other people's money—other people's money being of course the taxpayers' money. We know about the Labor Party's misuse of public funds during their period of office, but that is really another debate for another time.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Life was tough for business under the Labor Party government. Under Labor, bankruptcies were at a record level of more than 14,000 in 1994-95. Under Labor, businesses struggled under the weight of compliance imposts. The Labor government imposed on them the fringe benefits tax, capital gains tax, the superannuation guarantee levy and the failed training levy, which is doing nothing to reduce the cost of compliance. Labor raised the provisional tax uplift factor.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Of course the Labor government did not cause all the resulting problems associated with this, but they contributed heavily to many of the social issues we are now faced with. The Labor Party put everything on the bankcard, on the cuff. Because they put it on the cuff, Australia almost lost its shirt. This includes the shocking figures for youth unemployment. Youth unemployment accounts for almost 45 per cent of the total unemployed and in Cowan it is an unacceptable 27 per cent. It is a terrible statistic that requires the whole community to support solutions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Mr Deputy Speaker, you are no doubt aware of the government's utmost desire to fix the terrible problems of Labor's legacy. This includes giving small businesses, which are the backbone of the nation's economy, the chance to grow and profit. Business is such a major factor of our society that, when it suffers, we all suffer.
        </para>
        <break page="2296" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          Having worked in a wide range of occupations myself, I have come to realise the importance of small business. Small businesses are often the ones affected by spiralling debts. The Western Australian Small Business Development Corporation was able to provide me with figures relating to bankruptcy in Western Australia which brought to light an interesting point. In our state, the lack of business ability has overtaken economic conditions as the No. 1 cause of business related bankruptcy in Western Australia. Economic conditions are still the major cause overall in Australia, at 26.4 per cent. Of the 275 Western Australian business related bankruptcies reported during the 1995-96 financial year, one-quarter were attributed to poor business skills. In some ways, it is encouraging to know that government policy is not the major—nor the sole—offender, although it is on a national level.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Yet, it is still a very disturbing fact that people continue to move into business without adequate training or a sound knowledge of precisely what they are getting into. Inappropriate business decisions can be made, leaving the way open for more problematic factors to feature, such as the accumulation of debts. Other significant causes relating to bankruptcy in Western Australia were economic conditions, at 22 per cent, and lack of capital, at 20 per cent.

         <para first-indent="16">
          In 1995-96, bankruptcies directly caused by business activity accounted for approximately 15 per cent of all Western Australian bankruptcies and 27.5 per cent of all Australian bankruptcies. Out of all the states and territories, Western Australia was one of only three to experience a decrease in business related bankruptcies. Furthermore, Western Australia had the second highest fall after the Northern Territory.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It should be noted that a business related bankruptcy does not necessarily equate to an actual business closure. Even though Western Australia's level of bankruptcies has been increasing since 1994-95, this is due to an increase in non-business bankruptcies. Obviously, it is apparent that a bankruptcy does not necessarily have to follow liquidation. A business or a company can signify many

           different things and bankruptcy or liquidation are just two stages of this. I believe the world of the small businessperson is about to enter a new positive phase under this government, with various initiatives either already in place or not far around the corner which will make the life of the small businessperson much easier.

          The government's small business initiatives include reducing the provisional tax uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent, cutting red tape, delivering capital gains rollover relief, moving to scrap Labor's unfair dismissal laws and arresting the slide of budget deficits. All these will provide a small business with the certainty and support it needs. This positive feeling does seem to be supported not only by government initiatives but also by various studies published by the Western Australian Small Business Development Corporation. According to this organisation, using statistics from the ABS, over the last decade the number of small businesses in Western Australia has increased at an average annual rate of 4.8 per cent, the highest annual growth rate of all states and territories. The corporation also published results of a small business opinion survey, which found that:

          An example of the renewed vigour in small business was recently brought to my attention by a company in my electorate which has become a virtual runaway success.

          This business makes quality, very large and very expensive signs. That would seem fairly trivial, but these signs are quite spectacular. I saw a recent example of this when I stopped to view their latest project, the distinctive world sphere sign that sits on the top of Planet Hollywood restaurants in Australia and in Asia. This particular sign has a six&amp;hyphen;metre sphere and 2.4&amp;hyphen;metre&amp;hyphen;high lettering. The sign is destined for the Planet Hollywood in Melbourne, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, so when you visit that august place of eating you will be able to see it. It was actually made in

          Perhaps to my eastern states colleagues this may not seem terribly remarkable. But to a Western Australian this signifies a great achievement: that a local company is able to compete not only in the national marketplace but also in the international marketplace. This is in consideration of the fact that in many senses we have a few natural disadvantages in Western Australia that can often stand in the way of competitiveness. The eastern seaboard does not need to consider such factors as the isolation and distance factors. This relatively small company, called Signlight Neon, is able to employ up to 50 local people to carry out its operation, which obviously has advantages for the economy.

          Although there is every indication that this business will continue to do well, it is not the only business that is doing well within Western Australia. Small business is obviously very important to Western Australia. It is very important for Australia. Business will still be tough to do in Australia, but it will be much easier under the coalition's policy and initiatives than it was in Australia under the Labor Party. This bill is supported by all those that have an interest in any of the matters associated with the bill. It has no financial impact on the government. It is a bill which will help business and I commend it to the House.

It reflects the proceedings of seminars, which enabled the members of the committee to engage in discussions with those two respective office&amp;hyphen;bearers on issues that are of mutual concern.

I would also like to thank the staff of the joint standing committee, in particular Margaret Swieringa and the staff of the human rights subcommittee who organised this very successful seminar program and drafted the report.

          The report itself embraces some five resolutions and I want to address those briefly. The first two essentially are matters that I am delighted to be able to report to the House, in part because my wife, through the work she has undertaken with the National Association for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect, NAPCAN, has been advocating these measures for some considerable time.

          The first recommendation was that the Australian government should introduce legislation to incorporate the Convention on the Rights of the Child into domestic laws. Members will be aware of the Teoh case and of the implications of that. While this is not an alternative, it certainly appears to us to be
          <break page="2298" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           essential that, having subscribed to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, we should now adopt it into domestic law. The repetition of events such as those that occurred in the Teoh case should not then recur.

          The second recommendation suggested that the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) investigate the feasibility of establishing a children's commissioner within the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. That and the last resolution, which is within the Office of the Ombudsman, both identify particular problems that emerged from the seminar. There should be a children's commissioner. I think most members of this House would concur. There have been far too many cases of child abuse and far too many cases of sexual abuse; far too many cases where children have been the victims. The ways by which they can best be represented are matters not just of state jurisdiction but I think very much matters for the federal parliament and I very strongly recommend to the government that they take up that second recommendation of this seminar's report.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The next three recommendations relate to the Office of the Ombudsman. I have little doubt that my colleague the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) will identify his concerns with respect to item 3, so I will pass that by. But one of my concerns about the Ombudsman has always been that an Ombudsman should never replace the work undertaken by senators and members of this place. I have always felt that people who go to the Ombudsman should recognise the work that is undertaken by federal members, and in many instances that work could obviate the work that otherwise goes to the Ombudsman. We do have a responsibility to our constituents and I think people need to recognise that.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I want to identify recommendations 4 and 5 very briefly. We think a parliamentary review of the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman needs to be done to look at the resources of the office to make sure it is adequate for the purpose. The fifth recommendation is that we think there are particular problems for indigenous Australians. We do not think that the Ombudsman's office is
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           adequately equipped to pursue those problems at the moment.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We think there does need to be, therefore, a specific person in the office of the Ombudsman to fulfil that function. We have suggested that an indigenous Australian should be appointed to the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman to ensure that they can undertake within the Ombudsman's office that task. In saying that, I also hope that individual member's offices employ indigenous people, because that too provides another vehicle by which you can relieve these obvious difficulties that occur so often at a time when we are aware of too many racist problems and when there are quite real difficulties in many parts of Australia.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Both HREOC and the Ombudsman have confronted racism. They see it as a significant issue. Therefore, I think it needs to be pursued. There is no doubt that, if we take note of that recommendation with respect to the staff of the Ombudsman, it would fill the notable gap. I therefore commend this report to the parliament and suggest to members and to the government that these five recommendations are matters of which they should take serious note.

          There is no doubt that the two officers who were part of this seminar—that is, the Human Rights and Equal Community Commissioner and the Commonwealth Ombudsman—form a very important part of the Australian fabric of human rights. I think it is worth noting that Sir Ronald Wilson now completes his seven-year term as chairman of the human rights commission. This has followed a very distinguished career on the High Court. I often think it would be nice if we as a parliament were able to acknowledge the contribution of outstanding Australians. I certainly believe that he falls into that category.

          I support with the same vigour the first two recommendations of this report but, as the right honourable member for New England says, I do have a particular interest in the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. It was very clear when the acting chairman, the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), had the Ombudsman before him that indeed ordinary Australians are suffering as a result of cutbacks to the office. I note that in the last couple of weeks of the last sittings of parliament we put through legislation to establish the Auditor-General as an independent officer of the parliament.

         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          <para first-indent="16">
           It is really important that the consideration that has been extended to the Auditor-General be extended to the Ombudsman's office. We must understand that every time we restrict the budget of the Ombudsman, as we did in the last budget, we effectively limit ordinary Australians' ability to contest administrative decisions on a no-fee basis. We also avoid the opportunity for the Ombudsman to scrutinise administration rather than just deal with individual cases and to make recommendations to departments to fix systematic errors of administration. So those changes benefit a whole range of ordinary Australians.

           It is also important to note that a group of people who are victims of a lack of jurisdiction of the Ombudsman are small business people. They do not have an ability to actually take their cases to the Ombudsman, because much of Commonwealth work is now being outsourced—but I do not want to enter into that debate. The Ombudsman has detailed in successive reports the impact this is having on small business. I sincerely hope that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet will expedite the legislation that will fix this want of jurisdiction. As I understand it, it is neither disagreed with nor controversial.

           We recommend there be a parliamentary review of the Ombudsman's office. I sincerely hope that we will have that opportunity.

           Last but not least I would like to concur with the right honourable member for New England that there is no better person than a dedicated member of parliament across a problem capable of providing solutions to ordinary people. I think no matter how good or how effective an Ombudsman's office is, it will never replace the role of members of parliament. Regrettably, from time to time the executive constricts the ability of members of parliament to seek redress on behalf of their constituents. I think that is something to be regretted. I commend the report to the House.

          Firstly, I will comment very briefly on the matters concerning the Ombudsman, which the previous speaker, the member for Chifley (Mr Price), covered pretty comprehensively. The key point to make is that, obviously, we are very keen to see the Ombudsman retain the independence of that office. That is probably the most fundamental matter that our committee is concerned about and, therefore, the recommendations that we have made in this report are very much directed in that sense to making sure that that independence is maintained.

          Sir Ronald Wilson gave the committee some very harrowing accounts of some of the evidence that was coming forward in his inquiry into the stolen children—the Aboriginal children taken away from their parents.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I think that HREOC report is a very important report because, if you do not understand the significance of the impact on many indigenous people of having been taken away from their parents or having had their children taken away from them, then you do not understand the root cause of many of the problems of disadvantage today. If you do not understand the causes, then you cannot fix the problems that are manifest today. So I think that is a very important report.

          I would also like to comment very briefly on some of the comments made by Chris Sidoti in the human rights area. Chris Sidoti, apart from the matters that we have explicitly covered in this report, also talks about some of the regional matters of human rights. We should not lose sight of the fact that the human rights movement in this country has outstanding international standing. Certainly, we look at areas within Australia where there might be some deficiencies and where there are on occasions some deficiencies, but equally we do have a good international record. We are making a major contribution to human rights in the area. We often need to
          <break page="2301" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           make that contribution because the human rights records of some countries in our area are less than perfect by a long way.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Chris Sidoti and others have been very instrumental in setting up regional human rights mechanisms. The chair of the joint standing committee, the member for New England (Mr Sinclair), last July attended a regional forum in Darwin. In a couple of weeks time, in early April, there is to be the next regional forum in New Delhi.

          —Firstly, I would like to address a number of issues raised by the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), the previous speaker in this debate on the Corporations Law Amendment Bill 1996. The member expressed concern regarding the number of small businesses going into bankruptcy. Of course that is a matter for regret and it is indeed a matter for concern that that number is increasing.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The member for Cowan referred to factors which he believed played a role in that occurring. But what he did not refer to and did not acknowledge—and this is common to just about all government members—is the dramatic and drastic effect of the government ripping such a massive amount of money out of the economy. It is literally taking customers away from small business doorsteps and has really caused severe problems for not only small business but the economy generally.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In addition, the failure of the government to announce policies to address unemployment has caused fear and insecurity. Far from people feeling relaxed and comfortable, as was promised in the last election, there is real apprehension out there. It is a very bold person who is going to commit themselves to a major purchase such as a car or a house when there are such feelings of insecurity. Any car dealer and any real estate agent would tell you the consequences of that fear of unemployment. If you add to that an absence of any policy in relation to developing industry in this nation, you get a bleak picture.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The member for Cowan also suggested that the government had the means to address this small business decline and referred to the repeal of the former government's unfair dismissal laws. The facts of the matter are that, if that is the best the government has in their armoury, we are all in real trouble. We are all in big trouble because the government itself does not understand its own legislation
         <break page="2302" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          and it certainly did not understand the former government's legislation.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For instance, on about four occasions the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) has stood up and berated the former government for relying on International Labour Organisation convention No. 158, which dealt with the concept of unfair dismissal. It seems the minister does not appreciate that the relevant part of his legislation dealing with unfair dismissal specifically has, as one of its objects, furthering the International Labour Organisation Convention. That is defined in section 4 of the act as being set out in schedule 10. All the minister has to do is look at schedule 10 which is set out in the act itself to see ILO convention No. 158.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So, if the minister says departure from the former government's policies and departure from ILO convention No. 158 are going to resurrect small business and employment in this country, we all, as I said before, have real problems on our hands. The only repercussion that the government's legislation has had, by introducing a few hurdles and somersaults that applicants in unfair dismissal cases have to go through, is to shift unfair dismissal cases into the state sphere. My information is that in the last two months in New South Wales we have seen a 200 per cent increase, for instance, in unfair dismissal cases. If the government thinks it has created some sort of new order, it is sadly mistaken. I suggest with respect to the minister that he obtains a briefing from the experts in his own department.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I have spent my time so far addressing and replying to points raised by the member for Cowan. One final point that he raised which I would like to address is his praise of the concept of risk undertaken by business entrepreneurs. What I would like to emphasise is that risk is not only taken by business entrepreneurs. Every day workers get on the train or get in their car and go to work and face risk in industrial accidents. Any solicitor's office around this country is likely to have several—indeed, many will have scores of—quite serious, and in some cases, horrifying injuries sustained by workers.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In some industries, it is still the case that a spouse waiting at home does not know wheth
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          er their partner is going to come home with a serious injury. Mining is one of those industries. Indeed, although they have been damned and condemned by this government, the waterfront is still a very dangerous industry. Workers who go along there face considerable risks. So my point in this matter is that the government should really appreciate that economic growth in this country is not solely generated by the activities of entrepreneurs. Rather, it is literally built from the sweat and, regrettably in many cases, the blood and flesh of Australian workers.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I want to move on to the topic of the bill itself. In 1992, the Corporate Law Reform Act introduced a new system for the voluntary administration of companies. It allowed a system whereby an independent administrator could be appointed to take over the charge of a company for a limited period of time. The thrust of that bill was significant because it was one based on mutual cooperation between the debtor company and the creditors and the independent administrator.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The scheme allowed the company to operate under a deed of company agreement. That deed was one that essentially bound all parties—that is, the company, the creditors and the administrators—as to the course of action to apply in dealing with the company's affairs. It specifically precluded another creditor from claiming some sort of priority over other creditors by acting inconsistently with that company deed of arrangement.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In many circumstances it was acknowledged that the best people to run the company were the directors themselves—obviously because of their contacts and their industry knowledge. The voluntary administration allowed in the 1992 act certainly facilitated that, providing that the administrator generally oversaw the operations. In other words, it enabled a company facing difficulty to request the appointment of an administrator as an alternative to the old sudden death system of appointing a receiver. That was a significant and welcome advance.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Indeed, that was a factual background in the now famous Crawford House case. The issue in that case was whether debts incurred by a company still under the control of the direc
         <break page="2303" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
          tors, but in a situation of voluntary administration, received the same priority as that which normally attaches to debts incurred by an administrator, where the administrator is left in control of the business.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Usually, it is that later case that is adopted whereby the administrator himself is in control and any debt incurred by his actions receives priority at the end of the winding up. But the situation in the Crawford House case where the directors were left in control is still not uncommon and in many cases desirable. Obviously, it is more likely to occur if the creditors regard the directors as reputable and competent. In many situations, if not most, they are going to be the most able to deal with the company's affairs because of their long history of commercial relationships and their knowledge of the industry generally.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In many instances, the creditors of the company will cooperate in that situation because they have a vested interest in the company's survival. Because of the interactions in commercial relationships, many creditors will be suppliers or purchasers of the particular business. If they lose a link in their trading network, obviously their businesses are going to be the worse for it. So there is often a vested interest in creditors cooperating and trying to save one of their trading partners. I think it is fundamentally important that creditors so cooperating to save one of their trading partners not be penalised. This bill, it must be said, substantially addresses that issue.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I said before, normally, if the administrator was left in control of a company, the debts incurred by that administrator would get priority. This bill essentially ensures that debts incurred by the company under the ultimate control of the administrator, but through the actions of the directors, receive that same priority.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Justice Cohen in the Crawford House case itself indicated that his conclusions as to the direction that the law took him were regrettable. For instance, in his opening address in the judgment, he said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The conclusion I have come to, if correct, can result in creditors of a number of companies which have entered into deeds of company arrangement
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          having no fund upon which to claim for payment of their debts if the company should in due course be wound up. This would be a matter of serious consequence for the commercial community.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         Unfortunately, he felt compelled to arrive at that conclusion. He summarises the effect of his conclusion later in the judgment with these words:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         This results in the regrettable situation that there appears to be no right in those who became creditors of the company or whose debts were increased during the period of the operation of the deed, to prove for those debts or increased debts. This would not seem to be a result intended by the legislature.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         Later on, he said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         It is not satisfactory that the position should be left as it is and it requires urgent legislative amendment.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         In fact, the former government had proposed a bill very similar to this and the opposition hence supports the government's actions. It is probably desirable that the legislation moves in a direction which encourages administrators to leave directors under control. While most administrators are competent and honourable, the facts of the matter are that they charge their time at professional rates and often that hourly rate of somewhere between $200 and $400 an hour is the final straw which causes the company to go under.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I recall a recent speech by the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) in which he gave an account of a business in his electorate which faced a very similar situation where an administrator took over control of that company. It seemed inevitable from that day forward that the company was going to die a slow death, whereas if the directors had been left in control there would have been every chance that the company would have survived.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is highly desirable that the legislation does as this bill does: that is, it does not cause an impediment to directors being left in control of a company facing financial difficulties. If the company can survive, employees of the company are going to benefit—not to mention their families. As I have said, company insolvency is often contagious, so any arresting of the decline of a business partner can keep secure its trading partners.
        </para>
        <break page="2304" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          In summary, there are very sound public policy reasons for justifying the legislation. I note the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) in his second reading speech has expressed that the only reservation is one of addressing the question of priorities generally. We, in the opposition, would agree with that. It is appropriate that the issue of priorities in company receiverships and bankruptcy be addressed. I note the government is to refer that question to the companies and securities advisory committee. The opposition would most certainly endorse that occurring. From my own personal point of view, I think there should be some rewards attached to trading partners taking a risk to try to keep their associated company or trading partner alive.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I note that this bill is topical in another sense. It was addressed by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) in the context of announcements by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) the week before last. The Treasurer indicated the government's intention to review corporate law generally. He said that he intended to review the law to give it a stronger economic focus so that businesses could undertake their businesses with low transactional costs and that, as a starting point, he would be addressing the Australian accounting standards boards.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I also note the Treasurer's comments that he regarded the law as too proscriptive and too legalistic. In the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Australian Financial Review
          </emphasis>
          on 20 November 1996, he is reported as favouring a system of self&amp;hyphen;regulation of a scheme of business ethics, which he believes will promote investor confidence. I must say that I have concerns about a voluntary code of ethics. I do not think, from my experience, that it will go anywhere near addressing a number of concerns that shareholders have. They still have concerns that there is inadequate reporting in respect of the foreign activities of companies. Even though they receive balance sheets regarding local activities, there is usually very scant information provided as to the foreign activities of companies of which they are shareholders.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Similarly, the procedures for the reporting of related party transactions are very inad

           equate. Equally, there is a generally inadequate methodology in the Corporations Law regarding the election or appointment of directors. While substantial work has been done since the days of Clyde Cameron in 1972 to ensure the democratic election of trade unions, very little of that seems to have been translated into the Corporations Law. It is one area where there is a severe lack of democratic control. That is something which is inevitably going to deter ordinary Australians from investing in the share market and buying shares.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          News Corporation is a case in point. For instance, a recent article reported on the techniques of News Corporation in selecting its board members. That is achieved by one of News Corporation's in&amp;hyphen;house lawyers going around with another director and virtually head&amp;hyphen;hunting the board members. I should say that the board members are the government, as opposed to the chief executives of the company. If one anticipated that occurring in respect of a trade union, in which the members of the committee of management were not democratically elected, there would be a public outcry.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The government must be alive to the fact that the Australian public is becoming increasingly educated in the affairs of corporate investment and the activities of corporations. Much more information is being communicated to them through the general press, business papers and, of course, electronic communications. The Australian people are in a position to judge, and judge appropriately, the standard and quality of directors, and this government should urgently look at taking steps to encourage the democratic participation of shareholders in the composition of boards of companies.

          —in reply—I want to sum up the debate, and thank the four or five speakers who have participated in it. I will go back over a few of the key points of the Corporations Law Amendment Bill 1996. This legislation has come about due to the voluntary administration scheme, in part 5.3A of the Corporations Law, becoming an increasingly
          <break page="2305" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           popular means of dealing with companies that find themselves in financial difficulties. The objective of that scheme was to provide a swift, flexible and inexpensive insolvency procedure which focused on saving the company's business, rather than the company, and preserving employment prospects. So it is an important aspect in the situation in which companies find themselves in difficulty that we make sure that it is a straightforward process. This amendment is about clarifying that process and making sure that there is security for those people who attempt to ensure that that company keeps going.

        <para first-indent="16">
         A large proportion of companies using the scheme are successfully negotiating deeds of company arrangement with their creditors, allowing them to continue with their businesses rather than going into immediate liquidation. It is important that, while those companies are under a deed of company arrangement, creditors are not discouraged from supporting them by trading with them.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill will resolve an anomaly in the legislation whereby creditors who trade with a company under a deed are at risk of losing any claim on the assets of the company if the company should subsequently go into liquidation. The bill will render those debts provable in a subsequent liquidation. The bill has the support of the Law Council of Australia and the Insolvency Practitioners Association of Australia. The related issue of whether the debts should not only be provable, but should also receive priority treatment, is a more contentious one, though not as urgent. In this regard, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has referred the issue to the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee, which is reviewing the operation of the voluntary administration scheme as a whole.

          —This Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997 amends three acts of this parliament, two of them substantively and one in a technical way. The two substantive sets of amendments I will deal with briefly. The first set relates to the Airports Act 1996. There are a variety of amendments to this act which are essentially tidying up amendments to various oversights or difficulties which have emerged from that legislation, which was passed roughly six months ago by this parliament.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Some examples of the amendments are: the adoption of a tiered process with respect to offences and penalties for environmental matters, which ensures that there is, in a sense, a cascading sequence of penalties that can be applied so that people can be found guilty of and penalised for lesser offences rather than greater offences; and an obligation to be imposed on all persons to comply with an airport environmental strategy rather than just to be imposed on the airport operator. This fixes an oversight in the original legislation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One rather spectacular amendment imposes an obligation upon an airport lessee to operate the land as an airport. It is rather surprising that was not in the original legislation. Other amendments are: a requirement of consultation with respect to major changes to airport master plans be undertaken in line with the original requirements with respect to consultation; a requirement upon the minister to extend consultation beyond the operator for the exercise of certain powers under the legislation; prohibition on subleasing an airport through means of trusts to avoid the
         <break page="2306" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          act and guidelines on how the airport should be operated.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are a variety of other specific amendments in this section which I will not go into in detail but all of them are essentially tidying up provisions to facilitate the operation of the Airports Act. The opposition strongly supports these provisions. It does illustrate—an observation I have made a couple of times in the past in the debate on the sale of the airport leases—that there will be a substantial learning process with respect to the airport sales. Already I think some problems and issues are emerging that were not necessarily conceived at the time the former government was dealing with these issues and have not as yet been addressed by this government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I cite as examples the question of future investment and, in particular, the distinction between investment in non&amp;hyphen;aeronautical airport activities and aeronautical activities, which may lead to an imbalance between the two, and the question of price capping and concerns that I have indicated about the likely future effectiveness of the price capping arrangements that have been adopted. These are just a couple of examples of problems that I think we will have to deal with in the future. It will be to some extent a learning process and I suspect there will probably be other difficulties that emerge as well. The fact that we are already amending legislation does indicate that that is going to be the case.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second substantive set of amendments relate to the Air Navigation Act, one of which is to establish a register of encumbered aircraft so that prospective buyers of aircraft can have some information about any legal encumbrance that may exist on the aircraft. I understand that there are a variety of circumstances where parts of aircraft can be encumbered as collateral for loans and the like and it can actually be quite confusing and difficult for prospective buyers. The proposal to establish a register has the support of the opposition. It does not entail any legal implications with respect to the relationship between buyer and seller, but it should facilitate the process of purchase of aircraft and make things a bit easier for prospective buyers and therefore has our support.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          The second section, which the opposition does have a couple of amendments to, relates to the approval of international charter operations by the secretary to the department. Under the previous provision, the essential criterion which applied in this case was `the need to provide reasonable protection' to the Australian aviation industry. Under the new criteria proposed by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) in the amending act, there is a list of concerns which the secretary to the department must take into account prior to granting an approval for an international charter. These include such matters as consumer needs, promotion of trade and tourism, aviation security, the location of the services concerned, international relations generally and the criteria that are followed by the International Air Services Commission.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The opposition does have a slight concern, albeit a substantive concern, about the drift of this particular set of legislative amendments, the concern being that there is a gradual shift occurring under the new government towards an open skies policy. The opposition does not oppose the concept of broadening the criteria which govern the secretary's decision with respect to granting international charter rights but in the context of some other decisions that the government has taken we do wish to register our concern at the gradual drift in aviation policy which may ultimately be to the significant detriment of our two major national operators, Ansett and Qantas, and the Australian industry more generally.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I indicate that I will be moving two amendments circulated in my name, the second of which is actually a condition or contingent amendment. There are two options there depending on whether or not the first is adopted. I will not go into the detail of those amendments. That will be dealt with in the consideration in detail stage. I will flag what they relate to.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The first of these amendments would add an extra criterion to the government's proposed new set of criteria for the secretary to the department to consider and that would be `employment and investment in, and general development of, the Australian Aviation
          <break page="2307" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           industry'. The second of these amendments would be to apply the same set of criteria to any decision by the secretary to the department to exempt a particular charter operation from the requirement to be given approval. That power is currently in the amending legislation. The amendment that we will be moving would seek to ensure that in exercising that power the secretary would take note of the same issues that he would have to take note of in exercising his power to grant an approval.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I understand that the government's intention with respect to this power of exemption is that it would relate to, in a sense, one&amp;hyphen;off charters to unusual or very small or low key situations. Certainly, we do not object to the intent of what the government seeks to do with the legislation. Our concern is that the power that is granted to the secretary to exempt is a fair bit broader than that intent applies.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As I have indicated, the opposition does have some concern about what we would see as a drift towards a more open skies policy. Clearly there is a difficult balance to be maintained here. Competition in international aviation needs to be fostered, but at the same time we need to make sure that there is a viable Australian international aviation industry.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We are very proud of the fact that we have an internationally renowned carrier in Qantas, which has a worldwide, top&amp;hyphen;class reputation. Clearly, we want to make sure that Qantas can continue to operate and function in a similar way to the way in which it has historically functioned. We can also take great pride in the fact that we now have a second Australian international airline in Ansett. We look forward to Ansett's share of the total market increasing—preferably not at the expense of Qantas but at the expense of other international operators.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I will quote from a press statement the minister put out on 10 June of last year relating to charter flights, particularly in the freight area, to indicate the general drift that is occurring in policy. The minister stated in this press release that freight was being neglected in favour of passenger demand and
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           that the government would seek to `bilaterally negotiate significant increases in dedicated capacity for air freight services in key export markets' and that `an APEC model air freight agreement for greater liberalisation of air freight operations' would be sought to be developed and the government would seek to `liberalise the freight&amp;hyphen;charter approval process for carriage of Australian exports'. Finally, he stated:
          </break>
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          Throughout the world, passenger charter services have served to stimulate international tourism growth by providing seasonal services on many routes not normally served by scheduled carriers, at prices affordable to tourists who would not otherwise travel internationally.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          As you would recollect, Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile, having chaired the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform which did a study on air freight recently, the lack of available freight charter capacity is not really a major problem in the total picture of Australian airfreight. Clearly there are issues associated with capacity, but the findings of that committee, which you chaired, were that there are numerous problems that appear all along the chain and there is no great single dominant problem. There are a number of problems with our airfreight situation.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Contrary to popular myth, Australian exporters actually get access to pretty good airfreight prices, primarily because they are cross&amp;hyphen;subsidised by passenger tickets, because the vast bulk of the airfreight currently goes out in passenger planes. I do not necessarily agree with the minister's comments on freight charters.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          With respect to tourism, the statement the minister made in that media statement is in fact broadly accurate, but it fails to recognise that we have a slight backloading problem in Australia. Tourist charters that operate, for example, between Britain and Spain clearly have a fair potential to operate with substantial passenger loads in both directions. One of the difficulties with tourism charters to Australia is that in many instances it is very difficult to maintain the number of people going from Australia with sufficient regularity to make the charters economically viable.  Clearly, ultimately people have to go back to
          <break page="2308" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           where they came from, but the time they wish to spend in a particular place is going to vary and the volume you are able to get in a charter operation is going to depend on the amount of demand for travel in both directions. That will be a significant influencing factor. I question just how strong that is likely to be in Australia. That may be a significant restraining factor.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I understand that today the government will vote against the amendments we will be moving but is going to give some further consideration to them subsequently. The minister may wish to elaborate on this in his closing remarks. On that understanding, we will not seek to divide on the two amendments we will be moving. The matter can perhaps be revisited when the bill gets to the Senate.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I conclude with a reference to my concern about the government's general approach to transport and transport policy; that is, transport in essence is primarily a cost and little else. It is more than just a cost. Yes, it is an important cost consideration for the vast bulk of the Australian economy in a direct or indirect way, but transport, particularly in aviation, is also a major export earner. Qantas is our third largest individual export earner. Ansett is now earning substantial export dollars directly as an international carrier and, as I indicated before, hopefully will increase its share.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Qantas's market share is now below 40 per cent of the Australian international aviation market. I certainly hope that it does not go much below that. I think our international aviation market, where Australian operators supply roughly half of the total, is probably about right and has a reasonable balance. It is important that we do not alter our policy framework in a way that might derogate from that.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Clearly, the proposals the government are enacting are not likely to have a sudden, direct impact on the viability of Ansett and Qantas, but it is important to ensure that we do not, through the back door, introduce competition that is outside International Air Services Commission agreements and which might undermine the economic viability of
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           Qantas and Ansett services and might undermine their capacity to compete with the other international operators that ply the Australian routes.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The concern I have is that the government, in pursuing its general direction in this area, is focused excessively on the issue of cost, which is important, and is failing to focus on the importance of maintaining a viable Australian international aviation industry which, as I have indicated, delivers very substantial export dollars and a large number of generally highly skilled and generally well&amp;hyphen;paid jobs to Australians.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Efficiency is important, but so is the capacity to participate in our society, to have employment, to earn a reasonable income and to have a reasonably skilled job. I think there will be a role for additional foreign charter flights in the future in the areas of freight and tourism. It is reasonable to anticipate that that section of the aviation industry in Australia will probably expand. The minister and I may differ a bit on precisely how large such an expansion might be. But, as I have indicated, I think it is very important that any such expansion not undermine to a significant extent the viability of our existing international carriers.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is also important to ensure that safety concerns are protected. CASA has undertaken recently a program of enhanced safety examination of foreign carriers. We have a lot of foreign carriers coming to Australia from small countries. Sometimes there are question marks over the maintenance regimes, in particular, that apply to the aircraft and sometimes there are question marks over the age of the aircraft—things of that nature. It is very important that we maintain our overall safety profile and performance. Increasing the access of foreign charter flights to Australia is one way that safety could conceivably be undermined.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I would be interested to know what discussions the minister has had with Qantas and Ansett about this legislation. I hope that he has consulted with them about it and that he has had some discussions with them, because these issues do ultimately affect their viability  and capacity to operate as major Australian
          <break page="2309" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           operators and as an important Australian industry.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The opposition's amendments are not designed to protect the Australian industry and not even designed to be as strong as the previous criteria were. They are simply to ensure that, in the criteria before the secretary of the department in making decisions about granting international charter approvals, there is some reference to the interests of Australian industry. At the moment it is virtually the only thing, the one aspect, that is left out. All of the other issues that have been put in the draft legislation are entirely legitimate and perfectly reasonable to consider. The one thing that is missing is the potential impact on Australian industry.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          If that change is made to the legislation, we feel that it is entirely supportable and worth while. As I have indicated—I will wait to hear what the minister has to say in reply—on the understanding that the issues will be considered further in the context of the matter being in the Senate at the end of this week, we will put up the amendments and, on the assumption they will be voted against by the government in the House today, will not seek to divide in the hope that we can reach some agreement in the context of the Senate debate.

          —I rise in support of the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997. A lot of legislation passes through both houses of parliament. From time to time a particular piece of legislative framework is introduced that creates some interest for members. I think it would be very difficult for a member to try to cover all the legislation that is introduced into this House. This bill, I believe, does have a great deal of interest for those living in the Northern Territory and in remote areas of Australia, especially those with very good tourism destinations.

         As I understand from reading a press release today, the government is currently negotiating to lease airports in Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth to interested parties. Also, the government has recently announced that the evaluation and short&amp;hyphen;listing of stage 2 bids for long-term leases of these airports are complete. The government is offering 50-year
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          leases, with options being available for a further 49 years. Nine consortia were short&amp;hyphen;listed in October last year and have lodged bids for one or more of the phase 1 airports. Six consortia have been short&amp;hyphen;listed to proceed to the next phase of the process, and they will be required to lodge revised offers by the middle of April this year. It is envisaged that the sales will be completed before 30 June 1997.

         The press release which has been issued by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) in the last 24 hours would certainly alleviate the concern expressed by the shadow minister for transport, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). He thought there were some hiccups and that the government was having a few problems. My understanding is that the minister has made a statement that the sales should be completed before the end of this financial year.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The main purpose of the bill is to amend the Airports Act 1996 and will consequently allow for certainty for new and existing airport operators and ensure that the Commonwealth has a clear regulatory framework for the operation of these airports. The bill also amends the Air Navigation Act 1920 relating to charter operations of which I will speak later.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill includes provisions to ensure a better standard of environmental protection at Australia's airports. These provisions include: variable penalties for breaches of environmental standards; providing new offences for deliberate harm to the environment; power to allow pre-existing contamination to be addressed; prohibiting subleasing to trusts; requiring public comment on proposed plans or developments to be sought by the lessees of airports, and ministerial approval; and a statutory requirement that airport lessees actually use the airport site as an airport.

         The federal Department of Transport and the office of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development have been working on the development of regulations governing the environmental standards required, in consultation with Environment Australia. These regulations will ensure that the responsibility

         Section 130 of the act already stipulates that the airport lessee take responsibility for the monitoring of any environmental issues caused by the airport. This will now be expanded to include all other persons undertaking an activity at an airport site to take the responsibility of ensuring that the environment is protected. It also authorises the Commonwealth to set limits of aircraft movements at airports, and it allows for public reporting by the ACCC on competition issues like pricing and practices at airports.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There has been some difference of opinion between the states and territories on the after&amp;hyphen;sale lease powers that the Commonwealth will have. This is reflected in the state&amp;hyphen;territory opposition to the land planning powers, building authority function and environmental authority function that the Commonwealth will have. I know that the Northern Territory government has some concerns about the balance of power between the different levels of government post FAC. It is my hope that the Commonwealth will delegate some of those responsibilities to the territory government, which has an excellent record in that area.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill prohibits the subleasing of airports to trusts on the grounds that it may be a way of sidestepping the ownership provisions of the act. Therefore, the amendments will prohibit a trust being declared as a sublease and, consequently, prohibit the separation of the legal and beneficial interests of a lessee.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill will also amend the Air Navigation Act 1920 in order to facilitate quick approvals for international charter flights, establish a register of charter aircraft pursuant to the provisions of the act and add some clarification to technical details.

         As I have mentioned, I have a special interest in charter flight operations. So I welcomed the government's decision last June to move towards a more liberalised and flexible international air charter market. This led to the release of updated charter guidelines for charter flights in Australia. Charter

         When one thinks about Alice Springs being the centre part of central Australia and Uluru being a much sought after destination, there is absolutely no reason why international charter operators could not fly into central Australia. Alice Springs could become a hub which would then support Qantas and Ansett domestically by having a two-hour flight to Sydney, a two-hour flight to Brisbane, a one hour and 50 minute flight to Adelaide and a two&amp;hyphen;hour flight to Perth.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The shadow minister for transport was concerned that there may have been a restraining factor. I think it would make sense if Concord were to fly into central Australia because there are no environmental requirements and no curfew. That may become a very interesting factor in terms of the development of tourism in central Australia. Other operators in the Asian region would still have the capacity of discharging passengers in central Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Those passengers could be flown to other destinations, brought back into central Australia and flown back on the charter on which they originally started. That certainly has some interesting prospects. Those prospects were not available before the minister introduced his amendments. There is a lot of work to be done by the various tourist commissions. With private enterprise, there is no reason why charter operators cannot use the territory as a hub. That is something that the Northern Territory government would be very interested in.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another interesting factor is that of freight. I have known of instances where Flying Tiger used to bring their cargo from overseas ports into Australia and then fly empty from Sydney over Darwin and back into Singapore or other Asian ports. I always thought that was a waste of a resource, especially as the territory in the last five years has developed a tremendous horticultural market. Only 10 years ago horticultural development in the Northern Territory was worth about only $1&amp;half; million to $2 million per annum. Now it
         <break page="2311" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          exceeds $60 million per annum. We are able to export some of our produce to northern areas such as Sabah in Malaysia and Singapore.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If Flying Tiger were able to bounce into Darwin and pick up a couple of tonnes of freight, that would certainly help the development of the horticultural industry. I believe the amendments as proposed by the minister would have some validity if approved by the secretary to the department of transport. There are certainly some avenues which will open up. I do not know whether the opening of the blue sky policy, as mentioned by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, is the objective of this legislation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This legislation provides those operators with the capacity, after obtaining approval, to move in and out of the country both with freight and with passengers. The amendments in the bill will go another step in freeing up the operations of charter companies by streamlining approval processes for applications while strengthening protection for consumers by ensuring that passengers are indemnified for financial loss should the charter not fulfil its obligations.

         While northern Australia has had a fairly liberal charter policy for some time, this bill enables quick approval for multi&amp;hyphen;destination charters. The amendments also provide for the establishment of a register. It is envisaged that the register will be managed by Airservices Australia and will list information on encumbered aircraft. This will be a national register, and it has the in principle approval from all states and territories. The Northern Territory government already has complementary legislation. So a move to the national register should not pose any major problems. While acknowledging that this is only an information register and does not guarantee title, it is a useful and welcome initiative.

         Whilst restating my concerns that the balance between the Commonwealth and the territory be preserved, I want to mention some of the other operations of the FAC at airports. I want to highlight one particular instance which has caused me some concern. A coach operator who had permission from hoteliers to pick up guests from the airport and transfer
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          them to the various hotels as a courtesy service had his operation ceased by the FAC in Alice Springs. The reason for this was that the FAC had entered into an exclusive agreement with another operator to take those passengers to various destinations in Alice Springs, but those people did not have bookings. They were simply walking off the aircraft, looking for transport and were able to use the bus shuttle into various parts of Alice Springs.

         I felt very sorry for the operator because he had gone to a lot of trouble to make arrangements with the various hoteliers to transport their guests from the airport to the hotels in the various locations. Because of a regulation of the FAC, the road into the FAC was virtually closed off. This prohibited the operator from going in to pick up passengers.

         I realise that this does not have anything to do with the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1). However, if somebody bought an airport, what extension would the legislative process provide for the protection of those people needing to do business at the airport? With those few comments, I commend the bill to the House. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development will obviously pick up some points raised by the shadow minister, and I will listen with interest to that.

         I have looked through the bill that is before us and through the minister's second reading speech, and also a speech made by the minister to the Orient Airlines Association at Sanctuary Cove on 29 November last year. I want to draw upon some of his remarks in that speech and some of the information that he provided in the course of that speech, because it contained a quite comprehensive analysis of the international aviation industry in Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The two largest aviation markets in the world are the United States and the European Community, with 280 million and 360 million people respectively. Those two markets recognise the economic importance of having strong aviation and shipping industries and the multiplier effects of those industries. Yet I have to say that this Treasury&amp;hyphen;led doctrinaire government, a captive of the economic rationalists, never misses a chance to hit Australia's shipping and aviation industries. Earlier this session, the government pushed through cuts to government assistance to Australia's shipbuilding industry and depreciation allowances for Australian flag shipping. That assistance had been initially established to encourage the growth of both of those sectors—shipbuilding and ship operation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the intended effects of this legislation is to weaken the role of Australia's international airlines, Ansett International and Qantas, in the international market. I will compare that a little later with the attitude of the European Community and of the United States which have very strong and protective policies towards their international aviation industries. The ultimate result of that is to transfer jobs offshore under the pretext of increasing the size of the tourism industry.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When I looked to the minister's speech of 29 November last year I saw he made the point that Australia has been pursuing a policy of keeping the capacity ahead of the demand. That is a very good doctrinaire approach, but when the capacity is so far ahead of demand, that 40 per cent of the capacity that is available into and out of Australia is not utilised, that is something we
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          need to look at fairly closely. There needs to be a balance in all of those things. As I said, when I look at the really big players in the world and look at the policies they are following, I ask: with all of the strength that they have and all of the market opportunities available to them, what leads them to pursue the policy they are following and are there indicators there that we should be taking notice of?

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When I look at Australia I see that at present only 60 per cent of the total seats available—just under 200,000—are actually operated each week by the airlines. There are 330,000 seats available each week into and out of Australia but only 200,000 of those seats are operated.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The minister made the point in that speech that Australia's international aviation policy is aimed at liberalisation but that we are not pursuing open skies. There is a fine line there. I can see the objective, I have listened to the shadow minister and I am conscious of the previous Labor government's policy, but the warning I want to give is that it is a fine balance. When you look at the United States, when you look at the Asian airlines operators, when you look at the growing conglomeration of international airline operators around the world, we are but small bit players. We are small bit players in the global sea and just how much risk can we take with what are really fledgling industries.

         If you look down further, you will see our share of traffic into and out of Australia has increased from 38 per cent to some 42 per cent in 1996 with the operation of Ansett International. Again, Australia's market share has been declining. So we should work through and look at what is happening in the rest of the world and what we are doing here with our policy. There is another issue, but I will come back a little later to look more at the European scene.

         When we look at some of the airlines operating into Australia—and it is helpful that the minister is here at the table when I am making these remarks because I want to talk about the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the onerous task that that organisation carries—we see that just over 41 million people
         <break page="2313" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          travelled by air in Australian air space in 1995&amp;hyphen;96. That includes domestic majors, domestic regional operators, the few that go by general aviation and all of the international travellers who come into Australian airports or go out of Australian airports.

          Daily Commercial News
         </emphasis>
         of 3 March 1997, has found some `major safety deficiencies' with an international airline which is flying into Australia—into Sydney. CASA has covered some six or eight airlines and found that one had some major deficiencies—and the minister would quickly be able to recall which one that is without my naming it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         With 50 international airline carriers coming into Australia, it is vital that they are checked for safe operation, for airworthiness and for safety deficiencies. Let's not blindly accept that, because an aircraft is registered in another nation, that nation has the same attitude towards airworthiness and safe air operation as we have in this country. We are one of the leaders in the world, but there are all sorts of flagged aircraft coming into this country now that have differing levels of safety and safe operation. So unsuitable aircraft—the aviation equivalent of Panamanian registered ships, I am sure you would appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker—create the fear of an accident occurring. We need to be concerned about the possibility of unsuitable aircraft, especially high&amp;hyphen;passenger planes such as Boeing 727s and 767s, and they need to be watched and they need to be supervised from an airworthiness standpoint.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         An example of a safety concern is an airline, which did not land in Australia, where a plane was registered in one country, chartered to another country and operated by a crew from a third country who were licensed by a fourth country,  for instance by the Federal Aviation Administration of the United States, and probably had a multiracial crew—just to make you happy!
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Last month, in that period that was reported, CASA banned 13 international airlines from landing in Australia and put another 15 on notice to improve their air safety regulations. CASA is currently concentrating on
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          inspecting the 15 carriers who are on notice, but eventually it wants to inspect every foreign carrier entering Australia. I believe that the Australian public demands no less than that achievement. There is a blind acceptance—rather, it is almost like a blind expectation—that international aircraft are really absolutely safe and, if they have a flag on the tail of the country of origin and they are registered overseas, they will be right.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We know the reality is somewhat different from that and the level of risk varies greatly as we increase the number of aircraft, the flags, coming into Australia. With the prospect of charter operators coming in, there is clearly in the charter industry—if one looks closely, like in the shipping industry—a greater incidence of older aircraft often operated by organisations or businesses that have lesser durability than their standard scheduled operators who have a much greater market image to protect. The risk, in my mind, of crash and injury is greater with some of those operators. I have to qualify that. I do not want to raise the alarm, but we do need to recognise the reality of the composition of that industry. It is a different industry to the scheduled operators. Those remarks I made about CASA are drawn from the DCN of 3 March.

         Inbound tourism flows out of all of this, because the purpose of growing the international airline industry is to grow inbound tourism. Inbound tourism is constantly presented as the panacea for all of Australia's ills. However, in the general community, there are increasing numbers of Australians raising questions about who benefits from increased inbound tourism. There needs to be clear policies and industry initiatives in place to ensure that Australian businesses and Australian men and women gain income and employment from increased inbound tourism.

         Increased inbound tourism can bring benefits, but there have to be effective policies in place to achieve those benefits.

         I am asked the question—I am sure a number of my colleagues here in the House have been asked the same thing—`Well, what does Australia benefit from that?' With regard to the incidence of vertical integration, I do not know the answers; that is why I am raising it in this debate. It needs to be addressed and those questions need to be answered. Where is the benefit to Australia and does that kind of vertical integration benefit Australia? If more foreign activities being vertically integrated do benefit Australia, is there a mirror of that, where Australian owned businesses are similarly vertically integrated in their journey abroad? I would like to think that they were.

         The parting remark that I usually get in that kind of discussion is a sort of dismissive sentence that goes something like, `Well, it seems to me we get to make some of the beds and wash some of the dirty clothes, thanks very much.' But it is a serious question and it is that perception that needs to be addressed. I have seen a number of current affairs shows and I have seen it addressed on various television semi&amp;hyphen;documentaries. It is a problem we need to address if we are going to continue to have the support of Australians for that.

         I can understand people forming those views of inbound tourism in light of the media coverage that I have referred to. The question of vertical integration needs to be addressed. That leads me to the next point. We regularly hear calls from the industry for less and less supervision of tourists coming to Australia. Some spokespeople wanted visas abolished altogether. I am looking here again at the DCN. It is not my favourite journal that I read all the time, but it just so happens that I noticed these articles—

A few weeks ago, we saw, vividly, news bulletin after TV news bulletin of two Koreans being bashed to death in a street in Sydney and then the subsequent reports that they were related to crime syndicates that had come in.

         There again has to be a balance about the level of inspection and the level of examination.

We have seen already numerous news reports about the Yakuza from Japan, now the Korean criminal gangs that are here and all the other ones we have heard referred to in the past. These more recent ones have to do with the increased flow of tourism. I think the industry itself and governments themselves, both federal and state, need to address this issue before it develops too far. It is a serious issue.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We looked at the industry as a whole, and where the industry is going. The airline business is a very tough business to be in. It is a very attractive business. So many operators think that if you paint `airlines' on the tail of your aircraft your fortune is made. All you have to do is collect the money and enjoy the wealth. I refer to another article which says that it is a cyclical industry that is highly sensitive to discretionary factors. There is no more a discretionary factor than in the case of charter aircraft, or unscheduled air services, as they are known.

         If you look to Europe, you will see that 1997 is the year—I think it is next month—when cabotage within the aviation industry ends, when any nation within the European Community will be able to transport people

          by air to any other nation within the EC. It is going to be interesting to see how that works, because the EC has had a history of deliberately high domestic fares with travel into Europe being much cheaper than travel within Europe. When that develops, it will be interesting to see what the effect is going to be on the domestic cabotage rights within the 17 member states that constitute the community.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Going on from that, I looked at a report prepared by the BTCE, report No. 86, and the section in that which deals with unscheduled services—`non-scheduled passenger traffic' is the jargon for it. It makes the point that, as we have known before, non-scheduled services, or charter services, provide a relatively small proportion of total revenue passenger kilometres, RPKs, or total traffic, across the world. In the 1992 figures, it was some 14.7 per cent of the total international revenue passenger kilometres, both scheduled and non-scheduled—that is all, less than 15 per cent of it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The demand for that kind of traffic is highly discretionary. It is very price sensitive and it varies. It used to be the case that charter operators opened new markets and brought in a great deal of traffic. There was a very substantial margin between the scheduled fare level and what the charter operator could come in with, often with an older aircraft and often with a lower standard of accommodation in the aircraft—usually a higher passenger number, a closer configuration, less leg room and all those things that go to passenger comfort.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But that margin has greatly narrowed and there is not generally the margin of fat that used to be there for the unscheduled operator or the charter operator to come in underneath and siphon off traffic from the scheduled passenger operator. Again I raise the doubt about that. I can see chartered aircraft services as a way of opening up some new markets, but I do not think we should hold out a great deal of expectation about it.

         I have a concern with the way this government is going about handing out bilateral arrangements, it seems to me in many cases with little in return. We are so hasty, and you can see that reflected in the figures.

         If you go to the other extreme, you can look at non-scheduled service to the Middle East. What is said in respect of the Middle East? Most Third World countries and Middle East nations have tight restrictions regarding non-scheduled operations in order to protect their infant aviation industry. So there is this great mix of tight aviation policy, not so tight policy and in some cases I think overly liberal policy.

         I come back to the point I started with. The two greatest markets in the world—the European Community and the United States of America—fiercely guard their aviation resource, their national aviation markets and the utilisation of those markets. If you look at where the growth is going to come from in the market, it is interesting to note that, looking across the United States, the Pacific and the international market generally, half of the revenue of all US airlines comes from trans&amp;hyphen;Pacific operations—half of it. Compare that to what the minister had to say in his speech in November, that by the year 2000 the Asia&amp;hyphen;Pacific will constitute 40 per cent of the world total of aviation traffic and aviation activity. Australia's share of that, as I said, is down to 42 per cent.

The sale of the long-term leases on federal airports will improve the efficiency of airport investments and operations while at the same time provide ordinary Australians, such as my constituents in the electorate of Swan, with the opportunity to invest in what is a very stable and profitable business.

The successful bidders may commence operation in the airports towards the end of June, but certainly will do so by the end of this parliamentary sitting or before we sit again.

         Sydney will not be leased without a satisfactory solution to the noise problem from aircraft. In my opinion, that is a very sensible situation, given the heat surrounding Sydney. The government strategy of offering long&amp;hyphen;term leases, coupled with the decision to break up a government owned monopoly airports network, is a world first and has attracted considerable international interest. It is providing significant opportunities for private sector involvement in infrastructure, with airports representing very attractive investments. This bill will provide certainty to new airport operators and existing airport tenants and will ensure the Commonwealth can exercise adequate regulatory control over the leased airports.

These will include statutory requirements for an airport operator to use an airport site as an airport, this is a legal requirement to ensure that airport land is not redeveloped for other purposes; variable penalties for breaches of environmental standards; powers to allow pre-existing contamination to be addressed; and prohibition on sub&amp;hyphen;leasing to trusts.

          The bill also provides for some amendments to the Air Navigation Act 1920, including the establishment of a register of unencumbered aircraft to provide buyers and sellers of aircraft with information on registered security interests held by lenders and creditors over aircraft including airframes, engines and avionics. This initiative is supported by the aviation industry. Other amendments to the Air Navigation Act 1920 relate to the current approval process for charter flights. The amendment will strengthen consumer protection provisions and streamline and better identify charter approval processes consistent with the government's aviation policy.

          The Airports Act provides for the future operating regime of privatised airports for the next 99 years—50 years with a 49-year option. At this stage I wish to put the new owners of these airports on notice about their responsibilities and their obligations under their new ownership.

          Whoever ends up `owning/leasing' Perth airport needs to be aware of a number of obligations they will be required to adhere to. Because the airport will be in the hands of this new owner for some considerable time, I believe that the new Perth owners will need to develop a strategy like the good neighbour policy the current FAC management at Perth airport has in place. It is quite well known that up until a few years ago the Perth airport did not have a very satisfactory relationship with its neighbouring councils, some residents and the business community.

          Approximately three years ago a group called RAGE, or Retailers Against Government Enterprise, was formed. It was one of the most successful lobby groups that were formed in relation to Perth airport. It was headed by Wally Daly, a local business proprietor, with the support of a well-known lobbyist from Western Australia called Bill Mitchell. Unfortunately, Mr Mitchell has since passed on. This group was successful in addressing what were major concerns in the development of Perth airport land by commercial enterprises.

          Some of the considerations in this project included not only a huge commercial site but other developments which were regarded as being incompatible with the local environment. As a result of that, and possibly with the change of government, this large commercial development did not go ahead. In fact, it became such a contentious issue that the developers were unable to obtain local planning approval for this commercial development. I believe the then Minister for Planning in Western Australia, Mr Lewis, even threatened to cut off road supply to that part of the

          Under the management of the now FAC chairman in Perth, Mr Graham Muir, there has been a far better conciliation process with local councils and local commercial interests. I believe that the new proposal now being considered involves 5,000 square metres of retail floor space rather than 20,000 square metres. Compatible developments around the Perth airport include a three&amp;hyphen;star hotel. For those who do not know, Perth is absolutely bereft of hotel space at the moment. Perth hotels are continually booked out. I believe this will provide a great opportunity for compatible development on this land.

It will not impact on residents as such because the beauty about Perth airport is that it has a huge buffer zone around the airport and is away from residential development.

          I wish to now refer to environmental considerations regarding the Perth airport and its surrounds. In doing so I would like to bring to the House's attention also that there is considerable concern by local environmentalists regarding the natural bushland that surrounds the Perth airport and the buffer zone there. I have visited that part of the airport with Senator Ian Campbell, Senator Dee Margetts, Joan Payne from the WA Conservation Council and Mr Kevin McLean from the local environmental group. We have looked at some significant areas of urban bushland, which is an important consideration in environment issues.

Unfortunately, they have not seen one for 23 years; however, it is believed that it may still be a good environment for them. What has caused the problem here is that those who designed and placed the new international terminal on the Perth airport placed it in such a way that, if there is to be a second parallel runway in many years to come, Mundy Swamp is under threat in terms of its existence.

          I believe this matter has been attended to in some respects because at one stage the Perth airport bushland was put on the Register of the National Estate by the Australian Heritage Council and the FAC challenged this listing on the basis of concerns that it had regarding this listing. This matter was arbitrated eventually before the court and the area now has been removed from the Register of the National Estate. But this does not mean to say that there are not very important considerations that need to be taken into account regarding the urban bushland and the wetland surrounding the Perth airport.

          There are some very concerning aspects regarding environmental measures related to the area surrounding the Perth airport. For example, right next to the Perth airport are the major marshalling yards for Western Australia. On the odd occasion there have been some major oil spills. In fact, I went and witnessed one of these oil spills where a large diesel tank ruptured into the subterranean surface and leaked thousands of litres of diesel into the subsoil. They had spears in the soil trying to suck the diesel out of the soil and save it from getting into the ground water. However, it was leaching into the wetlands and going through the main drain through the Perth airport and covertly being pumped off when it could be. So there are great considerations regarding some of the environmental matters surrounding the Perth airport.

          I would also like to make sure the House is aware that one of the great concerns at the moment is the fact that there are three overlapping native title claims on the Perth airport. In my opinion, there is a very good chance that some of these are not as genuine as they may first appear because there seem to be competing interests from three different groups who claim native title over the Perth airport.

          My advice is that where the airport has been developed—runways, buildings, et cetera—the title no longer exists. However, the parts of the airport that are considered to be urban bushland and remnant crown land are still subject to native title claims. This is why we need the government to make a decisive action regarding native title. I am sure it does not help the potential private owners of the Perth airport in their future

          I would also like to mention a number of facts regarding the Perth airport. It grossed a profit in the 1995-96 year of $24 million. In the year before that it was $18 million. However, in 1988, when the FAC first took over, the Perth airport operated with a substantial loss. Since then there has been a 26 per cent annual growth and in the last three years profit levels have more than doubled. Most of this is non-aviation related. This is why there is great potential for the new owners to expand their commercial and developmental interests around the Perth airport.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I do warn the new owners that they may have a little problem trying to make it any more efficient than it is at the moment because Graham Muir, whom I mentioned earlier, under his urbane stewardship sees the FAC making sure the Perth airport is a very efficient operation. Mr Graham Muir would be an asset to any of the new owners as a manager not only because of his ability to manage the airport in an economic manner and make sure it turns a profit but because of the fact that he is a great consulter. As I have said previously, he has taken the airport from being a contentious issue to local business and local councils to being a harmonious working relationship. I can assure you that he has made the term `good neighbour policy' an effective one regarding the Perth airport.

          I would also like to make sure that the new owners understand their obligations and the protection that was given under the Airports Act 1996 regarding noise around the Perth airport. It is rather fatuous for the Labor Party to carry on about the noise around the Perth airport at the moment. They never, ever put money aside for noise studies regarding the Perth airport. They never did anything in a concrete way to help anybody who said that they had a noise problem.

As a member representing the people who live in areas surrounding the airport, I can guarantee those people that I will be acting on their behalf.

          —The Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997 is a step in the right direction for those of us involved in the industry. I am a pilot and owner-operator of a Cessna twin-engine aircraft and, as a parliamentarian, I am required to travel extensively throughout Australia on major airlines. So I understand the problems—not only as a pilot but also as a passenger—that the industry is currently having. I should add at this point that much of the problem is coming from the hierarchy in the industry. I am talking about the aviation board: a group of appointees—most of whom have little to no experience in aviation.

         The people on the ground in the industry—and I am talking about the investigators or liaison officers in the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Airservices Australia—know their job. They know what is required of them to put the industry right. On the other hand, the industry is immersed within a bureaucracy that feeds the board, for want of a better word, absolute rubbish. The information that the bureaucracy is currently handing on to the board puts them in a situation where they only act on that but, more often than not, the information that they are given is not what is actually required to get the best job done the first time. The problem then grows as the aviation board is short of knowledge in the field and is more often than not misled. They then intervene when they are not required to do so.

         I see the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) is trying to take charge of this misguided group, the aviation board, and has put his best foot forward to fix the problem. So I say to the board: do you want to continue to be part of the problem or become part of the solution? To this end we have seen the public opinion that agrees the board must change more in line with the industry. Obviously now we see the group refuses to move despite the need for a safer industry. This direction will not happen while we have people who know nothing about the problems the industry is experiencing and continue to flounder against the need for change.

         In regard to the latest developments, the minister has moved to fix the problem only to come up against another brick wall. I talk of the obstructive Democrats in the Senate, in particular Senator Cheryl Kernot, another individual whose experience I would question in the field of aviation. This situation is precisely what I have been talking about in past addresses to the House with regard to knowledge of a topic or issue at hand. How can one profess to be representative of the people on any topic with no experience of the issue at hand? This is why the country is in trouble today. We have people making laws and changing legislation who have no knowledge of the topic. This brings me to an article in the

Whether she likes it or not, the electorate at large gave the coalition government a mandate to form a government, and as a government, it has a duty to look after the interests of all Australians, including their safety. I am afraid that the Democrats under Senator Kernot are nothing more than a bunch of egotistical obstructionists.

         I rest my case. The amendments relating to international charter flights are an initiative that moves towards a more open and flexible international air charter market in Australia. The country city of Rockhampton in the electorate of Capricornia has an airport that has the capacity to handle overseas air charter flights for tourism and, even better, the ability to air freight food types to other countries. Runway 15&amp;hyphen;33, which is currently running to plan with an extension to handle larger heavier aircraft, will fall right in line with this change of legislation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Capricorn International Resort at Yeppoon, some 40 minutes drive from the airport, has looked forward to the day when they will be able to fly Japanese visitors direct to Rockhampton and then bring them to the resort. The extension to the runway and the new legislation make this event quite possible.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Another of the amendments casts light on the sale of encumbered aircraft, the registration of security interests in relation to aircraft and their components.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is envisaged that Airservices Australia will be responsible for the development and ongoing administration of the register, which will operate on a full cost recovery basis. This approach has been agreed to by the industry. The availability of this information on security interests held on aircraft and certain key components will be of particular benefit to the general aviation sector as this sector has been hit very heavily in the past by the economic

         The register will protect the purchaser of an aircraft from buying a machine which has outstanding debt against it—and here I am talking about engines and engine components, airframes and internal equipment like avionics. This, I believe, will also assist in the tracking of bogus parts and/or the sale of second&amp;hyphen;hand parts or components that are not up to scratch and subsequently fitted to aircraft which are not being caught by the system set up to safeguard against such occurrences. Too often, aircraft change hands with funds outstanding from the previous owner. In many cases, the aircraft has been sold because the owner could no longer afford to keep it, owing to the increases in maintenance costs, fuel hikes and landing fees. The cost to the owner/operator of aircraft these days is phenomenal and is only getting worse.

         I look to this government in the near future continuing to put good legislation forward that will decrease the cost to owner/operators and, therefore, stimulate the industry. People will then be able to afford the costs, thereby increasing the number of people involved in the industry and ultimately creating employment.

         In years past, the previous Labor government has forced people out of aircraft. You do not have to look too far to see how many people have discarded their light aircraft to purchase ultralight planes—aircraft that do not require 100 per cent attention to maintenance in order for them to fly throughout the country. It is getting bad when people have to step away from the good old 172 that they might have used, say, in the electorate of the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) to check the fences and the water and, on the odd days, to zip into the local town to buy the weekly or monthly groceries.

         The Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997 is to provide certainty to new airport operators and existing airport tenants and to ensure that the Commonwealth can exercise adequate regulatory control over leased airports. The new subsection provides that an airport lessee company must not enter into an airport management agreement unless

         In general, this initiative is to ensure that an airport is used for the purpose as defined of  aviation. With this in mind, many airports throughout the country have been sold off by the Commonwealth. This, once again, was another great milestone of the Australian Labor Party. They sold everything and now whinge that the coalition is selling off the country. Talk about hypocritical!

         Local government or the shire councils currently have most of the airports. In some cases a company or group could take ownership of one in a certain area and, if the airport were failing to cover its costs, the lessee may attempt to use the airport for another purpose, thereby obstructing the main task that is expected at that field, which must be aviation—the ability for aircraft to frequent the strip as required in accordance with the regulations. I commend the amendments to the House. The amendments are needed and are industry supported.

         The environment and aviation go hand in hand. Aviation, particularly in our modern cities and particularly in Sydney, relies significantly on the cooperation of the general public and on a harmonious relationship with the environment. That certainly has come into question over the last few years. Of course, we think only too often of the impact of the construction of Sydney's third runway, as it

         We should never for a second underestimate the importance of Kingsford Smith airport to the people of Sydney and to the Sydney basin. It has been there since 1919. More than 50 per cent of all international flights into Australia come into Kingsford Smith airport, and Kingsford Smith airport also handles over one&amp;hyphen;third of all domestic passengers. So, apart from having the massive infrastructure there that employs over 60,000 people and provides ongoing employment and further employment to a number of related industries and a large number of people, the airport is also the tourism and traffic hub of Australia.

         Forecasts suggest there will be an annual increase of 4.1 per cent of aircraft movements until the year 2000, and it is fair to assume that that growth will continue in the aftermath of the Sydney 2000 Olympics. According to the Department of Transport, in 1995&amp;hyphen;96 Kingsford Smith airport had 270,000 movements. This will increase to 316,500 movements in 1999&amp;hyphen;2000. Of those, 55,000 movements will be international, 235,000 will be domestic and 26,500 will be non&amp;hyphen;scheduled aircraft.

         I think this is a wonderful opportunity to go through some of the events that have occurred during the last few years, particularly in relation to the environmental management of Kingsford Smith airport. The most significant event was the opening of the third runway on 4 November 1994. It is a date that is indelibly marked on the minds of the people of Sydney. Within weeks the community's anger was palpable, culminating in a massive public rally held at Leichhardt Oval on 3 December 1994. Soon to follow, on 17 December, was a blockade of Sydney airport—an unprecedented event. Community anger was centred around the fact that the environmental impact statement associated with the construction of the third runway was proven to be misleading within days of the opening of the third runway.

         The ALP government on 20 December 1994 put in place the northern flight corridors. We all remember it: Paul Keating and

          Laurie Brereton standing in front of a massive map of the Sydney basin saying, `We are going to shovel the planes up this narrow flight corridor.' That corridor became known as the Bennelong funnel. The funnel was, in effect, the most obvious example of the very base politics that the Australian Labor Party em ployed in relation to the airport. The problem became very significant in a very short time for over 200,000 Sydney residents who were receiving over 55 per cent of all traffic to the north of the airport.

         Reaction to the ALP's obvious disregard for the welfare of residents resulted in a second blockade at Sydney airport, this time at the domestic terminal, on 13 February 1995. The coalition was very aware of this anger because the coalition had been aware of the great dispute within the Australian Labor Party during the debate about whether a third runway should be constructed at Sydney airport or whether a second international airport should be constructed in Sydney.

         I am a fair man. I will recognise that credit should be given where it is due. The current member for Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton) is recorded as saying that he was opposed to the construction of a third runway at Kingsford Smith airport. I think it is important at this juncture to refer to what became known as the bible of the Hawke&amp;hyphen;Keating years. I would like to quote from that bible. It is the Bantam publication

          Isn't that a sad indictment of the attitude of the Australian Labor Party? That is why they are in opposition today. It is that sort of pervading attitude—`My margin is big enough; I do not have to worry about it'—that put them there. I remember how during the six public meetings, which I will touch on a little later, the current member for Watson was standing in front of about 1,500 people in the Marrickville Town Hall professing his support for their concern about the ramifications of the construction of Sydney's third runway. I quote to the member for Watson what his own mate, the man who wrote the bible about the Hawke-Keating years, said.

           —I am happy to do that, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am happy to talk about the environmental ramifications of the aviation proposals before us. The most significant outcome of the election campaign was the policy of the coalition in the lead-up to 2 March election. That policy, Putting People First, indeed did just that—it put people first. What we said was that we were going to put the people of Sydney first when it came to discussions about the environmental impact of the operations of Kingsford Smith airport.
          </para>
         </talk.start>
         <para first-indent="16">
          That policy manifests itself today in what has become known as the long-term operating plan for Kingsford Smith airport. This plan, put together by the industry, the various community groups, Airservices Australia, the Department of Transport and all the various interested parties, offers a total solution for the problems immediately associated with Kingsford Smith airport.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          What we promised in January and February of 1996 was that we were going to spread the noise around, that Sydney airport could cope with the demands, which I have talked about a little earlier, of the 21st century. What we wanted to do was put in place a comprehensive system that introduced new modes of operation at Kingsford Smith airport, was able to share the noise around and, at the same time, was going to address the concerns of specifically the people who suffered under the Bennelong funnel—the Bennelong funnel that people like the member for Watson said was okay for their electorates because they had a significant enough majority to cope with some of the dissent.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          They significantly underestimated the dissent in the community. That dissent has come to the fore in two ways. Firstly, it was a direct part of the development of the coalition's policy. Secondly, the concern of the Sydney community is directly conveyed
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           to the minister today through the Sydney Airport Community Forum.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The community forum, which I am fortunate enough to chair, has representatives from the Australian Labor Party, including the members for Grayndler and Barton (Mr McClelland), the state members for Heffron, Diedre Grusovin, and Lane Cove, Kerry Chikarovski, and a number of mayors. Most of those mayors are not obvious supporters of the coalition, including the Marrickville mayor, who is obviously not a supporter of the coalition. That group has come together to have some important feed into the decision making process at Kingsford Smith airport.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As a part of this plan, over 1,500 submissions were received from the general public, including representative groups. We also held six public meetings. Most of the public meetings were held in Labor Party seats. What I find most interesting is that the public meetings held in Labor Party seats, such as in the town hall at Marrickville—the members for Grayndler and Watson are party to this—attracted about 2,000 people. In total, about 6,000 people attended the public meetings and had some feed into the long&amp;hyphen;term operating plan. The net result is that the plan is being considered further by the Commonwealth government. I urge the minister for transport to adopt the plan. I urge the government to fully support its implementation.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The beneficiaries of the plan, which benefits the Sydney community significantly, are mostly the people immediately to the north of the airport. It is not just the people in my electorate of North Sydney who benefit and it is not just the people in the electorates of Bradfield and Bennelong who benefit. People in the electorates of Grayndler and Watson are also the big beneficiaries of this plan. We are happy to go in to bat for the people of Watson and Grayndler because their own members are not representing them and are not batting for them at any time.

          But before I get on to that I would remind the House that in my maiden speech I said that the honourable member for Shortland was the greatest Minister for Transport Australia had had since the war. The point I would like to make is that, when I first arrived in the Australian parliament, Peter Morris, the member for Shortland, was the acknowledged expert on transport matters. He displayed in his contribution earlier tonight that he continues to be extremely well informed and remains up to date in many ways about the issues that are before the parliament tonight and that affect aviation. He has always been a strong advocate for making sure that Australia's interests are protected in aviation and shipping, and other matters.

          I would just take up a few of the issues that the member for Shortland raised in the debate. He quite rightly pointed out that in the past, when Australia was negotiating airline agreements, we often used to adopt positions based on what we thought was best for the Australian airline—in practice, what we thought was best for Qantas, which was then the only international airline owned by Australians.

          Some years ago, during the time of the former Labor government, the philosophy changed so that we were looking at what would be the best position to advance the economic interests of Australia. That certainly is the way we should be going now, especially with the Australian tourism industry having grown dramatically in the last decade. If we want to make sure that we maximise not just the foreign exchange earnings for Australia but also the number of jobs that we create in Australia, we need to balance what is in the interests not just of the Australian owned airlines but also of creating jobs and investment in Australia.

          I believe that there have been discussions between the shadow minister for transport, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), and the minister for transport about ways in which we can seek to improve the current proposal which is before the House to make sure that we do get a proper consideration and proper analysis of how we can estimate those benefits for Australia.

           There has been a bit of debate about charters and whether we should be making it easier for air charters to bring more tourists to Australia. During my time as Minister for Tourism in the last government, there were a number of examples of where charters had been able to grow and expand potential markets for the Australian tourism industry. In particular, I think there were a number of flights from Singapore to regional areas that really blazed the trail for increasing tourism from a number of countries in Asia.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Also, I think the British market to a large extent still depends on large numbers of charter flights each year, despite the large number of scheduled flights between Britain  and Australia. If we did not have those charter flights from Britain, despite the relatively large number of them, I think the Australian tourism industry would probably be receiving fewer English tourists and in many ways probably fewer English backpackers. However, despite what people have thought in the past, backpackers often are the ones who stay the longest and spend the most during their extended stay in Australia. I know that people on both sides of House probably would prefer to see more scheduled flights. But, if we can use charters to advance the economic interests of Australia, that is something which should be welcomed.

           The member for Shortland also said that we should be trying to address this issue which often gets raised of how much economic benefit flows to Australia if you have people flying on overseas owned, foreign owned, airlines, staying at foreign owned hotels, allegedly shopping at foreign owned duty-free stores. This issue often gets raised in the tourism industry, and people ask how much of the money stays in Australia, especially if the airfares are prepaid overseas.

          <para first-indent="16">
           In fact, there have been a number of studies on this issue. They have all concluded that up to 80 per cent or so of the land component of these overseas holidays stays in Australia. If you stay at a hotel, no matter who owns it, someone has to provide the food that is served there and local staff are employed there in the hotel to provide the services. No matter who owns the hotel, it is not just a

           The member for Shortland also raised a very important issue about the calls by some people, including my old friend Bruce Baird from the Tourism Council of Australia, for the abolition of visas or the identification of perhaps a dozen or so countries for which visas should be abolished. The member for Shortland quite rightly raised the concerns that will follow if we do abolish visas for some countries. He is not the first person to raise in this House concerns about what happens if you allow visa&amp;hyphen;free entry from Japan and other countries. There have been lots of stories in the paper about the Yakuza and other crime syndicates—not just those involving Japanese citizens.

          <para first-indent="16">
           I know that a number of members on the government side of the House have also expressed strong concerns in the past about making sure that visa checks remain very thorough and we make sure that people of poor character or who are involved in organised crime, drug trafficking or other unsavoury activities are prevented from coming to Australia. I have always thought that some people in the tourism industry, including Mr Baird, exaggerate the impact that visas have on tourism to Australia.

           I seem to recall a study once which claimed that billions of dollars in foreign exchange earnings were lost because we required people from other countries to have visas. When you went back to the raw data of the survey, you found that it was 80 people who happened to be accosted as they arrived in Australia. The amount of rigour which that survey entailed would lead me to question the validity of some of the conclusions that were made.

           I think the department of immigration has been working for a number of years on the introduction of electronic visas. If the department is still able to meet its targets, that will go a long way towards making it easier for international visitors to travel to Australia because they will not have to send their passports away. It will allow people to get

           A comment was made about the number of seats available for flights into and out of Australia—that is, about 330,000 per year. People have commented that only 200,000 of those available seats are actually utilised. I think we have to be careful not to exaggerate the impact or the meaning that might be read into that. A number of airlines who have the right to fly to Australia do not. A number of airlines do not use their full capacity. Let us look at the number of flights that have been agreed between Australia and Korea, or Australia and Taiwan or Australia and Indo nesia. As the tourism flows have grown, Australia has, through negotiations, agreed to increase the number of flights per week from those countries.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           That has certainly led to a significant boost to the Australian tourism industry because the airlines then have a vested interest in filling their seats and in making sure that more tourists from their country come to Australia on holidays. This is not to deny the comments made by the member for Shortland that the United States and the European Union are fiercely aggressive in defending their airline rights. I think we have to apply the test that I mentioned earlier of working out the best way to develop the most economic benefit to Australia.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Simply because some other countries have anti-competitive practices does not mean that we should automatically make the same mistakes as them. If we liberalise air service agreements from other countries to Australia, the test will be whether that delivers increases in the number of tourists coming to Australia or whether that delivers extra foreign exchange earnings, especially if our airlines are slightly less worse off. We have to work out on that balance sheet whether or not there is an economic benefit to Australia. That is the way to do it. I am sure all those who hold out hope that there are extra jobs in the Australian economy as a result of the tourism industry want to make sure that we get that balance right.

          —It is unfortunate that the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) scuttled out of the chamber before the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) and I made our contributions. As the member for North Sydney knows, by bringing into the debate the canards that he did, he has opened up the debate to a number of areas which the government probably would not feel all that comfortable about. The Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997 before the House tonight is about the environmental impacts of the use of airports.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) said in his second reading speech that he and the government `want to include offences for deliberately causing environmental harm'. He also said that the environmental protection regulations `will establish a regime to identify and manage any pollution or sources of pollution at the leased airport sites'. Everyone knows that the greatest form of pollution at any of the airports around Australia, most particularly at Sydney airport, is noise pollution.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         All the people living in western suburbs know that the person responsible for noise pollution around their homes is the member for North Sydney. He has done a sleazy deal in collusion with the minister for transport. The government made an election pledge to move a problem that the Prime Minister, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), had—that is, the noise over the poor little people in his electorate—and spread it over everyone else. This was the most wicked example of self&amp;hyphen;interest that anyone has seen here in a long day's march.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The member for Bennelong said, `It is really shocking that the millionaires who live in Hunters Hill'—who are the ones in the aeroplanes—`have to put up with the noise caused by their neighbours in these aeroplanes. We will get the member for North Sydney to set up this committee and move the noise into someone else's electorate.' The government attempted to buy the last election. As I outlined in the MPI today, another electoral bribe put forward by the government was the Prime Minister saying that you could trust him on health. This is another one of
         <break page="2330" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          those electoral bribes. The Prime Minister has said that you can trust him on airports.

        <para first-indent="16">
         He told the gullible electors in Lowe that they could trust him; that the government would remove noise pollution from the electorate of Lowe. The people of Lowe might be able to have a go at the government because the government said that they want to include offences for deliberately causing environmental harm. The Prime Minister promised that there would be no aeroplanes flying over the electorate of Lowe. The people in the electorate of Lowe have a credibility problem because they wake up every morning to these aeroplanes when the Prime Minister told them that there would be no planes flying over Lowe.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The member for North Sydney gave the game away five minutes ago. He said that the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) could speak for himself. The truth is that the government has cut the member for Lowe adrift. He is dispensable now. The government has a big majority; it does not care about the member for Lowe. Poor old Paul Zammit has members of the Liberal Party in the Lebanese community wanting to do him in. He has members of the Liberal Party in the Greek community wanting to do him in, and now he has the member for North Sydney wanting to do him in because he does not matter.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         They have got to organise this noise pollution and environmental harm in a way that suits them. The way that suits them is to get the planes out of the member for Bennelong's electorate because he is the Prime Minister and you cannot upset his constituents, for goodness sake, and we have got to get the planes out of the member for North Sydney's electorate because he is the chairman of the Sydney airport noise abatement committee or whatever it is called now. He cannot have any noise, because there is no point in appointing him to this most important committee if he cannot get the planes out of his electorate.

         So the poor old member for Lowe has just got to sit there and cop it and the planes will zoom down Jet Alley, down there through Dobroyd Point and over there through Ashfield. They will all zoom through the member

          for Lowe's electorate and when the poor member for Lowe's voters wake up every morning they will think, `But hang on, we remember the last election and we remember the Prime Minister coming out here and saying that we won't have to worry about environmental harm'—and this bill does talk about environmental harm—`and we won't have to worry about offences for deliberately causing environmental harm; we won't have to worry about the noise.'

        <para first-indent="16">
         They voted for the member for Lowe as a result of that, but what do they find now? They find that the member for North Sydney and the government have cut him adrift. They have said: `Paul Zammit? Well, he's expendable. We'll just let those planes rip up there through Jet Alley so that the Prime Minister and the good old member for North Sydney, who is chairman of the noise committee for the government, are protected.'
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The member for North Sydney has got the hide to come in here tonight and try to impute motive to people on this side. The problem the member for North Sydney has is that the rotten government that he is part of and the predecessors of this rotten government have been trying to do their damnedest to build up Sydney airport since the seventies, since the days of Malcolm Fraser and his major airport needs of Sydney expansion program. The people around Sydney beat that.

         Now we have the current government saying that they have this little bill here tonight in which they want to include offences for deliberately causing environmental harm and they want to establish a regime to identify and manage. That interesting word `manage' is in the second reading speech on the top line of page 2, but it is in inverted commas. So what does `manage' mean? What they mean by managing air pollution and noise pollution is that they manage it into someone else's electorate. They manage it into the electorates of my colleague the member for Grayndler and my electorate, but they manage it out of the electorates of the member for North Sydney and the member for Bennelong. That is what they mean by `manage' and that is

         Of course, you have the other person who has been sacrificed on their altar of airport expediency. That is the poor old member for Hughes (Mrs Vale). The poor old member for Hughes literally came in here on a wing and a prayer and she has been doing a bit more praying than winging lately. Her problem is that she has got in here as a member of the government. The people of Hughes ought to really pray for the member for Hughes because she has been terrific for them. Since she got here the government has given her a nuclear reprocessing plant in her backyard and it is now about to give her a 24&amp;hyphen;hour operation airport. The contagious diseases hospital and the locust plague will be along next week. That is what the member for Hughes has been given. So she has been cut adrift.

         The member for Lowe has also been cut adrift. The poor old member for Hughes and the poor old member for Lowe are  sort of just dopes in the old Liberal Party regime. They got in here but, unfortunately, they were not supposed to get in here, I don't think.

         I am pleased also because this bill is in part about charter flights. It is interesting that the issue of charter flights comes up, because back on 6 November 1996 I asked a question of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp)—question No. 927 on the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Notice Paper
         </emphasis>
         —about an Evergreen Airlines flight over my electorate of Grayndler on 15 October 1996. I asked that question because I had a number of representations from dozens of residents who saw fuel being dumped over their homes, over their schools, over their clothes, over their cars, over their suburbs—carcinogens being dumped on their heads where they live.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is interesting that it took the minister for transport five months to give a response. Eventually I did get a response about this Evergreen Airlines flight. The response that I got is quite astonishing. It appears that it was a flight chartered from Qantas—a B747&amp;hyphen; 200 departing to the north, the favoured mode of operation under the long-term operating plan. That aircraft departed, on its way to Hong Kong, with 240,300 pounds or 35,865 US gallons of fuel. And what happened? I will read you the minister's response. It states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         It is reported that the aircraft released fuel from take-off to Russell Lea—
        </para>

         a distance of about 10 kilometres.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         For 10 kilometres fuel was dumped on the residents of Sydney and on their homes—carcinogens: poisonous, damaging to their health, damaging to their houses and damaging to our environment. It appears that Airservices Australia wrote to the operator, Evergreen International, requesting that an inspection take place and that any fault be quickly rectified. The matter was also taken up with Qantas, given that they were the charterer of the aircraft.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What is extraordinary is that the investigation found that there were five—not one, not two, not three, not four, but five—broken vent valves in the wing tanks. There were five
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          tanks pouring out carcinogens on my electorate. What is the response from the minister? To sit on this matter for five months; to not give an answer to the residents of the inner western suburbs of Sydney; to not give an answer to me as the member for Grayndler; to not give an answer to the discredited member of the extreme right of the Liberal Party, the member for Lowe.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It went even further. The minister also replied to my question of how many similar incidents have occurred since November 1995. You might have expected the courtesy of a detailed response: `Yes, and these were the details.' But what I got was simply a one-liner: `Three similar alleged incidents have occurred.' We are talking about 10 kilometres of fuel dumping on the heads of residents of Sydney, and on three other occasions similar incidents have occurred. Today I have put questions on notice to the minister asking exactly what those incidents were, because residents have a right to know when carcinogens are being dumped on their families, homes and schools.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The minister's response to solving the problem is pathetic. He has hit them with a feather. You would expect some sort of penalty—a financial impost, the banning of the particular aircraft, some action which says to these airlines that the government actually thinks this is not on and that the government actually cares about the residents of Grayndler and the residents of Lowe. Perhaps if the fuel had kept coming out and had gone on to the residents of Hunters Hill we would have had some action. But what we see from this government is, `If it ain't over the North Shore, it doesn't matter.' The minister's pathetic response just says:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">

         Oh dear me! Airlines dumping fuel over residents and, if it occurs again, it will just be raised with the operator as a matter of urgency: `We'll pick up the phone.

          That was the then opposition policy that was launched by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in the electorate of Lowe. It counts for nothing. We then had a press release from John Howard on 8 February 1996—that is, last year; not this year—which stated:

          Again, nothing happened. So I put together a bill, which had its first reading on 4 November and its second reading on 18 November. On 18 November 1996 the minister released a media statement headed `Sydney airport aircraft movements cap to be legislated'. It stated:

          I think that is extraordinarily dishonest. It is about as dishonest as the coalition's promise that Lowe will not be affected in the future—a direct promise by the Prime Minister. Well, Lowe does not have one flight path. It has four. The reason why it has take&amp;hyphen;offs to the north rather than landings from the north is that, if planes are to be landed from the north, they have to be brought in in a straighter line and they would have to come in over the electorate of Bennelong.

Maybe we should have done some sort of an exhibition in the corridor on the flight paths. Maybe then we would get some action. Maybe we could build a few lightweight houses in the corridor of the ministerial wing, and then we could get some action on their voluntary acquisition.

         By way of brief explanation to the House, amendment No. 2, which now lapses, was conditional upon amendment No. 1 being passed. Amendment No. 1 has been defeated. Therefore, amendment No. 2 is no longer applicable. We now move to amendment No. 3.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The net effect of amendment No. 3 is that the criteria which apply, with respect to the  secretary to the department granting an approval for a foreign charter operation to come to Australia, will also apply when the secretary exercises his power under this legislation to exempt a particular charter operation from needing to get approval for that operation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The provision in the legislation has been indicated by the government to be there to provide for certain specific situations where there may be a once&amp;hyphen;only charter. From time to time circumstances may prevail where there is a need for a particular charter, and to have to go through the bureaucratic approval process may be unduly onerous and may be relatively unnecessary. The opposition does not contest the logic of that position on the part of the government but is concerned at the breadth of the provision as it stands at the moment, which empowers the secretary to the department to give an exemption from the requirement to obtain approval.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The opposition feels that the simplest way to get around this problem is to require that,
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          in granting any exemption from a requirement to give approval, the secretary is required to give consideration to the same factors that he is required to give consideration to in granting an approval. That way, there is an evenness between the two sets of criteria: whether the secretary is making a decision by saying, `Yes, you can have approval to run a charter operation from your country to Australia,' and vice versa, or whether the secretary is saying, `Yes, you are exempted from even having to seek that approval,' that he has to think of the various issues that are set out in the legislation in both cases.

         So that is the purpose of the amendment. Once again, I understand that the government, although it will vote against the amendment in the House, will give further consideration to this matter and that we may be able to reach some common view by the time the matter gets to the Senate. On that basis, the opposition will not proceed to divide on this amendment.

          —The Export Market Development Grants Bill 1997 is an anti&amp;hyphen;export bill, an anti&amp;hyphen;export measure. It is bad policy. It is bad for jobs. It is bad for exports. It is bad for Australian exporters. It is bad for the development of an export culture. It is bad for our balance of payments. It is bad for economic growth. But it should come as no surprise to this House because this is consistent with what the government has been doing in the trade and industry policy area since it came to office.

         The bill reflects and implements substantial changes announced in the budget on 20 August 1996. What the government is proposing to do with the Export Market Development Grants Bill is consistent with what it has  been doing in a range of industry and trade enhancement measures—very many of which have been contrary to government election commitments. If it is not the gutting and the narrowing of the export market development grants scheme, if it is not the adverse export and trade consequences of the government's ramshackle handling of the DIFF scheme, if it is not a $2 billion cut to research and development, it is the abolition of bounties such as the shipbuilding bounty in an industry which is now exclusively exporting. That is the government's general approach to trade and industry enhancement measures.

         Export enhancement is one of the very important legs of trade policy. The opposition's position and response to the government's bills—these two measures, the Export Market Development Grants Bill 1997 and the transitional bill, the Export Market Development Grants (Repeal and Consequential Provisions) Bill—is reflected by a second reading amendment which I am happy to have
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

        <para first-indent="16">
         The second reading amendment and the consideration in detail amendments reflect the opposition's approach to these particular measures. The opposition's parliamentary response to these measures has been threefold: the second reading amendment, which I will formally move at the conclusion of my remarks; the amendments at the consideration in detail stage, which I have referred to; and action by the opposition in the Senate to ensure that these bills were referred to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee. Consistent with the Senate standing orders, on the introduction of the legislation to this House, the bill in the Senate was the subject of a reference to and public hearing by that committee. That public hearing was conducted on Monday of this week with a resolution of the Senate that the committee report by Friday of this week. Coincidentally, with the passage of the legislation through this House, we will find the Senate exploring the adverse implications of this legislation to Australian exporters by way of its relevant legislation committee. The opposition reserves its right to move further amendments in the Senate, dependent upon the detailed consideration of that public hearing and the evidence given yesterday.

         There are some items of the legislation which the opposition has no difficulty with. Some of those go to the full extension of the scheme to tourism providers. That has been the subject of a number of reports by various committees of this House—in particular, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration and the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. From memory, the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) was a member of the relevant industry committee and was one of the signatories to a report with a recommendation to that effect. The full extension of the scheme to tourism providers

         The reduction of the eligible threshold limit from $30,000 to $20,000 is also supported. The restriction of the scheme to firms with a turnover of no more than $50 million per annum is also supported, as is the upper limit of $25 million in export earnings. A couple of minor measures are also supported, including the three per cent calculation for communication costs.

         What is strongly opposed are those measures which form the heart of the government's two bills.

         document, which was distributed and circulated by the then shadow minister for trade and now Minister for Trade in the run&amp;hyphen;up to the election, refers to maintaining the export market development grants scheme, continuing the innovative agricultural marketing program, maintaining the international trade enhancement scheme and maintaining the Asia-Pacific

         I also note in the document there is a commitment to `welcoming the contribution of the business community through chambers of manufactures and chambers of commerce and industry and other similar bodies to improve international trade performance'. So there is in this document an expressed commitment to consult with the relevant business community and to heed their remarks. Similar commitments are made in the coalition's industry and commerce policy, which was released by the now Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore).
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The present government's election commitments went beyond those general comments. On page 40 of the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Meeting our commitments
         </emphasis>
         document, which the now Treasurer (Mr Costello) released in the concluding stages of the election campaign, the Treasurer proposed as the to&amp;hyphen;be government's financial commitments a reduction to generate savings from greater efficiencies in Austrade and the export market development grants scheme of a total of $58.3 million—a combined reduction in expenditure from Austrade and the export market development grants scheme of $58.3 million.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The export market development grants scheme measures implemented by this piece of legislation reduce expenditure in EMDG alone by $426 million over four years. In the Austrade area, the annual reductions in appropriations are over $90 million per annum. So the first point to be made in respect of these measures is that they are in breach of expressed election commitments given by the opposition.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Secondly, this legislation in respect of EMDG is in breach of personal undertakings and commitments given by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade while in opposition, and that is a matter that I refer to more in sorrow than in anger.

         The Association is extremely concerned about the threat to the future of the scheme, especially in view of the Government's election commitment to maintain it.

         So, in the course of discussions with exporters in the run&amp;hyphen;up to the election, the now Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade gave personal commitments and undertakings to relevant export associations that the EMDG scheme would continue until 1999—on the five&amp;hyphen;year review cycle that we have seen over the years—without fiddling amendments.

         The third point the second reading amendment refers to is that these measures occur at precisely the time at which the government's own papers show that the net contribution of exports to growth in GDP will be negative.

So at precisely that point in the cycle where the government's own papers forecast a negative contribution of net exports to growth in GDP, the government is gutting one of the most successful trade and export enhancement measures that has been in operation in this country since 1974.

         In the government's own budget papers, if you look at the portfolio budget documents, Budget Related Paper No. 17 at page 87, you find that the success measure for the EMDG scheme is said to be an export performance ratio of 33:1. That measure, contained in the government's own budget related papers, occurs at precisely the same time as the Deputy Prime Minister announces the gutting and narrowing of this scheme.

         That export performance, or export ratio, does not come out of the blue. The export market development grants scheme has been in operation since 1974 and over the years we have seen a myriad of reviews. In some respects the EMDG scheme has been reviewed to death. I will not go through very many of the reviews in any detail, but the first significant recent review of the EMDG scheme was the Hughes report of July 1989. That report recommended that the scheme continue for a further five years and drew attention in the course of the report's deliberations to the enhancement of an export culture and the incentives that the scheme provides to emerging exporters and exporters.

         In the course of this report and in others, very many suggestions have been made for improvements or modifications to the scheme. They have been considered by the parliament and by many other people in the course of the years. There has never been any great difficulty on either side of the House, whichever side we occupy, in having a look at the various reports, having a look at the various suggestions for change, and dealing with them and considering them on their merits.

          The great difficulty with these particular changes is that they have not been made on merit. The Minister for Trade walked into the ERC, was given a global allocation of $150 million and told to make sure the scheme fell within that amount. He did not go through the objective process or the objective review, which has occurred over the years, of trying to discern which measures were effective, which measures would continue to be of assistance and incentive to Australian exporters. He simply got his budget bottom line and, when you look at Budget Related Paper No. 17, to which I have referred, the explanation for the gutting of the scheme is referred to simply as to meet the ERC savings target identified by the ERC in April of last year. There has been no objective review which has seen these measures come about as there has been in the past.

          The scheme attracted over 1200 new claimants who lodged grant applications in the 1995-96 financial year. $202 million in grants were paid during the year to 3,251 claims. Recipients in the 1995-96 financial year achieved $5.7 billion in exports resulting in a ratio of exports to grants of 28:1.

As the member for Canberra would well know, and as I am quite happy to say—I share the minister's vigilance in ensuring that this particular scheme is not abused—when you have a look at the scheme through its tenure, on the most recent briefing I have had on fraud against this scheme, the scheme has been abused by less than one per cent of its appropriations over the years. For an open&amp;hyphen;ended scheme which relies upon the integrity of exporters, that is not a result which is at variance with any general defalcation or fraud on any Commonwealth scheme.

           When you have discussions with exporters, whether it is by way of meeting with them out in the field, by way of taking anecdotal evidence or by way of reading submissions, they all say that airfares are absolutely essential to them, that it is important they establish contacts on the ground in the market destination and that, for companies who are particularly involved in intellectual property or in services, things like patent registration and technical information are important to them.

           Recently I was in Adelaide and met with Hamiltons Pharmaceuticals.

           There are two aspects to the retrospectivity. The bulk of these measures, all but one, were announced on budget night, 20 August 1996, to take effect from 1 July 1996.

Because this has to date been an open&amp;hyphen;ended scheme, companies make commitments well in advance of that. So there is an element of retrospectivity which adversely affects exporters. Worse than that was the retrospective effect of the proposed removal of trusts from the scheme.

          —I am delighted tonight to stand and add my contribution to the debate on the Export Market Development Grants Bill 1997. I do have somewhat of a history in talking about this particular government measure. My research assistant today brought me a file of copies of speeches I have made over a number of years in this House about EMDG, and I have to say that it was a rather thick folder—not quite as voluminous as the stack of reports of the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith). Nonetheless, from time to time I have had a few words to say about this scheme.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The EMDG scheme is now 22 years old, and at the outset of my remarks I congratulate the department on the putting together of this bill. After 22 years of operation, reports, amendment after innumerable amendment and changes to the scheme, we finally have a new and rationalised bill that is easy to read and understand. It is logical in sequence and very well put together. It is in plain English, so that even a non-lawyer like me can relatively easily understand the provisions of the bill. The legislation that this bill replaces is not only old but also extremely complex, very difficult to follow and had created a great deal of confusion throughout industry. I might say, it probably made a lot of money for lawyers, practitioners, accountants and others in helping companies to try to deal with this issue.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I will go back to what this bill is all about. The object of this act is to bring benefits to Australia by encouraging the creation, devel

          opment and expansion of foreign markets for Australian goods, services, intellectual property and know&amp;hyphen;how. It does so by providing for an assistance scheme under which small and medium Australian exporters committed to, and capable of, seeking out and developing export business are repaid part of their expenses incurred in promoting those products.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In listening to the honourable member for Perth, I rather got the idea that he thinks the scheme should forever be an open-ended scheme which would commit Australian taxpayers to increasing amounts of expenditure for ongoing export development work. I thought the intent of the original act was—and certainly the intent of today's bill is—as a leg&amp;hyphen;up, a bit of a help for small and medium sized businesses to become involved in the export marketing business.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We want our businesses to export. I heard the former government and its ministers time after time in this place come in and talk about manufacturers, providers of intellectual property, providers of services, and companies dealing in know&amp;hyphen;how as if they had no idea of what business opportunities they could avail themselves. The government simply said, `You must export.' I would go out and talk to my businesses, and they would say, `Look, the government says export, but what are they doing to help us? Are they doing anything to help us?'
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is one area that I constantly pointed out to them. It was a scheme that had been supported by most major political parties for 22 years. We do support the export market development grants scheme. For the member for Perth to say that the scheme has been  gutted or discontinued is an absolute nonsense. It has not. The scheme has been modernised and simplified. Sure, the scheme has been capped. In a sense, I probably regret the necessity for capping the scheme. However, I point out to the honourable member for Perth that, if his mob had done the right thing with forward projections and the budget in 1995, they would not have left us with the mess that we copped in 1996, with $10 billion of unfunded government promises to spend in the future.

          Where do you think the money was going to come from? The money has to come from somewhere. Do we continue to draw out of this bottomless well of funds which do not exist? Do we continue to put this kind of imposition on Australian taxpayers who are already not happy about the level of taxes they already support? Do we continue to put an impost on the Australian taxpayer to fund schemes to help industry continue to make better profits and to grow? I maintain that the intent of this scheme was always as a leg-up for small businesses and for medium sized businesses to get involved in the export market, to become efficient and productive, and to get out there and expand their exports as part of an overall government approach to exports.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I note that our exports are rising, particularly in manufactured goods and in intellectual property. The education sector's contribution to exports in Australia has expanded almost exponentially. The EMDG scheme has been very valuable. This streamlined, simplified rewritten bill in plain English now gives our businesses and their advisers a real good shot at understanding what complex legislation is all about and how it is to work every day.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The rules have been tightened in order to provide the right kind of assistance to the right people and for the right reasons. The tightening of the rules was not to exclude everyone but to make sure that we target this application of taxpayers' funds to the area likely to do us the most good and to businesses that honestly and sincerely need the most assistance—that is, small and medium sized businesses.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The new act implements the policy changes announced in the 1996 budget. In that sense, the cap on total EMDG spending is totally consistent with the government's approach to the 1996 budget, which was well received by the Australian public. It is still well received by the Australian public. It is certain that any company which is not able to receive as much benefit in the future from this program will be unhappy about that. If my pay were cut, I would not be very happy about that either. That is to be expected. That is in the nature
          <break page="2348" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           of human beings, businesses and all good things. But that is no reason for the opposition to come into this place and criticise the government for capping a scheme to prevent excess expenditure of Australian dollars.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This scheme is about helping small and medium sized businesses export the eligible products that they may export in accordance with the requirements of the bill: our goods, our services, our intellectual property and our know&amp;hyphen;how. There is a whole range of principle amendments to the act. The first amendment—the one which I will take the few minutes left to me tonight to talk about—is the one which finally says that the tourism industry is equal in status to all the other industries in Australia.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The member for Perth spoke about this issue tonight. He said that the opposition fully supports the fact that we implemented an election pledge to bring the tourism industry into line with everybody else and finally recognise it as a  full player with respect to this scheme. I have said many times that we generically support the tourism industry through major funding every year to allow the tourism industry to advertise Australia to the rest of the world, to tell other people around the world what a great place this is, what a tremendous climate we have, how wonderful our people are, how hospitable we are, what a beautiful environment we have and the many features that might attract them to come visit with us.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          However, for years and years we have said, `For export services, we consider the tourism industry has enough assistance in a generic sense so we will not help small and medium sized single service tourism operators to  advertise their products overseas.' We do not want them to help us go from the generic sense to the nitty&amp;hyphen;gritty. For example, somebody might say to a travel agent in New York city or in Palermo or in Linz, Austria, `I think I would like to go to Australia. I saw this great ad on television. I read something in a magazine or a newspaper. Have you got any brochures on where I might stay?' The answer might be, `No, we don't have any of those.' Why do we not have any of them? Who is going to supply those brochures? The owners
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           and operators of the specific tourism facilities in my electorate and all over Australia are the ones that will advertise those specific locations. But it is very difficult for them to target the entire world. So they are going to have to limit their meagre funds where they can do the best job.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I have maintained for a long time that the application of EMDG to single service tourism operators would be of great benefit to Australia. In 1994 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, of which I was a member, reported to the House in its report entitled
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Undersold overseas
          </emphasis>
          that tourism should be treated equally to everyone else. What did the minister do? The minister rejected our advice.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Later in 1994-95 the government finally brought in a proposal, after much pushing and mush pressure from the then opposition and now government, to make tourism operators half equal. They said, `You cannot get a 50 per cent return on the dollar; you can get a 25 per cent return, though.' So they sort of came halfway. Finally, thank goodness, this government has implemented good policy. It has said that tourism operators are just like anybody else, and they deserve a shot at export market development grants where applicable and if they spend the money.

You go into a nursing home because you have been assessed by the aged assessment team as category 1 to 5 and you need to be there. It is not a matter of choice; it is because you need to be there. So, at the time in life when women most need help, what this government is saying to them is, `If you are one of those women, come 1 July of this year you will be forced to sell up or rearrange your financial affairs to find the money that is needed to meet the entry fee contribution.'

          —Tonight I rise to congratulate all those who were involved in organising and participating in the parliament's first youth suicide seminar held on Friday, 28 February and opened by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). I want to place on the record a particular acknowledgment of the work of the federal member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs in making the seminar such a success.

         I was pleased to attend this seminar a few weeks ago. I believe it is an extremely important issue in the context of today's society and that we need to do all we can as politicians to encourage and support solutions to youth suicide. It is true that the youth suicide rate has risen alarmingly, particularly over the last 15 years. I was absolutely astounded by figures from the Australian Institute of Criminology which suggest that every day in Australia there are six completed suicides and 180 attempts. Our country has one of the highest suicide rates in the industrialised world.

        <para first-indent="16">
         No matter how you look at these figures, it is a devastating blight on our society. Youth suicide is not an issue which we can sweep under the covers or bury behind closed doors. It is an issue which in many cases is cloistered in intergenerational codes of silence. It is a problem that is growing, it is a problem which is becoming much more complex and it is a problem which is costing lives. It  cannot be assumed that even our own neighbourhoods are immune to suicide. I know that there are many cases in my own electorate of Petrie where no words can explain the heartbreak, the destruction and the loss felt by families who are caught in these particular situations. What drives our kids to self&amp;hyphen;destruction and what leads our young people to

         One of the speakers at the conference, whom I found very informative a few weeks ago, was Associate Professor Pierre Baume. He is a Brisbane based professor and is at Griffith University. He is the Director of the Australian Institute for Suicide Research and Prevention. A recognised person in the fields of suicide support and prevention, he was previously Chairman of the National Health and Medical Research Council suicide prevention committee. Recently, Professor Baume completed a paper which was titled `Cybersuicide: the role of interactive suicide notes on the Internet' with co-authors Dr Christopher Cantor and Mr Andrew Rolfe from the Australian Institute for Suicide Research and Prevention.

        <para first-indent="16">
         When Professor Baume spoke about this issue of suicide on the Internet at the seminar a few weeks ago, he stunned the room with stories and instances of the Internet acting as a medium between life and death. As my learned colleagues would be aware, the Internet and cyberspace is capturing the attention of more and more Australians on a daily basis—a technology where the only limit is one's imagination. The research paper found that there was a really strong preoccupation towards suicide on the Internet. The report states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Suicide features in an enormous range of internet resources. A search for the word `suicide' using a number of search engines has revealed thousands of matches.

        <para style="Para">
         The report also deals with tributes to suicide victims, electronic mailing lists, suicide notes and people using news groups and talk programs to transmit and promote the art of suicide. Notes can be found on the Internet pages detailing torrid stories and people threatening to take their own lives. What we
         <break page="2351" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          are dealing with here is virtual reality where the surreal is playing mind games. It is not fiction from a novel nor drama from a television series. It is real life lost through the keyboard. It seems that the Internet has the potential to influence behaviour here. It may be a medium which is only very new, but the level of influence cannot ever be underestimated.

         In concluding, an important point is made in the research paper which deserves repeating:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         Cybersuicide is now a reality. We can ignore it, or we can develop new strategies to promote the positive nature of interaction of this kind as well as to minimise its negative impact, for those communication conduits have limitless potential.

        <para style="Para">
         High&amp;hyphen;tech suicide is definitely becoming the suicide of the future and it is important that we take an integrated approach and a coordinated approach in tackling this problem. We need to work jointly as a community to ensure that we prevent these suicide strategies.

          —As honourable members would be aware and indeed the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) is certainly aware, yesterday was St Patrick's Day, which was enthusiastically commemorated throughout Australia and rightly so. Australia is, after Ireland, the most Irish country in the world. About 30 per cent of the people who live in this country have some Irish antecedent, be it a grandparent or a great grandparent or, in recent years, they themselves came from Ireland. Often, the Irish looked to America as the place where the Irish went.

         Indeed, this country is where the Irish not only came but were very successful. I suppose, in some ways, they took over the political system. While the Irish were still struggling in Ireland, the Irish in Australia  had in many parts of this country become the ascendancy. Most of those Irish people or people of Irish descent in Australia tend to forget the reasons that their antecedents came here to Australia. But there are a number of people who have formed a committee in Sydney, people like Tom Power, Ian Caruth,
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          Terrie Pollard and Annie Rahe, who want to get Australians of Irish descent to understand what that very seminal change in Irish history was about that occurred 150 years ago: the great famine.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The great famine is something that anyone whose parents, grandparents or great grandparents who live in Australia knows was a reason that their relations left Ireland and came to Australia. Most of us do not understand too clearly why that was. The famine is something that is not really understood in this country because we are so far from Ireland and that Irish experience.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But this group of people in Sydney wants to set up a memorial to the famine. On the 150th anniversary of the famine, which occurred between 1845 and 1848, it is useful for all of us of Irish descent, and all Australians who believe in justice, to think about what happened there in Ireland at that time, because, while half a million people came to Australia during the 19th century from Ireland around the famine time or just after, a lot of that history has been forgotten in this country. There are some terrible statistics about that famine that we should recall. In 1845, the population of Ireland was 8.6 million. In 1850 the population was 5.5 million. Between 1845 and 1850, 1.1 million people died of starvation and two million of them left their country and went to the US, Australia and to other parts of the English&amp;hyphen;speaking world.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Between 1800 and 1899, in that century, nine million people left Ireland. In 1900, 30 per cent of all Australians were of Irish descent—at present it is a little bit more. In 1910 the population of Ireland, only 55 years after the beginning of the famine, was 4.3 million—less than half of what it had been 65 years before. These people in Sydney believe that it is important for the Australian understanding of the Irish tradition that we should erect a statue to commemorate those women who came from Ireland to Australia, particularly those younger women, those young orphaned girls, many thousands of whom came to this country, who were made homeless after the death of their parents. They indeed became the pioneer women of the outback of Australia.

        <break page="2352" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          Many of those female orphans were dispersed to remote areas of Australia. Within the first three years, 70 per cent of them had married. As one author put it, `They married early, had large families and long widowhoods. They were indeed the pioneer women of the outback of Australia.'
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          These people want to erect a statue in Sydney to commemorate those orphan girls. This parliament should recognise the great work that Tom Power and his committee are doing to resurrect that very important part of this history of Australia. On the day after St Patrick's Day, when we have all celebrated the more joyous part of Australian-Irish history, we should understand the very important contribution that the famine and those orphan girls made to this country.

         Of equal concern to that particular matter in Gilmore was the return to what I might best call grassroots democracy within the Victorian municipalities of my state when over the course of last weekend 53 councils had returned to democracy after what might best be called a three&amp;hyphen;year hiatus. I would like to briefly commend the successes of several of my friends and colleagues—notably Councillor Bill Nixon, who was tonight sworn in as the inaugural mayor of the city of Kingston, and the first-time councillors elected in that municipality, notably Di Comtesse, Darlene Salisbury and John Ronk. Equally, in the city of Casey, I commend people like Janet Halsell on her election and, in the city of Frankston, my colleague Bill McCluskey for a stirling job that he did in campaigning to gain election as the councillor for the ward of Buninyong.

          editorial of 18 March, that `this should bode well for ratepayers'. However, there is no doubt now a cloud hanging over this return to democracy following the comments of the Victorian state Minister for Planning, the Hon. Robert Maclellan, who said that any meddling, as he put it, with planning issues by newly elected councillors could see them forfeit some of their new powers to their CEOs.

         editorial puts it, `determined to curb the rights of councillors to involve themselves in what is one of the most important facets of their job'. That same Minister for Planning, Mr Maclellan, recently told a meeting of council CEOs that, if councillors were seen to be meddling in planning issues, they could relinquish some of those planning powers to CEOs, who themselves would become the responsible authority. This is no doubt nothing more nor less than an outrageous attack on democracy and is symptomatic of the arrogant state government in my state that day by day loses touch with the Victorian people.

         Planning has been a major concern of local residents within various municipalities under the commissioners, and the Kennett government would have realised that planning was of course a serious factor when candidates were campaigning in the recent council elections. There has been `a sense of residential certainty' which `has been replaced by ministerial call-ins, site&amp;hyphen;specific exemptions and ad hoc planning', to use the words of Mr Demetri Dollis in his letter to the

          As I said, Mr Maclellan's record over the past 4&amp;half; years is perhaps one of interventionist approaches to the max.

I urge Mr Maclellan to reconsider his sentiments and to allow newly elected councillors the opportunity to truly represent democratically their constituents and afford them the powers under planning arrangements.

         I probably will not have the opportunity to enter into the full debate but, as a former minister for trade, I have to say I am extremely disappointed with and concerned about the implications for Australian exports and the Australian economy of the changes which have been made which are, as my colleague the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) pointed out, a flagrant breach of an election promise—an election promise which, to my chagrin, was made in a debate with me at the National Press Club when the then Leader of the National Party and shadow minister, the now Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), was outlining the trade policies for the then opposition. We had a fairly robust but friendly debate at the National Press Club, and he made a very clear and unequivocal commitment, which has been clearly and unequivocally breached.

        <para first-indent="16">
         That in itself is a problem, but what worries me about this broken promise is its implications. All the research which I saw as minister for trade made it very clear that, first and foremost, EMDGs, the export market development grants, were an effective way of getting new exporters into the field and helping small to medium enterprises which wish to export to make the transition successfully.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The consequence of that for the broader Australian economy is its impact on the capacity of the economy to sustain a rate of growth sufficiently high to get down our unemployment. Research shows that the trajectory of growth that is sustainable, without running into a current account deficit problem, is influenced by the proportion of our economic output that is exported. The export market development grants scheme was one of a number of initiatives which were influencing that proportion favourably and therefore creating the potential for the Australian economy to grow and to grow at a rate sufficient to maintain four per cent plus growth and therefore to sustain continuing  falls in unemployment, which Australia so sorely needs.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (1) The AFP is the primary law enforcement agency through which the Commonwealth pursues its law enforcement interests. The AFP is unique in Australian law enforcement in that its functions include both community policing in the Australian Capital Territory and the protection of the interests

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        The AFP is an integral part of the law enforcement and policing matrix of Australia.

        (2) The AFP provides support and enhances the international law enforcement obligations of the Commonwealth and maintains a high profile in the international law enforcement arena. The activities of the AFP overseas liaison officer network and the Interpol National Criminal Bureau (NCB) are central to achievements in this area.

        AFP liaison officers provide a valuable resource for intelligence and investigations on a wide range of criminal activity.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        The AFP has recognised and addressed a critical need to complement its professional fraud investigation team resources. It now employs specialists in forensic accountancy, international financial systems and computing technology. It also employs lawyers with the required skills and experience to provide investigators with specialist advice on the intricacies of legislation under which fraud offences may occur.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        White-collar criminal activity frequently involves breaches of State and Commonwealth criminal and regulatory legislation. The pursuit of evidence often will be helped by access to the intelligence and information holdings of agencies such as the AFP, State police services, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) and the Australian Securities Commission (ASC). Considerable emphasis is placed on the cooperative aspects of investigations.

        Organised crime was defined by the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Review (CLER) as a systematic and continuing conspiracy to commit serious offences. Organised crime involves fraud, extortion, drug trafficking and money laundering. Technological, political and economic developments have aided the growth of organised crime which has taken advantage of technological change, the globalisation of the world's economy and the larger movement of people, cash and goods around the world.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        To effectively counter the pervasiveness of organised crime, the AFP has actively pursued the development of cooperative strategic partnerships within law enforcement. Such partnerships ensure that the widest possible range of modern intelligence resources and techniques is available and employed to attack organised crime in this country.

        No single policing agency in Australia can combat the threat of organised crime to Australian society.

        The AFP has been undergoing an extensive reorganisation and evaluation process over the last two years.

Through this process the AFP believes it will then be better placed to provide the Government with a cogent and accurate assessment of resource needs.

This Corporate Plan, prepared in 1995, acknowledged that the exemption from dividends was to be reviewed by 30 June 1996 as the $750 million capital program would by then be completed. It was recognised that under then prevailing provisioning arrangements, the outcome of the review might cause a revision of projections for years after 1995/96.

        (3) The DHA's housing program for 1996&amp;hyphen;97 in Corporate Plan 1996&amp;hyphen;99 provides for capital expenditure of $94.4 million, and also provides for an accelerated debt repayment program over previous planning. In addition the DHA has made a major policy change from ownership of housing to an emphasis on long term leasings from the private sector housing investment market whenever feasible. The capital program is therefore less indicative than previously of planned housing achievements.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (4) The DHA's housing program in any year is a blend of meeting essential Defence Force operational requirements and making staged changes to the housing stock that match the DHA's planned available resources, such as reducing the numbers of members renting privately and upgrading the older stock. However, in the period between developing the 1995/96 and 1996/97 housing programs, the DHA has considerably expanded the numbers of houses delivered through leasing rather than purchase or construction. The DHA therefore does not need to have the same level of capital funds to  meet the same level of housing outcomes as in previous years.

         —The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        In relation to (a) and (b) only those persons who are recognised as native title holders by the common law are entitled to a determination of native title, and for this reason not all traditional owners or Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders will necessarily succeed in obtaining such a determination. It is essential for a successful determination that the claimants show that they have maintained a continuing connection with the land or waters concerned in accordance with their traditional laws and customs. The concept of "native title holders", however, is not synonymous with "traditional owner" as the native title rights of some traditional owners may have been extinguished or otherwise ceased.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        In terms of whether the persons referred to in the question would be able "to reside within lands for which title has been or shall be granted under the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         Native Title Act", the answer to the question is in two parts.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        First, native title is not in fact "granted" under the Native Title Act 1993 (the NTA). The NTA provides for the making of determinations that native title exists or does not exist in relation to an area of land or waters and details the processes which are to be followed in order to establish whether or not native title exists. Before the NTA was enacted, a determination of native title could be sought through the courts under the common law. A determination that native title exists is the formal recognition of the pre&amp;hyphen;existing common law rights that have been and are still held by the persons who are the subject of the determination. The concept of a "determination" is distinct from the concept of a "grant" where a right is conferred on a person who does not already hold that right. As native title rights already exist, they may be exercised whether or not there has been determination under the Native Title Act. After a determination that native title exists has been made, native title may be held by a body corporate on behalf of the native title holders, or it may be held directly by the native title holders with a body corporate acting as a representative for the holders in certain matters affecting their native title.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Second, the issue of whether the native title rights of a particular group of native title holders include the right to reside on land subject to their native title will depend on the particular facts and tenure history of the areas concerned and on the customary laws giving rise to the native title. This can only be assessed on a case by case basis.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        As native title is not a "tenure" within the normal understanding of that term in Anglo&amp;hyphen;Australian property law, it is not appropriate to speak of "security of tenure" in relation to native title.
        <break page="2375" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         Security of title of native title holders, however, is a matter dealt with by the NTA. Paragraph 3(a) of that Act states that one of the purposes of the Act is the recognition and protection of native title.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Native title holders are entitled to the protection afforded their title by the NTA and the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 regardless of whether there has been a formal determination that their native title exists. However, the protection given by these Acts does not mean that native title cannot be adversely affected or extinguished. Like other interests in land or waters, native title is not immune from acts of the Crown. Under the common law, native title is susceptible to extinguishment by the Crown, for example by the valid grant of an interest which is inconsistent with the continued existence of native title. It can also be surrendered by the native title holders or die out by reason of loss of continuing connection to the area concerned. Since the commencement of the NTA, native title has only been able to be extinguished or affected in accordance with the NTA. Under the NTA, as is the case with other interests in land or waters, native title can be compulsorily acquired by the Crown, and may be validly affected by certain other acts (known as future acts).
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        The NTA establishes processes to be followed when future acts are done, with the nature of the acts determining which processes are to be followed. Apart from the acts specified in subsection 26(2) of the NTA (which include the grant of mining interests), the general rule is that native title holders are to be accorded the same procedural rights in relation to a future act on land as they would have if they instead held freehold title to that area. The process to be followed in relation to the grant of mining interests and the other acts to which subsection 26(2) applies is known as the right to negotiate and does not amount to power of veto. It is a right to negotiate about a proposed act and if no agreement is reached, to have the matter determined by an arbitrator.
