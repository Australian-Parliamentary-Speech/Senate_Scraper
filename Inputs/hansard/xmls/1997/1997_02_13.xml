          —I wish to address my remarks to two appropriations in particular. The first of those concerns the government's plan to construct Sydney's second international airport at Holsworthy, a subject which would interest the member for Hughes (Mrs Vale)—in fact she is so excited she has had to take a seat at the mere mention of Holsworthy international airport in her electorate. The second issue is the government's plans for deregulation in the petrol industry.

         Holsworthy airport has been the major controversy in my electorate and, indeed, throughout the suburbs of the south&amp;hyphen;west of Sydney. I think the original community reaction was one of disbelief—the idea that, having gone through such an extensive airport debate in Sydney for some 18 months without any mention of a Holsworthy proposition by the coalition, straight after the election it would be on the drawing board. Residents could not believe the deceit and the way in which they had been misled by the coalition with its extensive promises about airports. Thereafter, disbelief has mobilised itself into protests and agitation. An extensive campaign is being launched against the airport and the government's folly in trying to site it at Holsworthy, so close to large residential areas in the south&amp;hyphen;west.

          tion of the petrol industry.When the federal government talks about terminal access it only means physical access—the right to purchase wholesale petrol but on terms and conditions dictated by the oil majors. The Trade Practices Act needs to be amended to entrench competitive price access into the laws of the Commonwealth. This would apply the same market principles which the oil majors apply to themselves through the horizontal sharing of terminal facilities. This is the great irony of the current market structure—petrol purchased from a BP franchise might actually have been supplied by a Shell terminal. The majors are willing to lower their costs by sharing terminal products between themselves but they will not allow the retail sector to lower its costs through competitive wholesale pricing.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Downstream access more than ever is essential to fair competition in the petrol retail sector. Woolworths is  presently establishing itself as another vertically integrated major with access to cheap wholesale petrol. Predictably enough it has also established horizontal alliances with the other majors. Unless branded and franchised stations can also access cheaper wholesale petrol they face closure at the hands of Woolworths. The federal government, despite all its election promises, has endorsed the closure of 3,000 service station small businesses with the subsequent loss of some 15,000 jobs in regional Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This rationalisation should not proceed on such an unlevel playing field. This is the purpose of establishing downstream access. Small petrol retailers will not need the resources of a Woolworths and have to establish their own terminal infrastructure to competitively access wholesale petrol. Existing service stations in country towns will have the same terminal access rights as any new competitor. The Senate is considering an amendment this morning which would deliver this legal access right and the basic principles of fair competition for Australia's petrol industry. Those amendments sponsored by the Labor Party in the Senate would shift market power from the large oil multinationals to the small business retail sector and consumers. It
         <break page="873" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Three days ago I mentioned how these reforms have the potential to lower petrol prices by up to 6c a litre. It is now possible to quantify the benefits beyond the per litre rate. In fact they can be quantified to the extent of $1 billion per annum. That is the cost of the vertically integrated nature of the petrol industry in Australia—$1 billion that sits in the coffers of the big petrol companies. By breaking up the vertically integrated control of the industry, that $1 billion surplus would effectively transfer to the pockets of Australian motorists, farmers, tourism operators and industry throughout the country.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is how that $1 billion calculation is arrived at. Each year in Australia motorists purchase approximately 18 billion litres of petrol. Of that, some 75 per cent is sold through franchised service station outlets. The wholesale price of fuel to those franchisees is controlled by the setting of the maximum endorsed wholesale price by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Included in the MEWP is an allowance to the major oil companies of 7.1c per litre for marketing. Freight costs are also set by the ACCC. Franchise service station operators are prohibited from sourcing fuel from other than franchisor oil companies. Franchisees are always charged the highest wholesale price for fuel simply because they are a captive market. That wholesale price is then reflected in the retail price charged to motorists.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Under the wholesale price capping the companies are allowed no more than 7.1c per litre for marketing. The companies are not required to demonstrate that this amount, which equates to more than $1 billion, is expended. Ironically, the companies have long sought to increase the amount but it has been contained under price surveillance to that level. However, in the absence of the wholesale price cap companies would seek to and would in practice secure more than 7.1c per litre through the market. The means of the oil companies achieving this would be through the exclusive supply ties that they have with their franchisees. That is, the wholesale price
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          to franchisees would rise and they would in the absence of being able to source fuel elsewhere have to pass that cost on to motorists. This 7.1c per litre is in effect the cost of vertical integration within the fuel industry.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Importantly, the difference between the Woolworths buy price and that of the major oil companies is approximately 8 to 9c per litre. Woolworths' capacity to buy fuel that much cheaper is therefore evidence of the low cost operation of that company. As to the cost of the vertical integration and the tied arrangements in the petroleum industry, that cost might be calculated as follows: eighteen billion litres of fuel are sold to motorists each year; of that, 75 per cent is sold by franchisees—the equivalent of 13.5 billion litres per annum. Oil companies are allowed 7.1c per litre plus freight, so assume an average of 8c per litre excess wholesale price allowance to oil majors—that is, 8c per litre of petrol sold through the pump. The total cost to motorists is $1.08 billion per annum, and that goes to the major petrol companies through the vertical integration and control of this industry.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It should be noted further that BP, Shell and Mobil are all foreign owned companies. Australian Petroleum Pty Ltd, while majority Australian owned, is approximately 37.5 per cent foreign owned. Therefore the $1.08 billion vertical integration dividend to the oil companies is not being returned in the main to investors in Australia. Virtually all the profits generated from that dividend are being remitted to head offices overseas, with a consequent impact on our balance of payments. So there is no doubt that major benefits will flow to motorists and petrol consumers throughout Australia from breaking up the vertical integration of this industry—from in fact establishing a downstream access regime. I hope that that is the result of the Senate deliberations this morning.

         I now turn to ALP price watch and some of the remarks that have been made regarding our campaign by the Ampol company in particular. Ampol has made a number of claims in the media in recent times which need to be challenged and exposed by this parliament. For instance, it has held out
         <break page="874" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          terminal access as one of the reforms in which it is engaged but in fact it is offering terminal access for new customers only. Old customers do not get that access right. In practice it has little meaning indeed. Ampol also promised not to increase its prices through the Australia Day long weekend  but I noted a shabby practice—a swindle on farmers—in the Young district of New South Wales. While Ampol may have maintained their wholesale price at the midweek level they engaged in a practice in the Young district which should be investigated by the ACCC.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Farmers in the Young district, Australia's biggest cherry growing region, in the middle of their harvesting, were being charged more than 80c a litre by Ampol&amp;hyphen;Caltex for property delivered super petrol while the service station price remained at 77c. Normally the delivery price would be well below the pump price due to bulk purchases that farmers make. Ampol&amp;hyphen;Caltex was also charging 2c a litre more than the market price for diesel fuel. It is perhaps more than coincidental that the price hike by Ampol&amp;hyphen;Caltex came at a time when farmers in the Young district needed to consume large amounts of fuel at the peak of the cherry season. Independent fuel distributors explained the increase by pointing to the way in which Ampol subsidised service stations in country towns where Woolworths has started to compete at the pump but then, at the same time, increased the home delivery price to restore its profit margin.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is a worrying trend. If the oil majors are to compete against Woolworths in country towns by slugging farmers by increasing the home delivery price on petrol as an effective cross&amp;hyphen;subsidisation of their pump price, then that is a practice which needs to be halted. Why should farmers, at the peak of their season, be penalised for the fact that there is a new competitor—Woolworths—in the town petrol market? This is matter that National Party members opposite, instead of engaging in chitchat, should be doing something about. It is a shameful thing.

          —This is the Australia Day long weekend just passed. You were in government last Australia Day long weekend and you should be aware, as someone who prides himself on being a National Party member, that farmers in the Young district were paying prices 3c and 4c more expensive for home delivered petrol than at the pump in town. Here they are, buying in bulk, and paying more for that practice. This is a business practice engaged in by Ampol, and perhaps other oil majors, which must be halted. Farmers should not be penalised for the fact that Woolworths might be competing at the pump in country towns. Ampol, clearly, was cross&amp;hyphen;subsidising its town pump price by charging farmers more for their home delivery.

         I turn now to Ampol's claim to transparency with its fuel prices. It has made a great deal in the public arena of the fact that it is placing its fuel prices on the Internet. Let me explain some of the facts in practice. On Friday, 24 January the average monthly prices posted on the Internet by Ampol were for the month of November 1996, some two months earlier. Thus those prices bear no relation to current retail prices, irrespective of what Ampol may imply it posts on the Internet. There is no transparency. There is no relevance in putting prices on the Internet that are dated by seven to eight weeks. Ampol posts on the Internet average monthly prices for city and country for each state, for the Northern Territory and for the ACT. These prices are average prices for all Ampol&amp;hyphen;Caltex sites for a whole month, after the event. These prices are not present retail prices or dealer buying prices on offer; they are historical prices of no relevance or practical use to consumers making a market judgment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Ampol does not post on the Internet actual retail or real wholesale prices at its sites on a
         <break page="875" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          daily or other fluctuating basis. All it does is list daily a single national wholesale price which may bear no relationship to transacted prices. These price averages do not reflect the price&amp;hyphen;volume relationships and very low price&amp;hyphen;volume sales locations artificially reduce the more prevailing widespread prices. These posted after&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;event average wholesale prices do not equate to actual retail or wholesale prices experienced by consumers and retailers.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In addition, the price list may not equate to any other dealer's buying price because of the way in which Ampol's market area pricing system operates. Under this system, an individual dealer's buying price is determined according to prices set by Ampol nominated reference sites in the vicinity of the Ampol dealer. However, the composition of the pool of reference sites is subject to change without reason and does not necessarily include all of the sites in the vicinity of the dealer. Thus a market leader, such as Liberty or Burmah, may not be included and the Ampol dealer may find himself at a competitive disadvantage compared to those sites.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As for the other oil companies, the point that retailers constantly make about rebates or price support is that these are paid retrospectively, usually a month or more in arrears. Retailers must pay the full listed wholesale price on the day that they purchase their fuel from the company and then claim the rebate at a later date. Thus, by the application of retrospective rebates, companies can affect the outcome averages for their prices, notwithstanding that consumers may actually have paid more than the average would suggest. In the case of Ampol and Caltex dealers, a retrospective rebate is not paid. Buying prices are determined by the MAP system, which may still mean that any one dealer's buying price is not competitive or reflective of average prices quoted after the event by Ampol.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For Ampol to say that it does not have equity in particular distributorships does not mean that it has no control over the distributor's buying price. Just as Ampol's retailers have a MAP system, so do its distributors. The nominated reference pool of
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          depots for distributors' prices is  subject to change without notice or reason and may not include all the distributor's competitors. Thus, while Ampol's list price may not change over a specified period, the distributor's MAP buying price may well change. To that extent, Ampol clearly has the central control over such prices in that it determines profitability of distributors and, through this part of the price mechanism, the prices themselves. Petrol prices in Melbourne during December and January—something you would be interested in, Mr Speaker—showed that, for much of that time, dealers were actually operating on an average negative margin and were to receive after&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;event rebates. To that extent, their prices were clearly controlled by their suppliers.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The opposition's petrol price watch scheme will provide a much more reliable, comprehensive and truly reflective indication of retail petrol prices than that posted by Ampol on the Internet. Ampol's Internet adventure is no more than the application of modern technology to old pricing practices by which consumers are mystified and confused. They get no practical benefit from prices that are dated by some seven to eight weeks. What Ampol really needs to do is to allow its retailers access to fuel at the lowest price it sells at.

         A lot of these issues in the petrol industry lean towards the technical and complex. They are very rarely dealt with in detail by the parliament. But I trust that, by explaining the way in which Ampol price transparency is effectively meaningless, by explaining the historical nature of the prices, by explaining the swindle that they placed on farmers in the Young district over the Australia Day long weekend and by explaining the limited access that they are offering to their terminals, the parliament might come to a better understanding of these petrol industry matters.

          —This morning I wish to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1996&amp;hyphen;97 in so much as it deals with the payment of legal fees by the Commonwealth for the member for Fremantle, Carmen Lawrence. That section of the bill is a provision of $49,776 for legal costs incurred by or an account of acting for Dr Carmen Lawrence in relation to the Marks inquiry.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is worth going through the chronology of events that led to the Carmen Lawrence defence fund being established by the Australian Labor Party and the fact that the action has now been taken by the solicitors Dunhill Madden Butler against the Commonwealth for the payment of those legal fees. It is worth establishing the fact that the Labor Party set up the Carmen Lawrence defence fund for a number of reasons and that even up to this date in 1997 those legal fees are still unpaid.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In June 1995, the cabinet decided, after some deliberation, to pay Minister Lawrence's legal costs. The then Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, Michael Lavarch, announced on 20 June in that year that the government would intervene
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          in an action to question the legality of the Marks Royal Commission in the High Court and that the Commonwealth would fund that challenge. On 21 June, the next day, the coalition indicated that they may not support the payment of Minister Lawrence's legal fees in their entirety, and from that point on the Commonwealth government at the time was on notice that there was a very real possibility that, in fact, the opposition and potentially the Democrats would not pay Minister Lawrence's legal fees for that section of the appeal to the High Court that dealt with the appointment of the Marks Royal Commission.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Finally, on 28 September in that year, the opposition announced that it would not support an appropriation for Minister Lawrence's legal fees, and Senator Spindler from the Australian Democrats confirmed, too, that he would insist on parliamentary approval for the payment of her legal costs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A month later, on 26 October, the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) was tabled by the government in parliament regarding Minister Lawrence's $800,000 legal fees, and another month later, on 28 November, the parliament voted down the appropriation for $240,000 for challenging the legitimacy of the Marks Royal Commission in the High Court. The Australian Labor Party inevitably accepted the amendment because they realised that it would be defeated in the Senate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         At that time, the government was well aware that the parliament, the supreme law making body in the Commonwealth, was not prepared to make an appropriation available for the payment of Carmen Lawrence's legal fees. However, from that time various senior ministers—Carmen Lawrence, Gareth Evans and Kim Beazley—made many statements about the issue of Carmen Lawrence's legal fees. On 29 November, Carmen Lawrence said that the cabinet decided that the bill should be met. On the same day, Kim Beazley said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         It is not our intention to fund that element of Mrs Lawrence's legal expenses by any other method than ultimately a recourse to parliament.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         The question I am raising this morning is whether, in fact, at the time Minister Lawrence and Minister Beazley were well aware
         <break page="877" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          that, in fact, the Commonwealth may have committed themselves to paying the legal fees of Carmen Lawrence and that many of these statements were disingenuously made.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It became more farcical as that month wore on, with Gareth Evans making statements like, `She could be faced with bankruptcy', in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Sydney Morning Herald
         </emphasis>
         . On 3 December, Mr Beazley was reported in the

         </emphasis>
         :
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Deputy Prime Minister Kim Beazley says it is imperative the Labor Party ensure that Carmen Lawrence is not bankrupted by having to pay legal fees arising  out of her court challenges to the Marks Royal Commission. Mr Beazley confirmed that Dr Lawrence would have to step down from parliament if she were made bankrupt.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         Then there is a quote from Mr Beazley:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         We could not let that happen, absolutely.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         And he said that the then Health Minister was a terrific political asset. Apart from whether Mr Beazley would repeat the assertion that she was a terrific political asset today, the fact remains that at that time it was quite possible—in fact, I am quite certain—that Mr Beazley, Mr Evans and Minister Lawrence were all aware that the cabinet had said that they would pay the legal fees for Dunhill Madden Butler and were probably aware that it may be the case that they would be forced to pay them regardless of anything that the parliament or anybody else decided. So the argument could be made that Minister Beazley and others were happy to circumvent the superiority of parliament over the cabinet in forcing payment of the legal fees of Carmen Lawrence.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But two days later, after the statements about bankruptcy, on 5 December the Carmen Lawrence defence fund was established by Gary Gray, the general secretary of the Labor Party, with two other trustees. From that time, money flowed to the Carmen Lawrence defence fund from such luminaries as the former member for Bass, Silvia Smith, who will be remembered by members, and from many unsuspecting members of the public who were led to believe by the ministers of that government that Minister Lawrence was likely to face bankruptcy if the Carmen Lawrence defence fund was not established.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am sure you can see the incongruity of the statements by the ministers as to the bankrpu
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          tcy of the then minister, Carmen Lawrence. The Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund was established in great excitement and a plethora of, `We have to save Carmen Lawrence because she is imperilled by the wicked, evil former opposition'—which is now the government—and in the knowledge on their part that the cabinet had potentially committed themselves to paying those legal fees. The only absolute amount of money that we know has been paid into the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund was $100,000, which Joan Kirner confirmed in January or February 1996. Other media reports suggest that the amount is closer to $244,000.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In summary, by 28 November 1995 the opposition had voted down the $240,000 component of Carmen Lawrence's legal fees associated with her challenge to the legitimacy of the Marks royal commission. From that moment, Labor figures such as Gareth Evans and Kim Beazley claimed that the opposition could drive Carmen Lawrence to bankruptcy. The Labor Party said they would not let that happen. On 5 December, the Labor Party established the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund, its trustees being Gary Gray, Joan Kirner and John Della Bosca. From 5 December, the ALP conducted a public campaign to raise money for the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Three questions therefore arise. Firstly, as the legal fees have not been paid to Dunhill Madden Butler, where are the proceeds of the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund? Are they sitting at Curtin House earning interest? If so, why haven't the legal fees been paid by the defence fund? Secondly, does the Labor Party expect that the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund will not have to pay the legal fees? In which case, has a fraud been perpetrated on those who donated to the fund believing they were doing so to stave off the potential bankruptcy of Carmen Lawrence? Thirdly, if the ALP expected that they would not have to pay, why were figures such as Gary Gray, Gareth Evans and Kim Beazley promoting the idea that Carmen Lawrence faced bankruptcy?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government's position is that the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund was established to pay the cost that parliament refused
         <break page="878" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          to pay and that the fund should be used for that purpose. As far as the government is aware, no payment has been made by the fund. The public and the donors to the fund may well ask why the fund has not been used. They may also ask about interest earned on that fund.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I do not intend to take up the time of the House at great length this morning but to simply put on the record some of these issues to do with the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund. This is the first opportunity we have had to do so in the parliament, and it arises because Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1996&amp;hyphen;97 lists payments for legal fees for Carmen Lawrence's legal actions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The final questions one needs to ask about the current members of the opposition are: why did Kim Beazley and Gareth Evans whip up hysteria about Carmen Lawrence's alleged potential bankruptcy when they knew as cabinet ministers that the bills may have to be paid by the Commonwealth? Why did the ALP establish the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund when they believed that the Commonwealth was responsible for the legal costs? Was the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund a ruse designed to deflect attention from the issue of Carmen Lawrence's veracity and create sympathy for her? Even the trustees of the fund, as late as yesterday, confirmed that they believed the Commonwealth would not have to pay. Gary Gray, your general secretary, said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Although the trustees have never assumed responsibility for paying the legal fees—
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         that is, the trustees of the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund—
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         we have always believed they were properly incurred by the Commonwealth. We did endeavour to raise as much as we could.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         So Mr Gray has confirmed that when the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund was established on 5 December 1995, the trustees of that fund believed that the Commonwealth was responsible for paying the legal fees. They then set out to conduct a public ruse that would raise vast sums of money from the public based on the idea that Carmen Lawrence faced potential bankruptcy when, in fact, she did not. Members of the public who
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          donated to the fund could be forgiven for being livid. They were led to believe that Carmen Lawrence was in danger of being bankrupted.

They need to understand that at no stage in my speech have I mentioned the Marks royal commission, the evidence that was presented to it or the veracity of Carmen Lawrence, whether she at any time lied to the commission or not. I have entirely stayed away from that issue and simply dealt with the fact that the Carmen Lawrence Defence Fund was established to pay legal costs and that the Commonwealth is now being sued by Dunhill Madden Butler to recover those costs.

The people in my community of Belconnen, Gungahlin, Jervis Bay and Wreck Bay have bestowed upon me a very important responsibility to represent their interests in this national parliament.

          My community has faced some very tough times recently. They have reflected their perception of those tough times in the vote expressed in the by&amp;hyphen;election. I will touch on the by&amp;hyphen;election results briefly. A number of prominent Liberals weighed into the by-election campaign, including people such as Gwen Wilcox, the former local Liberal president, Tony De Domenico and others. They supported a candidate, an Independent, Cheryl Hill, who described herself as a Liberal and an Independent.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This by-election was about Liberal ideology versus Labor values. The community in this by-election rejected the by&amp;hyphen;product of the conservative agenda. It expressed grave concern about where we are heading. People now feel less comfortable and relaxed than they ever have before. Labor received an eight per cent swing to it. The Independent Liberal almost halved her primary vote. Whilst in government Labor was criticised for not hearing the message sent to it from the Canberra by-election, I encourage the present government to listen to what the community is saying from the Fraser by-election.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Another pleasing outcome of the by-election was the performance of Ms Alice Chu, who was an Independent standing on a platform of racial tolerance and recognising the importance of a culturally diverse immigration program. Canberra is one of the most culturally diverse cities in the nation. Also in the by-election were two candidates standing on an anti-immigration platform. I am pleased to say that Ms Chu absolutely blitzed those candidates in the results of the by-election. Mainstream Australia has dispensed anti&amp;hyphen;immigration politics to the toilet bowl. We hope that it remains there.

         <para first-indent="16">
          One of the other interesting facets of the by-election result was that the pro&amp;hyphen;GST candidate polled extremely poorly. The electors have said yet again that they are not interested in this form of regressive taxation. The National Party leadership will be relieved to hear that the candidate supported by the shooters did not poll particularly well in the ACT.

          A commonly held belief about Canberra is that it was built because Sydney and Melbourne could not agree on where to house the nation's parliament. It is a misinformed view of Australia's history. The fact is that the states were uncomfortable about one state and one state only becoming the centre of the Australian universe. The concept of a national capital enabled Federation to take place where no one single state benefited beyond the others. I look forward to the day when the country's next Prime Minister will be in office and housed here once more.

One leg of our economy, the public sector, has been chopped off at the knee, it is true. The other leg, the private sector, is falling off.

          Funding cuts to higher education have hurt Canberra in a number of ways. In Canberra, higher education is a fairly significant industry. Many students come from outside the ACT to study here. We have had redundancies as a result of the funding cuts and consequently a reduction in the quality of training. The increase in HECS and the reduction in Austudy are discouraging students from taking on important courses like teaching and education. Cuts to skillshare, and privatising the delivery of skillshare, will hurt those people who cannot gain entry to higher education and cannot find employment.

          I would like to move now to health, which is another significant issue raised by electors in the by&amp;hyphen;election. Labor has, and has always had, support for a universal health care system. We would like to guarantee that everyone has access to quality health care, not just the privileged. That is why Labor delivered the Medicare system. The people of Australia agree with us. They agreed with us in 1993 when the previous leader of the then opposition promised to slash Medicare. The current government at the election promised to keep it, but Medicare is under the scalpel and it is my view that it is suffering the death of a thousand cuts. Over four years, $3.4 billion is being carved off the federal health budget. You cannot slash health without delivering a body blow to it.

He accused employers of wimping out on the ideology which he wanted to unleash on the industrial relations system, but the problem for some of the ideologues in the community is that business is there to do something. It is there to make money; it is not there to push wheelbarrows—and that is probably a good thing, too.

           As to unfair dismissals, I will briefly say that it is really more bureaucratic than it has ever been before. It requires employees to understand if their employer is a registered Australian corporation, if they work under a federal award and, if they are an employee of a territory or of the Commonwealth government, it requires the payment of a $50 lodgment fee, which is a pretty tough ask for someone who has just been sacked. It requires employees to sift through about 20 pages of forms, explanatory notes and applications for waivers, fees and so on to determine which path they are going to take in the dismissal process. Whilst the Liberals have preserved some of the protections that Labor implemented, some of the things that they complained about when in opposition, the outcome of the unfair dismissal changes has been a much more bureaucratic system.

There is little to be gained from things like dole diaries and work for the dole schemes, however they might be characterised. At the end of the day, what young people need and what people who are looking for work need is job opportunities. What people need when they are in the work force is a good quality and standard of living. That is the measure of our society's success, not how far we can screw down their standard of living and not how far profits can go up.

          I was interested in a number of things the member for Fraser had to say about the Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the success of the community and what is a successful community, and so on, because I think he is pretty much atypical of what we have seen from the Labor Party in the last 12 months—that is, they are in a position of denial. They are in a period of denial. They deny the result of the March election last year; they deny public opinion at the moment; they deny that they have no policies; they deny everything about themselves. In fact, they believe their last 13 years in parliament was a period of greatness for Australia, when the opposite is true in that we met record levels of debt and record levels of unemployment. This is what we were faced with over the last 13 years. The Labor Party have yet to accept and acknowledge the fact that the community has given them the message; they have refused to accept that message.

          Unemployment is a very serious issue in Australia, as the member for Fraser mentioned. Unemployment is a major concern and has been for some time. As I said in a speech yesterday, productivity is one of the reasons for unemployment in Australia because the more productive we become the less work we need to produce. Being more productive means less work, which means fewer jobs. As the member for Fraser mentioned, the importance of jobs for the community cannot be understated. This is a very important aspect of the entire nature of employment, and we should be considering some solutions.

But Working Nation was glorified too much. There was an increase in the number of unemployed, and unemployment amongst our youth was at an all-time high. There are approximately 100,000 young people who are unemployed, including 30,000 who have been unemployed for six months or longer—mostly because of

          I raised an example of this in the last parliament when one of these programs was advertised in my electorate. It was called `fun in the sun'. This program was advertised as being desperate to find young people to spend six months of fun in the sun. The Royal Life Saving Society was conducting the program. The program was called an aquatic care program. This is what it was advertising:

          According to the advertising pamphlet of this job program managed by the Labor Party, these cultural experiences will include fishing, sailing, powerboat driving, snorkelling, and pool and river care. I really have to question how many job opportunities there are in the community for abseilers, canoeists and wind surfers. They had a six&amp;hyphen;month program to do all those things.

They said, `No, unless you do it, you will be taken off benefits.' So he was forced to go along. He did not do any sunbaking. He did try the windsurfing and the body boarding but he wore a full&amp;hyphen;length shirt and a sunhat all the time. He said that he enjoyed the canoeing but was a bit upset by the abseiling. This

          These are the sorts of programs that were around. They were false programs; they were not real programs. We had people going into these programs for six months, but the real reason for this was to hide the unemployment figures. Once you put these people into a work program, you take them off the unemployment figures. So when they were saying that we had a reduction in the long&amp;hyphen;term unemployed, what was happening was that these young people were going into these sorts of programs. At the end of the six months when they could not get a job as an abseiler, they would have to go back on the unemployment figures. But they would not go as long-term unemployed; they would come back as new entries to the unemployment figures. The former government was able to manipulate the figures.

          The results are—if I remember rightly some of the figures I have read—that about 45 per cent of the unemployed are young people. The importance of young people to this nation cannot be understated. We have a very important task to nurture our young people from the day of birth right through to their adult years, because they are the future of our country. They are the future decision makers, the future policy makers and the future leaders of our community. Unless we look after them and show them some hope in a future, what will our country end up being? If we provide no hope at all to our young people, what return will they give to our country?

           One of the very serious concerns in the community at the moment is crime. I am sorry to report that there are some serious issues of crime within my own electorate of Cowan, and a lot of these are drug related, which must be a serious concern to all Australians. A recent report from Western Australia found that 89 per cent of juvenile detainees were drug users and that 47 per cent used drugs every day; 27 per cent used cannabis daily in 1992 and 58 per cent in 1995; 11 per cent used amphetamines daily in 1992 and 17 per cent in 1995. That shows that there has been an increase in drug usage.

Ecstasy is an increasing element in our community and it has been found that seven per cent of the population are using ecstasy. Why are young people turning to drugs? Is it out of disillusionment, boredom or lack of opportunity? Perhaps it is. We need to start thinking about some issues regarding young people and start seeking some solutions.

           One solution that we as a government have determined is to give young people a chance. There has been a lot of discussion about this working for the dole scheme.

In my view, we have to start looking at our terminology because there is no benefit at all in being unemployed.

In my earlier days I have been out of work for over 12 months, and I can tell you that it is a debilitating experience to be unemployed. There was not the need to go on the unemployment benefit at that time but, as I say, it is really not a benefit. I think we should be thinking about changing the terminology `working for the dole'. Perhaps we should be calling it a program of civil service, working

We will be able to test both voluntary and compulsory options at the pilot stage; that is, whether we wake make this compulsory or voluntary. We will seek submissions from local communities that wish to undertake projects involving partnerships with government, such as service bodies like Apex, Rotary or Lions which are very good community organisations; local businesses; local welfare groups like the Salvation Army, which does a great job in Cowan; and young people.

           The program will focus on the community based projects that provide direct benefits for local communities and worthwhile work experience for young people.

He has been constantly trying to get work. In fact, he works voluntarily for me and we have been trying to help him gain employment. He needs to get a work ethic.

           Ms Jennie George from the ACTU said that Mr Howard's proposal would put the blame on the victims of unemployment rather than creating labour market programs that could assist the community. The ACTU should never speak about employment programs because they are one of the reasons why there is increased unemployment in our community at the moment.

           In Cowan, for instance, we are working hard to promote youth unemployment schemes. I recently opened a JPET scheme in Wanneroo in conjunction with the Wanneroo accommodation service. This is a program which is helping young people who are at risk. It is a highly worthwhile national program, which is being used as a pilot program in our area. Mr Andrew Hoare from that program, with whom I have worked closely on a number of programs—the most recent being a drug project that we put together for young people; not to use drugs, but to educate others about them—says that the program will

           Over the last four years we have had four young Aboriginal people working in our electorate office under a program, two of whom have moved on to government appointments. One is working for the Premier at this very stage. I have also had a number of young people working in my office on work experience, so much so that when school holidays come around these young people for some unknown reason want to spend their school holidays working in my office. Maybe it is the cups of tea or the biscuits we supply. They really enjoy coming in and getting access to computers and to work experience. I think that if they were getting paid by the government under an unemployment scheme and were able to get access to work experience that would be very helpful to them. Most of the people who have come to work for us in our office are now working elsewhere. It is a program that I am very confident will work so long as it gets the support of all those in the community who are concerned about young people. As I said before, young people are our future. We need to address their issues.

When asked, `Did you in fact have an influence on unemployment rising to 11 per cent?' they said, `Not guilty. No, we didn't do that.' Did they increase national debt?

         This bill forms part of a complete package of legislation designed to give a legislative framework for the introduction of a superannuation contributions surcharge for high income earners. The other components of the legislative package which I will also introduce to the House today include: the Superan

         The superannuation system has been inequitably biased in favour of high income earners. Those high income earners have been benefiting from the concessional taxation treatment of superannuation to a much greater extent than low income earners. The introduction of the superannuation contributions surcharge for high income earners is this government's response to ensure that the superannuation system is more equitable for all Australians, while also ensuring that superannuation remains an attractive savings option.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         From budget night 1996 all employer and deductible personal superannuation contributions made by, or for, high income earners are now subject to a surcharge of up to 15 per cent. The surcharge applies only to contributions made after the budget announcement.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The surcharge will be phased in over the income levels of $70,000 to $85,000, with the surcharge effectively increasing by 1 per cent for each additional $1,000 of income above the $70,000 threshold. The $70,000 and $85,000 thresholds will be indexed from 1997-98 to the increase in full&amp;hyphen;time adult average weekly ordinary times earnings—AWOTE. This indexation is to ensure that low and middle income earners are not affected by the surcharge.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Income for the purposes of the surcharge is defined in the legislation to mean taxable income plus all employer and tax deductible personal superannuation contributions. Subject to data limitations, the retirement income modelling task force estimates that about 355,000 taxpayers will be affected by the surcharge.

         Collection Mechanism

         Superannuation providers will be required to send to the Australian Taxation Office—ATO—details of contributions received in relation to each member. The reporting date will be 31 October each year. For the 1996-97
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          year the date is extended to 15 December 1997 to allow superannuation providers additional time to collect information.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As members lodge their income tax returns, the ATO will match details of their taxable income with the information supplied by superannuation providers. Where, as a result of the level of a member's adjusted taxable income, a surcharge liability arises the ATO will assess the amount of surcharge and will periodically send assessments to the provider who holds the member's contributions. The superannuation provider will then debit the member's superannuation account with the surcharge liability and will remit that amount to the ATO within one month of the assessment. From 1998 an advance instalment of surcharge will be payable on 15 June. The advance instalment will be 50 per cent of the surcharge assessed in the previous year.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Alternative measures of collecting the surcharge have been put to the government. The government has given careful consideration to those suggestions. The alternatives suggested all involve an unacceptable increase in compliance costs for employers, small business and all Australians. A number of these alternatives involve transferring the reporting obligation from superannuation funds to the significantly larger number of employers. The government believes this would represent a substantial increase in the compliance burden of small business.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Significantly, the administrative requirements on superannuation funds under the government's approach are essentially similar to the processes that superannuation funds already undertake as part of their normal business operations. Against this background the government has decided not to depart from the broad approach to collection of the surcharge outlined on budget night.

         As unfunded defined benefits schemes are not funded until the benefit is paid, the surcharge cannot be collected from these schemes each year as the liability is assessed. Rather the surcharge liability is to be accumulated and will be payable at the time the affected member's benefit commences to be paid. To prevent unfunded defined benefits

         To avoid any retrospective application of the surcharge to golden handshakes, a transitional measure will apply to golden handshakes received within five years of the 1996-97 budget announcement—that is, payments received prior to 20 August 2001. The surchargeable portion is only that part of the golden handshake which relates to the employee's post 20 August 1996 service with the particular employer. Golden handshake payments made after 20 August 2001 will only be subject to this transitional rule if the payments were made under the terms of a written agreement between the employer and the employee that was in existence prior to 20 August 1996.

         The bill also amends the interest withholding tax provisions, as announced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in June 1996, in an effort to inject further competition into the Australian financial market and, in particular, the home lending market and update the provisions to reflect current overseas financial arrangements.

          Amendments Related to Net Capital Losses
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The bill will amend the income tax law to rectify anomalies in the capital gains tax provisions dealing with the carry forward and transfer of net capital losses. These measures were announced in the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 budget.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Under the existing capital gains tax provisions, taxpayers are able to carry forward net capital losses into a later year of income for recoupment against future capital gains which, as with the carry forward of revenue losses, is subject to a number of recoupment tests. These tests prevent capital losses incurred by a company from being recouped where there has been a substantial change in the beneficial ownership of the company since the losses were incurred and the company does not carry on the same business.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          However, the existing capital gains tax provisions operate so that taxpayers who carry forward net capital losses into subsequent years are taken to reincur those losses in each subsequent year. The effect of this anomaly is that the recoupment tests for company taxpayers do not achieve their intended purpose. That is, a capital loss is able to be recouped even where beneficial ownership of a company has changed substantially since the loss was incurred and the company does not carry on the same business.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This defect flows through to the provisions permitting the transfer of net capital losses between resident companies within the same 100 per cent owned group. A further defect is that, in certain circumstances, the recoupment tests applying to the transferee company are less stringent than those applying to the transferor company. This contrasts with the revenue loss transfer provisions which require both companies to satisfy the same recoupment tests.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The proposed amendments will ensure that net capital losses attach to the year of income in which they are incurred and are recouped or transferred within a company group in the order in which they were incurred. In addition, where a net capital loss is transferred within a company group, the transferee company will be required to satisfy the same recoupment tests—for example, the continuity

          Withholding Tax Avoidance
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As part of the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 budget, the Treasurer announced that the general anti&amp;hyphen;avoidance provisions, part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act, were to be extended so that they can apply to non&amp;hyphen;resident interest, dividend and royalty withholding tax in order to provide a mechanism to effectively counter withholding tax avoidance schemes. Four other specific amendments were also announced which will further assist in preventing abuse of the withholding tax provisions.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The government will not allow the income tax base to be continually eroded by artificial arrangements which attempt to get around the withholding tax provisions. However, the measures do not reflect any change in the government's policy on withholding taxes but are intended to give effect to existing policy by addressing tax avoidance.

          Removal of Standard Superannuation Contribution Limit
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The bill removes the option for employers with 10 or more employees to elect to calculate the maximum deduction they can claim for superannuation contributions made for the benefit of their employees by reference to a standard contribution limit. All employers will be required to determine the maximum amount of allowable deductions for superannuation contributions based on the ages of individual employees.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The standard contribution limit was introduced for reasons of administrative simplicity. However, the standard contribution limit has been subject to abuse with some employers claiming deductions for contributions on behalf of particular employees well in excess of the age based limits. The abuse has come at a cost to revenue and the government
          <break page="891" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           believes that the standard contribution limit can no longer be justified.

          Leases of Luxury Cars
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Another measure in the bill relates to the taxation treatment of leases of luxury cars. The cost limit for depreciation of luxury cars that was first enacted in 1980 has been effectively circumvented by leasing arrangements under which the lessor is largely unaffected by the limit. A common avoidance technique is to ensure that the lessor is a tax exempt or other tax preferred entity such as a loss trust.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The new measures will treat leases of luxury cars in much the same way as other forms of vehicle finance. The lessor will be treated as having disposed of the car to the lessee at the beginning of the lease and having lent the lessee the money to buy the car. The lessor will be taxed only on the finance charge component of the notional loan to the lessee, but not on the actual lease payments. If the lessee uses the car for income producing purposes, the lessee will be entitled to deduct an appropriate proportion of the finance charge component. No deduction will be allowed for actual lease payments, but the lessee will be treated as the car owner entitled to taxation depreciation allowances. The amount of depreciation allowed will be reduced under the depreciation cost limit rules.

          Interest Withholding Tax and Related Provisions

         <para first-indent="16">
          The bill will implement the government's commitment to amend the section 128F interest withholding tax exemption to increase competition in the Australian financial market. The end use in an Australian business requirement in the existing section 128F will be removed. The requirement that the debentures issued by an Australian company must be widely distributed on overseas capital markets will be replaced by a public offer test. This amendment will extend the exemption to borrowings in offshore wholesale capital markets. Division 11 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 will be amended to exclude its application to interest paid offshore in respect of bearer debentures which are issued offshore. The interest on such debentures will be subject to interest with
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           holding tax. Division 11 will also be amended to provide an exemption for bearer debentures issued by an offshore banking unit. The interest withholding tax collection procedures will be amended to ensure that they are consistent with the royalty withholding tax procedures. Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House.

         That the amendments insisted upon by the Senate be agreed to.

         The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996 was introduced into the parliament last year to give effect to a 1996 government election policy commitment to extend the time before new migrants may obtain access to certain social security payments and other benefits. The bill also implements legislation aimed at clarifying information gathering from the parties, clarifies that income data from different financial years may be used in the single data matching program cycle and makes other minor technical amendments.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When the bill was first considered by the Senate, the Senate made a number of amendments to the bill relating to the two&amp;hyphen;year migrant waiting period provisions. This House subsequently disagreed with some of those amendments and the Senate was so informed. The Senate has now agreed that it will not insist on making amendments that would have meant that there would be no migrant waiting period for these benefits: the carer pension, the widow allowance, the disability wage supplement, the mature age allowance, special benefit, partner allowance, mobility allowance, the provision of a senior's health card and health care cards under the disadvantaged persons scheme.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Similarly, the Senate will not insist on amendments that would have maintained the exemption from the operation of the waiting period that currently applies to a person who was a member of a couple immediately before entering Australia and whose partner has been an Australian resident for at least 26 weeks, also the amendments for a shorter waiting period for a parenting allowance or a number of consequential amendments to some of the definitional provisions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, the Senate still considers that there should be no waiting period for either a maternity allowance or more than the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          minimum rate of family payment. With respect to the maternity allowance, the government has reconsidered its position and now agrees that it should not be subject to a two-year waiting period. On the matter of the maternity allowance, it is a payment made to assist families to meet the costs involved in the birth of a child. It is not an income support payment, and, to that end, the government considers that it should not be treated akin to the minimum rate family payment.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Consistent with its election commitment, the government had never intended that the minimum rate of family payment, previously known as the family allowance, should be subject to a two-year waiting period. On the other hand, the government did consider that there should be a two&amp;hyphen;year waiting period for more than the minimum family payment and that it had an electoral mandate to do so.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Again, in the interests of facilitating the passage of the bill, the government indicates that it will not oppose any Senate amendment that would ensure that no such waiting period was imposed. Likewise, whilst not conceding that certain provisions relating to newstart allowance, sickness allowance and youth training allowance would be retrospective, the government is prepared to recommend to this House that it would agree to amendments still insisted on by the Senate that would have the effect of the two-year waiting period applying to people claiming those allowances who had not entered Australia and being granted a permanent visa before royal assent to the bill.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In reconsidering the bill, the Senate also agreed to a number of amendments moved by the government that the government had previously intended moving but had not been able to do so because of earlier Senate amendments. Those amendments would give effect to a number of recommendations set out in the majority report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the bill including exempting special needs relatives, refugees, former refugees, family members of refugees or former refugees and innocent illegals from the carer pension migrant waiting period and ensuring consistency in treatment of subclass 820 and subclass 826 visa holders. The

          —The opposition regrets that the government has succeeded in a process which will mean that there is now a two-tiered welfare system in Australia and that those who come to this country will be faced with circumstances which will mean that they have not got available to them the range of support that is  available to other Australians.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The most distressing of the changes is the imposition of a two&amp;hyphen;year waiting period on special benefit, a payment only available as a last resort when all other avenues have been exhausted. It is certain that it will mean that emergency relief agencies will have to pick up the pieces in this area. I note that, in the budget, supplemental appropriations were made to make sure that agencies such as St Vincent de Paul and other private agencies did have available to them some additional resources to meet that cost.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is a matter of some great regret that this parliament will be complicit in a process which will see the need for a number of people who are going through a period of resettlement in this country not having available to them a proper process—a safety net—under the law and being forced to have recourse to those private charitable ends.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government has pledged to introduce a form of safety net which obviously is intended to be less universal than that which applies for special benefit but has, thus far, declined to make available the detail. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) was pressed repeatedly in the Senate to give that detail. She said that, while she had circulated a draft of the regulations that she was proposing to introduce, she was not willing at that time to make that detail available.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It would have helped the conclusion of this process were that detail available to senators in that place, and certainly it is a matter that I would wish to comment on. There will be considerable unease amongst many in the community until the minister does produce whatever set of regulations the government intends to proceed with.

          The withdrawal of support from people who have been welcomed to this country as permanent residents in the vital period of their settlement is going to cause problems. It certainly may backfire in the sense of the withdrawal of support, which assists people in that period of settlement when they are most vulnerable. If it does result in people making a poor start to their life in this country and, if they do not leave but battle on and become long-term welfare dependent, as a consequence we will have bad policy compounded with bad results and any short&amp;hyphen;term savings outweighed by the long-term damage that is done socially and economically.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The only benefit for the passage of this legislation is that it will no longer give people such as Senator Newman, who used some outrageously populist language, excuses to make disgraceful comments such as referring to new arrivals in terms of `those people are being offered the opportunity to ride on the backs of battlers from the day they arrive'. The mean spiritedness of the government's original proposal—which included excluding eligibility for, amongst other things, the double orphans pension, child disability allowance and the failure to make provision for full family payment or maternity allowance—shows the way in which this government was intending to operate.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          What has now emerged is that the Senate has agreed with the government to enable a two-year waiting period to apply to a range of benefits, which, essentially, almost covers the field. There are a couple of areas where the Senate has dug its heels in, and the government has accepted at least two of those.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The law now will, indeed, be making available full access to family payment, which was a commitment by the then opposition before the last election and which it was plainly reneging on. The Senate has insisted on that being still made available, as it has in the case of the maternity allowance.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Might I say that there are a couple of small technical points on which I would appreciate the minister's assurances. The leader for the Labor Party in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, referred the Minister for Social Security to the
          <break page="895" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           case of class 309 and 310 visas. These are new visas which were introduced and, because of the technical way in which they have been expressed, I think as the law currently stands, there was the prospect that, in fact, two two&amp;hyphen;year waiting periods would apply. The minister said that she did not need to take the matter on notice, that she could give an assurance to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) that there would only be one two&amp;hyphen;year waiting period which would operate as of the date of arrival in Australia.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I would appreciate the minister at the table, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) firstly confirming that and, if it is possible for him to indicate the mechanism that the government proposes to use to actually achieve that end, because I think it would require either an amendment to this act or to the regulations in order to secure that. I would appreciate that being made known to the House. Although, of course, we would not stand on this matter in terms of preventing the disposition of this matter at this time, it is obviously one which would be useful for it to be known so that the matter could be concluded finally.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I think that really is the weight of what we would wish to say. This has been an exhausting process for the parliament. There have been some words uttered in this debate, particularly by Senator Newman, which I am sure she ought regret, if she does not regret. That being the case, we now have a situation where there will be a two&amp;hyphen;year waiting period and that will apply across a range of measures, excluding only matters which I think the Australian community at large would have said would have been so mean&amp;hyphen;spirited and so stony hearted as to have really not properly been put on the agenda in the first place.

          I find it extraordinary that the government, for example, sought to eliminate the double orphans pension from the start, or not to comply with its own commitment before the election to make available full family assistance through the family payment. Concerning its own concession in relation to maternity allowance and child disability allowance, they

          The government will, by accepting the matters that the Senate has insisted on, also concede the fact that these matters should not be introduced retrospectively. I think it is important that this parliament discipline the government to act in a way which is consistent with its previous undertakings and a philosophy that generally commends itself to both sides of this parliament. It has been a near universal rule of public policy that, with one exception—the exception of the taxation area where I think it has been conceded that, from the date of an announcement, taxation measures will be allowed to take effect so that the revenue is not defeated—there ought not be a concession to government to enable it to act in a way to withdraw people's entitlements in a retrospective manner. The insistence on this and its acceptance by the government, I believe, is at least a worthwhile outcome as a result of the way in which this matter has been proceeded with.

         On the issue that was first raised, which was access to special benefits, while the term `special benefit' is being used, when we originally developed the policy in this area we referred to it as a special allowance to distinguish it from special benefits as we had known them, and that was the clear intention. The special benefit, while it is available on a more restricted basis than other benefits—that is clear—in our view, was never intended to be available as a form of benefit for those people for whom assurances had been given that relatives were sponsoring them into Australia and that those relatives were going to meet their needs, where people clearly had the capacity to meet those needs, but, because they were willing to put the relatives on the streets, the person may well be able to meet the special benefit test.

          Clearly, what we stated in our policy we would do is accommodate those situations with a special payment where changed circumstances had arisen in relation to the sponsor after arrival. So what we were looking at was a situation in which the sponsor may have died and would not be in a position to continue to provide and meet those needs. The sponsor may have lost his or her job and was not, therefore, in a position to meet the obligation that they had assumed. So while refugees and those who come through the humanitarian stream were always exempt from these provisions, where we were dealing with people who come through the skilled categories and had the capacity to look after themselves and those people who come through the family categories, and there is a sponsor, then the sponsor, clearly, has an obligation to accept.

          The difficulty that we have had—and it has been acknowledged over a long time—is that not all sponsors meet their obligations. Some people sponsor where they have no capacity to meet their obligations. One of the things we are going to do is to reassess now the very basis upon which the assurance of support scheme operates so that it is clear what the obligations are.

          I have said to my officers that in undertaking this review they should also look at the extent to which people have the capacity to meet the obligations. In other words, we should not encourage people who have no capacity to continue sponsorship when we know that when the relative comes they are not going to be able to meet the obligation. Whether or not a bond is continued, whether you give access to the person who was sponsored and who is not being assisted to those funds, may be something we can look at.

          I think there are fresh questions there, as a result of the passage of this legislation, of ensuring that people know what the obligations are when they are involved in the sponsorship process. I am going to ensure that these matters are brought to people's attention at the time they are undertaking the sponsorship obligation. In relation to the guidelines, Senator Newman said yesterday:

            The suggestion was made that this matter may backfire on the government. I am sure people will come forward and say, outside of changed circumstances, that they are in a very difficult situation. That is why the assurance of support scheme has always been there. It needs to be reviewed to ensure that people understand that the assurance of support scheme means what it says. I do not think it will be a matter of backfiring in the minds of the Australian public when people come out and say, `I sponsored my relative, but I did not know what I was doing, and there is now an obligation that I am asking my neighbours to accept.' I just do not think that will be accepted.

           Reference was made to us reneging on a commitment to the way in which this matter was brought forward. The former government made changes to the way in which payments were made, particularly to family payments. The maternity allowance was a new payment that arose after the policy had initially been developed and costed. We brought it forward in the expectation that the form in which it was first proposed would be the form in which it would be adopted. That is the basis

           If I can reiterate the words that I used before, the reason we are acceding to these matters is not a reconsideration on our part of the issue but to secure passage of the bill. In other words, we agreed not to press these two issues—which, in terms of the savings involved, were relatively minor—not because we agreed we had made some error but to secure passage of the legislation.

           The final matter raised was the issue of the two&amp;hyphen;year entry permit which the parliament has acceded to for spouse entrants and de facto partners and also for those in the interdependency class. In relation to those visas, there was a specific amendment—No. 10—which was designed to ensure that the person would wait only two years before being eligible for social security payments. Our understanding is that the legislation, as it is now being enacted, will require a preclusion period to access of benefits for a two&amp;hyphen;year period. The time runs from the time of entry and a further period will not be required to be served for any period of later permanent residence that is granted.

Without such regulations, or if such regulations are brought forward and thought to be inadequate and disallowed, there is no safety net. I appreciate the minister's goodwill on this point. However, this is a matter that has commended itself to considerable public attention. A set of draft guidelines was the subject of discussion and comment in a Senate inquiry earlier. The government has had ample time to settle the terms of those regulations. Its failure to do so, in a circumstance where it now has the parliament's approval to change the law but has not yet made known to the public the nature of the safety net it has promised from the outset, is a matter of grave concern. I simply ask the minister to give such assurances as he may that this matter is not going to be allowed to fester and that we will have those regulations before us for consideration not just in the Senate but in this House without delay.

That is what the government was committed to. It is important to us to have them on the table, discussed and preferably dealt with in a way that we can all agree upon.

Both sides are cognisant of the difficulty that a failure to agree could occasion. That is something about which we both have to be conscious. While we know that the Senate can by resolution waive the six-month period—that may be a factor in people's consideration if there is going to be any posturing on the issue—obviously from our point of view, and from your point of view, given the comments you have made, it is better that we try to work out an agreed approach.

         For the benefit of the House, the government amendments moved and passed in the Senate relate to the commencement date.

         The advance payment of the service pension income support supplement is related to the commencement date. The variation to the Defence Service Homes Act 1918 changes to the date of royal assent. In terms of the advance payments of service pension income support supplements, there are three parts to this budget measure. One part will increase the maximum advance payment available to pensioners who also receive a war widow or war widower's pension. Another part will introduce a limitation to one advance payment in any year. Lastly, a purpose provision is to be removed. There is very strong support for this measure. Just prior to Christmas, in the expectation that this bill would receive the attention of the Senate before we rose at the
         <break page="899" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          end of last year, there was an enormous lot of interest in these changes to this veterans' affairs legislation.

         I would also like to touch on the Defence Service Homes Act 1918. There are three defence service homes measures that were to commence from 1 January this year. As this bill was not dealt with prior to the House rising at the end of last year, that commencement date of course could not apply without it being retrospective.

         The extension of eligibility for defence service home loans to those who served in operational areas of Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia and Somalia, and whose first service commenced on or before 14 May 1985, is catered for in these amendments within the bill, although not the amendments we are considering at the moment. There is the extension of eligibility to veterans and veteran widowers of World War II ex&amp;hyphen;service women, notwithstanding any previous assistance as a veteran. Further, the reduction of the interest rate for new additional advances goes from 10 per cent per annum to either 6.85 per cent per annum or a rate resulting in borrowers paying no more than the effective interest rate of 6.85 per cent in the majority of circumstances. I note, too, that is certainly a welcome measure for those people with those loans.

         There are other measures in the bill as a whole, one of which I would like to refer to. Once this bill receives royal assent, it will enable the government to increase payments to Victoria Cross recipients to bring payments from our government into line with those paid to Victoria Cross recipients in the United Kingdom by their government. I do not think there is any opposition to the proposition that this will in fact be a retrospective payment, backdated to August 1995, which was the date on which Victoria Cross recipients in the United Kingdom received an increased allowance.

         I will take the opportunity to make some brief comments. I join with the minister in his few words in relation to the Victoria Cross recipients who are still alive.

         I recall having the pleasure of being in the company of the three VC winners referred to about 18 months or two years ago when the former minister, Con Sciacca, in the former government presented them with a gold pass for travel.

         For the record, I should note the opposition's regret that a number of amendments that we sought in the Senate were opposed by the government—in particular, the abolition of the earnings credit scheme.

          —In resuming my contribution to the debate on the telecommunications bills I will deal with a couple of key areas. One is the question of Internet access and the problem created by the fact that Telstra is not only the carrier but also an Internet service and access provider. This gives Telstra an extraordinary ability to be able to control the marketplace in which Internet services are offered. I am pleased to see that the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) is at the table because this impacts on small business. This is an area where small business can be quite significantly affected, particularly those small businesses that are actually involved in the provision of Internet services.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have the ludicrous situation where Telstra is more or less expected to govern itself in providing fair access to the facilities that the Internet service providers need in order to conduct their own businesses, at the same time competing with Telstra in the same marketplace. That is an extraordinary conflict of interest. It provides Telstra with an extraordinary amount of control over the marketplace in Internet access. As a former member of the Liberal Party and as someone who values competition policy, I believe it is an
         <break page="901" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          absolute disgrace that the government is prepared to allow this to continue.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I have to say that this problem arose under the previous government but, of course, it is a matter that has developed at some speed over the last few years, so I suppose one could offer the excuse that they were not prepared for it. This is now well documented. There is a Senate committee of inquiry looking into it. At the end of the day, anybody with a remote interest in this issue could have foreshadowed that there was going to be this almost incredible conflict of interest in relation to the services and responsibilities of Telstra.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs would well know, this is an area of small business that is growing rapidly. It employs principally younger people—another aspect of coalition policy in relation to employment. Yet we have the situation where the independent Internet service providers are forced by this government to offer their services knowing that they have to rely on the carrier to provide them with the resources and then compete against the carrier in the same marketplace.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would have thought that that was an absolute contradiction of the government's commitment to competition policy. If there is going to be fair and open access to telephony and data transmission services and all the related areas, then quite clearly Telstra should withdraw from Internet service provision—certainly access provision—or there ought to be some means of regulating what is clearly an unsatisfactory conflict of interest. I would be interested to know whether the minister for small business is himself interested in contributing to ensuring that the small businesses involved in this are not being unfairly manipulated by Telstra's control of the provision of services.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other aspect is the question of timed calls for Internet access. Telstra is talking about timed calls because they say that the use of data transmission on untimed charged calls interferes with residential calls, with voice calls, and is a drain on the profitability in the provision of voice calls. In actual fact, there is a very good level of information to
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          the contrary to show that data transmission, which often occurs at non-peak periods, contributes to reducing the cost per call of telephony. The concept that Telstra would introduce timed charges for Internet access is another extraordinary potential abuse of Telstra's position as the carrier and Internet service provider.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I ask the minister who is here, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs—although, it would be interesting to know the views of the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Warwick Smith) on this—how on earth Telstra would propose to detect data calls so that they could provide time charges. It begs the question whether this would involve some means of identifying the numbers that are using data transmission on a regular basis. How will they do this in the absence of any technological ability to detect data transmissions on that basis at present? It is a well-known fact in the industry that Telstra is not in a position to do it and therefore would be required, in order to achieve this, to identify the numbers using data transmission.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We had the situation the other day where it became known that people who use mobile phones on the digital network are able to be located thanks to the fact that every so many seconds there is a transmission between the phone that is switched on and the exchange or the nearest station. This means in essence that the location of any person who uses a digital telephone—bearing in mind that the analog telephone network is to be abolished in due course—may be able to be identified.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As a former policeman, one could argue that this is a great step forward in law enforcement. But, as someone who is thoroughly opposed to Big Brother and those sorts of aspects of George Orwell's
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Nineteen Eighty&amp;hyphen;Four
         </emphasis>
         , this presents an awful scenario for the future where, by accessing the telecommunication carrier's records and the continuous monitoring of where particular phones are located, people's movements can be detected. I would have thought that that was anathema to the vast majority of Australians who value greatly their individual liberty and freedom to move around.

        <break page="902" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

          If we are going to see this in any way expanded then, in my view, this would be to the detriment of our free and democratic community. I just hope that will be knocked on the head as soon as possible. But I wanted to make the point that if they are going to expand that by identifying people who use  data—in other words, by using the numbers of the people who use the Internet—then this is another step towards a Big Brother scenario where the telecommunications carriers become accumulators of information about citizens that can be used by government agencies in goodness knows whatever functions in relation to the movements and the conduct of business of those citizens.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I want touch on one last aspect of this particular area: Telstra's universal service obligations. The government claims that they will preserve universal service obligations on the part of Telstra. My view is that when you read the speech of the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, on the question of universal provisions you see the fairly ambiguous nature of what he had to say. When you look at who is advising the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), you see that some of the advice he is receiving is anti-USO preservation. Then it is understandable that there is an ambiguity about the commitment to universal service obligations post&amp;hyphen;July 1997. Those members of the National Party, or those members representing regional or rural electorates, ought to be really looking at this very closely indeed, because it is my view that USOs will be progressively withdrawn post July 1997.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I might also point out in relation to service obligations of the telecommunication providers that a section of the community in my electorate, which is within the metropolitan area of Perth, already have timed call charges. They have always had timed call charges. In fact, because of the zoning arrangements within the Perth metropolitan area, they are still paying timed call charges notwithstanding that the metropolitan area of Perth—in other words, the area that is considered to be the suburbs of Perth—has spread to touch their areas. It is an absolute disgrace that we have
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           a situation where in my electorate, a city electorate, we have consumers who do not pay timed call charges living within a few kilometres of other consumers who do pay for timed calls. I have yet to see any rational explanation by Telstra for this other than the fact that we have this zoning system.

          Again, I have small businesses in my area who are obliged to ring and pay for timed calls to contact other branches of their business within Perth, within the same metropolitan area. It seems to me incredible that a government that is committed to charges for untimed local calls should allow this situation to prevail in the Perth metropolitan area. It is indicative of perhaps the real attitude of the government in relation to USOs, timed calls and other aspects of telecommunications telephony provision that this has not been stopped over a long time.

          As we well know, at the end of the day it is the asset values of Telstra that are going to bring the greatest return to the government through its sale. These built-in subsidies—like the ability to site telecommunication towers and to dig cables wherever they want to—are an addition to the net asset value of Telstra when it comes to be sold. One does not have to be Albert Einstein to work out that a government that is going to rely on the Telstra sale to do a lot of other things is not going to interfere unduly with those particular rights.

I can tell you that, in my view and I think in the view of a number of other people, the telecommunications towers and the cabling will continue on as it has done in the past. I notice with interest the technological aspect of the changes to the telecommunications towers. I can tell you that has been the excuse used in the past by the telecommunication carriers.

          —It was not that long ago that telecommunications services in Australia were provided by three legislated monopoly carriers: OTC, Telecom and Aussat. Although the

           Davidson report in 1982 favoured increased private sector involvement and competition within the Australian telecommunications industry, it was almost 10 years before Optus Communications entered the market, with Vodafone becoming the third mobile operator in Australia in 1993.

         In short, this legislative package of telecommunications bills encourages and facilitates the industry transition from one still dominated by government monopolies to one driven by vigorously competitive markets. Although our telecommunications industry is small compared with many other developed countries, it is one of the fastest growing segments of our economy, increasing from 2.6 per cent of GDP in 1989 to an estimated four per cent in 2000. Internationally, Australia ranks only behind New Zealand amongst OECD countries with the highest telecommunications growth rates.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Australians are the world's hungriest consumers of emerging technologies. Consider the following: in mid-1995, there were over two million mobile phone subscribers in Australia. By the end of 1996, that number had jumped to around four million customers. Among the OECD countries, only the Scandinavian nations have experienced a faster growth rate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Further, Australians represent approximately one million of the 60 million or so Internet surfers worldwide and have the second highest level of computer usage in the entire world. According to British Telecom Asia Pacific, whereas voice—as distinct from electronic data such as the Internet—accounted for 90 per cent of phone traffic two or three years ago, that proportion is down to 70 per cent today.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the United States, phone lines already carry more electronic data, such as the Internet traffic, than voice data. The rest of the world seems to follow that trend. In fact, according to Telstra, Internet growth is set to overtake telephony on its national and international networks by 2000. Australia has approximately 16 facsimile machines per 100 workers, which is well ahead of the United States and Europe which have eight fax machines per 100 workers. It is just behind

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Further, Australian consumers have much greater access and are comparatively bigger users of electronic funds transfer at point of sale—or EFTPOS as it is commonly known—than our counterparts in other technology friendly countries such as Japan, Germany and the United States. Approximately 96.4 per cent of Australian households have at least one telephone line. Based on the high penetration rates of telephones, televisions and personal computers, the International Telecommunications Union, the ITU, in Geneva names Australia as among the top five countries with the greatest potential to profit from the developments in superhighways.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To make the most of technological changes, as well as the ongoing growth in the telecommunications industry, Australia needs this package of legislation, together with the related post&amp;hyphen;1997 legislative reforms which set down the appropriate pro&amp;hyphen;competition and pro&amp;hyphen;user framework for this dynamic industry.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This government strongly believes that, if Australian businesses and consumers are to derive maximum value from a dynamic telecommunications industry, three principles are critical. Firstly, Australia must have a world&amp;hyphen;class telecommunications infrastructure, based on the latest mix of market driven technologies. Secondly, our industry must be open to a multitude of service providers with equal access to carrier facilities. Finally, we must have a competitive telecommunications market focused on driving prices down and the quality of services to consumers up.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Each of these principles is reflected in the key parts of these bills. Firstly, one of the fundamental elements of the bills is the introduction of a truly open market for telecommunications infrastructure and services. There will be no limit on the number of carrier licences that may be issued. Amongst other elements, the bills provide that a condition for obtaining a licence for carriers is an industry development plan, unless exempted. The government believes that this will maximise the opportunities for Australian industry. Network rollout obligations will, thankfully, not be imposed on new carriers. Distinctions
         <break page="904" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          between fixed and mobile services under the existing legislation are removed.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Secondly, a significant feature of a multicarrier environment is that competitors inevitably will make use of each other's networks. The government recognises the importance of guaranteeing all Australians seamless end to end telecommunications services—a telecommunications network which allows any to any communication. The legislative framework includes a full interconnection and access regime between carriers, service providers and their customers, the objective being that any user can communicate with any other user regardless of choice of carrier. That prevents us from going down the tragic path that has developed in the United States.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Thirdly, a key component of this legislation relates to the shifting, except where clearly inappropriate, of the responsibility of regulation to the industry itself. The government believes that greater reliance on self&amp;hyphen;regulation through industry developed codes is particularly important in a rapidly changing industry such as telecommunications. However, the government also recognises that, in certain circumstances, industry consensus may not be possible. In such circumstances, the legislation includes safeguard provisions to enable the regulator—the Australian Communications Authority—to establish standards or to arbitrate an outcome.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Fourthly, the legislation demonstrates the government's commitment to ensure that comprehensive and effective mechanisms are in place to promote and protect the rights of consumers and fulfils our undertaking prior to the March 1996 election—in the statement known as Better Communications—to establish a world&amp;hyphen;class consumer framework. The customer service guarantee sets out requirements relating to the connection of services, rectification of faults and keeping of appointments. It also sets down a streamlined means of compensation when these requirements are not met. The universal service obligation is further clarified and updated and aligns the universal service regime with the post&amp;hyphen;1997 multicarrier environment.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          The legislation also extends the untimed local call obligation so that residential customers, such as those in my electorate, will have the right to untimed non&amp;hyphen;voice local calls—for example, facsimiles, e&amp;hyphen;mails or connections with an Internet service provider—and voice calls. Businesses will have the right to untimed local voice calls. That is very important not only for local businesses but also particularly for players in various industries in some of the smaller cities around Australia.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In conclusion, we must recognise that this legislative package will not transform the telecommunications industry overnight. While this is historic legislation, change of this magnitude is an evolving process. The coalition government firmly believes that the results of legislative change will be lower prices and better services for customers, both in the quality of service and in the development and implementation of advanced telecommunications services.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This package of bills fulfils the government's election commitment as set forth in Better Communications. It brings about telecommunications reform that encourages a degree of competition unprecedented in Australia and sets down a framework of world&amp;hyphen;class consumer protection.

Specifically, it refers to the maintenance of the 1 July 1997 cut&amp;hyphen;off for carriers' exemptions from state and territory planning laws.

          What I can suggest is that Australian Labor Party has great form on this matter, especially in relation to its suggestion that there should be a cut&amp;hyphen;off for the carriers' exemptions from state and territory planning laws. As I walk the streets of my electorate—all 42 square kilometres of it; the second smallest electorate in the entire nation, which is perhaps why I am carrying a few pounds more than some may recognise—it is hard to believe that any government would permit the erection of overhead cables, the erection of black guitar string like spaghetti from household to household across the views of people living in the local streets and across the building line of buildings. There is only one group of people who are responsible for that: the Australian Labor Party.

          I can say with absolute confidence that if there has been a simple example in this House of enormous hypocrisy then it comes today through the member for Dobell, who has not even turned up to the debate, putting forward amendments which are suggesting that the Australian Labor Party is the guardian of the rights of local government. It was the Australian Labor Party that in 1991 legislated so that local government had absolutely no power to stop the erection of the overhead cables or to stop the telephone towers which sprout up like undisciplined mushrooms across our electorates. It is the Australian Labor Party that must accept absolute and complete responsibility.

          There is an old saying that when an ancien regime is about to collapse it makes a dying statement.

           mistakes. They failed to recognise where they went wrong. The Australian people said in March last year `You've got it wrong' to Paul Keating and to his mates in New South Wales. We know there are not very many of those mates at the moment; he is short of good friends. He can always speak to the telecommunications companies who have benefited from the 1991 Telecommunications Act, which permitted the carriers to have absolute carte blanche across the skies of Sydney and, in fact, across the skies of the entire nation.

It is particularly an affront to the people of my electorate, who have had enough of the overhead cables and the mobile phone towers. There is only one group of people responsible for that, and it is the people that gave the immunities to the carriers in 1991. Thankfully they are on the other side of the House, they are in opposition, and it will take a hell of a long time for them to come back over here.

         Throughout last year I was one of the most outspoken critics of the partial privatisation of Telstra, for that reason. Telstra is one of the major employers in my electorate, particularly in Bathurst. It is my very real fear that as the telecommunications market is opened up many of those rural jobs will go. Certainly many hundreds of new jobs will also be created in the industry, but the new players in this industry will not be tripping over themselves or their cabling to come to regional centres like Bathurst. We all know that Australia is one of the most urbanised countries in the world and the cities are where the money is to be made, and that is where the new players will be heading.

         You have only to look at the effects that the deregulation of the banking industry is having on rural communities. In the cities you will see aggressive new competitors like that favourite of the Treasurer (Mr Costello), Aussie Home Loans. We have heard this week that it is moving into the business market. It has no branch network, extremely low overheads and is eating away at the market share of the major banks.

         To compete with this lender and other new entrants with low overheads, the major banks have had to seriously cut back their branch networks and, of course, country towns have been the hardest hit.

Austudy is a classical example at the moment. Only this week the Western District Health Fund in my electorate has been told by the health department that it cannot increase its fees because the department believes its management costs are too high.

         One of the more welcome initiatives contained in the Trade Practices Amendment (Telecommunications) Bill—one of the 11 bills in the cognate debate—is the clause that will hopefully encourage carriers to share infrastructure such as trenches and communication towers. That is a very positive move that probably should have happened years ago before all these mobile phone base stations started popping up everywhere.

         In my electorate at Mount Lambie, between Bathurst and Lithgow, there are a plethora of towers all 500 metres away from a particular property. Not only is it a vision blot on the landscape but, with so many questions still being raised about the potential health threats from these sorts of communication towers, you can understand why the residents are alarmed. I am sure most of my fellow members can tell similar stories. I heard the member for Moore (Mr Filing) talking in the House earlier this week about a series of phone towers in front and behind a school in his electorate and the distress that that has caused.

         Interestingly though, while the bill says that telecommunication carriers must give their competitors access to facilities and suggests, in the case of disputes, that it will be left to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to try to arbitrate, it does not exactly spell out how long the parties involved have to try to negotiate a solution before the ACCC intervenes. Councils will be rolled by the costs of litigation brought by the heavyweight telecommunication providers. That is what I mean by signing on the dotted line while the fine print still has to be sorted out.

         Can you honestly see two aggressive telecommunication companies reaching a settlement on sharing each other's facilities? It is a bit like asking the Prime Minister, John Howard, and the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, to agree to share the same line at the same time. It is a pretty fair bet it is not going to happen. This is just one example of a crucial detail that still has to be sorted out.

         Another example is the set period that time carriers will have to rectify faults or problems with services.

         While Telstra remains government owned and Australian owned, for a short time only, I was at least able to write to the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) and have this poor response highlighted in the hope it will not happen again. But, once we wash our hands of Telstra and leave the whole system open to the market forces to dictate what happens, I will guarantee such problems will only get worse in the bush. Believe me, I am not having a go at Telstra. The local work force, which has been cut back severely in recent years, is working very hard to try to provide a first rate service and management is always more than helpful at a local level when it comes to trying to resolve problems.

         Another problem that still has to be sorted out is the portability of telephone numbers. Last year we saw the Prime Minister officially call Optus's first local call customer, once again heralding, as we were told, a new era in competition. But, according to recent news reports, Optus is well behind in its targets in signing up local call customers partly because at the moment,customers cannot change companies and keep the same phone number. Obviously, if you have had the same number for years you are reluctant to give it up.

         I am told that the lack of phone number portability is not really the fault of the industry or the regulators but more to do with the technology. Still, it is another example that, unless we get all the factors right, the brave new world of competition may produce great headlines for the business pages, maybe even greater profits for big business and the new shareholders of Telstra, but perhaps questionable benefits for the community, particularly in rural areas.

         Once again, I do not expect country phone customers will enjoy the benefits of local phone call competition in the near future—if ever—because, again, the profits are not there and the residential density is not great enough to warrant companies such as Optus stringing up their cables. Already country phone customers are severely disadvantaged when it comes to making local calls as Telstra's local

         In my electorate we have the ridiculous example where you can make a call from Bathurst to Orange, or vice versa—a distance of 50 kilometres—for the cost of a local call. That is good. Yet, if you live in the village of Millthorpe, between Bathurst and Orange, you pay STD rates to call someone in Bathurst. Similarly, if you live in one of the small towns in the Cabonne Shire surrounding Orange—towns like Cumnock, all much closer than Bathurst is to Orange—you have to pay STD rates to call Orange.

         If you lived in, say, Canowindra back in the 1960s when the call zones were drawn up, it would not have mattered because you could have happily transacted most of your business in Canowindra and never ventured to Orange more than once or twice a year, and very rarely would you have needed to make an STD call—or a trunk call, as they were back then. But these days, as we all know, small country towns have suffered as a result of cutbacks by government, banks and other enterprises. The rural downturn has contributed and, of course, improved transport has made regional centres much closer. I am not suggesting we go back to the horse and cart, but I am suggesting regional and rural Australia will receive very patchy benefits from this improving technology.

It would be nice to sit back like a coalition MP and say to angry constituents, `Don't worry, competition will fix it. Soon you will have a choice of local call carriers and prices will drop.'

Certainly, provisions have been made in these bills for cross&amp;hyphen;subsidies, but that will not be enough on its own. The fine print that still has to be sorted out must make sure that, wherever people live, big business interests are not put ahead of the community's interests. With these quite strong reservations, I do commend the bills to the House.

         Further, service costs will be regulated by price control under the Telstra Corporation Act or the Telecommunications Bill 1996—much to the dismay of the Labor scaremongers.

A price ceiling of 25c applies to untimed local phone calls from private phones and 40c from public phones. A range of services supplied to residential customers are subject to a price cap of CPI&amp;hyphen;X, meaning their price must decline in real terms.

          So where do we as a government stand with regard to regional and rural communications? Allow me to educate those representatives on the other side that are part of the true believers band. This government recognises the key role telecommunications play in rural and remote Australia and the need to foster the development of a robust, competitive and efficient industry. To facilitate this, the government has initiated a three&amp;hyphen;pronged strategy: introducing open competition and enhancing consumer safeguards, achieving this by allowing specialised or regional service providers to enter small markets and target the needs of rural and regional users. By doing so, licence agreements and costs are minimal. There are a few restrictions on technologies and, while protecting the community's interests, service obligations are not onerous and are consistent with those applying to larger companies in other advanced economies.

Therefore, the RTIF has been structured specifically to be community driven and assist regional communities in the identification of needs and development of innovative, sustainable solutions unique to their particular needs.

Yet, not to be left out of the race, the `Yes' company, Optus, is spending tens of millions of dollars doing the same, emulating the goals of the RTIF.

          The minister that was being praised by the member for Paterson set up a committee to give him some ideas and to give him a report on this matter. He put quite a lot of people on that committee, called the Review Group: people from the National Farmers Federation, consumers of telecommunications and all the main operators in the industry—Telstra, Optus and Vodafone. He really set up a pretty powerful group to review the very essence of his legislation. He also has had some relationship over a period with a bloke named Professor Henry Ergas—a visiting professor at the Centre for Research in Network Economics and Communications, University of Auckland—in relation to academic studies.

But there is a minority report from the professor from New Zealand, who cans what everybody else has done and says that the country cannot afford it, that it is going to cost $200 million, et cetera. So he comes in to wipe off the bush, to wipe off regional Australia. That was his job. I think he probably got a bit of a shock that the rest of the committee came down with a proposition which actually looked at the overall wellbeing of the country. They came down with a recommendation that the service obligation should include a digital data capacity. Of course the professor, the one&amp;hyphen;man band with the one&amp;hyphen;man band report, came down with his report.

          I was mistaken. I said $200 million, but $2.5 billion was his claim. To go back to the quote, the $2.5 billion would `lead to higher charges for residential consumers'. He is trying to say that everybody else is going to have to pay more to give this obligation to regional Australia. So he is running the minister's line and, I guess, if the minister's line is being run, that is the government's line, and that is the line of all those members from regional Australia because they are taking no different view.

         It seems that in return for the financial risk that is associated with any major infrastructure development, the ALP made special access and immunity provisions for telecommunications carriers in their 1991 telecommunications code. The immunity provisions quite sensibly included such things as koalas and migratory birds but amazingly took no account of the concerns that local communities had about the potential health effects of mobile phone towers and took no account of state and local planning laws which relate to visual amenity.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That immunity that the carriers have enjoyed has witnessed overhead cabling being duplicated and telecommunications towers being erected without reference to the local community. Fortunately, in South Australia there has been a strong emphasis on linking underground power to environmental or traffic issues. Installing underground power lines in new subdivisions has been made compulsory under state law since the early 1980s. Recently the state government announced a doubling of funding for undergrounding of powerlines, which is expected to result in 20 kilometres of powerlines being placed underground each year.

         In closing, I would like to state that the open market entry arrangements envisaged by this package will not be implemented to the detriment of consumer and community welfare.

          —I am particularly grateful for the opportunity to follow the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon). There were a number of points in his speech which I would like to refer to a little later on in the debate. I would like to thank him for at least acknowledging that the previous Labor government did fail to keep up with changes in technology. He talks about `How are we supposed to know what is going to happen down the track?' When you are the government there is an element of anticipation and an element of planning that needs to take place. The ALP was caught in the wake of technological change and, at least, the honourable member for Hunter has had the decency to own up to something which his colleagues have failed to do.

         I know that the member for Hunter would agree with that, considering that he was referring to the rapid advancements in technology. We have seen some of those rapid advancements and, of course, Australians generally have a propensity to use the latest products and services that are available. Those services are certainly far different today from what they were yesterday.

         Communications pioneers of the last century and early this century, such as Edison, Bell, Marconi and Baird, would all be amazed at the advances and the integration of their early inventions into what is now considered the superhighway. In fact, as recently as last Tuesday, three modern superhighway pioneers—Australian professors Rodney Tucker and Allan Snyder, and Dr Gottfried Ungerboek from Austria—were honoured by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for their major contribution to modern telecommunications in the form of optic fibres. It is truly a significant achievement, and those three gentlemen rank with those that I mentioned earlier on.

         Information technology, of which telecommunications is a large and vital component, is in fact the fastest growing industry in the world. My electorate of Deakin is part of Australia's largest IT region. It is because of such growth that governments must respond quickly to the changing environment—respond, as the member for Hunter has stated, before we as a government are left in its wake and before the needs and the rights of the public are forsaken.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The Labor Party, through its original 1991 bill, failed to respond to, failed to anticipate, the new world order in telecommunications. These bills will certainly redress the wrong, redress the balance that is so sought after by the Australian public.

It is based on a world&amp;hyphen;class infrastructure using the latest technology, access to a range of service providers all offering in a competitive manner diverse and innovative services.

         The government's telecommunications framework enables any number of businesses to operate as carriers. Existing distinctions between fixed and mobile services will be removed and, importantly, new carriers will not face an imposed burden to build their own network. If they did, we would not have two cables strung up and down Maroondah Highway or Whitehorse Road through my electorate but potentially three or four. We would not have 36 mobile towers but potentially 100 within the 59 square kilometre region of the electorate.
        </para>

         My comments today will concentrate on three key aspects of the new framework: firstly, the community and consumer safeguards, including untimed local calls; secondly, anti&amp;hyphen;competitive conduct; and, thirdly, the powers and immunities.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Within the framework, the Telecommunications Bill 1996 provides world&amp;hyphen;class consumer and community safeguards. The bill's provisions are more comprehensive and better developed than those originally introduced by Labor—which in itself is an acknowledgment of Labor's failure to deal with the issues at a time when it first introduced its bill.

          In fact, we now have around 20 consumer safeguards included in these bills. Some are improvements on existing mechanisms; some are new. I would like to briefly refer to a few of them.

Mandatory industry standards, emergency call services, the provision of operator and directory assistance, and itemised bills are all safeguards that are included within the current framework. Of course, another one is the highly politicised issue of price controls. The untimed local call obligation that we promised has not only been maintained but extended. Residential customers have been given the legislated right to untimed local calls for non&amp;hyphen;voice as well as voice calls.

         On the issue of anticompetitive conduct, the benefits of a truly competitive market will only be gained when all carriers and service providers are given the ability to engage in normal competitive behaviour. To stifle such competition will not deliver the benefits demanded by the public. However, the government has determined that some competition regulation should remain to counter the residual market power which incumbent players have over any newcomers.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, will be able to respond swiftly where anticompetitive conduct is evident. It can do so by taking direct action against conduct which substantially lessens competition or which otherwise breaches key trade practices provisions. One regulatory mechanism that is available to the ACCC is the ability to seek an injunction and issue a competition notice but only where certain breaches take place.

         Aspects of this bill address the issue of the powers of carriers and immunity from specific requirements. The new code strikes a balance between on the one hand giving the community a greater say in the rollout of infrastructure, and placing telecommunications into state based land planning regimes, and on the other hand ensuring that Australia gets a world class telecommunications infrastructure.

         The wide&amp;hyphen;ranging immunity provisions for `prescribed activities' have been rejected by this government.

         However, in saying this, the framework must allow the Commonwealth some limited rights of intervention. These rights of intervention exist in particular areas such as low impact facilities, maintenance and temporary defence facilities. All of these will be subject to a code of service. The new rules, in part, continue with established telecommunications policy.

         One area that deserves special attention, and which has received such attention by many speakers this morning, is that of pay television cabling. It is significant because of the problems that have arisen from the failure of the previous Labor government's code, the failure by the previous Labor government to acknowledge the blight, the anxiety and the uproar that such cabling would cause in our community.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In my electorate, the community's objection to the rollout of broadband cable and mobile towers has been well recognised and expressed to both the minister, and to me, by my constituents. Hours of consideration and negotiation have gone into this package. Government backbenchers have listened long and hard to the voices of their electorate. The honourable member for Hunter and the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams) readily denigrated the minister. But, to his credit, he has listened to the backbenchers and he has welcomed their input in the drafting of this bill. Following the concerns of individuals and councils within the Deakin electorate, the framework now includes new obligations on these carriers.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Three important obligations worth mentioning are that there is to be no broadband cabling unless specifically authorised by the relevant state or territory authority; the carriers must collocate their towers unless it is not technically feasible; and undergrounding at major intersections is to take place and, where
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          possible, if undergrounding facilities exist, that is to continue.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The environmental amenity of some parts of the Deakin electorate has clearly been affected by the intrusion of overhead cabling. Residents throughout my electorate and, in particular, those in the environmentally sensitive areas, such as in Blackburn, Mitcham and Ringwood North, have complained bitterly about the intrusion of cables and towers into their streets. Fortunately, pockets within the electorate have been spared the ugly blight of the cables—pockets such as the Bellbird area in Blackburn, which has a heritage classification.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To install the cables, what has had to take place is that nature strip trees have been pruned, in some cases with obvious overenthusiasm, in some cases in a unilateral manner, quite contrary to agreements that have been struck between the local council and the carrier. At one stage, peak hour traffic on the Maroondah Highway was stalled because of a carrier's arrogant and devil&amp;hyphen;may&amp;hyphen;care approach to directives from the local council and, in fact, even from the police.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Who can the people of Deakin, my constituents, thank for such intrusion? They can only thank one particular body in Australia and that is the Labor government, now in opposition. That is whom they can thank and their outrage will remain.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Of course, the electorate is not alone. Many suburbs throughout Melbourne and Sydney have been the focus of Optus and Telstra's rollout. Until last December, of course, local communities had been powerless to act in any strategic manner. Labor's policy failures, as with failures in other areas, will continue to be felt by the residents of Deakin.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Unfortunately for my constituents, a combination of factors, such as the agreement between the carriers, the Labor government's failure to acknowledge its consequences, the legally binding nature of the agreement and the investment of $18 billion on infrastructure and network, has meant that there is no significant turning back possible in those streets. There can be no pulling down of cables at this stage, but I certainly look
         <break page="925" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          forward to the day when those cables do come down.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I know that the Local Government Authority in Victoria remains critical of the new bills. But it is easy for the local government authority to be so dismissive and rattle the sabre when someone else, in this case the federal government and, in turn, my constituents, the taxpayers, would be asked to make financial restitution to the carriers, or foot the bill for undergrounding. While the cable rollout in the cities of Whitehorse and Maroondah is virtually complete, it is my hope that Deakin's pain will not be wasted and that suburbs in other capital cities and regional centres will benefit. To many Australians, the growth and power of telecommunications carriers and providers creates a sense of apprehension and unease. I look forward to these significant obligations and safeguards creating a higher level of consumer confidence in our telecommunications providers.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Finally, as time goes by, the significance of the work of those early communications pioneers, Edison, Bell, Marconi and Baird will be a distant memory. Our pride in Snyder and Tucker may also dim, but the need for governments to respond to the fast paced world of the information superhighway will escalate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I look forward to the increasing competition, to the new products and services demanded by consumers but, above all, I and the public look forward to the safeguards which all of us, the technological minnows, the technological dinosaurs, require as our security blanket.

There were 38,400 new jobs created in the month of January 1997, bringing total growth since June 1996 to 106,400 persons. Since March 1996 there have been 158,900 jobs created in the Australian economy. Youth unemployment fell by 11.4 per cent in January and the youth unemployment rate fell from 30.4 per cent to 27.3 per cent. I hope the Labor Party welcomes that fall in the youth unemployment rate.

         In relation to the budget forward estimates and the forecast that was made of employment growth of two per cent throughout the year, the seasonally adjusted data shows that employment growth in the seven months since June 1996 has averaged around 15,000 persons per month. For the remainder of 1996&amp;hyphen;97, employment growth needs to average around 12,000 persons per month to achieve the government's forecast of two per cent growth.

That is a matter for the ABS and the ABS is considering that at the moment. If the ABS were to revise up the mean of those two figures, the budget forecast for employment would be met already.

As it turns out, there is every reason to believe they will be met, if not more so. I hope that this House welcomes the growth in relation to employment. As I said earlier, one cannot dwell too much on one month's figures only. But what we have seen over recent months is a positive trend in employment, good jobs growth in relation to those opportunities but, of course, continuing work needing to be done to improve job prospects for all Australians.

The other aspect of the accusations made yesterday by the honourable member for Melbourne, assisted by the Leader of the Opposition, was that there was somebody else to whom I had offered an inducement, job or bribe. As I discovered later, it was Dr Clare Pollock, another member of the board. In the same interview, the interviewer's next question was this:

          No offer of a job.

If the Leader of the Opposition had any standards, he would discipline the honourable member for Melbourne for misleading the people of Australia over this issue.

The minister did that in a commonsense and courteous fashion. He did not do it covertly. He did not do it wrongly. He did not do it dishonestly. He did it very openly.

         The Leader of the Opposition had two chances. He was not only minister for employment—and he failed miserably in that portfolio—but Minister for Finance. He was the Minister for Finance who did not have the guts to stand up to Paul Keating's big spending policies that led to $70 billion of accumulated deficits, drove interest rates up and destroyed so many small businesses and jobs around Australia—a gutless Leader of the Opposition who has not got the guts to support the policies that the government is

         One of the most encouraging features of today's statistics has been the fall in full-time unemployment amongst young people. Teenage unemployment—are you listening to this, because you obviously did not pick it up last time?—fell from 30.4 per cent to 27.3 per cent, a very significant fall. We do not want to make too much of one month's figures, but the fact is that that is a very significant fall.

         There are still too many young people unemployed, and many of these young people have become entrenched in unemployment and isolated from their communities. That is precisely what the government's work for the dole scheme is designed to address. It is designed to bring many of these young people out of isolation and to give their communities the opportunity to work with them, to bring them back into community life and to restore their self-esteem.

         It is no surprise, of course, that the Leader of the Opposition is against this scheme, because the unions have told him that they will not cop it and he is too weak to do anything about it or stand up to them. Today's jobs figures are just a step along the road to rebuilding employment opportunities in this country, but they are encouraging news. They show that Australia is now on a different course to the one which was set by the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues on the other side of the House when they were in government.

          —I thank the member for her question and the fact that she did indicate she would ask a question on this topic. For that reason, I am able to give the information that is required. There was a RAAF contingent based at Ubon in Thailand situated on the borders of Laos and Cambodia between 1962 and 1968. They were there pursuant to our arrangements and our obligations under SEATO and it was separate from our involvement with the Vietnam war.

         Ubon is in fact a Royal Thai Air Force base, and there were two reasons that were considered specifically by the Committee of Inquiry into Defence and Defence Related Awards dealing with why they did not recommend that the Vietnam Medal be awarded but did in fact recommend that the ASM 1945&amp;hyphen;75 with clasp Thailand be awarded. Indeed, that award is being made, recognising the service they gave.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The reason that the committee recommended that the Vietnam Medal could not be awarded was simply that the area designated for the award of that medal did not include Ubon within its perimeters and the committee did not consider that it ought to be changed. The second reason related to the rules of engagement which were set down for that particular contingent. They were:

         That no aircraft will be directed to investigate any identified contacts unless specifically requested by the Royal Thai government and, secondly, that no aircraft will attack unless fired upon.

I might say that the Senate's reconsideration of this matter will improve the budget position by $196 million over the next four years. This means that the total savings for Australian taxpayers from the implementation of this election promise will be during that same period an amount of $337 million.

         But it is interesting that this measure has passed through the Senate against the strenuous opposition of the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats have once again shown their contempt for the views of the taxpaying public of Australia, their contempt for the views of mainstream Australia, their lack of connection with the beliefs and attitudes of mainstream Australia and they have voted together to strike down a measure of which clear and explicit notice was given by the coalition during the election campaign. As the Labor Party has demonstrated with its response to the government's proposals for work for the dole, as the Labor Party has demonstrated in relation to Hindmarsh bridge and as the Labor Party now demonstrates in relation to the two-year waiting period for migrants, it is utterly out of touch with the concerns and aspirations of mainstream Australian taxpayers.

These issues go to their daily concerns; these issues go to their daily livelihoods. I want to say to those people that we remain sensitive to their concerns, and we will respond strongly, fairly and consistently with the aims and values of the mainstream of the Australian community. Just as they can rely on us to do that, they can increasingly rely on the Australian Labor Party at every turn to vote against, to frustrate and to try to obstruct the realisation of what they want their duly elected government to do.

It became renewed after the Monarch crash several years ago in which seven people were killed—all bar one of those people I happened to know. As a result of that, I began inquiries of my own to find out why that had happened. I will tell you why it occurred and, indeed, the coronial inquiry confirms this advice. One of the major contributing causes to that crash was the failure of the safety regulator to properly maintain safe aviation standards in this country.

         Can I just pick up the thrust of the question, which is that in some way there has been impropriety in what the minister has done. When that allegation was made yesterday it somehow jarred with me. I thought: how can it be that an allegation of this kind is made? How can it be that what the minister has done is seen as being in some way improper? It disturbed me. Finally, I came across what really had caused me to jar: a report of the onslaught of the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition to obtain Labor Party preselection for the seat of La Trobe in 1994.

          this morning there is an article headed `Reforms threaten meat exports'. At the outset I want to reassure the House that the Commonwealth's planned reforms are in fact all about improving food safety and quality as a vital investment in this country in securing new and existing markets. Industry and government together recognise that consumers here and abroad want and demand ever higher standards of food safety. Better processes will be required in the future to meet those rising expectations.

          The approach that we are adopting, the so-called HACCP based system, agreed by all Australian governments, already implemented in Victoria and increasingly now being picked up by the other states, is now used extensively worldwide in food production right across the region. The point that needs to be understood by some of these people, including Ms Felicity Rafferty, is that the game has moved on. Things change. I know that sometimes that is hard for people like to Felicity to recognise, but these are the not the old days where visual inspection of carcasses was the best way to secure food safety in the meat industry.

          These days the safety and quality issues of the 1990s go to the heart of things like micro&amp;hyphen;biological contamination and residues. They need much more sophisticated approaches to pick up. So, in short, criticism from Felicity Rafferty of the CPSU is a travesty in this area. It is really all about protecting a job—her job—and the few hundred people that she represents, regardless of the implication for the 50,000 other Australian workers, most of them in the regions, who work in this massive Australian industry.

          This government is about protecting and enhancing our export opportunities. It is hardly going to put consumers at risk or implement processes that cannot be justified here or internationally. Apart from anything else, we have seen from the international experience what BSE has done to consumer confidence amongst meat eaters. We are putting in place total quality control systems which will remain under the watchful eyes of government employed regulators. Those measures are designed to maximise, not minimise, our opportunities in our markets here and aboard.

          —I thank the honourable member for his question. Last November I became concerned that there was very little consensus or goodwill in the private health sector. So back then I convened the first in a series of round table discussions with hospitals, doctors, insurers and consumers to see whether there could be common ground found on a number of issues. I am pleased to say that the last meeting occurred yesterday and consensus has emerged on a number of issues which I think will be very positive for consumers. They are simplified billing, informed consent and guidelines for contractual negotiations.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The first is simplified billing. Anyone who has had a stint in a private hospital will know the torrent of bills that turns up after a hospital stay. My last experience with that was two years ago when my son had a two day stay in intensive care. I got something like 35 bills for that two day stay over the next five months. That is what over 10 per cent of people put as their major reason for dropping private health cover.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Doctors, hospitals and funds have agreed to cooperate on a number on trials looking at different methods of simplified billing. It may not get down to just one bill, but it offers very real prospects of, for the first time, being able to do something that is very positive for consumers. It also recognises that the present system is totally unsatisfactory.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second thing is informed consent. Most people find it nearly impossible to find out how much they will be up for for an episode of care. While individual surgeons may give
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          their fees in the out&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;pocket expenses, you cannot predict what the anaesthetist, the radiologist, the pathologist and the other doctors working in the area are going to charge.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         They have agreed to set up a group to design and trial different procedures to give informed consent for the public. It may be in the end that the public will, at best, only be able to be given a range of expectations because you cannot always predict what is going to happen post&amp;hyphen;operatively. There is also goodwill here and a willingness to accept that the public has a right to have some idea of what they are going to be up for.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Finally, hospitals and funds have agreed that there should be some guidelines for contract negotiations particularly when this impinges on the rights of consumers. Negotiations between hospitals and funds are quite new. They are still exploring their ways. I get a torrent of complaints from insurers and then I get exactly the same complaints about the insurers from the funds. In the end though, they both should be interested in the public. I do not want to see the public getting squeezed or forgotten in these contract negotiations. I thank all parts of the health industry and also the consumers for their excellent input. Hopefully something worth while will come out of it for the public.

Did the minister meet with the Board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority in April 1996 and invite the four lay members of the board to resign? Did he state to the board members words to the effect that, if there were any other government appointments or work that would be more conducive or convenient for them, he was prepared to look at that? Can he confirm that the chairman of CASA responded by stating: `We are

          —I thank the member for Griffith for his question. It would be well known to many that he is a great supporter of local government having spent nine years on the Brisbane City Council. In the current financial year, 1996-97, the Commonwealth provided $1.2 billion in grants to local councils. This was an increase in the 1995-96 level of nearly $47 million. It is an increase that represents a four per cent increase, and that is in both dollar terms and real terms. The increase honoured a major election promise and undertaking of the coalition.

         The FAGs pay for approximately 10 per cent of all local government income and some smaller regional and rural councils receive up to 50 per cent of their income from these grants. Using the Australian Local Government Association classifications of urban, rural and urban regional councils, in 1996-97, urban councils received $385 million, urban regional councils received $323 million and rural councils received $475 million. The total grants to rural and regional councils is, therefore, $779 million. This represents 67 per cent of the total Commonwealth grants to local councils.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The important point is that, of that nearly $47 million increase in 1996-97, rural and regional councils received 77 per cent, or $35 million, of that total increase. These are untied funds. They are funds that are used by councils to build roads and bridges, health clinics, regional centres, maintain parks and
         <break page="940" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         This funding is helping to generate jobs. It is recognised that it helps to generate opportunities in small business. It is recognised by local government, particularly in rural and regional areas, as being absolutely essential for their ongoing capacity to provide services and it is a clear demonstration of the commitment of this government to rural and regional councils and, indeed, to local government right around our nation.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It belies the fact of the accusations made by the Labor Party that this government is not supporting rural and regional Australia. The facts show otherwise. The people in rural and regional Australia know that to be the case, and that is why they supported us in overwhelming numbers in the election that we have just had.

         Now we have a situation where we have a formal `show cause' letter which he has sent, dated 28 January, to enable him to sack the board. That letter has been sent to all four board members. It is 19 pages long, and I have a copy of it here. Two of these members have four months to go in their positions. If it is not bad enough that he is engaging in this outrageous campaign of vilification and smear against the members of this board, now we have a situation where it has been uncovered that he and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) have been seeking to induce the resignation of some members of the board by offering them other positions, clearly in contravention of the ministerial guidelines and quite possibly in contravention of the Crimes Act as well.

         Over the past year the minister has done the following things: he has asked in person, he has asked in writing, he has asked directly at a meeting of the board, for their resignations. His answer as to why he had to do this: `I have obligations to other people.' I would urge you to remember that quote. He claimed that they had no experience relevant to aviation, including Dr Clare Pollock, who is a safety expert. I would remind him that the name of the authority is the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. But, no, she has no relevant expertise. He misled the public about the board's role on the Ita Buttrose program. He effectively said the board gets out there and checks the planes, which, of course, it does not. It has a supervisory role.

And, in spite of that, they have already got a draft to the department for their comment. But they have failed to provide a corporate plan!

These requests were made on 14 January, 15 January and 17 January—not 1996 but 14, 15 and 17 January 1997. In other words, we are going to dismiss independent board members of a statutory authority because they have failed to respond to a request from the minister's office for a document within about five or six working days.

          On 6 May last year, board member Gabi Hollows met with Senator Herron, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, and with Tim Fischer—the postman, Mr Fischer the postman—in the Prime Minister's office. He delivered a letter from Senator Herron to her. We have all seen what is in that letter, since it was finally tabled last night after Senator Herron quoted selectively from it. In fact, he quoted almost all of it except the key sentence and then refused to table it. I wonder why he did that. Could it have perhaps been a guilty conscience or was it just coincidence? The key sentence is:

          I have discussed this matter with my ministerial colleague Mr Sharp who has assured me that he will be amenable to you retiring from your responsibilities on the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority in order to be available for an appointment in the area of Aboriginal health delivery.

          Oh, the unctuousness. He is amenable. The generosity. The condescension. He is amenable to Ms Hollows resigning when in fact he has been chasing her and her fellow board members relentlessly throughout the whole period preceding this letter.

          Then Gabi Hollows meets the minister for transport and—what a coincidence—he says, `I'd like you to resign from the CASA board. Oh, by the way, I've got a great idea. Why don't you go down the corridor and there is the minister for Aboriginal affairs, my good mate. I think he can line up a job for you.' Of course, according to the Prime Minister, this is just pure coincidence—total coincidence that all this is occurring. What is it? It is actually the old one-two. The two ministers saying, `Right, we've got a problem here. John's got a problem, so John will fix it up. We get Gabi Hollows in—bang, bang, away we go. Yes, no worries, we're going to look after you,' and his problem is solved. But, fortunately, Gabi Hollows did not take the bait. She knew what was involved; she knew what this was all about.

           It will be said, and it already has been said, what is wrong in appointing Gabi Hollows to a position in Aboriginal affairs? Nothing. There is nothing wrong with doing that. But that is not the issue. The appointment has to be on the basis of merit alone—merit only, not on the basis of extraneous considerations like `Will she do something else? Will she resign from another position in order to do that?' That is not on the basis of merit.

           The real reason for this offer is shown by the fact that it was a general offer. It was not a specific offer. Senator Herron did not say, `There is this position involving these tasks, this remuneration and this time.' It was a general offer in a letter. The true nature of this offer was `I want you to get off the Civil Aviation Safety Authority board.' That was the true motive for the offer.

           What was the qualification required of Gabi Hollows in this instance? It was that she agree to resign from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority board. Nothing else.

But he has not told us why he raised the issue in the first place. Why did he raise the issue in the first place? He has not answered that at all.

It is perhaps worth asking the question: if she is unqualified to be on the board, how is it that she is qualified to do consultancies for the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation? How is she qualified for those? The answer is, of course, as I said before, that Clare Pollock is an expert on safety, on human reactions, on human behaviour in safety generally and an entirely appropriate person to be on that board.

           The reply from Mr Justice Fisher makes it very clear what the proposal was that the minister made to him, and what it indicates is that there are three instances which cannot be explained away by innocent misunderstandings as he seeks to do. Within a month, he has innocently ganged up with Senator Herron on Gabi Hollows to try to offer her a job in Aboriginal affairs if she resigned. He has innocently suggested to the board, `If you need something else, I can look at it.' He has innocently suggested to Clare Pollock, `What about consultancies?' Doesn't it strike you as remarkably coincidental that all of these innocent things are going on in such a way. This minister has the competence of Billy McMahon and the credibility of Richard Nixon.

         We have seen a display in the House this afternoon and yesterday of how incompetent and inappropriate the Labor Party was in government and now how incompetent and inappropriate they are in opposition. Their track record on aviation safety management is nothing to crow about. We have heard today, and yesterday, from the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). Yesterday he was ably assisted by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) who, incidentally, and interestingly, did not appear in the attack today.

         The reason the Leader of the Opposition was not part of the attack today was simply that he knew—like everybody on this side of the House knows, like most people on the Labor side of the House know—that the opposition is flogging a dead duck. The Leader of the Opposition knows—like everybody else in this House and everybody in the Australian public knows—when it comes to administering aviation safety in this country, who has credibility and who has not. Everybody knows the Labor Party in government had probably the worst track record of aviation safety management in the history of this country. The reasons for that are evident wherever you want to turn in recent years. I am fascinated that the person seconding the censure motion of the honourable member for Melbourne today is the former Minister for Transport, the member for Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton), who was responsible during most of the period that the Labor Party was in office during the 1990s for aviation safety in this country.

I guess two outstanding things spring to mind in the history of Labor's management of aviation safety in this country. They are words that are household names around Australia. They are Monarch Airlines and Seaview Air. Monarch Airlines was

In the subsequent publicity that followed, and in the coronial inquiry which investigated the preconditions or causes of that crash, it became quite self&amp;hyphen;evident that the failure of the aviation safety regulator was a major contributing factor to that crash in which seven people lost their lives.

         Which government was responsible for establishing the aviation safety regulator in Australia at that time? Which government was it? The Labor government. Which ministers were responsible at the time for the implementation of the reforms that established the Civil Aviation Authority? Which ministers were they? Let me think for a moment. Oh, Senator Gareth Evans was Minister for Transport and Communications at the time of the establishment of the Civil Aviation Authority in 1988. What is Senator Evans doing today? Oh, he is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition here in the House of Representatives. Who else was around at the time? The then member for Swan, who is now the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), was also minister for transport through this period. Who else was minister for transport through this period? The former Treasurer in the Labor government, Mr Willis. So sitting on the opposition benches today is a living history of the reforms made by the previous Labor government in civil aviation regulation in Australia.

         It is quite clear that, as a consequence of those reforms, they established an organisation which let down the travelling public of Australia.

         My involvement in this goes back to the night of that Monarch crash. That crash occurred within a mile of my farm at Young, where I come from. It was the place I learnt to fly at. I knew six of the seven people who

         Many people would not believe me when I first started to tell the story, but I felt it was important for us to do that. And we did it. I did it on 9 May 1994 in this House. I highlighted all of my concerns. I described an airline which I felt was an accident waiting to happen, another Monarch. That was Seaview. Seaview Air, I said, was `a danger to the travelling public' if I can remember my words at the time. Of course, five months later, having made all these claims in the House and having brought them to the attention of the then Minister for Transport, who is now the member for Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith, and having seen the government take no notice whatsoever, a Seaview Air plane crashed on 2 October 1994 with nine lives lost. In the commission of inquiry that followed, it was quite apparent that a contributing factor to that crash and the loss of those nine lives was the failure of the aviation safety regulator to do its job properly, to do the job that it was paid for.

         It was sad but true that, because of the inefficiency and incompetence of that aviation safety regulator, a number of people lost their lives.

I am driven in my present role as Minister for Transport and Regional Development to make sure that I get aviation safety regulation right in this country. It is quite obvious to anybody, as it was obvious in those two inquiries, that there is a serious problem. Yet what did Labor do? It changed things by establishing two separate authorities. On 1 July 1995, the former CAA became two organisations: Airservices Australia and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority—strange that because that is precisely what I recommended.

While we are on legal opinions, let me place another one before the House this afternoon, not from the Crown law officer asked to give a narrow interpretation on a letter and forbidden from looking at the surrounding circumstances but from a leading member of the Sydney criminal bar who today has provided an opinion which says:

          There are many ways to seek to influence or affect a Commonwealth officer in the exercise of his duty or authority by promising or offering any property or benefit other than by an outright express bribe. The suggestion made by the letter on its face is oblique. When it is considered in the context of the provable circumstances the suggestion becomes quite blatant: "If you resign from the Board we'll find you a job in Aboriginal health." What matters as far as criminality or impropriety is concerned is the nature of all the conduct, the intention behind its effect . . .

We reject the insulting character of this motion as put by the Labor Party against a minister who, in the last 12 months, has been working to overcome the problems left to him by the last and previous Labor administration. And what is more, with every ounce of indignation I can bring, we reject the Labor Party putting up the member for Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton) as a seconder on this motion when he was the minister responsible, during a significant period under the Labor administration, for the very problems that the now minister has been attempting to resolve.

         It is beyond belief that the Labor Party could so insult the intelligence of the Australian people that they could put up the member for Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith on an issue which they claim goes to questions of propriety and probity. He is the member who started in the kindergarten of politics in New South Wales, in the Labor Youth Council, and who soon
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          became infamous for the fact that on the back of a motorbike in the middle of the night he took off with a parcel of disputed votes so as to ensure the preselection of Paul Keating. He is the incarnation, if you like, of the Chappaquiddick of Australian politics.

         The member for Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith comes in here talking to us about probity but he was at the centre of one of Australia's most infamous, unsolved political scandals—the rezoning of land around Botany Bay—which, for those of you who are interested in a bit of Australian history, at one stage saw charges brought against the member for Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith. The magistrate said that there was a prima facie case against him, but the same case was dismissed by none other than Chief Magistrate Murray Farquhar—also famous in Australian politics.

        <para first-indent="16">
         They put him up to attack us on probity and then they put him up to attack the competence of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp). We get this from the member for Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith, who was the minister responsible for the tendering of the tunnel under Sydney Harbour; the minister responsible for the blowouts at Darling Harbour; and the minister responsible for the monorail, which has never made an cent of profit. In his own former federal portfolio—let us talk about competence—one of the great fiascos of management was the handling of the Sydney airport noise issue, which for so long he was the irresponsible minister in charge of.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Not only does the member for Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith have that litany of failure and question marks over his political career but in his last effort he was the Minister for Industrial Relations. He was the minister who had the gall to stand up in the parliament suggesting a few technical changes to his unfair dismissal law and saying he was going to make a good system better—a system which during Labor's administration literally cost, I would say on a fair and conservative estimate, tens of thousands of jobs of our fellow Australians right across the board but particularly young Australians. I do not make that as a party political comment. Bob Carr, the Labor Premier of New South Wales, made that
         <break page="952" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          point—that Laurie Brereton's unfair dismissal laws were costing young people opportunities for jobs. So we especially reject a censure motion which is seconded by the member for Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith for all of those very good reasons and also for the hollowness of the claims which they make in regard to the issue before us today.

         I also want to say, as we reflect upon the political career of the member for Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith, what a stark contrast that makes to the incredible efforts that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development—today the subject of the opposition attack—has made in the last 11 months. I suppose I have seen many pretty empty censure motions over the years, but it is particularly galling that we have a censure motion against a minister, the subject matter of which is his attempting to fix up the problems which he has inherited from the previous side.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is not as though this is a new issue. The fact is that John Sharp has put in a hell of an effort, both in opposition and in government, trying to improve aviation safety in this country. It is incredibly galling for you to in any sense question his motive, when he has on the record his efforts for many years now—and those of you who know him personally know what a huge effort he has made for one reason, and that is he has tried to improve the air safety conditions which face Australians as they travel by air. That record is there for all to see.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As he mentioned—I thought very well—during question time today, the minister had ministerial responsibility as a shadow minister in opposition for some of these issues. But the fact is he was personally touched and affected by one of these crashes where a lot of people died. It says a lot for and is a testimony to our colleague that he has made it a personal objective to improve air safety in this country. That is why we particularly so strongly support the minister.

         The issue, as put by Labor, revolves around two incidents or series of events. The first relates to Gabi Hollows and her continuation on the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority—and similarly the continuation of other board members. Our policy position on this has been quite clear. This is not something that has arisen just in recent times. Well prior to the previous election we made the simple point that we believed that those who constitute that authority ought to be people who are expert in the field. As a commonsense proposition, that is very hard to deny, and I was interested to listen to the contributions from the two Labor members because
         <break page="953" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          they have never actually mounted a rational argument against that simple proposition. If you are worried about aviation safety in this country and you have a regulatory authority in charge of it, it seems to me to make eminent sense that the people in charge of that—the people at whom the buck stops—should be people who have some expertise in that area. We have made that point. It is a policy point that was endorsed in the last election, and this minister has simply been going about doing his job in a competent and sensible way. For that, you bring forward the most spurious, base and hollow claim imaginable.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Look at the question of whether or not Ms Hollows should remain on the board. The point the minister has been making is that he respects Gabi Hollows—as do members on both sides of this House, I am sure—for being the person she is and for the work she does in a number of areas. It is hardly exceptional for a minister to say that the government would be interested if she were able to serve the national interest by taking an appointment in the area of Aboriginal health. Basically, that is all that has been said. You can go over the fine detail of the documentation, but that is the bottom line.

          With the second one, the reality is that the minister, on the basis of what he said and of the confirmation we have had from Bill Fisher, said to Claire Pollock, `Regardless of the circumstances of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, our view about the work that you might have in the future with the government, given the fact that you have had work with the government before, would not in any way be impaired by the fact that you might tender your resignation from the CASA board.'

I got out the ministerial guidelines and, when you boil it down, the ministerial guidelines expect ministers to act with probity and to get on with the job. That is exactly what this minister has done. Commonsense would tell you that, if you wanted to see a change in the structure of the board, you ought to be talking to some of the people concerned. The minister has done that. It would be pretty odd if he had not talked to those people about what the consequences of their going off the board might be. It beggars belief that this is the subject of a censure motion in the national parliament. You are basically attacking the minister for doing his job by talking to somebody about getting off the CASA board and about what the implications for their relationship with the government might be in the future. It is absolutely absurd.

         entitled `Coalition push for more detail on convention', Michelle Grattan sought to give a report on our recent party meeting.

        The misrepresentation is the inference that I released a statement following a party meeting in conflict with the decision of the government. Ms Grattan was, in essence, quoting from my media release of 5 February, issued well before the government had decided what level of representation should be given to the states and territories. I just wish to correct the record.

           —by leave—The first report which I have tabled concerns the proposed development of operational facilities at RAAF Base Darwin. The Department of Defence proposes to provide the base with the facilities needed to perform its operational role in a safe and effective manner. The proposal examined by the committee encompasses: one, explosive ordnance loading aprons and alert facilities for fighter aircraft; two, operational and technical support facilities; three, additional aviation fuel storage; four, an upgrade of the emergency power station; five, a replacement fire and rescue facility; and,
           <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
            six, replacement airfield lighting equipment facilities.

          </para>
         </talk.start>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The estimated outturn cost of the proposed work is $59.5 million. The committee has recommended that the work should proceed. The committee concluded that the military presence in Darwin reflects government policy for an increased defensive presence in the north of Australia. It is clear that RAAF Base Darwin is a vital component of the Defence infrastructure in the north and is likely to remain for many years at its present location.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          By way of background, the report notes that the military and civilian infrastructure at RAAF Base Darwin represents a significant investment by the Commonwealth and the cost of relocating the RAAF base to another site on the grounds of aircraft noise or public safety cannot be justified.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In answer to a number of individuals and organisations which suggested that the RAAF base should be relocated elsewhere on the grounds of aircraft noise, the report acknowledges the responsible efforts of the RAAF in promulgating noise abatement procedures which have reduced the incidence of noise complaints. Nevertheless, the report recommends that the Department of Defence should establish a dedicated telephone line for receiving and recording any complaints about aircraft noise and a mechanism for their speedy investigation and reporting back to the complainants.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The strategic importance of RAAF Base Darwin can easily be overlooked by the presence of RAAF Base Tindall, which is not far to the south. But what the committee had reinforced to it was that, in the sense of real defence for the north of Australia, the role of RAAF Base Darwin as a forward staging post could not be underestimated and that the location of RAAF Base Darwin in strategic terms was irreplaceable.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In relation to the extensive works that are proposed, the committee has concluded that all of these works will enhance the operational facilities of RAAF Base Darwin as an operational forward redeployment and air defence base not only for Darwin but for the entire nation.

           The second report I have tabled deals with the proposed development of buildings and services in support of the Department of Defence joint project 2043, high frequency modernisation project. The high frequency modernisation project will provide for the installation of modern, state-of-the&amp;hyphen;art high frequency radio equipment to satisfy the needs of Army, Navy and Air Force.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The public works proposal will provide access roads, security, engineering services and buildings to house the transmitter, receiver and management functions of the network. The entire modernisation project will cost $505 million with building works and services estimated to cost $75 million. The committee has recommended that the building works and services should proceed.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The high frequency modernisation project will consist of four communication nodes, each comprising a transmitter station, receiver station and local management facility. There will also be a primary and secondary national management facility. The communication nodes will be located in the Riverina, Townsville, North West Cape and Darwin. I note the interest of the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) in this proposal and his presence in the chamber this afternoon.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The committee concluded that existing facilities are aged and need refurbishment and that new facilities are required at two communication nodes. Facilities to house the high frequency equipment will be located on existing Defence properties and properties acquired for radio communications purposes. All are in areas which Defence believes are free of electromagnetic interference and have sufficient buffer zones to protect them from urban encroachment.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The proposed work will entail the construction of new facilities for the Riverina transmitter and receiver on sites which Defence believes are suitable. Elsewhere, the proposal will make good use of existing facilities which will need to be modified.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Once the high frequency network is operational, some existing Defence communication sites will be redundant. The committee noted that, before excess properties are offered for sale, Defence should ensure that any soil
           <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
            contamination has been remedied in accordance with state or local government requirements.
           </break>
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The report recommends that the Department of Defence provides annual reports on the status of the redundant properties, particularly in relation to the cost of the remediation of any soil contamination, when they are to be sold and the amount of revenue received. I commend these reports to the House.

           —by leave—The high frequency modernisation project is very important to my city of Townsville, because Townsville is the home base of the Operational Defence Force and 3rd Brigade that responds in this country first up.

          The receiver equipment will be located at a new site in the Townsville field training area where there is already significant infrastructure of other types that support the Operational Defence Force. I certainly welcome the continuing investment by the government in Townsville. I am unable to say the exact amount of dollars that this project will entail in Townsville because it is at this stage commercial-in-confidence and will be subject to a tender process.

          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           other bills identified in the orders of the day was interrupted by question time, so I am resuming my contribution. Before question time, I made reference to a very clear, firm and unqualified commitment which had been made by the present Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to the National Farmers Federation prior to the last election, and I believe that that commitment was very important, firstly, in having the National Farmers Federation endorse the partial sale of Telstra and, secondly, in assuring people in rural and provincial Australia that an incoming coalition government would make absolutely certain that high technology telecommunications facilities would be available to them just as surely as they would be available to people in metropolitan and larger provincial cities.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The amendment which was moved by the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), who represents the shadow minister for communications in this chamber, made four points. I am not going to go over them—they have already been identified. What I want to do is indicate that I intend to concentrate, to the extent that I can, my remarks on item (3) of that amendment where it expresses concern at the government's refusal to honour its election promise on ISDN connections for rural and provincial Australians. People know that ISDN refers to the integrated services digital network. Just to put on the record the promise that was made by the Prime Minister, I indicate that it was made on 21 November 1995 to the National Farmers Federation. It was the big policy announcement of that day. The Prime Minister said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Today I announce that a Coalition Government will require Telstra to offer all of its customers who have lines connected to digital exchanges with access to ISDN as a standard service.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         We will also require Telstra to substantially complete its FMO or digitisation of exchanges by 1 July 1997, instead of its current year 2000 target date.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         `Its current year 2000 target date' was our commitment—the former Labor government's. That was brought forward, as I say, by that unqualified commitment on the part of the present Prime Minister, then Leader of the Opposition, that an incoming coalition government would bring that target date
         <break page="962" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          forward to 1 July 1997, that is, this year. Everyone knows that since that commitment was made, the government has sought to back&amp;hyphen;pedal in a way which will bring very serious disadvantage to those people to whom that promise was quite clearly and unqualifiedly made.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For people in rural areas, there are probably two services which, to them, are of overriding importance: transport is one, communications is the other. This present government slashed $600 million out of its road programs, so that is what has been done for transport. As far as communications are concerned, the whole area of telecommunications and things like these high technology provisions, the ISDN, all of those things, if they are provided for people in rural and provincial Australia, will make it possible for them and their families, and in particular for their children, to be given equal opportunities. When we talk about making opportunities available to kids in Australia, we mean the kids in the bush, just the same as we mean the kids at Bennelong, the kids at Hunters Hill, the kids who can be seen from Kirribilli. We mean the kids in the bush. Now for a government to repudiate an undertaking of that kind, as it quite clearly is set to do, I think is nothing short of disgraceful.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Senator Chris Schacht is our spokesman on communications and he is represented in this chamber by the shadow minister for health, the member for Dobell, Michael Lee, who, incidentally, was the minister for communications in the previous government when that commitment was made that we would be providing, as standard service, across Australia to all Australians, those services by the year 2000. Michael Lee, the member for Dobell, was in the process of charting the course of communications reform for the next century. That has all now been put asunder.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The member for Dobell also raised very serious questions when he led for the government in responding to this legislation. I am not going to go into all of those, because, as I have indicated, the one that I am particularly concerned about is item (3) in our amendment, that is, the government's election
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          promise on ISDN connections for rural and provincial Australians.
         </break>

         I emphasise again that we had undertaken to provide it by the year 2000. The present government, in opposition, said that they would bring that forward until 1 July 1997, that is, this year. After the election, the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, commissioned the review group which was chaired by Jock Given from the Communications Law Centre in order to examine this whole area. That was the first step in a quite deliberate strategy to repudiate that earlier undertaking, particularly because of the composition of that review group. I mentioned that Jock Given was to be the chairman. I am not going to go through all the others, except to say that that review group represented, for example, isolated children's parents, the Australian Consumers Association, the National Farmers Federation, the Consumers Telecommunications Network, Australian Telecommunications Users Group, Telstra, Vodaphone, Optus, all of the deliverers, all of the service providers, all of the operators in the area of telecommunications, but of particular and very special significance was the inclusion of—I say this without denigrating the professor, he knows he had a role to play and he played it—Professor Henry Ergas, visiting professor from the Centre for Research in Network Economics and Communications, University of Auckland.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is particularly significant because, at the end of that very comprehensive examination of all the issues that that review group was charged to examine, the professor delivered an individual report of one. Those other nine—consumers, providers, participants in telecommunications—all contributed to and endorsed the joint report which that study brought forward. The only dissenting comments were from Professor Ergas.

         It was interesting because the next stage in this very smart strategy to repudiate that undertaking engineered by and instituted by the minister, Senator Alston, was his media release following that review committee's report.

He said that he was disappointed that the review group was unable to reach a consensus. Nine did; one dissented. He said the two reports would be given careful consideration. It is interesting that the dissenting comments of Professor Ergas quite clearly are going to be the ones that will be given most careful consideration.

         This Telecommunications Bill and its associated legislation currently before the House provides a platform for an Australian telecommunications industry that is competitive and on the cutting edge. At the same time, these bills signal a new age of greater choice and protection for consumers and new opportunities for technological innovation. Sadly, the first wave of new possibilities offered to Australians has consisted of more stick than carrot, in the form of the two most used words in my electorate office lexicon, `overhead cables'. Not surprisingly, the community reaction to the uglification of our streets with the erection of towers and hanging of cables has been both loud and widespread. While people are being told about their increased choice of channels, programs and services, they have had no choice about the siting of these cables.

         The Telecommunications Act 1991, sponsored by the previous Labor government, has allowed Telstra and Optus to do as they please with scant regard for the wishes of residents and the environment. I am sorry that the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) did not mention that the Labor Party was responsible for the introduction of the 1991 Telecommunications Act that led to this very sorry state of affairs which this current government is attempting to change.

         With extremely charitable immunities due to expire in mid-1997, Telstra and Optus have attempted to roll out their cable as quickly as possible. This has caused a great deal of unrest in the Australian community. Certainly it has become the major concern among the residents of my electorate of Sturt, who decry the fact that 21st century technology will arrive in their houses courtesy of a 19th century delivery service.

         New technologies have usually achieved quick penetration in the Australian marketplace. I suspect that most Australians have been waiting for pay TV for a long time. But the widespread anger at the overhead rollout has somewhat dulled the enthusiasm. Carriers will have to conform to new obligations, such as collocation of mobile phone towers and ducts, where possible, which is something my constituents have been demanding for a very long time. While Austel discovered that collocation was not universally feasible, it recommended that it was possible in 30 per cent of cases. For competing commercial reasons, Telstra and Optus have failed to explore those possibilities fully.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Of course, that would not be the case if the Labor government had listened to the coalition, then in opposition. From the outset, Labor badly mishandled the whole issue of pay TV. After equivocating for years on whether Australia should even have pay TV, they invoked a regime that was clumsy and cost ineffective. It has been extremely difficult to explain to people that the sins of our predecessors have tied our hands with regard to the control over cabling in towns.

         The coalition, however, is doing something about this mess. Already we have negotiated some new restrictions, and the telecommunications companies have agreed to a tougher interim regime.

         Burying cables is an expensive proposition that will require the cooperation of all levels of government, utility companies and the community. I know in my own state of South Australia that there have been several estimates over the cost of such an enterprise. While the amounts have varied widely, none of the quotes has been inexpensive. However, there is considerable resolve to get the job done. If in the not&amp;hyphen;too&amp;hyphen;distant future we can rid our cities, suburbs and towns of all overhead wires and, as a consequence, even the classic Aussie stobie pole, as it is called in South Australia, the harshest critic of the current arrangements will admit that it was all worth the effort. Perhaps then they will take down the signs `No overhead cables' that seem to festoon my electorate across all the main streets.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The framework that will curb the aerial festooning activities of Optus and Telstra will be of great benefit to consumers. However, these benefits will flow only if there is true competition among the various players. The anti&amp;hyphen;competitive conduct provisions in the package allow industry players flexibility but require adherence to the Trade Practices Act, supplemented by the involvement of the ACCC, which will issue competition guidelines by 1 July and act to stop non-competitive conduct thereafter.

         Consumers will also benefit from the safeguards contained in this telecommunications package.

In addition, the all&amp;hyphen;important obligations to provide free access to emergency calls and operator and directory assistance services have been retained and will apply to all appropriate providers. The new customer service guarantee, which is not part of the current act, will promote higher service levels and guarantee quick avenues to

         Telstra and its predecessors, for so long the monopoly in telecommunications, tasted its first domestic competition only recently. From 1 July, there will be new carriers, which will offer new services to consumers. There will be no restriction on the number of these able to enter the market. Opening up the market will ensure that Australia enjoys state-of-the-art infrastructure that uses the latest technology. A freer market with less regulation will also guarantee a greater choice of services and different rate packages. There will be fierce competition for niche markets and broader services alike. Costs to the consumer can only inevitably come down.

         As one who has spoken in this place before on the importance of privacy provisions, I am gratified to see that this legislation covers the protection of communications.

         Twelve months ago, Telstra announced it would be spending millions of dollars over two years to protect their customers from misuse of phone information. That assurance followed a six-month study by a privacy audit panel which found that Telstra failed to meet best practice standards in the areas of accountability, use of information and gaining consent from customers. Despite that finding, the audit also admitted that Telstra exceeded international standards for the protection of data.

         The new telecommunications act will strengthen the privacy provisions. It will now be a requirement that companies keep adequate records of disclosure of information. The Privacy Commissioner will monitor the

Currently, many of my constituents are financially disadvantaged by bureaucratic line drawing, which is always done from the mainland capitals of Sydney and Melbourne where Telstra and Optus reside. Because of the misunderstanding of what constitutes rural and remote areas in their minds, this line drawing defines areas which are included in the local call area and forces other people to pay STD rates because they are on the other side of this so-called line.

         The three centres that I mentioned—Dover, Cockle Creek and Catamaran—could have quite easily been included in the local area network as these are the last small townships.

          —I wish to raise two matters very briefly. The first one is for the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer). I have advice from AusAID that they are aware of an emerging drought situation in parts of Kenya since late last year. The government of Kenya has recently declared a national emergency and launched an appeal for international assistance for drought relief measures.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is a matter that I believe the Minister for Foreign Affairs ought to give very rapid and prompt attention to, not only on most important humanitarian grounds but also because of the important role that Kenya plays as a partner of Australia in the Indian Ocean Rim initiative. Kenya was one of the five original nations in that process. It is a country which, because of the importance—that is recognised—of our relationships in the Indian Ocean, we ought to be paying particular attention to. For those reasons, as well as the more fundamental humanitarian reasons, the Minister for Foreign Affairs ought to be giving prompt attention to this issue.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second matter I wish to raise is a matter for the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston). It arises from a constituent who came to my office—a Mrs Azab—who, much to her consternation, recently received a bill from Telstra of over $4,800 and another from Optus of some $900. The overwhelming number of calls registered with Telstra were to a 1902 number and with Optus they were to a 1900 number.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Mrs Azab has a 15-year-old son who has attention deficit hyperactive disorder. A very quick perusal of the accounts she has received shows that on a whole range of days—for example, picking 29 November at random, when some 18 calls were made—calls were made for quite lengthy periods of time to a number that describes itself as a telephone counselling service, a 1902 number. These were matters that were raised with Austel. Austel gave a most disappointing response to Mrs Azab where they said that it was not a matter they would take up.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          She has raised the matter with an organisation called the Telephone Information Services Standards Council. She was told by a Telephone Information Services arbitrator on 28 January that she would get a response within two weeks. That has not been forthcoming. Frankly, I believe a situation exists here where vulnerable, isolated people are very much subjected to the possibility of quite considerable exploitation by these sorts of call services, which charge extraordinarily expensive rates for so-called counselling.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I had a staff member in my office today make a call to the 1902 number. I will just give the House a very brief sample of the so-called counselling that goes on:

          The situation is that this family simply cannot afford a Telstra bill of the extraordinary order that they have received. It would seem to me that companies, which are seeking to exploit people of this isolated, vulnerable character or boys of this type—a boy where I have plenty of medical evidence of the genuineness of his complaint and his situation—by engaging in these services, ought to carry the risk. They ought to be the people who lose out in situations such as the one I have described.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is simply unfair for isolated, vulnerable people to be expected to pay those amazing amounts. It is equally disappointing that Austel has simply failed—when approached—to deal with the matter. The arbitrator in the industry has failed us to date. This is a matter that causes the family great consternation. They face the prospect of disconnection of an important telephone service. It is a matter which I believe the minister for communications ought to look at very quickly.

          —I rise tonight to inform the House about the progress, or lack thereof, of roadworks and traffic lights at Chelmsford Drive and the New England Highway at Metford. This is a road which has in excess of 25,000 vehicles per day; a road that children cross to go to school; a road that a large section of the community cross to shop at Green Hills; and a road that is a major highway which is impossible to cross—after all, it is a national highway.

        <para first-indent="16">
         On 5 August 1994, three concerned residents of the Metford-Ashtonfield area in my electorate started a saga which is yet to be resolved—not through any fault of the current federal government but through the mindless political games of the current New South Wales state Labor government and the campaigning untruths of the former government. These three tireless campaigners from the Metford Residents Action Group—Veronica McLennan, Kaleen Fletcher and Joan White—started by contacting the RTA and the state member for Maitland, Peter Blackmore, along with Maitland council. To show how concerned the residents were, over 1,100 signatures were gathered on petitions and presented to the New South Wales state government. But Blackmore was told to butt out by the former federal member. After all, it was a federal highway.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The progress evolved into the Maitland integrated transport study, which, beginning in late 1994, involved three detailed workshops that specifically asked for, and received, extensive community input. The final RTA report has not been released to date, despite the public input and despite the apparent desire to be seen to treat seriously the views of local residents impacted on by any decision. Maybe the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority is scared of the contents.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         And then that famous transport minister, Laurie Brereton, who in the dying days of the former government with the monopoly money in one pocket and a new road proposal in the other turned up in the seat of Paterson on 8 August 1995 and again two weeks later—
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          bearing gifts like Santa—promising $2 million for the lights and associated roadworks. At this point in time only 14 months had transpired, and the amazing thing was there was an election in the air. To cement the promise, the former Labor member letterboxed Metford and Ashtonfield with a glossy brochure promising that $2 million—it was allocated, work starting immediately, don't pass go, collect the $200. Members on this side of the House would be used to hearing these untruths from members and former ministers of the other side.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Then there was the obligatory public meeting by the RTA on 12 February 1996, which evolved into the three meetings of the Metford value management study—the first in March 1996 and continuing until July. By this time over two years had passed by with no solution.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The money was not there when we came to government. There was no mention of it in the previous minister's notes or files—it was just lies, yet again and again. We got used to it, but the community almost believed them. But we, the Howard government, fixed that. We promised we would have the money—$1.96 million—and, hey presto, change of administration in Canberra and suddenly the state Labor government is playing games.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The works are being held up by—guess who—the RTA and the NSW state government. Now, when these residents call the RTA to find out what is happening they are told: `Contact Bob Baldwin—he's sitting on the plans.' Well, Bob Baldwin is no draftsman and, further, he is tired of being used as the whipping boy for the political games of the RTA and the state Labor government.

         These people have been lied to by the RTA and by none other than Bob Sharpe, Regional Manager of the RTA, and some of his colleagues. They have been playing games—games with people's lives. I and my office have followed this through diligently all the way and we have been continually reassured by Bob Sharpe of the RTA during private meetings in my office between him, Peter Blackmore and me that it was all happening, that it was waiting for federal approval. This was all garbage. It took forever to get it to the
         <break page="971" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          desk of the federal minister, John Sharp. The state government was sitting on the plans while the people of Paterson waited. The then minister for roads, Michael Knight, and now Carl Scully are sitting on these plans. The money is in place; they know it. They just want to play games and delay the project, hoping that it will reflect badly on that outstanding Liberal state member Peter Blackmore and me.

         Interestingly, the Weakleys Drive and Thornton Road lights were promised during the election by Labor. But, again, the previous government did not provide the funding. We have put them in—no surprise given the time and urgency. But they must have been fast&amp;hyphen;tracked: they just happen to be in the surrounding Labor seat of Hunter. And to show it was political, they imported a Labor state member, John Price, to open the lights—lights funded with federal money. It is just games, games and more games. Labor does not care, and has not ever cared, for the people in the Hunter. They just use them up as election fodder.

         I put the state roads minister on notice that if there is an accident in the area—and indeed it has been pouring bucket loads up there today and yesterday—it will now be Carl Scully who has the blood on his hands.

You know the type: unctuous elites, out of touch with everyday cares, who luxuriate in their own high morality. They are great favourites of the fashionable media types—and don't they know it. In their glib, superficial sanctity they perfectly complement those pious secular clerics of the politically correct establishment.

          The uproar over Pauline Hanson has given such clerics a golden opportunity to parade their sanctity while lambasting the unworthy general population. There has been no attempt to understand, only to wallow in their own vanity and to pander to elite opinion.

          We had one recently who vainly preened herself before the assembled media at an Anglican church summit, attended by both the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). For the benefit of the politicians and referring to the gospel, she said:

          —I rise to speak tonight about the life of an ex&amp;hyphen;POW, Mr Keith Botterill, who was born in Nyngan on 1 August 1924 and who passed away in Sydney, at the age of 72, on 25 January this year.
          <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
           What was remarkable about this person was that he was one of only six survivors of World War II's infamous Sandakan death marches. Only six out of 1,800 Australians survived those marches; none of the 750 British solders did. Five of those six survivors are now dead. Only Owen Campbell, an 80&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old, survives. He lives near Brisbane.

          It was thought that Keith Botterill was unlikely to survive. He weighed only 38 kilograms—six stone—and over one stone of that was attributed to swelling from beri-beri. He had been hobbling along with the support of a stick, using the other hand to hold up his testicles, which were swollen from beri-beri. This disease is due to a vitamin B1 or thiamine deficiency from starvation or eating refined rice. It causes muscle weakness, heart failure and oedema in various parts of the body.

          Mr Botterill was raised largely by his grandmother, who had 13 of her own children to raise. He started work at the age of 14 as a screen printer. He put up his age to enlist, at 16&amp;half; years, in the army. He served with the 2/19th Battalion in Singapore where, as a 17&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old, he was wounded in his stomach by a Japanese bullet. He became a prisoner of war in February 1942 in Changi and was shipped to Sandakan to help build an airfield and service roads.

          At the end of 1944 allied forces were getting within striking distance and the Japanese authorities decided to move the soldiers out in this infamous march, which became the most ruthless, horrific, demeaning act of incomprehensible cruelty of the war. If you fell, you were bayoneted or shot. Had the supreme commander, Douglas MacArthur, released a few DC3s for a few days in March 1944, as he was requested, a rescue operation could have gone ahead with a high chance of success. Perhaps a thousand or so soldiers could have been rescued. In mid&amp;hyphen;1944 to August 1944 that march took place. Men dropped from malnutrition, disease, exhaus

          The treatment of Keith Botterill as a prisoner of war was bad. They used to place him in a cage above the ground. He was bashed every day. He was in this cage once for 12 days, and on another occasion for 40 days with 17 other prisoners. On one occasion, they received no water for the first three days, then they were made to drink until they were sick. They received no food for seven days and then were put on half rations, despite their emaciation and infection with lice and scabies.

          After the war he put this behind him. He knuckled down to hard physical work. He worked on the Snowy Mountains scheme and the construction of Warragamba Dam. He met his wife, Ruth, at Katoomba. She used to deliver milk for the tea for the workers there. He is survived by three daughters—Susan, Judy and Wendy—a son, Keith, and 13 grandchildren.

His story of extraordinary feats of survival should be recognised in this parliament, and I am pleased to acknowledge them here this evening.

          —Tonight I want to take the opportunity to address an issue that I think is of enormous social importance to our community today; that is, the question of legal aid funding. I preface my comments with a couple of notes. First of all, we have seen in the last federal budget additional court charges being made—at a very heavy level, I might add—particularly in relation to matters affecting family law. I mention that in passing at the beginning of this adjournment speech, because that sets the scene for another step that occurred.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Additional to that were cuts in funding to a range of community services which assist in
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          family breakdown and family matters generally within our community. Couple those two things with a third issue, which I think is the most alarming; that is, the playing that is going on in funding for legal aid.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The reality is that most legal aid matters where family law is concerned are the ones that affect families. This government purports very strongly—throughout the election campaign and since—that they have a patent on caring for families, that families are the backbone of our nation, that they care for families, and that they believe in the sanctity of the family. Yet it seems to me that everything they are doing in this area of social policy is attacking that very group.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is absolutely no doubt that in the ACT there is a great deal of effort going on at the local government level—I commend all players in that area—to desperately try to save the situation in relation to funding for legal aid. The situation in the ACT is unique because it appears that the Commonwealth has admitted that the Commonwealth matters accounted for a particular amount of money last financial year, which in fact was $3.006 million, and the subsidy that we received back in the ACT from the Commonwealth was something like $646,000 short. Despite that admitted error, it seems that both the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) have made a concerted decision that they will ignore that and that they will get on and debate and negotiate in terms of funding for future years. That is really starting on the back foot before you get any further.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The options that are facing the ACT, as I believe are the options facing all states and territories, are simple. Either you continue to run at a loss, running a legal aid service as best you can on the limited funds that are appearing to be made available or, alternatively, you set up your own state or territory service and allow the Commonwealth to consider setting up theirs separately. That seems the most retrograde step you could ever consider.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For a start, what could be more un&amp;hyphen;cost effective than running two separate services? Additionally, how can you ensure that the
         <break page="974" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          clients of those two services will get proper, fair and adequate service when in a majority of family law cases—I would say in most—there is a very definite crossing over between both state or territory and Commonwealth jurisdictions. In other words, to try to administer that system of legal aid on a split basis means that, in many cases, clients are going to have to either figuratively or in realistic terms go from one office to another and back again. Whether that occurs on paper or physically, it is going to happen.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It seems to me that, if this government are fair dinkum, if they are saying to us that they have deficits that they have to attend to, that they regrettably have to make these sorts of cuts, then why on earth are they going to help to create a system that is most cost ineffective and most inconvenient to the people they say they care for more than anybody else? It seems a most ludicrous situation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         On behalf of the constituency that I represent, I say that this situation is absolutely and totally unacceptable. The families in my constituency who happen to fall into the unfortunate category of requiring legal aid deserve nothing more nor less than a proper and fair approach to justice. That must be adequately funded and appropriately administered.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         At the moment, I do not see any signs that we are getting any sensible debate out of the government. For the Prime Minister to say the other day, I think in the media and in this place, that there is no further consideration being given to the issue saddens me unbelievably because this is a very important social and family issue in our community and one that I believe must receive better attention than it is at the moment. I urge all members, particularly those on the other side—and more particularly the women members on the other side—to lobby hard and long to have this decision reversed. It is inappropriate, it is unjust and it is inequitable to everybody who participates in the legal aid process.

         I empathise greatly with the position Louise is in. I know she has been a very effective small business operator.

         Her landlord at Garden City is AMP. They have demanded she make a number of very expensive renovations as part of the terms and conditions of her lease agreement over the 16 years she has been there. She has, amongst other things, had to mortgage her home to meet the cost of these expensive renovations to her shop front. The centre has just undergone a massive restructuring and reworking and major operators who trade in the centre are able to meet the costs of renovations far easier than small—mother and father or husband and wife type teams—business operations.

         I am very concerned for people in my electorate like Louise. I think tremendous pressures have been placed on them as a result of the previous government's legacy. That is bad enough. The fact is the banks, which I think have continued to snub the real opportunities given to them through deregulation for so many years and which have basically continued to do whatever they darn well like, need to get a very large slap across the wrist.

         Today I wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) suggesting that if banks do not want to do the right thing and cooperate, then perhaps we should seriously consider some sort of re&amp;hyphen;regulation of the banking sector.

         I am very concerned because effective operators like Louise are feeling a strong lag effect in the reality of the day to day operations of their business. They understand this government is well intentioned. They know the Prime Minister is very strong in his commitment to the small business sector, but the effect they are feeling on a day to day basis just does not seem to back up the optimism they had. As their local member, I think it is my role to raise this point tonight and to call on the Prime Minister to re&amp;hyphen;double his efforts and to again confirm his strong commitment to the small business sector, offer them some concrete proof of the support I know this government has already given them and show a small business led recovery can only occur if small business survives and grows.

         I want to assure people like Louise Esdale that we are not going down the Labor Party road. We are very aware of the mess Labor left them and the tough times they face. We are aware of the mess the Brisbane City Council has created by the proliferation of shopping centres. Landlords like AMP really do not care all that much about small business traders—one dies and another one is always there ready to mortgage their home to take their place. I think all members in this place would share my concern because small business can and will generate real jobs and bring about the recovery we all want and need in this country.

The issue is that of the Garrawarra Centre for Aged Care which is located in an area of bushland between the townships of Helensburgh and Waterfall and which caters for the frail aged people with challenging behaviours and dementia.

         This situation has a long history going back to state and Commonwealth discussions and decisions of the previous government in 1992.
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          At that stage, Garrawarra had 280 beds and we had always assumed that this would be the basis for further decision making. Subsequently, this base has been eroded to  250. In addition, the initial discussions related to a reduction of one-third of the beds, but this now has achieved the proportions of almost halving or more of the resident population.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For Garrawarra, at the moment, this means a proposed downsizing to 120 beds. This is associated with a destruction of an infrastructure of teaching, education and excellence in care. The proposal will eliminate what has long been a tradition at Garrawarra—that is, the offering of a continuum of care after the resident has come to reside there. It will also mean destruction of community day care programs which facilitate community residence.

        <para first-indent="16">
         For Sutherland shire, this will represent a very significant loss of nursing home beds and a drop in the ratio per thousand persons over 70 to well below the accepted Commonwealth guidelines when adjusted to the current resident population. This will precipitate a crisis situation within the next five years.

         It would appear that 100 beds are going to go to the Illawarra region. This would seem to be not negotiable, but perhaps 20 of those beds could remain in the Garrawarra Centre as they will service Illawarra in regard to people with challenging behaviour and dementia as their infrastructure at this moment is not geared to cope with these patients.

         There is no doubt that a rebuilding of the site is desperately needed after decades of neglect. This has been presented as an all in one phenomena. Certainly, the New South Wales state government seems to be indicating that they have capital to rebuild 120 beds. This is going to take at least two years. There is surely an intermediate position which could allow for the retention of some of the current building stock or perhaps there are funds within the Commonwealth sphere which could allow the extra rebuilding and creation of a centre of excellence. I would contend that 180 beds is probably optimal both from the viewpoint of allowing beds to go to the south and to the maintenance of the Sutherland shire infrastructure. It is a vital question to know whether this figure could be negotiated.

          Associated with this decision is the commitment from the Commonwealth to fund these added beds under the Camsam arrangements and to address the question of these patients at Garrawarra who have severe challenging behaviours and who cannot be appropriately cared for under the current Camsam funding arrangements. The private sector is not happy or able to take these patients and it is vital to offer high standards of care to these very debilitated people who have the consequences of brain failure.

          —Continuing my remarks, members may be aware that my electorate of Cowan covers some of the northern suburbs of Perth. In these regions there is a substantial level of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, which all too often results in bored or poor individuals turning to drugs and drug related crime.

         I am proud to say that this government is attempting to solve many of the nation's challenges left to us by 13 years of avarice from the Labor Party. However, it is a sad fact that the issue of crime remains one of the hardest problems to control. This is due to the fact that criminals do not tend to take much notice of legislation and law.

         An examination of research papers shows how divided opinions are on what are the best solutions for dealing with the increase in crime rates. This brings me to the issue of the Crimes and Other Legislation Amendment Bill which we are addressing today. The Commonwealth must seek to recover some of the costs incurred in the transportation and storage before disposal of illegal drugs. It is a sad day, though, when money must be spent on these types of operations and when the Commonwealth must put in place legislation to recover some of these costs, but we must. To not act would be to reward those who test the law by dealing in drugs.

         It is this parliament's responsibility to ensure we maximise the taxpayers' expenditure by not carelessly spending funds when other sources of income may be available. This amendment will ensure that the nation can recover our costs. Not all costs can be recovered, such as salary of staff and other day&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;day expenses. However, the collection and disposal of narcotics is a very necessary operation.

         It disappoints me that so much time and energy is spent on cleaning up the deeds of the dirty few—the people who involve themselves in the drug dealing lifestyle. Almost every day in my electorate I see and hear evidence of people who have come unstuck due to the influence of drugs.

         I will quote some figures which come from the report of a task force on drug abuse. The report states that, in particular, of juvenile detainees held in detention in Western Australia, 89 per cent had been drug users and 47 per cent had been using every day prior to a 1992 survey. Twenty&amp;hyphen;seven per cent had been using cannabis daily in 1992 and 58 per cent in 1995—indicating an increase in cannabis usage. Eleven per cent had been using amphetamines in 1992 and 17 per cent in 1995—indicating an increase in amphetamine usage.

        <para first-indent="16">
         There are many reasons for this dilemma. However, there is a strong argument that the issue of drug usage should really be seen as a health issue rather than a criminal issue. There is an
         <break page="978" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          argument for a total rethink of the way we deal with the issue of drug usage. Seeking reasons for drug abuse seems to be a perennial problem and, whilst some dangerous and destructive addictive drugs are legal in our community, such as alcohol and tobacco, using them is not. Perhaps a debate on the decriminalisation of certain drug usage could be brought on in a very serious manner if it were relevant.

         Drug abuse is an issue which affects many of our young people. Perhaps the emphasis on criminal activity, rather than treating usage as a health issue, is not the preferred way to address the problem. Many teenagers who have become involved in the drug lifestyle seem to be introduced to drug usage through the most recent worrying trend of the rave party culture. The accompanying music and associated body stimulating beats per minute, the fashion trends and the excitement of rave parties appeal to many young people.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other attraction is the presence at these parties of ecstasy. The drug enhances the music beat, thus further stimulating the drug user. Perhaps not all raves tolerate the use of these drugs, but many do due to the rise of this relatively new culture. There must have been a resultant increase in the trafficking of drugs such as ecstasy.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Some seven per cent of the population is using the drug ecstasy. Who could ever forget the tragic tale of the Sydney girl, Anna Wood, who became a victim of this drug and the rave scene? Unfortunately, other people have been lured by the so&amp;hyphen;called easy money aspect of drug dealing, whether it be for the extra funds or simply as a way of life. For example, at the beginning of this year, a constituent contacted my office seeking options for the assistance of a young man who had recently come out of gaol after serving a 12&amp;hyphen;month sentence for drug dealing.

          He fell into the dealing scene by way of boredom and possibly a lack of direction, dealing to pay for his living. There was no thought of retribution, as it appeared to him that little time was done for this crime and it was hard to get caught. But he was caught. He is now out of gaol and he is preparing to make a go of his life in an honest way. He was lucky, in a sense, that he learnt his lesson. If there had been a proper deterrent, perhaps he would not have even committed the crime.

          But what of all those other drug dealers who choose to continue with their illegal vocation? These are the ones who deserve to pay the harshest penalty this country can offer. Drug addicted people are not the only ones who are prey to drug dealers and traffickers. The other victims are in fact everyday people; they are victims of crime who suffer as a result of drug addicts needing money to pay for their habits, and they are family members who may have to witness the breakdown of trust that being a drug addict entails.

          Luckily, within Cowan—and, I am sure, in many other electorates—we have a variety of agencies which seek to address these problems and other associated issues that lead to crime. Agencies which handle problems such as unemployment, drug abuse, broken homes and homelessness, particularly when it comes to our youth, attempt to pinpoint the cause of all the trouble and set young people back on the path to recovery and law&amp;hyphen;abiding behaviour.

          However, when I look at other countries with relatively low crime rates, I wonder what it is exactly that they do that makes crime control so effective. Is it because they are so strict, and the punishment is so severe that it serves as a suitable deterrent? I have been to Malaysia—which, as everyone knows, is notorious for the severity of its sentencing laws. As I was riding through the city of Kuala Lumpur in a taxi to the airport, I saw a sign on a wall of the gaol. The gaol was not really an attractive place to look at. The sign said, `You take drugs, you suffer.' The message was pretty simple to me: if you took drugs, you were going to suffer. By the look of the gaol, they were suffering.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Drug dealers must in fact pay the penalty, and this brings me to my next point. The time has come to crack down on drug trafficking in Australia, and I am calling for stricter sentencing laws to deal with drug trafficking crimes. The presence of drugs in our society is something which is a sad reality and one that it is doubtful will ever go away. The fact that all drugs, bar alcohol and nicotine, are more or less illegal and yet abuses still occur means that, rather than try and while away the drug issue, we must address it as it is and approach it with the realistic outlook that abuse of illegal drugs will, most likely, always be with us.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          That is why I am suggesting a different approach to drug usage management and recommending that the community begin to look at drug use as a public health issue, thus raising the issue into a more acceptable climate of debate rather than keeping to the crime aspect of it. However, we should never accept dealing and trafficking of drugs as desirable. Drug dealing is basically profiteering in the weakness and desperate needs of others, and this surely grinds against any community's entire value system. I would suggest that the time has come for legislation to go much further and crack down on these specimens who survive by preying on the weaknesses and addiction of others. By this I mean tougher sentences. Today, I am calling for mandatory minimum sentencing of 25 years for drug dealing or drug trafficking, no matter how large or small the deal.

          Under the Customs Act of 1901, nine drugs are listed as narcotic—this includes cannabis—and a commercial quantity is measured in kilograms and a trafficable quantity in grams. The maximum penalty for the importation of a commercial quantity of any of the nine narcotics is imprisonment for life. The maximum penalty for a trafficable quantity is a fine not exceeding $100,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 25 years, or both. In the case of importing
          <break page="980" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           a trafficable amount of cannabis, the maximum is a fine not exceeding $4,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 10 years, or both.

         <para first-indent="16">
          This is nowhere near enough. Only recently in Western Australia, we had two gentlemen fined about $120,000 each for trafficking in abalone. On this occasion, it would seem the law protects our wildlife more greatly than it does our young people. In Western Australia, according to schedule 4 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1981, the maximum penalty for the possession of a prohibited drug with intent to sell or supply is a fine not exceeding $100,000 or imprisonment for a term of 25 years without the option of a fine. However, the maximum penalty for conspiring to sell or supply a quantity of prohibited drug is a term of imprisonment not exceeding 20 years, with an option of a fine.

         <para first-indent="16">
          It is time to stop pussy&amp;hyphen;footing about drug dealers. The community wants some toughness in sentencing—that is the message I am getting from my electorate. The police believe that tough sentencing laws for dealing and trafficking will act as a deterrent, and they cite Singapore's sentencing as an example. Extending gaol terms for drug dealers to a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years seems to be a suitable sentence to me.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Drugs are the one thing that survives by shamelessly preying on the weak. Sure, there are many outwardly so&amp;hyphen;called normal people who may make an informed choice to use drugs. However, if someone deals in drugs, by making a profit from the sale of drugs they should be made to suffer. This amendment hurts them financially, but they must also have a substantial gaol penalty. I am calling for a minimum of 25 years.

          Illegal drug organisations rely on the little men to do their dirty work—and those people must take the fall, if necessary. Those people in turn rely on manipulating people with drug habits or manipulating people to take on drug habits, including people who may be vulnerable to such pressures, and for them I would recommend the harshest penalty possible. That they  choose to subvert other people's lives is their choice and they must live with whatever onsequences that choice may bring. If this includes a very long prison term, so be it.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Countries such as Malaysia and Thailand have already made it clear that they will not tolerate drug trafficking. Whilst I do not agree with the death penalty for drug trafficking, a mandatory extended prison term would act as a deterrent. This may be considered a hysterical response to the issue of drug dealing. But, let's face it, drug dealers are dealing in death for the sake of a few dollars. How much value does one place on life? Is it just a couple of hundred dollars?
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There have been a lot of deaths recently in Adelaide from ecstasy, and in Perth and Sydney as a result of heroin dealing. Drug dealers are not there for the health and welfare of their customers. They are not there to make sure people have a good time. They are there to make a lot of money as quickly as possible. If an emphasis were placed on the mandatory sentencing of 25 years for drug dealers, can you imagine the impact this would have on the illegal drug industry? All the foot soldiers would be wiped out, severely crippling their impact.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There appear to be two schools of thought when it comes to dealing with crime. One is the threat of locking them up for as long as possible as some sort of deterrent to others. The other shuns that idea and seeks to rehabilitate them and address the cause of the problem. We should not punish the victims of crime and, surely, a drug user is a victim of crime. We should, however, drop the full force of the community on those who would profit at the expense of the health of others. Mandatory sentencing for dealing and trafficking will work. So, too, will this amendment and I commend it to the Committee.

          —The Crimes and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 makes amendments to a number of acts. While I am in no way an expert in this area, I have taken a keen interest in our country's law enforcement agencies as I am a member of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. Crime, and community concern about it, is currently the No. 1 concern of people in the electorate of Bowman. In recent surveys carried out in the electorate, crime, law and order, and the level of crime were cited as the first concern of those surveyed. It is in this context that I am pleased to contribute to the debate.

        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One does not have to be an expert to appreciate what the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams) is proposing with these amendments. I feel the most significant of these changes is that which will affect the superannuation benefits of a convicted felon. Currently, due to a legal loophole in the system, sentences can be manipulated so that someone convicted of multiple offences may not lose their Commonwealth or employer funded superannuation benefits. This occurs when a person convicted on two counts of fraud and sentenced to 12 months imprisonment for each count has three months of the second count made cumulative with the sentence of the first count.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To me, that makes little sense, so let me put it another way. A thief rips off the government twice, gets sentenced to 12 months on both counts, serves 15 months in total and gets to keep his employer funded superannuation. I cannot, for the life of me, see how this is fair to all honest and hard&amp;hyphen;working employees across Australia. The change proposed by this bill will put an end to this nonsense.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The changes propose that a superannuation order may be made if the single sentence in respect of multiple corruption offences, or the aggregate of sentences in respect of multiple corruption offences, exceeds 12 months. In other words, if you are convicted for two counts of fraud and get eight to six months cumulative sentences for the two, totalling 14 months, you have just lost your employer funded superannuation benefits. The only exception to this  is where a person who is convicted of a corruption offence receives a sentence under subsection 20AB of the Crimes Act which could see that person serving only periodic detention.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another important section of this bill deals with the recovery of costs incurred by the Commonwealth in relation to the storage and maintenance of confiscated goods. These goods usually come in the form of vehicles and marine vessels used by drug traffickers. This amendment will allow the Commonwealth to recover, as the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams) put it:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Out of pocket expenses it incurs in relation to the transportation and storage of narcotic&amp;hyphen;related goods that are condemned and placed in commercial storage facilities, prior to the goods being transferred to the Official Trustee for disposal.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         Currently, the Trustee is able to recover costs for such activities. This amendment will allow the Commonwealth to do likewise.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, the amendment will not allow the Commonwealth to recover other costs incurred, such as salary of staff, or everyday running costs such as telephones. Nor will the Commonwealth be able to recover expenses that are an ordinary incident of its operation. When you consider the number of boats, planes, cars and trucks used by these drug traffickers, the cost to the Commonwealth of storing them would be immense. I think that it is fair and reasonable for the Commonwealth to receive reimbursement for these costs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The third section of this bill I wish to speak on is the amendment to the Crimes Act 1914 which will increase the value of a penalty unit. In his second reading speech, the Attorney&amp;hyphen;
         <break page="982" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          General explained that in 1992 it was decided that all pecuniary penalty provisions in Commonwealth legislation were to be expressed in penalty units to enable penalties to be adjusted from time to time. Penalty units are used to determine the maximum length of sentence, or amount of a fine, and currently the penalty unit is $100. So, if you were fined 100 penalty units, your fine would be $10,000. The reason for using the penalty unit system is to make it easier to vary the value of a fine to reflect the current money value. As is the case with most things, inflation devalues everything, including penalty units.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Attorney&amp;hyphen;General pointed out that, according to figures provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the change to the consumer price index numbers between June 1992 and September 1995 is calculated at approximately 9.6 per cent. This means that the value of the penalty unit has dropped.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One can only assume that if all other costs are increasing, so must the profits be from crime related activities. Therefore, it is not unreasonable that the penalty for crimes should also increase accordingly. Under the amendment proposed by this bill, the penalty unit will be increased from $100 to $110. On its own, that is not a huge jump, but the fellow earlier who was fined 100 penalty units has thus had his fine increased by $1,000. I would have to reflect that this is, in reality, a drop in the ocean. What we should have is a greater punitive and prohibitive fine, double or treble the penalty units: make the user pay, and pay dearly.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In fact, the amendments, as quoted by the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, will have a minor and unquantifiable financial impact on government revenue. I would have to say: why not make it a viable revenue raiser? Obviously, inflationary pressures also impact on the running of the courts and law enforcement agencies. Without these measures, the cost of catching the criminals will be extremely inhibitive and will affect the overall outcomes.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So far I have spoken on matters that focus on severer penalties for criminals. However, with any legal system there will always be a minority of innocent citizens who get caught by  mistake. This bill will also amend the Extradition Act 1988 to correct deficiencies and thus lessen the likelihood of innocent citizens being held incorrectly.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The first of these amendments deals with the application of bail. Under the current system, if a magistrate remands a person in custody following the application of bail that person is not entitled to make further application for release on bail during the remand period. The original intent of this was to stop people from magistrate shopping, where someone who is refused bail by one magistrate simply asks for their case to be heard by a second and, hopefully, more lenient magistrate. The honourable member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) alluded to cases where he has had personal experience of this matter.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Unfortunately, the legislation does not allow for someone to make a further bail application, even if the person's circumstances change such that bail would be justified but the original magistrate is no longer available. This could happen if the magistrate resigned or retired. This amendment proposes that, if a person initially fails in his or her bail application on merit, he or she is not able to make a further application unless there is evidence of a change in circumstances that might justify bail being granted.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second change to the Extradition Act 1988 relates to the procedures following the arrest of a person who has escaped from lawful custody. The intent here is quite obvious: the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General is looking to make sure that the right person is arrested. Under the present legislation, a police officer may arrest a person without a warrant if the said officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person has escaped from custody. That officer may arrest the person and throw them back into gaol.
        </para>
        <break page="983" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          I do not want to cast aspersions on our police officers, the majority of whom do a tremendous job under very trying conditions. However, it is not inconceivable that a mistake could be made. Imagine you are walking down the street one day and suddenly a police car, sirens blaring, mounts the gutter in front of you. Two huge police officers jump out of the vehicle, guns drawn and, without getting a really good look at you, scream at you to lie face down on the footpath with your hands behind your back. Of course, you would comply with their demands for fear of being shot.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The police officers then handcuff you, throw you into the back of the vehicle and drag you down to the watch&amp;hyphen;house where you are held. This may sound a bit far&amp;hyphen;fetched but it could happen. If you bear a resemblance to a convicted felon who has escaped from custody, the police could possibly mistake you for that felon and put you in custody. This amendment requires that such a person be taken before a magistrate for testing of the arresting officer's belief that the person has escaped from custody. Until the magistrate is satisfied that the person has escaped from custody, no warrant can be issued.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Another section of this bill that protects the innocent is the amendment to the Proceeds of Crime Act. This amendment relates to creating a defence of reasonable corporate precaution. The Proceeds of Crime Act currently states that a body corporate is vicariously liable for the criminal conduct of its directors, servants or agents. This means that if a director or employee of a company, such as MIM, is convicted of a criminal act, the company can be held liable.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There is other Commonwealth legislation which, while establishing similar liability, provides a defence or reasonable corporate precaution. So if a company, such as MIM, can prove that it has taken reasonable precautions and, as the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General put it, `exercised due diligence to avoid the conduct of its directors, servants and agents,' the body corporate may not be held liable. This amendment proposes to extend this to the Proceeds of Crime Act.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The other change to the Proceeds of Crime Act relates to applications for variation of restraining orders and extensions of time. The act allows for the court to restrain the property  of defendants charged with serious offences. Property that remains restrained for six months after conviction is automatically forfeited to the Commonwealth. An application to have the order released or varied may be lodged but it must be listed, heard and decided within six months of the original conviction. Considerable pressure is placed on the court lists because people generally wait until the end of their trial before applying for a variation in orders. The amendments in this bill are designed to alleviate this pressure by allowing for an extension of time for the making of an application.

          Another procedural change is that which will remove the necessity for ministerial consent before a prosecution can be instituted against a person suspected of a Commonwealth offence. In his second reading speech, the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General explained that the provisions were originally enacted for the purpose of deterring private prosecution brought in inappropriate circumstances, particularly for offences which related to national security or international treaty obligations.

          I now come to the final amendment proposed by this bill. This amendment will make changes to the Witness Protection Act 1994. Before delving into the proposed changes I would like to take a minute to extol the virtues of this program. The witness protection program is vital to the continued success of our law enforcement agencies. Without this program, many
          <break page="984" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

          It takes a great deal of courage to testify in court, particularly in matters relating to Commonwealth criminal law. I can barely imagine what it would be like to have to testify against some of these criminals in the full knowledge that their cronies are still at large and may come looking for retribution. And after testifying, witnesses find that their lives are never the same. They may have to be relocated. Their children are ripped out of a school they may have been in for years. They may have to leave behind family and friends, and start a new career. The sacrifices these people make are immense and as such I feel it is our duty to protect them in any way we can.

          The amendments proposed in this bill will make it no longer an offence for a participant in such a program, or someone who was previously a participant, to make disclosures when making a complaint to the Ombudsman, under either the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981 or the Ombudsman Act 1976. Under the current legislation such a disclosure may not be made to the Ombudsman unless prior consent has been given by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police.

          I may be corrected if I am wrong, but I believe that if you have a complaint which relates to the Federal Police you are hardly likely to want to go to them to complain. While I agree that the strictest confidentiality must be maintained with regard to the witness protection program, I would have to say that for a person to feel totally at ease they must have the right to go to the Ombudsman directly with complaints. Surely the integrity of the Ombudsman is not in question here.

          As I said at the outset, I am not a lawyer nor do I pretend to have extensive knowledge of the laws of this land. However, I do feel strongly about the way our law enforcement agencies are operated. As a mother of three, a former school teacher of young children and a concerned citizen, I have a vested interest in ensuring the laws of the land are upheld. For this to be done, those who enforce the law have to have every assistance in doing so. I believe that this and other legislation being introduced by this government provides just such assistance. For that reason I commend this bill to the House.

          —in reply—I propose to wind up the debate on the Crimes and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 and I would like to thank all of those members who have taken part in the debate. Those who have participated this morning, the members for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) and Bowman (Mrs West), both reflected concern in the community relating to law and order and security issues. In their own way they reflected also the concern that the legal system protect the innocent as well as punish the guilty.

         This bill makes minor and technical amendments to a number of acts dealing with Commonwealth criminal and law enforcement matters. It is not, in that sense, a major policy bill. The support of the opposition for the bill is most welcome. The member for Banks (Mr Melham), who spoke for the opposition, gave conditional support to the amendment to the Crimes Act which increases the value of the penalty unit from $100 to $110 in accordance with the consumer price index. The concern he expressed was also reflected by the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith).

         Monetary penalties in terms of penalty units were first introduced in 1992. That approach allows a range of monetary penalties to be monitored and amended simultaneously by a single amendment to the value of the penalty unit in the Crimes Act. Where a particular offence is

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The value of the penalty unit has remained unchanged since 1992. Given that the CPI increased by 9.6 per cent between June 1992 and September 1995, it is considered appropriate that the value of the penalty unit be increased. The amendment to the value ensures that the level of monetary penalties for Commonwealth offences is uniform and consistent.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The member for Bowman mentioned the possibility of double or treble penalty units. The question of whether to increase the value of a penalty unit by doubling or trebling it raises complex policy and practical issues which really could not appropriately be dealt with in a portfolio bill such as this. This bill is intended only to effect minor policy and technical amendments.

         The government welcomes the support of the opposition for the amendment which corrects a deficiency in subsection 15(3) of the Extradition Act 1988. It is important that, where a person whose extradition is sought has unsuccessfully applied for bail, the person be able to apply again for bail if there is evidence of a change in circumstances which might justify bail being granted.

         The member for Banks and the member for Dickson also mentioned the retrospective application of the amendments to the International War Crimes Tribunals Act. The paragraphs in question are technical amendments to correct a typographical error in the 1995 amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987. In each case, section 46 of the International War Crimes Tribunals Act 1995 was referred to, whereas the correct reference should have been to section 45.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Legal advice was obtained following discovery of the errors to the effect that it is likely that a court would regard the incorrect reference as a patent mistake and interpret the amendment as referring to section 45 and not section 46.

         Section 45 enables the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply for registration in a specified court of a forfeiture order made in relation to property believed to be in Australia when so requested by the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991, or by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda.

         The amendment to the Customs Act in the bill makes provision for the Australian Federal Police to recover the costs it incurs in relation to the transportation, storage, custody and control of vessels used in drug trafficking. This was referred to by the member for Bowman. In the course of the debate, the member for Dickson asked whether cost recovery would extend to the travel costs of the AFP where those costs relate to the transportation and the taking control of vessels used in drug trafficking. The amendment is framed broadly so that any costs, charges and expenses incurred by the AFP in that context are recoverable.

          prevent the conduct of the body corporate's directors, servants or agents from being attributed to it, if it can establish that it took reasonable precautions and exercised due diligence to avoid the conduct.

         Schedule 2 to the bill removes the requirement to obtain ministerial consent to institute proceedings for the prosecution of offences under the acts denoted in the schedule.

Private prosecutions may be instituted, which might previously have been blocked by the consent provisions.

         However, as pointed out by the member for Bowman, the DPP has the power, under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act, to take over a prosecution on indictment for offences against laws of the Commonwealth where the prosecution has been instituted by someone other than the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General. The DPP could therefore take over the prosecution and effectively terminate it. That power provides a safeguard against the continuation of prosecutions which do not comply with the prosecution policy of the Commonwealth.

          —The opposition supports the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill in that it introduces a number of technical and drafting corrections. Firstly, it incorporates name changes to about 350 tariff classifications, which were recommended by the world customs organisations, but the current levels of tariff assistance are to be maintained. It also makes minor amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to correct drafting, formatting and spelling anomalies in the act when it replaced the Customs Tariff Act 1987.

          —I rise also to support the amendments to the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996. This bill amends the 1995 act to enact measures introduced earlier into the House of Representatives as customs tariff proposals. These amendments are drafted twice yearly to maintain some 350 tariff classifications recommended by the World Customs Organisation, to which Australia is a contracting party. There are also a further 200 Australian classifications which make up our own tariff program.

         In 1988, Australia adopted a new classification system for administering imports and for collecting and presenting foreign trade statistics. This new system—the harmonised commodity and coding system—has been developed over a number of years by an international body, the Customs Cooperation Council, of which Australia is a member.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The new international harmonised system, sponsored by the WCO in Brussels, replaces the tailored Australian tariff system, with domestic subheadings, with a universal six&amp;hyphen;digit code. The first six figures of each classification are taken from the international system and the seventh and eighth figures are for Australia to insert. These seventh and eighth figures provide a separate category while under the same tariff grouping, making it possible for Australia to impose its own domestically determined tariff system.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A universal coding system is essential in the new world of international trade where countless goods are traded between countries and categories are proliferating. The new system incorporates new products that have come into the international trade market in recent years. Value added, technically advanced products and components emerge without a suitable tariff concession to cater for them. This requires the introduction of new classifications. So Australia has adopted the classification changes as agreed and formalised by the principal Customs Tariffs Act in 1995, and it has added 200 national tariff splits to maintain its tariff program.  These biyearly amendments are therefore necessary for the efficient and effective administration of our customs.

         Schedule 1 of the bill is one of four schedules, and is mainly editorial amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. The other schedules, however, have some important provisions. For example, the rates of duty for beer, spirits, tobacco products and certain petroleum products are the subject of half&amp;hyphen;yearly adjustments in line with movements in the consumer price index, so this amendment reflects the increase which came into operation on 1 February 1996. This amendment will also provide for the tariff treatment of topped crude oil. A reference to topped crude oil was inadvertently omitted in the newer 1995 act.

         Schedule 2 is significant and related to goods repaired overseas, a matter already referred to by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). The schedule amends the concessional entry of goods which have been sent overseas for repair when those repairs could not be carried out in Australia. Previous to this amendment, an importer has been required to pay duty on the value of the exported articles as well as duty on the repair cost. Administrative procedures have been implemented to ensure that customs duty will be collected only on the repair cost of the imported goods. This amendment gives legal effect to the administrative action taken on 15 July 1996.

          The principal act originally tightened the eligibility definition in respect of goods that were exported from Australia to be altered overseas. Some manufacturers took advantage of a system where they could send materials overseas to be enhanced or further manufactured using relatively cheap foreign labour. They then enjoyed a duty&amp;hyphen;free return of the goods to Australia, so a more rigid definition was introduced to discourage this practice. The principal act now only provides for the duty&amp;hyphen;free importation of goods replaced under a safety recall. It includes goods which are being sent to consumers to compensate them for a product they have already purchased which has a design fault or safety concern.

          Schedule 3 of the bill is to do with the aviation industry and it is to do with the aviation fuel excise. Avgas is the fuel used in piston engine propeller aircraft, and is most commonly used by the general aviation industry. Avtur is used in jet aircraft and turbine powered propeller aircraft.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There was an amendment to the Customs Tariff Act of 1995, which came into operation on 1 September 1996, reducing the per litre duty on aviation gasoline—avgas—and avtur. This reduction in aviation fuel excise will return more than $13 million in savings to the aviation industry in 1996&amp;hyphen;97. The entire excise on aviation fuel is distributed by the Commonwealth to two aviation authorities. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority—CASA—is responsible for air safety regulation and Airservices Australia—AA—provides air traffic control services, air navigation facilities, rescue and firefighting services. These two authorities were created in 1995 by the division of the Civil Aviation Authority.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The reduction in excise follows a 1995&amp;hyphen;96 over recovery of contributions from the aviation industry for operating costs of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. The total funding for CASA for the 1995&amp;hyphen;96 financial year was $86.3 million. Of this, 40 per cent was funded by the  government. Of the remaining funding, 55 per cent was met through a levy on the aviation fuels and $4.9 million is expected to be contributed through fees for services provided by the industry.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This funding is broadly based on a model where the users of aviation and the beneficiaries of aviation safety contribute directly to the costs. The general public contributes to this via the government appropriation, the travelling public by the excise on aviation fuels, and the aviation industry by the excise on aviation fuels and by direct regulatory service fees.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Revenue from excise on aviation fuels was greater than budgeted, reflecting higher than expected growth in domestic airline activity. So this reduction rightfully returns those moneys to the industry, consistent with the government's commitment to fair and equitable charging arrangements. Last year, when the coalition was in opposition, we opposed the then Labor government's plans for an increase in the excise on avgas.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Beneficiaries of this reduction in flying costs will in particular be regional and commuter airlines, flying training schools and operators of agricultural and charter aircraft throughout Australia—and no&amp;hyphen;one needs to be reminded of how significant that aviation is for rural and regional development. The reduction in excise on aviation fuels will also directly benefit the more than 20,000 private pilots, and help the major and regional airlines keep downward pressure on air fares, benefiting the travelling public.

           Both avtur and avgas aircraft operators contribute to an excise which is allocated to CASA. Avtur operators, the jet aircraft, pay for the air traffic services they use through a system of charges to AA—a user&amp;hyphen;pays approach. The contribution is in the form of on route charges. Jet aircraft tend to adhere to nominated flight plans. However, avgas users, or smaller craft operators, generally do not use scheduled flight plans and a further excise has been imposed on the avgas fuel to recover their air navigation control costs to Airservices Australia. International craft pay an international aircraft charge in lieu of the excise. Our government is also progressing the planned development of long&amp;hyphen;term funding arrangements for CASA later this year, with a view to their implementation in next year's budget, but this amendment has not reduced funding to CASA in 1996&amp;hyphen;97.

           In general, the international harmonisation of tariff classifications—that is, the focus of the amendments in this bill—makes it easier for exporters to participate in international markets. It minimises the costs to exporters by decreasing paperwork and research, makes it easier to research new markets, and makes it quicker for a new industry or small business person to understand, learn and grow a market share. The amendments provide a simpler and a more understandable process for those who administer the Customs Act. The harmonised system also greatly facilitates the collection and interpretation of all foreign trade statistics. It is essential for Australia to monitor trends in world trade so we can take advantage of emerging opportunities as we develop appropriate marketing strategies.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The coalition supported the implementation of a new tariff classification regime in 1995 in order that Australia would become a cooperative and efficient player in world trade. We must not jeopardise Australia's ability to meet its international agreements, especially in respect of trade, and we must maintain our reputation as a facilitator of trade.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The government aims to secure the best possible conditions and opportunities for Australian businesses trading and investing overseas. International trade is no longer the sole domain of large companies. There are now more than 4&amp;half; thousand small and medium sized businesses actively engaged in export markets, and their numbers are growing. There is no longer any relationship between being big and succeeding; small players can also grow and succeed. They generate some $6.5 billion a year in international turnover and, of course, there are many jobs on the home front. Australia's tariff reform has played a major role in promoting the restructure of Australian industry, promoting world best practice and competitiveness and encouraging Australian firms to pursue export markets. I therefore strongly support the Customs Tariffs Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996.

          —in reply—I would like to thank the speakers for their input into the debate. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996, which is now before the committee, contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. In the main, the proposals incorporated in this bill are technical measures and they fall into four parts. Schedule 1 is a series of amendments which were made in the Customs Tariff Proposal No. 1 (1996) to ensure that details contained in the Customs Tariff Act 1995 were correct when it commenced on 1 July 1996. The changes contain editorial amendments, the transfer of legislative amendments, which were enacted late in 1995 but not incorporated in the new legislation, and three tariff structural refinements to accord with the previous government's requirement that duty rates remain stable.

         Schedule 2 of this bill is operative from 15 July 1996. This contains consequential changes as a result of amendments to the tariff concession system. Item 19 in part 2 of schedule 4

          allows the concessional entry of goods which have been sent overseas for repair that cannot be carried out in Australia. The amendments contained, change the previous bill which would have meant that importers would have to pay duty on the value of exported articles in addition to that on the repair costs.

         Administrative procedures were implemented to ensure that customs duty was only collected on the repair cost of the reimported goods. This amendment gives legal effect to the administrative action on 15 July 1996. Schedule 3 of the bill is operative from 1 September 1996. On 20 August 1996, my colleague the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, John Sharp, announced a reduction of 0.75 cents per litre on the duty on aviation gasoline and aviation kerosene. The duty reductions stem from the over recovery during 1995&amp;hyphen;96 of the aviation industry's contribution to the operating costs of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.

         The industry contribution is collected by the Commonwealth through a levy included in the customs and excise duty on aviation fuels. This reduction will deliver savings of more than $13 million to the industry in 1996&amp;hyphen;97. This is consistent with the government's commitment to fair and equitable safety regulation cost recovery arrangements. The other changes contained in the bill are of an administrative nature and have no duty implications. I commend the bill to the Committee.

          —The opposition has indicated that we are comfortable with this legislation and, of course, that is why it is being debated in this chamber. We accept that the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill and the operations of the scheme, since it has been in place, have now to a large extent been superseded by funding through the drought relief scheme.

        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I might say that I can well remember the angst that surrounded the introduction of this legislation. I remember a very late night sitting of the House of Representatives in the legislation's passage at a time when we were seeing a substantial downturn in commodity prices and a lot of difficulty, particularly in the agriculture sector. There was clearly a need to introduce measures that made it easier for farm households to gain financial support, while various income tests and assets tests were being applied. It was something that the Labor government of the day worked through and put in place in an attempt to make that easier.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It still continued to have its administrative difficulties and, to some extent, I think what has now come into place through the drought relief scheme meets those needs and therefore this legislation is really redundant. But we are quite comfortable in going with the flow on this one.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I might take the opportunity, while speaking on farm household support and with some indulgence from the chair, to raise an issue that is causing me a little bit of concern at the moment in central Victoria and in other parts of regional Victoria. We have all seen the need
         <break page="991" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          for farm households and rural communities in particular to become much more innovative in finding new ways to source income and in Victoria one such interesting innovation has been the establishment of the concept of Teletrack which is to expand the racing industry into televised formula presented racing, particularly for the Asian satellite market and elsewhere. In many communities in regional Victoria, there has been a very strong and favourable response to the development of this plan.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have run into a bit of a problem though in that the Victorian government, which in the end has to give final approval, is now sitting on a report which I understand recommends that we proceed with this industry. There are lots of rural towns which are saying, `Yes, please do so as quickly as possible.' In the central highlands, in the goldfields local government region, it is my understanding that the commissioners want to approve it and go on with it. Lots of farms, which are now involved in this industry, are very keen about it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am raising as a matter of concern, while I have the opportunity to say a few words, the fact that the state minister has not made the decision to approve this. This appears to be because of pressure from the VRC, which is not happy with the competition, obviously. I understand that the commissioners have now received a letter from the planning minister directing them to abandon this plan and revealing, I guess, the hint that if the commissioners do not agree, then they may in fact be replaced by an administrator and the move back to local government elections postponed even more.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I can only say in this forum that this is a classic example of people in rural and regional areas—where necessity is the mother of invention—being forced to find innovative ways to bring their communities back to life. With the changes that have taken place in the economic field here in towns such as Bairnsdale, Lakes Entrance, Maryborough, Hamilton and Portland, as well as in central Victoria, this is one such industry that has been won, and it is highly desired. I would certainly call on the Victorian state racing minister, Tom Reynolds—whom I know personally and have dealt with for many years on a very friendly basis—to get on with  the approval. If, under the influence of the VRC, the government is trying to sit on it, I call on him to very quickly correct the situation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I note also that the Premier of Victoria is away. They always say down there that when the cat is away the mice will play, and so I guess we will need Jeff back soon to straighten this out. I understand that he is very strongly in favour of Teletrack, and wants to see it up and running. So, for all sorts of reasons, I am saying today, `Get on with it.' As I have said, the opposition is very comfortable with the changes that are involved in the legislation. We are not opposing it.

         We are awaiting with interest the outcome of the review that Senator Newman has in place to look at the application of the assets test and the income test to farm based properties, because that is directly relevant to household support and to income flows in difficult times. We wait to see what sorts of solutions come from that report and, in the interim, we are very happy for this legislation to proceed, acknowledging that Labor's farm household support scheme has really now run its race and has been superseded by the drought relief scheme.

          —I note that the opposition is not going to oppose the rather minor amendments to the legislation which the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 1996 addresses. It is meant to tidy up a situation which has evolved over the last while with the farm community. You have to go back a little in history to look closely at what has happened. I suppose that it goes back to about 1989 when there was an agreement between
          <break page="992" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           the states and the Commonwealth. At one of their ministerial meetings, the Commonwealth put forward that drought no longer be considered a natural disaster. Until that particular time, it was considered to be a natural disaster.

         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, the facts were that there was an agreement that, having withdrawn drought as a natural disaster, certain other things needed to be put in place. The Commonwealth did agree that there would be changes—particularly in the taxation area, where farmers would be able to set aside money in the good years to tide them over the uncontrollable drought periods that occur in this country—and also other incentives whereby they would be encouraged to preserve water and fodder on their properties in order to better manage their properties so that they would not have to come back to the taxpayer in such times.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Unfortunately, when I was the Minister for Agriculture in New South Wales and we struck the terrible drought around 1992, none of these things were in place, and so we had an extreme problem as to how we were going to accommodate people who were in dire distress. There was no doubt about it: some of them did not have any money to put food on the table, and they were in extreme circumstances. I pay tribute to the then federal minister for primary industry, Senator Collins, who, when I approached him, did put in place a scheme which was very helpful to farming families. I suppose it is the scheme that we are phasing out now because it has been superseded.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The point is that it is important, and I think that the present minister has addressed the problem in setting up the rural task force. Some people in the community would say, `How  is the farming community so different from small business? They work along similar lines and they can probably get into the same types of financial problems.' As I mentioned before, one of the unique things about the farming community is that they have to put up with the vagaries of the seasons, and no matter how much budgeting you do, if you do get into these circumstances where the seasons turn against you, of course, it puts you in a very serious situation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When it comes back to getting some support, they do not have the ability to get support because they are considered to have an asset. The asset might be encumbered, it might be very encumbered, but they are considered to have an asset. So it does cause a problem when you are trying to give some relief to people who are in very serious and necessitous circumstances.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The rural task force has addressed some of those issues as to how that can be considered. Quite frankly, the most important point is to try to make farmers self&amp;hyphen;sufficient. You are not going to support everyone. There is no doubt that in any business some are going to fail and some are not going to be economic producers. That is a fact of life. But the majority of good managers, the majority of good producers, should not be driven out because of the nature of Australia, which is the driest inhabited continent on earth, and it certainly causes some very distressing problems from time to time.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is rather minor legislation. It is addressing a few of the issues that have become redundant. However, I do urge the parliament to consider, very closely, the report that is going to come from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, on this rural task force. Anyone who represents a rural seat will understand exactly what we are talking about. I believe the majority of Australians really understand and are very sympathetic to the way that farmers have to put up with the vagaries of the seasons and the hardships they go through in the rural and regional areas of Australia. I honestly believe that when we need to put in

          —As the previous speaker said in speaking to this bill, the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill, these are minor amendments. I must say that the farm household support scheme was applicable to very few. There were very few who actually took it up. Because it was under close scrutiny, the ability to rort the system was very limited indeed. There was very little rorting, so little that it did not warrant supervision. This is not so with many of the other social security forms of relief that are given to people.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I do not believe that this country any longer realises the full significance of farm support. When you support a farming family, you do not just support that family, you actually support a country town. If you look at Australia you see the enormous drift from country towns to the cities occurring everywhere. It imposes additional strains on the whole community because when someone goes to the city—our cities are by and large bursting at the seams—you require new infrastructure. The cost of providing that new infrastructure is quite significant and is borne by the general community. Quite clearly, in the national interest it is worth preserving the country towns. It is also worth preserving them for the lifestyle and the contribution that country people make in giving stability and perhaps an element of commonsense to political discussion that is not generally available in the cities.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I do not believe the drought relief scheme fully replaces the household support scheme. People could get household support for reasons which did not pertain to drought—things like commodity prices and the actions of a rapacious banking system.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I have the problem also that there are many farm families where the application of the job search allowance would be highly justifiable. Very many social security outlets do not understand the application of this act with respect to farmers and often you find it very difficult  to get this applied to farm families. This is something that certainly needs looking at. I know it occurs in Western Australia and I would be surprised if it did not occur in every other state, in that a lot of Social Security officers do not understand the particular situation of farmers.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is no doubt that we do everything we can to keep our farm sector viable. I am not sure that is understood today by any of the major parties. As an example, the government parties are, I suspect, going to vote to abolish the present tariff on sugar. That would make Australia susceptible to imports from the European Common Market, where the tariff subsidy range is close to 200 per cent. It is quite conceivable that Europe will use that for political reasons, and we could see sugar coming to Australia. That will be an absurd situation. It will benefit the consumer not at all. All it will do is put a little extra money in the pockets of the mainly multinationals who are the very big consumers of sugar in the country.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It will, of course, flow on. They will say, `If we have taken the step with sugar and we have made the sugar industry even more efficient, we can then apply this in other areas.' If the government goes ahead and supports a reduction of tariff on sugar it is inconceivable that it will not likewise support a reduction in the tariff on motor vehicles. In my view, that would be an absolute disaster and an irresponsible act.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This tariff reduction on sugar is supported, I understand, by the grower groups. They simply, in my view, do not understand their own situation or their own best interests. They feel that

         There is nothing in this bill that you can substantially oppose. It is a relatively small amendment. I will be watching it very closely to make sure there is in fact no diminution of assistance to country people. As the previous speaker said, there are always people at the margins in farming and you cannot protect them all. The truth is that in the rural communities we have had an ongoing loss averaging over 10 per cent. There has always been that action, I guess, of the market filtering out the incompetent and, in some cases, the unlucky. Unfortunately, in recent times it has also filtered out the young, aggressive farmer who is trying to get things done, often taking bank advice and extending himself—on bank advice—beyond his capabilities. He has subsequently been sold up by banks. So we have actually tended to filter some more aggressive farmers by this process.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The importance of the rural sector is, I think, not generally understood in Australia. Both political parties have to sit down and have a good hard think about whether we do want farming in Australia as it exists now or whether we are going to be content in the future with corporate farming. That is a move that I would oppose very strongly as I see it not in our national interests, as it clearly has not been in the national interests of the United States.

         We should be proud in Australia of the reputation of having a comprehensive social security policy. I have a citizen in my electorate who was widowed two years ago. She is an American, but has become an Australian citizen. Originally, her contact was just to brief me and advise me that, with the support she was receiving, although it was sizeable, it was difficult for her to manage a family of three boys and all of their education expenses. In assisting her to  understand the process, I advised her that social security was not designed to allow Australian families to live a lifestyle of luxury; it was set at targeted levels to make sure that the needs of families were met. She commented to me that the US social security system came nowhere near what Australia provided, and I was encouraged by that approach.

         Last week, I had the good fortune in Washington to attend some discussions with congressmen in association with the festivities for the new Congress and the State of the Union address by the President of the United States. I entered into some discussions about concerns I have with the new US farm bill and the export enhancement program that is included in that, with a massive budget—of $500 million—proposed for it again this year. That approach was referred to as their rural policy and it poses a great challenge for Australians.

         I am not advocating that we move into any level of subsidising inefficient agriculture in any way. But there are rural families hurting out there who have enormous pressures in educating our children—bearing in mind that securing a post&amp;hyphen;secondary education for many rural families involves sending them away to provincial cities and metropolitan centres to pursue their tertiary education. This often involves enormous expense. So when the social security system looks at their asset base and says, `You have sizeable assets in your farming assets. You have the means to educate your own children,' what needs to be kept in mind is that often that large asset is propped up by a very large debt at dangerous equity levels. It is very difficult for

         The member for Kalgoorlie talked about those who can be lucky. One of the things about primary production is that, if things go well, often it does amount to luck. An aggressive young farmer who wants to have a go has to take a punt; he has to take a risk. While the situation in my electorate for primary production is nowhere near what it is in Queensland and northern New South Wales after five years of drought there, the good year only comes along once every three or four years. To say to the farming community, `In your good times, you should put away to cope with the bad,' is often unrealistic, given their current equity situation.

We have great potential, and one of the greatest assets is the nature of the people that live out there. They are, just by nature of their pioneering character, a very positive and resilient people. We need to recognise this and do what we can to arrest the dramatic decline in population centres out there. More importantly, we must meet the very immediate concerns of working&amp;hyphen;class, very hardworking Australians. I look forward to further progress on these matters. I commend the bill to the House.

          —The purpose of the Farm Household Support Bill, introduced in 1992, was to provide loans for certain farmers who could not obtain a loan through normal means and also provide for the conversion in certain circumstances of such a loan to a grant when a farmer sold his or her farm. No&amp;hyphen;one should have any objection to a continuation of this scheme, given the parlous state of much of our rural industry, but the farm household support scheme is to be terminated to make budget savings of $960,000. This perhaps indicates the scheme was not accessed to the degree it might have been, given the needs of many rural families for financial assistance, but to dismantle it seems premature, for reasons I will detail.

Unless we take control of this industry ourselves—the value adding component as well—and are not just a bottom&amp;hyphen;end price taker supplying product, with no control over prices, to vertically integrated foreign&amp;hyphen;owned abattoir feedlot export consortia—then the family farm is doomed, and the skills and dedication of the farm family go with it.

         All this is highly relevant to the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill under discussion. Unless we restructure farm finance in this country to help fill the void left by the banks' abandonment of the bush, we will most likely see not only bandaid schemes such as farm household support reintroduced, but also the need for massive bandaging to stop the haemorrhaging that is likely to occur in rural Australia unless our terms of trade improve.

          In this regard, the way in which the banks have abandoned the bush is an absolute disgrace. Not only have they headed off to greener pastures, aided by the total deregulatory climate allowed by the Labor government and its successor, but they have removed much of their advisory services from not only regional centres but also certainly the small local branch, where face&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;face contact with the bank manager had become part and parcel of the family farm's financial planning process. At the time the banker was needed most—at the time of high interest rates, dropping commodity prices, the drought, and the slump in wool—the bank johnnies left town. That is no fault of theirs: they were rationalised out of existence while the bank bosses told deputations from councils in my area to go home and stop wasting their time.

          There are those who want to invest in the viability of the family farm because they believe it is the heart and soul of Australian enterprise. They do not believe the economic rationalist argument that `get big or get out' is the only answer. There are those in regional centres who are exploring alternative schemes of farm finance that will bypass the major banks and their usury attitudes. They will probably require government support for some underwriting of their proposal, but it will be public money well provided, because it is pro&amp;hyphen;active support to help farmers at grassroots level.

          I do, however, despair of the interest that this government will show in such proposals, if they were floated—so desperate is the government not to underwrite debt.

We need some proactive support from government for the family farm.

          As well, there are those in the superannuation industry who are exploring the potential of supporting rural infrastructure programs, particularly rural specific superannuation schemes.

          The horror days of the Keating bank rates are, hopefully, behind us. Hopefully, we can safely put farm household support schemes in the bottom drawer. But let us not be fooled that the recent reduction in interest rates heralds an end to the problems of the farm family. Such families are now being caught up in the sticky web of the actual means test for Austudy if their children or one of their adult members wants to improve their educational standard.

          Why is that? It is because no&amp;hyphen;one outside the farm community, certainly not the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) or her bureaucrats, understands that most farm families are trying to earn some supplementary income off farm. Income becomes expenditure to keep the farm family on the farm and meet the repair and maintenance. Family farm partnerships are a fact of life. They are not a rort, they are not a void into which off&amp;hyphen;farm income is dumped to avoid taxation or any other responsibilities; they are very real. Off&amp;hyphen;farm income is an essential part of the family farm these days—it is not some scheme to manipulate government assistances.

Sure, there were times when it was easy to accuse the farmer of capitalising the gains and socialising the losses—the `agrarian socialist' tag—with the bounties, the tax write&amp;hyphen;offs. For the average family farm those times, if they ever existed at all, are well gone. Yet few are putting their hands out for help unless there is a desperate need.

In 1994, as I pointed out, there were 284 recipients; at last count there were 47. I will bet there has been no other research done on where those other 237 families are now.

         I was interested in the comments of the honourable member for Calare (Mr Andren), those that I caught, and I would like to make a couple of brief remarks. Firstly, there is always concern that corporate farming will take over in Australia. However, historically, the ownership of Australia's farms has remained between 90 per cent and 93 per cent family based. Since the early days of colonisation, through all of the ups and down—the Great Depression, the 1890s, which were as tough, if not tougher, as current times, and the 1930s, which were desperation times—the figures have fluctuated by only two or three percentage points. Family farm ownership has never really slipped below 90 per cent, and that is essentially because it is such an efficient economic unit.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I agree that, in broad terms, we need to look to alternative sources of financing for the family farm. At the moment, it is largely debt financed and it may be that more innovative approaches are needed for the future. Farmers complain, and understandably, about the interest rates that the banks impose upon them. As a government we are intent upon saying to the banks and the financial sector in this country that we are showing long&amp;hyphen;term support for agriculture. We are developing a business plan, and a set of policies and strategies derived from that, to maximise the chances of the family farm and we expect the banks to do the same.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let us get away from the problem of excessive interest rates. It is worth noting here that evidence submitted to the rural assistance scheme inquiry, which we have set up, suggests very strongly—the inquiry is only at a preliminary stage at this juncture and I certainly do not want to pre&amp;hyphen;empt any of the work that it may put together—that there is no evidence of market failure in the provision of capital to the rural sector.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let me comment very briefly on what is happening to those farmers who do leave the land, an issue that was also touched on by the honourable member for Calare. I, too, have an interest  and a concern about that matter. We will do a bit of research on it. One of our rural councillors who has dealt with this problem extensively has followed through on it and undertaken a bit of study of his own. Interestingly enough, he discovered that many of the farmers who left the land found that the time leading up to leaving the farm was the most difficult of all. I suspect that any person in this country who has seen the failure of his or her private enterprise would be able to relate to the dreadfully stressful times leading up to the collapse. It is a situation that can never be fun.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, when farmers did leave, they were able to begin their lives again and, almost universally, they expressed surprise that they were able to get a job quite easily. Farmers are more highly skilled than they often recognise. That is not to say that I resile, in any way, from the need for us to do everything we can to ensure that as many farmers as possible can secure their future.  But having said that, I will very briefly refer to the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 1996. The effect of the bill will be to prevent people who are not entitled to receive farm household support payments on the cut&amp;hyphen;off date, that is 28 days after the bill receives royal assent, from obtaining farm household support at any time in the future.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For those people who are entitled to receive farm household support payments on the cut&amp;hyphen;off date, transitional provisions will permit them to continue to receive the support until such time as they are no longer eligible. Permitting continued access to the farm household support
         <break page="1001" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          payments will require that the access be unbroken and once a person becomes ineligible to receive farm household support payments, that person cannot be paid farm household support payments at a later date.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill retains the operation of other provisions of the farm household support scheme for those people who will continue to receive farm household support payments after the cut&amp;hyphen;off date and FHS payments will still be made as a loan which may be converted to a grant under certain circumstances.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I should emphasise that the operation of the drought relief payment, the DRP, administered under the Farm Household Support Act 1992, is unchanged by the termination of the farm household support scheme in all but one regard. Those former farm household support recipients, who have transferred to the DRP, will not be able to transfer back to the farm household support scheme after the cut&amp;hyphen;off date when their drought relief recovery period finishes.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think the previous speaker had something to say about that recovery period. We have extended it from six months to 12 months, a very significant movement in terms of the assistance that we offer to the farm sector. In fact, in broad, it has resulted in an increase of something like $170 million over that provided by the previous administration in the forward estimates for drought relief, thus reflecting our very real commitment to this sector. That $170 million, I must say, pales into some insignificance against the value of the interest rate cuts that sound economic management has and will continue to deliver. Presuming that it is properly passed on by the banks, and my evidence is that they are claiming that it is being passed on to the farm sector, that is around $300 million per annum relief already provided by the three reductions in interest rates that we have seen since coming to government just under 12 months ago.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In conclusion may I say that we announced the termination of the farm household support scheme in the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 budget. We are considering the most appropriate way forward in terms of meeting the needs of destitute farm families in the most appalling circumstances. At the  same time we are considering the best way forward in terms of ensuring that as many as possible of those farmers that are finding it difficult are moved into a new era when they are able to join the 20 per cent of Australian farmers who are, at the moment, reaping very real financial rewards for their efforts in terms of return on capital. We want as many as possible who are not in that bracket to be assisted into it and that is what we are aiming to do. Thank you.

         On a couple of the items though, I would like to just make some passing comment to indicate the way some of our own thinking is evolving for those who conscientiously read or listen to these debates.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There may be some confusion in the minds of studious observers of these proceedings when they find that there is more about the Farm Household Support Act involved in this particular legislation, as well—we did not clean it all up with the last bit. I gather that there are some provisions that continue to operate while the other legislation still does. These provisions are meant, primarily, to prevent double dipping which may occur when people are able to take up benefits under drought relief schemes and under broader opportunities that are available in social security and veterans' affairs legislation when it all conjuncts with the FHSA.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This just shows the eternal dilemma we have. As I mentioned in the earlier debate, I remember when we introduced the farm household support scheme and the then Prime Minister's country task force spent a long time with the primary industries minister—who, at the time, was Simon Crean, I think—and the social security minister, who was probably Brian Howe. We worked through these things, introducing the legislation at 4 a.m., going home from that session only to face yet another barrage of discontent from rural constituents about the way they were treated by Labor and all this sort of stuff when we had been there until 4 o'clock in the morning introducing this sort of legislation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Now we find double dipping, so the dog is always chasing its tail around in a circle. It does not mean that we do not continue to try to provide fairly for people who are in difficult financial situations, but where there is a loophole—Garfield Barwick set the path a long time ago—the conservative approach is to find it and slip down through it. So, inevitably, we find ourselves here in the parliament trying to close the loopholes as quickly as we open them. I have no doubt that the same thing will continue, but let us hope that it moderates over time.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This legislation also makes provision to extend until 30 June the provisions for the Wool Council to maintain its funding for research and promotion. An interesting situation evolving, particularly in the promotion and future use of wool is the changing marketplace for wool, and many of us have been involved in this dilemma for many years. Last night I had the pleasure of dining with a number of representatives from the textile industry, particularly in Victoria, and they were making the suggestion that it is time for the wool industry to seriously consider abandoning its longstanding promotion and logo of 100 per cent pure wool.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         They said that the market no longer regards a pure wool garment as a pragmatic garment. People are in a hurry; they want easy to clean, easy to hang, easy to press and easy to wear garments. The properties of wool change when they have some synthetic, or other natural fibres added, such as cotton. Even with just small additives, the properties of wool change, according to these people, so that it is suddenly a very attractive product. The marketing of pure wool and the insistence on pure wool products may, in fact, be holding back opportunities for wool.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am not saying that I know these things, but I am just throwing into the discussion the fact that leaders in the textile industry, who are aware of the longstanding interest in wool and the marketability of wool, are saying that the industry itself, and the wool promotion council, need
         <break page="1003" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          to start thinking about repositioning this strategy, particularly as it has been around for a long time and a lot of money has been invested.

         Yesterday afternoon in the fashion parade, as it has been called, that was put on in the House by the textile industry, we saw one extremely positive development; that is, the invention, if you can call it that, and the development—with R&amp;D in the industry here in Australia—of a new denim yarn which is a cotton&amp;hyphen;wool mix. The industry is quite confident that its properties and attractiveness may take the international denim market by storm. If that is to be the case, then that would be a fabulous injection for both the cotton and wool&amp;hyphen;growing industries in Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I make those preliminary comments because this is not a new debate. But it is one that I very strongly call on my conservative opponents opposite, those in government now, to seriously think about. In January, in a very public statement, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) made the comment, published in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australian
         </emphasis>
         , that he and the government see Australia's future in this area of commodities and products being to ensure that we improve the quality of the raw material, or the raw product, rather than focusing, as we have been talking about and trying to do for some years now, on value adding.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is not a new thought among the conservatives. It was first presented to me by the now Minister for Defence, Ian McLachlan, when he was President of the National Farmers Federation. He put quite strongly to us as members of the country task force—I think the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) who is here at the table was present at that very meeting—that it was not in the interests of primary producers in Australia to support the development of value adding because they had very well&amp;hyphen;established markets for their bulk exports—bales of wool, shiploads of wheat or whatever—and that exposing those products to the vagaries of value adding in manufacturing in Australia was not the way to go.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Many of us would be flabbergasted to think that anyone in Australia could even think that way. But I make it very clear to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it was not a new thought expressed by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy in January, that it is actually a  well&amp;hyphen;argued and articulated hypothesis that has been around amongst the conservatives in agriculture and minerals for many years, and it is being argued actively again.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So here we have the wool industry struggling with its strategy of exporting bales of wool—and I can remember my colleague who is in the chamber tonight giving his views many times on the so&amp;hyphen;called export of experts who were in charge of that over the years—but now we have the textile industry saying to us that there are some new and innovative ways to go about doing this. They are suggesting that in fact value adding in Australia holds some real potential at the very time when the people in government who are now running the industry are saying that this is not the way they are interested in going.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I call for a rethink on that, and I suggest that people particularly listen to those in the textile industry, although we know that they are not always constructive in these debates. Many of their concerns about tariff reductions, for instance, are totally contrary to the view. In an article in January I saw that the Wool Council was calling for a rapid reduction in tariffs in Australia so that they will get better opportunities to sell their raw product overseas.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Our overseas customer is saying to us, `If you reduce your tariff barriers to our products, then we will take more of your raw materials.' That is all very well. What happens when you have the Wool Council coming out and calling for accelerated tariff reductions is that the textile industry suddenly says, `Hey, don't you care about us? Don't you care about the jobs?
         <break page="1004" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Don't you care about what we are trying to do with your product to give it a future?' The answer, on that evidence, is no. So this is not an insignificant debate.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We are, in this legislation, just passing a bit of machinery that enables the funding to continue. We understand that the Wool Council is developing its further strategy for post 30 June 1997. What I am saying to the Wool Council is: do not be led by Minister Anderson's hypothesis that we are better off concentrating on the development of the raw material and walking away from attempting to value add in this country. Our farm producers—and the nation as a whole—have a far better future by taking the view of the textile manufacturers, the people who want to expand their businesses, based on improving, developing and expanding the use of the products.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A very interesting discussion and debate will unfold on this issue. And I signal here that we are quite incensed that a government could actually begin the process of walking away from value adding in this economy when so much effort has been put in by so many people in the last 10 or 15 years to try and get an export culture, a productivity culture, a research and development culture and a value adding culture established right across the nation. The proof of the pudding is in the eating: the dramatic increase in manufactured exports in the Australian economy, as against the decline in commodity exports in dollar value—even though volumes have gone up, dollar values have gone down. The contrast is stark and real. It beggars belief that anybody could conclude that it is in the national interest to go any other way. But that is unfolding and it is something that I am quite confident will become part of a significant debate in the nation during the next few years.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We are supporting this legislation and approve of it. But I have taken this opportunity to make a few comments to set the parameters of what we see as a very significant debate emerging in our economy.

          —I congratulate the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) for supporting this series of amendments to clean up various defects in acts and to make sure that we do not revisit ground we have gone over in other areas. I will  refer later to his comments on the textile industry, but I will first speak in support of the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996 and, in particular, the first amendment to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Code Act 1994.

         Compensation provisions already apply to agricultural and veterinary chemical products, but do not extend to an individual active constituent where this active constituent is the responsibility of a company separate from the chemical product company. This situation relates to the active constituent review information requested by the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals for the purpose of reviewing existing active constituents to ensure they meet contemporary standards.

         In a nutshell, this amendment seeks to ensure that compensation provisions apply to all active constituents in use by chemical product companies, as they do to the agricultural and veterinary chemical products. The amendment will remove the concern about commercial exploitation by providing compensation provisions equivalent to those already applying to agricultural and veterinary chemical products, and will ensure commonality in the entire process of review.

         Another part of this bill amends the Farm Household Support Act 1992, which was very well summed up by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) at the close of the debate on that individual act but is referred to in the tidy&amp;hyphen;up session in this legislation. Quite simply, due to the complexity of the various financial aids available to those in primary industry, this amendment seeks to ensure that recipients of financial assistance cannot double&amp;hyphen;dip when receiving drought relief payments.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Currently, when drought relief payments are calculated an amount is allowed for a partner. Should this partner subsequently claim social security—in other words, family allowance or parenting allowance—this person would receive the same support twice. That would be once as a component under drought relief payments and again under social security benefits. Ultimately, though, such a situation leads to a gross overpayment, resulting in even further financial hardship when restitution is to be made. This amendment will remove the possibility of that occurring.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We only need to think about farmers out there doing it a bit tough when the weather has not gone the way that they want or situations are not as good as they could be, to remember that for generations farms were owned outright by families, whereas the farms have now been broken up and sold off. Indeed, over generations these farms have got mortgages on them, some so big the farmers cannot climb over them. But still these people, the very backbone of Australia's rural society, hang in there and keep working.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The days of this country riding on the sheep's back, I believe, are gone, and we need to get smarter in our farming applications. We do need to pursue such things as the supermarket to Asia approach. When times get tough and these very proud people put out their hand, they are not used to filling in government forms for assistance. Sometimes by mistake they fill in two sets of forms to seek aid through income support.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It is a shock. I have had one of these people come in to me, and when I spoke to that person I realised from the outset that it had been a very big hurdle to cross, to actually go and seek  assistance. Some have said that for the first time in their life they have actually had to go and put their hand out, and it goes a long way towards breaking the back. We have seen so many farmers walk away from the farm these days. We can remember, through the heavy periods of the drought and the periods of very high interest rates under the former government, the people walking away from the farms, the marriage breakdowns and, sadly, the suicides. To lose the farm is one thing, but to lose life over it is another dimension altogether.

         Removing either temptation or an error that may occur by double&amp;hyphen;dipping, and making sure that once support is in place there is no need for people to pay back money to the government because they have only been paid what they are properly due, will reduce a lot of stress on these people.

         This bill addresses also the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993. As the member for Burke said, in the chamber we have the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), who has spoken many times and well.

         The Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act was amended back in 1996 to provide for wool industry contributions to the Australian Animal Health Council to be funded by the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation until 30 June 1997. It is obvious that an extension of this funding arrangement is required to enable the wool industry to continue to meet its financial obligations to the Australian Animal Health Corporation and to examine options to provide for a longer term solution. I understand that the Wool Council of Australia supports these amendments.

         I refer to the comments that the member for Burke made about the textile industry. We have a great textile industry in my electorate—indeed, we have National Textiles based at Rutherford. Unfortunately, they have just had to downsize and lay off another 20 staff to restructure and remain competitive. I am glad to see them talk about developments in fabrics with the inclusion of wool and cotton together to produce fabrics that will work in Australia, because we can blend those and work those up at Rutherford and produce fabric in Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the crying shames is that, over generations, not just in the last government but through many governments, we have seen a deterioration of wool product being spun and made into cloth in Australia. Indeed, now to buy some of the best wool in Australia, the microfines that are produced in Australia, one has to buy fabric woven and spun either in England, Italy, France or Belgium. That is a sad shame because it is a very labour intensive industry even though there are high levels of mechanisation. Perhaps it was the high tariffs that kept the industry uncompetitive for a long period of time and then, when the crunch came, they were no longer able to compete. I know the people at National Textiles are investing millions of dollars to make sure that their plight is not the same, that they do keep up with technology and that they do remain competitive.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I said, the lack of availability of quality cloth has led to a lot of problems. Indeed, the suit I wear today is Australian wool blended with mohair and made by a tailor in Newcastle, a clothing company called Rundles, which faces the possibility of closure—it is under administration at the moment. It is a shame because their history in Newcastle goes back, I understand, well over 100 years. To hear people like the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) get up last night and put the blame for this on the current government, I find rather ludicrous. Simply, the former government was one of the major instruments in bringing down the tariffs, its archaic industrial relations laws allowing for this company to have to wind back to compete, to overextend and then no longer be able to compete in the Australian market.

           Act and, Mr Deputy Speaker, with all due respect, it is partly about promotions and organisation and the use of the textile. The demand for the textile has dropped off because of the very high interest rates which we saw climb during the term of the previous government. We then saw a recession, a recession that we had to have, and this recession that we had to have was one of the major factors there. We just heard the member opposite talk about the drop in retail sales: there are direct links and effects. There is no way that the previous government can walk away from the fact that it was there for 13 years, that it administered the policies in those 13 years. We have come in in the last 12 months—or 12 months in a couple of weeks time—and we are trying to clean up and fix their mistakes. As we heard our Treasurer (Mr Costello) say in the House, interest rates now are at the lowest ever stage.

         Going back to the wool bill, which I am sure you were about to remind me of, Mr Deputy Speaker, it makes the clothing more affordable. When interest rates are down, and the mortgage repayments are down, the affordability of the loan puts more cash back into the pockets. I include the $34 a week family tax benefit that came in this year and I am hoping that people therefore will go out and invest that money in new clothing, particularly with Rundles in Newcastle, so that we can see this company survive. It is a great company and has probably some of the best tailors in Australia when it comes to making fine quality clothing.

         Further, the act goes through and repeals and introduces many savings provisions. One there is the Tobacco Marketing Act 1965. The repeal of this act allows the Australian tobacco industry to participate fully in the international markets. The Tobacco Marketing Act 1965 provided the legislative basis for the Australian Tobacco Marketing Advisory Committee, which cased to operate on 3 July 1995. It was agreed by the industry that all rights, assets, obligations and liabilities be transferred to the Tobacco Research and Development Corporation, in anticipation of the repeal of this act.

          —I must confess that I came in to the chamber to address a few caustic words about the next bill. I find myself ahead of myself, so as a compromise measure, I would like to go back to the previous bill, with your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker. I want to draw attention to something that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) said which is very germane to the bill we are now discussing.

         The minister was talking about family farm ownership. He was pontificating, as he is wont to do, and said that the level of family farm ownership in Australia was very high, and in fact over 90 per cent. What the minister does not realise is that multinationals today do not want the land. The land is an encumbrance. It is something they cannot move quickly. But the multinationals control the product so they have family farmers in total thraldom to them. It is real bondage because any slight movement in the price is felt immediately by the farmer. Of course this affects vegetable growing, the chicken industry and beef.

         In the 1920s when `Red Ted' Theodore set up the establishment of publicly owned abattoirs in Queensland, he did not do it for those abattoirs to make a profit; he did it to break the
         <break page="1008" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          monopoly of the foreign ownership at the time. In those days, it was Vesteys. There was no doubt that the cattle industry in Australia was in total thraldom to Vesteys interest and Theodore's strategy was to provide an alternative source of processing.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I ask this House: what difference is there between the position that Vesteys held then and the position held by Japanese and American processors today? Quite clearly we need an alternative form of processing so that markets can be addressed through other than the oligopoly that we have now. I do not subscribe in this day to state ownership, but I do believe that, if we really care about agriculture, we ought to be looking at funding a grower organisation to establish abattoirs to break the vertical integration of that foreign ownership. In my view Minister Anderson does not really understand the rural sector. He speaks from a silver spoon&amp;hyphen;fed background and that is a great pity.

         I am reminded of the early days of the wool crisis when the previous government initiated the Garnaut report. Garnaut is a man for whom I hold the utmost contempt. He is greatly overstated and his report
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australia and the Northeast Asian ascendancy
         </emphasis>
         has done enormous damage to Australia because it was swallowed hook, line and sinker by politicians on both sides. I went to Dubbo to give my views to the industry on the Garnaut report, which I thought was a very suspect document. Young Mr Anderson, the minister, got up and read chapter after chapter from the Garnaut report, which was understandably quite flattering about itself. When we broke for morning tea, one of the local National Party people said to me, `My word. We are so lucky to have a bright young man like John Anderson.' I remember saying to him, `I think you are about to get the government you deserve,' and that is a pity.

         Now the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) mentioned the Wool Council, and I have been very critical of wool marketing arrangements in Australia. The truth is that the Wool Council, the round table and Minister Anderson are as one. There is no doubt that we have to look very hard at wool marketing. I do not think it is so much a matter of value adding as one of making sure that wool growers hold on to their product until further down the production scale. It has been shown in other parts of the world—in America, for instance—that, where cooperative organisations have enabled growers to hold on to their product and to sell the value&amp;hyphen;added  product and get the benefit themselves for value adding, they have done very much better. I believe we need to be setting up mechanisms where the Australian wool grower can hold the interest in his wool down to, at least, the single yarn stage.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) talked about Australia no longer riding on the sheep's back. It is true; it does not. But this should be recognised: if we were to process wool to the top making stage—and we are the world's best top makers; we have actually eclipsed the French in our productivity—wool would today be our biggest single export. Wool is important, because wool is the single most important small business in Australia, and it is so widely spread that it has an impact on much of rural Australia. That is something that needs to be looked at. I do not believe that, with the present wool marketing arrangements, the Wool Council or any of the major companies are going to seriously consider this. It is going to be an initiative that must come from wool growers, and it is an initiative that will only succeed if it is looked on sympathetically by government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In terms of processing wool, I believe that a player that has been overlooked in the market is India. India has re&amp;hyphen;equipped itself with the world's best machinery, and I think there would be a good synergy from using Australian produced top making for processing into yarn in India. I favour India over China because India has actually beaten the Chinese in the process
         <break page="1009" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          of equipping itself with the best equipment, English is generally understood in India, and the legal system sort of works, which is more than really can be said for the situation in China.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I have no real problem with the bill, as it is basically the machinery for the arrangements, except to say that we have to do something constructive about the wool industry. The innovations happening now are coming from individual wool growers. I see nothing of substance coming from Wool International, which is currently seeking its own survival by trying to join forces with the two other big players in the industry, Elders and Dalgety&amp;hyphen;Wesfarmers. I believe that it is the work of individuals in the industry that is doing most to benefit industry.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The member for Burke talked about the value of the processors. I believe that it is the wool users who should be the people most involved in the merchandising and advertising of wool. When you look at the history of Australia's wool marketing, it has been abysmal. We have spent $2 billion trying to increase wool consumption in the United States, with negligible effect. I recall that, when I finished wool classing, our instructor said to us, `Everyone of you will now go up and class a clip'—which every one of us did. He then went on to say, `Unless you can increase consumption per capita in the United States, wool doesn't have a good long&amp;hyphen;term future.' We spent $2 billion trying to increase that consumption, without success. That was $2 billion of wool growers' money that was basically wasted. I believe that there are marketeers in the world who could have had much greater success than that.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Indeed, one of the famous Italian manufacturers of fine wools and material sent Mr Todhunter to America to market their product, on the basis that he had a month and then he had to support himself. He did it very well and that American market is now a substantial part of the company's export business. So it is quite clear that we were capable of doing it, but it certainly was not done by the ways and methods of the Wool Corporation. I do not believe that the organisation we have now, which consists basically of the same people that sit around the minister's round table, has any better grasp of what is needed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Certainly, the member for Burke is right: the processors need to be listened to. Wool&amp;hyphen;cotton is a very good blend. It has a big future in denim. It is certainly going to improve the material.  I believe there is a market also for wool&amp;hyphen;hemp and wool&amp;hyphen;linen, but why do we not address the crying need for wool&amp;hyphen;polyester? I was at a Kangaroo exercise in the north when our servicemen complained bitterly about the polyester clothes they were supplied with and how they simply did not work in the tropics. You could see by the condition the soldiers were in, in those polyester shirts, that there was a need for a better material. I believe that nothing is too good for our services; we should have the very best cloth. Any shirt for the tropics would be enhanced by the inclusion of wool in the mixture.

          —in reply—I thank those who have participated in the debate on the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996. In particular, I acknowledge the genuine interest of the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) in these industries and his commitment to the people in them. Even if I think he is a bit skew&amp;hyphen;whiff in some ways in terms of policy prescriptions, I thank him for his contribution and would like to make a few comments about some of the things he said.

         Firstly, he is right when he says that India offers some real future for wool exporting opportunities in this country. The great problem there, particularly vis&amp;hyphen;a&amp;hyphen;vis China, is that India maintains very high rates of tariffs, particularly against tops. The Indians do so for two reasons.
         <break page="1010" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          In general, they maintain high levels of tariffs as a revenue raising measure on wool because they regard it as a luxury. I think the tariff on tops is about double what it is for greasy wool, and the reason for that is that they have an extensive top making industry themselves, to which the previous speaker alluded.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As it happens, I spent a considerable amount of time just yesterday with the Indian minister for textiles. The activities covered by his portfolio, textiles in India, incidentally, support no fewer than 60 million Indians. That is quite mind&amp;hyphen;boggling. We worked through this issue at great length and I left him in no doubt that Australia's position on this is that we are all in favour of joint ventures, all in favour of expanding the trade; that we want to cooperate and strengthen ties with India, particularly in relation to the wool industry and the activities related to that; but that we feel very strongly that the lowering of tariffs is very much in their interests.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Perhaps there are some lessons to be learnt even from the model whereby Australia is now exporting wool tops to Mexico. They are allowed into that country with no tariff barriers being imposed at all, they are then value added by the Mexicans and re&amp;hyphen;exported, under NAFTA, tariff free to the United States. It is a happy arrangement which works very well for Australia, works very well for Mexico and works very well, we hope, for the Americans and their consumers. It is seeing Mexican consumption of Australian wool rise very rapidly—whilst admittedly off a low base—by no less than 60 per cent last year.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If that sort of growth continues and if we see the sorts of projections that are now shaping up for India following through, then we will indeed be looking at a much brighter future for wool. I must say that it is not before time. With the knowledge that nine out of 10 woolgrowers this year will lose money and that most of them have now lost money for the sixth year running, there is no doubt at all about the seriousness of the situation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have at least, through the round table process somewhat disparagingly referred to by the previous speaker, managed to establish that the industry can work together. I regard it as an absolute prerequisite for recovery that the industry works together in a unified way and recognises that the enemies for the wool industry and for woolgrowers are not other sectors of the same industry but the alternative fibres.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         They really have to capture market share again, and that is not going to be easy. In their heartland markets, in terms of traditional outlets such as Europe, the research shows that an interesting phenomena amongst consumers of almost all goods is now affecting wool; that is, increasingly people expect real value for money from mid&amp;hyphen;range commodities, whether it is motor cars, electronics or clothing. They actually expect qualities of them now that 30 years ago they would have only expected to find in the goods that were priced two, three and four times as much. As a result of that, they are increasingly reluctant to pay big premiums for what are regarded as very narrow increments in quality and prestige. So we do have a problem.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The name of the game for the wool industry is promotion, promotion, promotion. We have to expand demand for the product and, notwithstanding my general agreement with the comments about the apparent lack of result from the vast amounts of money that have been spent on promotion in recent years, I do think that we are now looking at a much leaner and meaner operation, and certainly on vastly reduced budgets in terms of the generic promotion of wool in the late 1990s. We are going to have to make sure that strategies are effective. This government believes that whilst we have a vital role to play in market research and development and in market access issues and those sorts of things, the industry itself has to
         <break page="1011" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          by and large take a lead. The people with the greatest vested interest in the industry are those who have the greatest capacity to really make it work in the future.

        <para first-indent="16">
         May I comment very briefly just on Wool International to reassure the previous speaker and anybody else who is interested that they will not be buying themselves a future? It is quite widely recognised that it is the government's view that, as the stockpile is dealt with and as various other charges imposed upon that body by the 1993 act are discharged, the body will be increasingly wound down and in due course will fade from the scene altogether. We do have a lot of bodies in the wool industry and some rationalisation is, I think, generally agreed to be a very healthy objective.

         Coming to the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996 which is before us, I will be as brief as I can. Firstly, the proposed amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code of 1994 will extend the part 3 compensation provisions to cover the active constituent of a chemical product, as distinct from only applying to an agricultural or veterinary chemical product as is currently the case. The active constituent compensation provisions will apply between the primary applicant with a protected active constituent and a secondary applicant seeking access to certain information relating to the protected active constituent.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In particular, the proposed amendments are in response to concerns expressed by some companies involved with the marketing of active constituents. These concerns especially relate to the provision of active constituent review information requested by the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals, the NRA. The review information is for the purpose of the NRA reviewing existing and especially old active constituents to ensure that they meet contemporary public health, occupational health and safety, environmental impact and trade standards.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Coming again to farm household support, the act of 1992 will be amended. Those amendments will strengthen the multiple entitlement exclusion provisions of the Farm Household Support Act in relation to the drought relief payment. The current multiple entitlement exclusion provisions in the Farm Household Support Act need to be strengthened to restrict the level of income support payments to a DRP recipient or their partner through  either the Social Security Act 1991, the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 or the Farm Household Support Act to the equivalent level of entitlements received under other Commonwealth income support measures.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The proposed amendments will prevent recipients of the DRP or their partners double dipping by receiving support in the form of a couple&amp;hyphen;rate payment under this act while at the same time obtaining payments or allowances identified separately under the Social Security Act 1991 or the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. When DRP is calculated, an amount for the partner is included in the DRP payment. Hence, if the partner were to claim a payment in their own right such as a partner allowance or parenting allowance, they would in effect receive the same support twice—once as a component of the drought relief payment and again as a separate payment under the Social Security Act 1991 or the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. Following this amendment such a case will not be possible.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are in excess of 1,450 recipients of DRP, or their spouses, who are also claiming social security income support payments in addition to receiving the DRP. Based on these figures, the estimated saving from the proposal to strengthen the multiple entitlement exclusion provisions would be a little over $7 million per year. I know that some of those members
         <break page="1012" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          opposite will understand entirely what I mean when I say that, in this day and age, when one has to be very careful with budgetary outlays and when we all accept the need to ensure that targeting of assistance is effectively undertaken and followed through, the issues can become awesomely complex. This is an outstanding example of just how tricky it can be to get these things right. Nonetheless, we think this will remove a small anomaly under which some people were enjoying a little more than their fair share of the cake.

         As part of the December 1994 tobacco restructuring package, the activities of the Australian Tobacco Marketing Advisory Committee—or ATMAC, as it was known—were wound up on 3 July 1995 in anticipation of the repeal of the Tobacco Marketing Act 1965, under which ATMAC operated. Schedule 3 of the proposed legislation repeals the act and provides for the transfer of all rights, assets, obligations and liabilities from ATMAC to the Tobacco Research and Development Corporation. This is a troubled Australian industry, but tobacco farmers are doing their best to grapple with their future. They are operating at the moment under a restructuring package, which will see many farmers identify other futures for themselves.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I would like to make the general comment that I have the utmost sympathy for tobacco farmers. We live in an age when everybody wants to slate people who smoke, everybody is after the manufacturers and there is a great deal of community angst over it. The poor old tobacco farmer is often absolutely the meat in the sandwich in all of this. Many of them are people who, at various times, have been encouraged by governments of all persuasions to go out there and farm tobacco. In fact, I think I am right in saying that they were a protected industry during the Second World War. They were regarded as so important in terms of the product they produced for our service men and women fighting abroad, and so forth, that it was a protected industry to make sure the produce was available.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In this day and age, a very different view is taken of the desirability of providing cigarettes for anybody. But we must remember the need to work with tobacco farmers, who in many ways are victims of past government policy. In this age when we want to get everybody out of that industry we need to work with those farmers so that they can restructure and find their way forward.

         In relation to the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993, the previous speaker, the member for Kalgoorlie, had quite a bit to say about the wool industry. I will confine myself to a few remarks, having responded more broadly to his comments. The amendment to the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993 will extend the sunset date to 30 June 2000 for wool industry contributions to the Australian Animal Health Council—the AAHC—from 30 June 1997, when the current funding arrangements expire. The objective of this provision and the reason for its sunset is to provide an interim funding arrangement pending wool industry agreement on longer&amp;hyphen;term funding. The extension of the sunset date to 30 June 2000 will enable the wool industry to continue to meet their financial obligations to fund the AAHC while they examine options to provide for a longer&amp;hyphen;term solution for funding the AAHC. I commend the amendments to the Main Committee.

           —The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency Bill 1996 proposes to appropriate funds and to issue the securities to effect Australia's membership of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, MIGA. The purpose of MIGA, which is an institution of the World Bank, is to foster foreign investment in developing countries by providing insurance against various risks and advisory services concerning foreign investment. Membership should assist Australian firms doing business: for example, through obtaining a MIGA guarantee or through obtaining political risk insurance. In addition, Australian membership should be viewed positively by other nations in terms of fulfilling our international development obligations.

In 1993, the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade concluded that the benefits of joining MIGA were in excess of the costs and that therefore Australia should join. The Australian Labor Party supported that recommendation at the time and now, in opposition, we are pleased to support the bill.

I am on the public record as always being a bit of a sceptic as far as some of these international financial institutions are concerned.

          I know there are a number of other issues involved as far as MIGA is concerned. As set out in the EM, MIGA's purpose is to foster foreign investment in developing countries. I imagine that the speaker who is to follow me will express some concerns about the encouragement of  Australian institutions and companies investing in developing countries. I have had it brought to my attention that some Australian mining companies are investing and exploring in countries that we might think are a bit politically unstable. However, Australia's membership of MIGA affords these companies insurance against the risks of currency transfer, ex&amp;hyphen;appropriation, war and civil disturbance. Membership should be encouraged because it gives Australian companies the opportunity to invest abroad with security.

          We live in a world that economically and industrially is getting smaller. We are continually faced with concerns for our own constituencies with regard to foreign investment in Australia. But, by the same token, Australian companies are being very proactive in investing in other parts of the world and, again, I instance mining industries. To a certain extent, I remain a bit sceptical about World Bank type financial institutions but my understanding of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, and the insurance that it provides to Australian companies investing overseas, is that it is well worth Australia's membership. I commend the bill to the House.

           —The previous member said he remained a little sceptical and I think he should. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency Bill 1996 is just another grab at this great straw of internationalism, which has been a hallmark of this and previous governments in Australia. We are told that the analysis says that there will be more
           <break page="1014" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            benefit than cost. I think that analysis is very dubious and, in any case, it is going to be marginal.

          I find it amusing that we spend so much time on these multilateral bodies. Here is another that is going to be dominated by the United States. It is quite clear from the capital structure that that will be the case. There is no provision in these insurance contingencies for devaluation of currency, which is one of the very big risks taken in investment.

          We are going to all this trouble to set up an organisation that will, in the main, be used by large business—and mainly by foreign business. It will not be used much by small Australian businesses. We do not give anything like the same support to industry in our own country. The Development Bank has basically ceased to exist. As a branch of the now privatised Commonwealth Bank, its charter is invalid. Its charter would be ultra vires a companies act. It is necessary to re&amp;hyphen;establish that sort of facility in Australia if we are going to do something serious.

          The previous speaker mentioned the growth of the manufacturing industry. This myth has to be countered. We are told that manufacturing now represents a growing percentage of our exports. That is true, but what is not realised is that importation of exactly the same sorts of things has increased at the same rate off a bigger base. So the situation is getting worse, not better. We are going to have no jobs in this country if we do not address the urgent need for an Australian import replacement manufacturing industry.

          I do not intend to dwell long on this bill. I certainly do not intend to oppose it. It is just another example of the fetish drafts by successive governments in this country. I made the point in the House the other day that in Australia we are fast approaching a one&amp;hyphen;party system where both major parties have identical policies and only quibble at the margins. This bill will do very little for Australia. It is a bill, which, over time, will provide a few lofty jobs for a few people, but it will be of no great benefit to industry.

          There was some criticism of the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) in this House. I think it was a little unfair. I have spoken to Ian McLachlan on occasions. I think Ian McLachlan  and the government are aware of the great benefit of bilateral trade arrangements and would pursue those. I believe that Ian McLachlan will do more than any previous minister has done in his capacity as Minister for Defence to make sure there is a real Australian component there. The member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) misrepresented, to some degree, the views of the member. The member is a man whose views should be listened to much more in the cabinet. I believe he is isolated in the government. Having made those few remarks, I am satisfied.

          (Braddon—Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (12.54 p.m.)—in reply—I recognise people's contributions here today. There has been a level of scepticism about being involved in multilateral agreements, but we live in a world community, a global community, and I think everybody recognises that the boundaries are disappearing and distances are shrinking because of the capacity for the world society to work together and because of developments in transport and communication systems. We are closer together as people. We all are aware of a degree of sharing and working with each other.

          History is dotted with the difficulties of doing that but, as an Australian government at this stage in history, we believe that we have a role to play in the global community and in working through the structures of the world community. As some of the speakers have indicated, there is a degree of scepticism. That will always be the case, probably right throughout the world. In any country there will be people who are sceptical of centralised

          Yet governments of every country, as they participate in this global community of ours, have a responsibility to make judgments, assessments and decisions as to where they can best link in as participants in a world community while, at the same time, giving consideration to the interests of their own people, their own society and their own communities. I believe that in this regard the government has found that balance.

          Of course, this proposal for the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency Bill 1996 is one which was supported by the previous government. It has been taken up by us and we support it as a coalition government. It is beneficial to Australian business and industry, and Australian business and industry have wanted us to be involved in this because it does give Australian firms procurement opportunities and, of course, some guarantees against political considerations.

As a government, this is our bill and we support it, and we take on board the comments of people who have contributed here in the Main Committee today.

As I said at the time, the Government does not have a population target for Australia. Rather, and this point was also made during the interview, this comment was made in the context of promoting public discussion of the issue of population levels.

        (1) Proceedings in relation to decisions of the Child Support Agency (CSA) come to the Family Court of Australia by way of an application or appeal filed on a Form 63 or an appeal from a decision of the child support registrar filed on a Form 64. Forms 64 are used for appeals against incorrect assessments under section 110 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act, appeals against the Child Support Registrar's decision to refuse to accept a child agreement made under section 132 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act or appeals against a decision made by the Child Support Registrar in relation to an objection made pursuant to sections 82&amp;hyphen;85 of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act.

        However, the majority of Forms 63 filed are applications for departures from administrative assessments made under section 116 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act or for substitution orders made under section 125 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act.

         (1) The June 1996 Leipzig International Conference on Plant Genetic Resources, which Australia attended, recognised the importance of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture, in particular for the food security of present and future generations. The Conference recognised the serious threats to the security of plant genetic resources and acknowledged that efforts to conserve, develop, and sustainably use genetic diversity should be improved. A significant outcome of the Conference was the adoption of The Global Plan of Action for the Conservation and Sustainable Utilisation of the World's Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture.

Nevertheless, my Department, including AusAID and ACIAR, is aware of the critical nature of the ex situ germplasm collections held in the `world's gene stores' and the necessity that these collections be adequately conserved and curated.

         In providing funds to the core programs of the IARCs, the Australian aid program adopts a strategic approach which gives priority to those centres which have prime responsibility for conserving the collections of major crop species important to developing countries of our region and Australia—namely,  rice, wheat, maize, grain legumes, potato, banana.

        This determination does not affect any decision the injured workers may make with regard to taking their own proceedings. The two proceedings are completely unrelated and, in fact, Supreme Court case law has previously ruled that a Coronial inquiry should not be used to set up civil action.
