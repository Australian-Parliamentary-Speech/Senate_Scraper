         The purpose of this bill is to introduce a charge on exports of Australian wine to assist in funding the wine export promotion infrastructure and program of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. The government is introducing the charge at the request of the wine industry.

         The wine industry developed the export charge proposal because it was concerned that the corporation would have to wind down its generic export promotion program for Australian wine as the grant funding came to an end. The industry strongly supports the corporation's export promotion program and regards it as an essential component of its export growth strategy. It does not believe that a voluntary scheme would be effective.

The council, a committee of the corporation, oversees the corporation's export promotion program. The wine export charge will have no impact on the Commonwealth budget.

         At successive annual general meetings of the corporation, in 1995 and 1996, levy payers to the corporation have considered motions in support of the wine export charge. All levy payers are entitled to vote at the annual general meeting, with votes allocated according to the dollar amount of levy paid. The motion was circulated to all levy payers prior to the meetings. At the last meeting in December 1996, 94 per cent of votes were in favour of the proposal. There was strong support for the proposal from small, medium and large producers. The government has also received many representations from individual winemakers and industry bodies, including the corporation, requesting the introduction of the charge.

         On taking office, the government had to consider a number of proposals from primary industries for new levies and charges. It decided that a more systematic process was needed for assessing such proposals and decided to develop a set of principles for the purposes of this assessment.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In developing the levies principles, the government was concerned to ensure that there was a strong case and a high level of support for proposals from industry for new levies and charges. It wanted to be satisfied on a number of points, including that such proposals relate to a function for which there is a significant market failure, have broad support within the industry and have been the subject of extensive consultation with all industry sectors. The government has assessed the wine export charge against the levies principles and is satisfied that it meets all relevant principles.

          As honourable members are aware, the Australian wine industry is currently enjoying unprecedented international recognition and is achieving rapid growth in exports. Between 1985&amp;hyphen;86 and 1995&amp;hyphen;96, exports grew more than ten&amp;hyphen;fold in volume and more than twenty&amp;hyphen;fold in value, from 11 million litres worth $21 million to 130 million litres worth $471 million. Australia's major export markets are Europe, North America and New Zealand.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In calendar year 1996, exports totalled 148 million litres valued at $551 million. This is an increase on the previous year of 28 per cent by volume and 36 per cent by value. Exports now account for over 28 per cent of production. This growth in exports is being accomplished in spite of falling world production and consumption. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has projected that by 2001&amp;hyphen;02 wine exports will more than double in volume to 407 million litres valued at $1.5 billion, which is equivalent to $1.3 billion in 1996&amp;hyphen;97 dollars.

          The Australian wine industry has set a goal in its industry plan entitled `Strategy 2025' to achieve annual sales of $4.5 billion by the year 2025 of which exports would make up $2.5 billion. The industry believes that generic promotion of Australian wine in export markets will continue to make an important contribution to the achievement of its goals, and is prepared to fund this promotion.

The government wishes the industry every success in this important endeavour. I commend this bill to honourable members, and present the explanatory memorandum.

         The Broadcasting Services Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 is part of a legislative package, the primary purpose of which is to make commercial radio and commercial television licences allocated under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 subject to the same annual licence fee arrangements as apply to commercial broadcasting licences that were granted under the former Broadcasting Act 1942. This bill also proposes to correct an unintended consequence in the operation of the cross media rules relating to the common control of a commercial radio licence and an associated small newspaper.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The related bills in this legislative package—the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1997 and the Television Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1997—will amend the Radio Licence Fees Act 1964 and the Television Licence Fees Act 1964 to make commercial licences allocated under the Broadcasting Services Act subject to the payment of annual licence fees based on their gross earnings.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act in order to make provision for the administration of annual licence fees payable under the Licence Fees Acts. The bill also makes consequential amendments to the Broadcasting Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1992 and repeals various redundant provisions in that act.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Honourable members may recall that, when parliament passed the Broadcasting Services Act in 1992, the issue of whether to make new commercial licences, that is, licences allocated after commencement of the act, subject to licence fees, was left unresolved, pending determination of the most appropriate method of recovering economic rents from commercial broadcasters. However, commercial broadcasting licences granted prior to commencement of the new act continued to
         <break page="2380" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          be subject to the payment of annual licence fees.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Options identified for the payment of licence fees by new commercial broadcasters included: a one&amp;hyphen;off payment on the allocation of a licence; ongoing fees based on the value of the spectrum used; ongoing fees based on the income derived from use of the spectrum; or a hybrid system combining two or more of these components.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As honourable members will appreciate, a pure price based allocation system attempts to recover, up&amp;hyphen;front and in a single payment, all economic rents generated by the use of the radio frequency spectrum and ownership of a licence. Such a system works best under conditions of effective competition where there is complete market information and certainty, but is less effective where there is limited commercial interest in new licence opportunities.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Analysis by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics in 1995 suggested that new licensees are likely to earn less profits than existing broadcasters in the area and that this will affect the premium bid for licences at auction. In addition, under provisions for the allocation of licences in under&amp;hyphen;served single service markets, many of the new licences are being allocated for a charge which reflects no more than the recovery of costs incurred by the Australian Broadcasting Authority in planning and allocating the licence.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The current arrangements are considered to be inequitable. New players are able to purchase, comparatively cheaply at auction, a right to compete with incumbents who pay annual fees and who in the past bore the cost of proving eligibility under the former merit&amp;hyphen;based allocation process or, in the case of some radio incumbents, paid high prices for the right to convert their AM licences to FM.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Under the circumstances, the government has decided that the best way to ensure fair treatment between incumbent licensees and new licensees, and to ensure that economic rents are not lost to the Commonwealth in respect of new licences, is to apply fees to all commercial licences based on annual gross earnings of the commercial broadcasters.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          Accordingly, the legislative package before the House today, of which this bill is an important part, will extend the current provisions to licences issued by the Australian Broadcasting Authority in its price&amp;hyphen;based allocation process under the Broadcasting Services Act, as well as to second licences in single service markets allocated via the administrative allocation mechanisms in the Broadcasting Services Act.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The two prime components of the broadcasting tax regime remain unaltered. Licensees will pay a one&amp;hyphen;off, up&amp;hyphen;front fee on the allocation of a new commercial licence and an annual fee, which will recover the economic rents due to the Commonwealth. Opportunity is also being taken in the bill to correct an unintended consequence in the operation of the cross&amp;hyphen;media rules with respect to control of a commercial radio licence and a small newspaper associated with its licence area.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          An effect of these provisions is that they apply to all newspapers with 50 per cent of their circulation in the commercial broadcaster's licence area even if that circulation is very limited in comparison with the total population of the relevant licence area and their level of influence in the licence area is correspondingly minimal. The bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act to exclude newspapers with a circulation of less than two per cent of a commercial radio broadcaster's licence area population from the cross&amp;hyphen;media rules.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The financial impact of this and the other two bills in the legislative package in respect of extending annual licence fees to all commercial radio and television licences is difficult to forecast precisely because of a number of variables. These include: the number of new commercial broadcasting licences that will be made available by the Australian Broadcasting Authority in the future; the number of these new licences that will be actually taken up; the extent of any discounting that may occur at auction because of the new annual fee arrangement; and the gross earnings of new licensees.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          However, the legislative package when it comes into effect is expected to have a progressively and increasing positive net effect
          <break page="2381" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           on the budget, levelling out at about $0.134 million per annum after 1998&amp;hyphen;99. The other amendments in this bill are expected to have no significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue.

          —On indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, before the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) continues his remarks I would like to make a correction. I spoke in the debate last night and in the course of my remarks I said that the export market development grants scheme measures implemented by this piece of legislation reduce expenditure in EMDG alone by $426 million over four years. I went on to say that in Austrade the annual reductions in appropriations are over $90 million per annum. I have made the point before, but in the past I have made it correctly, that the $90 million reduction for Austrade of course refers to the 1996-97 financial year only.

          —When the debate was interrupted last night, I was talking about some of the principal amendments of the Export Market Development Grants Bill 1997. Firstly, I was talking
          <break page="2383" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           specifically about the measure to finally bring small tourism operators into the scheme and to treat them equally. I note that on 2 May last year the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) asked a question of the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. He said:
          </break>

        </talk.start>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I refer to the Prime Minister's commitment to small business and to your government's specific election commitment to extend the export market development grants scheme to the tourism industry, particularly for the benefit of single tourist operators who are a cornerstone of small business in this country. Do you still stand by that commitment?
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         What a lot of hypocrisy that was, because the former government failed abysmally to even accept recommendations from reports of committees of this House to bring the small tourism operators and to bring the single service providers into this scheme.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So this government, in answer to the question asked by the member for Cunningham last May, absolutely has done precisely what we said we would do in the lead-up to the last election. In fact, four years prior to that, the coalition made a commitment to small and medium sized business, particularly to the tourism operators who had been rejected by the former government which is now in opposition. So it is a bit of hypocrisy from the member for Cunningham.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Following on from that, the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), who is still with us here in the House this morning, on 7 May last year raised this matter of public importance for discussion:

        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         The threat to the capacity of small business to develop export potential as a result of the planned abolition of trade and industry development programs, in particular the Export Market Development Grants scheme.

        <para style="Para">
         That was about talking down the economy, wasn't it? That was a bit of let's go and frighten the horses and frighten business out there when, in fact, the government has absolutely kept its commitment and maintained the scheme.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I want to speak about the second principal amendment in the brief time left to me. The minimum expenditure threshold has been reduced from $30,000 to $20,000. That is in line with our commitment to small and medi
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          um sized business to give new entry players in the market—people who want to become involved in export, people who want to expand beyond domestic production and get their products and their services out into the international marketplace—an opportunity at an earlier stage to go out and market their programs or their products or their services overseas. The reduction in the expenditure limit will bring into play more small business. That is what it is designed to do, and I have no doubt whatsoever that in that regard the new act will be successful.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The scheme funding is to be capped at $150 million and a pooled payment system is to be implemented to make sure that the small players and the medium sized players do not miss out. As I said last night, I would rather that we did not have to put a cap on such a scheme. But, in the nature of things, given the legacy left to us by the former Labor government, this government had to cut spending, and that is a fact. For all Australian citizens we had to cut spending. It had to come from across a wide range of portfolios without decimating any particular segment of the economy dependent upon government assistance. So the new EMDG scheme is fair. It will operate equitably. It targets the end of the market where we really need to give a leg&amp;hyphen;up to new entrants in export marketing.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Some of the other major amendments include applicants with incomes greater than $50 million being excluded. That is totally appropriate. I believe we do not need in this country to keep using taxpayers' funds to encourage industry to continue to make greater profits. Industry with a $50 million profit a year level is certainly capable of supporting itself in both domestically and overseas
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For so long as we continue to maintain a mentality that it is the government that will make the play for industry—that the government will provide absolute protection for all of its citizens; protection for industry and protection for jobs—we will never progress to be able to play in the huge international market. With only 18 million people, Australia—a small country numerically, but an important country economically and indus
         <break page="2384" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
          trially—will never ever be able to play appropriately in that international marketplace so long as we continue to cosset industry and allow our production to hide behind protective barriers and artificial mechanisms to provide so-called funds for assistance. Our companies need to be profitable, efficient and productive in their own right. They need to be innovative and they need to seek out new products and new services and new markets.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is really what this bill is all about: helping smaller companies and medium&amp;hyphen;sized companies to go and find those markets and participate in selling their products and their services overseas. The scheme as constituted limits claimable expenses in respect of overseas representatives to $200,000 per grant. That is simply a capping mechanism so that we do not allow companies to artificially raise their expenditure in one area to the detriment of the general development of overseas or export market areas that are particularly applicable.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the amendments eliminates all capital costs from eligibility. That is appropriate in a scheme which has had to be pared down. Capital costs are to the cost of the company, and depreciation costs, of course, apply. But what we are really looking at with this scheme is encouraging companies to do things which assist their marketing effort, assist selling their product and assist in advising the citizens and the businesses of other countries about what it is that we make, produce and supply, rather than creating infrastructure to supply that product or that service. A range of expenditure categories has been reduced from the number allowable before, and some specific items in relation to expenses have been removed from the scheme.

         This is a very short&amp;hyphen;sighted bill. If we learned anything in the last two decades, it was that Australia's future rests with exporting to the Asia&amp;hyphen;Pacific region and to the rest of the world. Unless a government takes steps to directly support small and medium enterprises in competition with small and medium enterprises from other countries, and larger entities that they have to deal with, unless there is that government intervention and support, Australian industries which have done well over the last decade and a half may perish or be dramatically reduced in their effectiveness. That imperils the state of the economy of this nation. The cuts and the capping that are undertaken in this legislation will hamper, limit and constrict Australian businesses in their attempts to earn income for Australia.

         This piece of legislation does nothing good for this nation. It is a piece of legislation that breaks commitments the coalition made while in opposition. Prior to the last election, the then Deputy Opposition Leader and now Deputy Prime Minister, the member for Farrer, (Mr Tim Fischer) told exporters that there would be no significant changes to the export schemes that the Labor government had developed during its time in office. But, like most other things they said while in opposition, this government came into office and broke yet another commitment. They gave their lies a euphemism: `non&amp;hyphen;core promises'.

         The coalition came into government proclaiming itself as the saviour of business in this country. It promised everything under the sun and has delivered on almost nothing. This piece of legislation is different. It is not simply that they have not delivered; they have actually done something to seriously damage Australian business. In 1974, Australian businesses exported $7.5 billion worth of goods. By 1994, that had become nearly $65 billion. In 20 years, this country had increased exports by a staggering 860 per cent. The
         <break page="2385" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          greatest gains were made during the time that Labor was in government. From 1983 until 1994, Australian exports increased three&amp;hyphen;fold. From 1974 to 1994, the annual average growth rate of exports to north Asia was 12.6 per cent and to South&amp;hyphen;East Asia, 14.9 per cent. Did Labor stymie business or did it promise to promote and encourage business?

         If you listened to the ravings of the Deputy Prime Minister, you would think that we sent all business people to re&amp;hyphen;education camps and collectivised industry. We did more for business in 13 years than the coalition did in 30. The Labor government inherited programs like the development import finance facility and the export market development grants; small&amp;hyphen;scale programs that were under&amp;hyphen;utilised. We had the vision and understanding of the usefulness of these programs in expanding the Australian economy and changing the focus on industry in this country. Under Menzies, Holt, McMahon, Gorton and co. this was a country where industry atrophied. Programs like DIFF and EMDG to the Fraser&amp;hyphen;Howard government were a cottage industry that needed to be patronised and paid lip&amp;hyphen;service.

         Under Labor, industry was given the tools to broaden its horizons into Asia and the world. We made these and other programs export market programs of some merit. Australia is not in a position to influence prices of goods on the scale of the European Union or North America. Being dependent on primary products is dangerous for this country. The prices for these goods fluctuate in the extreme and our economy is not strong enough to handle these changes. The proof of this was the erratic fluctuations that world commodity prices went through in the 1980s. It was the goal of the former Prime Minister and Treasurer, Paul Keating, to change that. His vision and his policies drove Australian business to become smarter and better at doing business. It was the vision of people like John Button, Ralph Willis and Paul Keating that gave Australian business the tools they needed to make the leap into exporting in areas which had not been extensively explored.

         The previous Labor government and the Whitlam government before it knew that this country had to diversify its industry or it would become a second-rate, tin-pot basket case, or perhaps worse—simply perish.

        <para first-indent="16">
         To this end, these Labor governments created and broadened programs to assist businesses in this country in their attempts to export products that would bring enormous returns to Australia. One of these programs was EMDG. Created in 1974, this program helped business offset the costs of trying to build markets overseas for their products. I think we all can agree that the greatest hurdle for businesses trying to export is the initial costs they face in breaking into markets. These costs can be too great to make the initial attempts viable or they can be too much of a burden to continue. EMDG gave some relief to companies making the great leap into overseas markets.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The effectiveness of this program can be seen in the budget papers laid before this House last August by the government. In 1994-95 EMDG helped companies gain exports for this country totalling approximately $6.6 billion. The ratio of exports to the cost of this scheme was 33:1—33:1! How can this program be so inefficient and so costly that the coalition government could make cuts and restrictions to it? How short-sighted is this ideologically driven group of Luddites, one might ask? They can only see dollars and never have any sense in regard to providing facilitation for our export businesses. Industry assistance is not a policy area where the government sees direct benefits to its bottom line. The benefits do in fact come with more jobs, more exports and indirect gains in taxes and revenue to the government.

          So now we turn to the Department of Trade and the Deputy Prime Minister, the sabot hurler of Australian industry. This is a Minister for Trade who has presided over the destruction of government programs and claims he knows how to promote exports. Programs like the national industry extension scheme, DIFF and EMDG were the tripod on which businesses in this country could make an attempt to push their products overseas. Under the coalition, all these industry assistance programs have been cut—contrary to what the Deputy Prime Minister promised before the election last year.

So it is astounding that every industry group affected by the cuts to assistance programs has come out publicly to say that this government has completely missed the mark with these cuts to these beneficial programs.

           Time and time again the minister for industry and the Deputy Prime Minister have heard the cries from industry about these cuts. But you would think that they are blind, deaf mutes.

           Firstly, in relation to overseas representations, many companies cannot afford to set up offices or subsidiaries overseas to handle business for them. Many businesses do not have the know-how to do business overseas, where the slightest mistake may mean that you lose contracts. The best option for many is to turn to local business people to help them to enter markets. Does the government expect that these representatives work for free? For a small or medium size firm struggling to enter a new market, the cost of this sort of representation is very high. Taking away this assistance means undermining their ability to exploit a market.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Secondly, there is the overseas market development allowance. That too has been pared back. Thirdly, there is communications. This is a fairly simple concept to understand, but the cost to business is not for this government. It is expensive to stay in touch with markets and initially there are very high costs for businesses breaking into new markets. Cutting puts pressure on businesses involved in this process. As we know and understand, despite the fact that worldwide communication costs have been cut with the introduction of new technology, it is still a major factor for small and medium businesses trying to enter overseas markets.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Fourthly, product promotions: this is one of the most mean spirited of all the cuts undertaken under the umbrella of this legislation. Promoting a product in a new market is a horrific cost to business. In very sensitive markets like Japan, promotion is a cost that is not cheap and can never be penny&amp;hyphen;pinched. The Australian Meat and Live&amp;hyphen;stock Corporation may have the discretionary funds to undertake an extensive market promotion, but I do not think a small engineering firm can.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Fifthly, trade fairs: again this cut is evidence of the coalition's penny&amp;hyphen;pinching, narrow focused and ideologically driven myopia. One of the most effective means of promoting a product to the largest number of industry buyers and consumers is trade fairs. Each industry and country has fairs for businesses to promote and sell their products. The cost to participate in these fairs and have a presence that will interest and impress is not
           <break page="2387" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            cheap. Most firms cannot afford this kind of ongoing cost. A few days at a trade fair can mean the difference between entering a market and wasting time.
           </break>
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Sixthly, literature and advertising: material for distribution and advertising in local markets seems a fairly logical cost when trying to enter a market. Not so for this government. Translation and printing in those countries is another area they do not seem to understand. So the government cut it and tell business they are unwilling to help it underwrite those necessary costs.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Seventh, marketing consultants: markets overseas can be very difficult to understand and then sell into. Japan, for example, as I have said previously, is a highly sensitive market and few Australian businesses have the knowledge to enter this very lucrative market on their own. That is why it is necessary for those businesses to engage marketing consultants who have an experience in trading into a country such as Japan, and those marketing consultants come not at a low cost but at a high one. If a business is to understand the market that it is to enter, the business culture within that country, and is to attempt to directly deal with the sensitivities of that market and with the underlying reasons for purchasing undertaken by consumers in the market and also undertaken by chains in the market, then they need to pay out the money to get that marketing advice; otherwise, as with a range of these other cuts, their attempts to sell into those markets are foreshortened and the benefit to Australia is also directly foreshortened.

          <para first-indent="16">
           Eighth, patent registration: if industry in Australia needed any more evidence of a lack of vision in a government, this cut is it. How many times have great Australian ideas been lost to overseas companies because individuals and companies could not afford the cost of patent registration? The black box flight recorder is one that springs to mind quite readily. I am sure that many on the coalition side of politics can remember their lambasting of our promotion of Australia's wealth of intellectual talent. The idea of a `clever country' was met with howls and hoots of laughter from the coalition. The laughter was
           <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
            from mindless ideologues whose vision extends no further than a plough, a rock and a quadruped. This government does not care if our intellectual property is sold by others with no great gain for this country.

          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           It is in this area chiefly of patent registration in our regional markets and markets worldwide that we run into a core problem for Australian businesses. They have to not only attempt to enter foreign markets but also protect their original products from exploitation by others. And we have seen time and time again the inability of Australian companies to cover themselves worldwide because of the high cost of patent registration. Time and time again we have seen in other countries a ripping off of those products and then the extension and development of them, at great cost to Australia. That has been a great windfall for those countries, which have simply taken the intellectual product from the people of this country and then worked it to their advantage.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           There are a range of other measures which I will not go into detail on. On overseas buyers visits, it is quite simple to understand that, if businesses in Australia need to bring in overseas buyers to look at their products and if they cannot touch and feel and handle the products and come to understand them absolutely, they are not likely to buy that product.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The 10th measure is foreign language training; 11th, international business education courses; 12th, export packaging and labelling design; 13th, tenders and quotations; 14th, free technical information; 15th, subscriptions to associations; and 16th, airfares. In this bill we see a reduction of the claimable period from eight years down to two. So, if the grant runs for a period of eight years, under this bill, instead of the airfares being claimable—and they are a necessary business cost—over the whole life of the grant it is restricted simply to two years.

Labor expanded programs like EMDG to make this possible, yet this government sees the money as wasted and the program abused. We know that they think the system was abused because the changes they have made to this legislation will affect 60 per cent of current grant holders.

Indeed, the member for Blaxland has become the grim reaper, the bearer of bad tidings, `Mr Negative Half&amp;hyphen;Hour Session' in the way that he has presented an economic picture of what is happening in Australia.

One of the major initiatives of the coalition during the last election was to encourage new growth in our economy, to promote new business investment and to secure the spawning of new jobs, reversing the trend of business closures and pessimism for the future. A catalyst for investment, the concept for this Export Market Development Grants Bill 1997, a total reworking of the original 1974 act, is both timely and appropriate to the needs of our economic growth in small to medium enterprises.

         Improvements to the bill include repealing and changing the 1974 EMDG Act. Its revision incorporates the overriding imperative of this government that covers policy area upon policy area, that being to provide a fairer deal for small business. Another improvement is making the Export Market Development Grants Act easier to comprehend, by cutting in half the number of words, as well as simplifying the requirements of the existing act, making it more logical and easier to implement, and most importantly increasing its focus on assisting and delivering opportunities far more to small and medium sized enterprises, particularly in the tourism and small manufacturing sectors.

         The member for Blaxland said that this bill limits and constricts small to medium business. He said that government needs to take steps to support small to medium enterprises, otherwise Australian industry may perish. I seek to remind the member for Blaxland how many small to medium businesses did perish during Labor's reign of 13 years. But this shows that this government, the Howard coalition government, is making growth and the sustainability of small business the government's business. That is achieved in part by lowering the minimum expenditure threshold to $20,000 per grant, from its present level of $30,000, and excluding all applicants with yearly incomes greater than $50 million.

         I am very confident that the shift in the focus of the EMDG program will help provide access to assistance for those small to medium Hunter exporting firms seeking to export product opportunities, particularly in light of the announcement by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) of the restructuring of the beef industry which will now allow small producers and graziers to seek export markets of their own offshore or indeed through a cooperative process and get some level of compensation for expenditure in opening up those markets—markets which will create a future for regional and rural Australia, long forgotten by this former government, as shown by the number of representatives they have in regional and rural Australia.

         Under the former government's act, too often was funding distributed amongst a relatively small group of applicants who applied for large grants which were quickly wiping out the balance and limited the potential good effect that this investment was created for. Now that this bill has been simplified and capped at $50,000—something that I am glad to hear the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) actually supported in his speech last night in this House—it encourages the little guys to make that investment decision, knowing that the process is less cumbersome to implement and that the funding is not likely to have already dried up, creating a window of export opportunity for small business.

Our amendments

         There has been plenty of talk in the Hunter of late and plenty of talk in this chamber about the apparent net benefits of the ever-rising international tourism numbers coming to our shores. It is a fair question, and within our home, the Hunter, that debate continues as to what tangible benefit tourism actually delivers to the average man or woman in the street. The simple answer to that question is jobs; genuine job creation in a growing industry sector. Statistics show, and this data is backed by both sides of the political fence, including most recently by the New South Wales Premier, Mr Bob Carr, that for every 17 international visitors to the Hunter one real job is created, and that is sustainable.

One of Joni Mitchell's lyrics was `Don't it always seem to go that you don't know what you've got till its gone'. One of the things that the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) pointed out recently was that Labor's industry policy stood largely unacknowledged by the broader community and by the electorate until the Howard government dismantled it and people became aware of just what it was that they had. The Export Market Development

         First I will point out some of the provisions of the bill. The bill legislates those changes to the export market development grants scheme which were announced in last year's budget. That includes capping the scheme at $150 million per annum and that cap includes up to five per cent for the costs of administration, so the scheme is effectively capped at $142.5 million for exporters. This legislation significantly narrows the scope of the scheme.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are things within the bill that the opposition does not oppose. The single tourism providers grant rate is increased from 25c in the dollar to 50c in the dollar and the eligible expenditure threshold has been reduced from $30,000 to $20,000. Firms with a turnover of more than $50 million per annum are no longer eligible and an upper limit of $25 million in export earnings remains.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But we also see that the categories under which grants will be made are to be reduced. Patent registration, overseas buyers visits to Australia, foreign language training—I would have thought that was extremely important—international business education courses, export packaging and labelling design, tenders and quotations, free technical information, subscriptions to associations—all of those things—will no longer be eligible expenditure. Airfares will be eligible expenditure for the first two years only as opposed to the previous eight years.

          The second problem is that it is bad policy. Exports are critical to this nation's future. If we have a look at the 1995-96 data on exports of primary and manufactured products, they make it very clear. For example, over the past 10 years unprocessed primary products fell from 53 per cent to 38 per cent of total Australian produce exports, while elaborately transformed manufactures rose from 11 per cent to 20 per cent.

          I think one of the interesting commentaries on this government's first year in office, at the 12-month mark, was the number of people in small business and industry who were expressing concern at what they saw—essentially a `do nothing' government, a government that was inactive and did not have any answers for the problems of small business and the problems of industry. A lot of that was indicated in the responses that came forward quite recently at the Senate committee hearing inquiring into this legislation.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We had, in the first place, evidence being heard of the success of the scheme in increasing exports. In particular, the Australian Publishers Association noted that, as a direct result of the scheme, exports in the publishing industry had increased by 100 per cent over a four-year period—from $41 million in 1990 to $80 million in 1994.

           used by the 500-odd manufacturers surveyed. The committee also received quite a lot of evidence concerning the multiplier effect of this scheme. These ranged generally between 15 and 25 times. So, for every dollar of grant these manufacturers and exporters receive, it generates between $15 and $25 in trade and exports for this country.

          Witnesses before the Senate committee also informed the committee that 42 per cent of the outlays under the scheme were returned to the government in direct taxation, with additional revenue being gained through sales tax, payroll tax, et cetera. They made the following observation:

         <para font-size="-=2">

          Against that background, it is most disconcerting to find that the EMDG funding is now to be slashed by $425 million over four years, being capped at $150 million per annum and having that significantly narrowed focus.

         <para first-indent="16">
          One of the other things that ought to be pointed out too is that this is likely to lead to additional red tape in satisfying the demands of the scheme. Most people in this House would know that small business is classically overpressed with little or no discretionary time. Most people would also be aware that this government has made an election undertaking that it is going to cut red tape by 50 per cent. Against that background, I want to express concern at the prospect that the revised legislation will in fact increase red tape for small business and that many small businesses, rather than go through that red tape, will not make application for grants under the scheme, and it will therefore fail to fulfil its important purpose.

That was the movement of large manufacturers offshore with their manufacturing bases—those people who had been extended the opportunity of export incentives to further expand the Australian economy and improve our debt situation. We saw companies move offshore to invest their money in the markets we should be exporting to and develop manu

However, the government is hard pushed to provide any evidence of abuse of the EMDG scheme by trusts, just as it failed to substantiate its claims that industry was rorting the R&amp;D syndication provisions on a large scale before it savaged that program.

           Trusts are a legitimate business structure and are adopted by many small family businesses—the very sector which is supposed to be sponsored by the government under the EMDG scheme. The exclusion of trusts from future participation in the scheme is clearly another example of Treasury's attempts to rein in current government expenditure without any regard to Australia's ability to compete internationally in the longer term.

           Trusts are obliged to pay payroll, sales, group and fringe benefits taxes like any other business. Both Crommelin Chemicals and G.W. Lucas and Sons employ staff who each pay income tax. Crommelin Chemicals now pays more company tax on the profits from exports than the amount of assistance it receives under the EMDG scheme, so it is more than paying its way in terms of taxes. A small business based on a trust set-up will take no fewer risks than any other small business when it comes to deciding to expand into the global marketplace.

           The Australian Institute of Export (WA) is also critical of discrimination against knowledge intensive industries under the new scheme. The institute, of course, favours keeping knowledge in technology. Under the proposed guidelines, the categories of expenses that will be reimbursable will be reduced from 11 to five. What is most disturbing about this is the make&amp;hyphen;up of the reduction. Promotional activities, including the provision of free samples, attendance at trade shows and the production of advertising material, will continue to be eligible. Businesses involved in either tourism or manufacturing consumer goods will benefit from EMDG claims.

          —I must say before commencing my presentation on the EMDG bills that I am disappointed with what has come from the other side of the parliament on this legislation—disappointed because, after 13 years of Labor, one would expect that the message the Labor Party had from the electorate 12 months ago was that there was a need for change in the way we do things in Australia. This is one of the things that we need to change. It is unfortunate that the Labor Party would rather continue their policies of the last 13 years. They come into this place to debate bill after bill saying that they disagree with what we are trying to do and that they would rather go back to the last 13 years of operation. On 2 March last year, the electorate referred to the Labor Party and said no, they did not want any more of that 13 years of management. The bills that we are talking about today are two of those bills of change.

         This legislation will create a revised Export Market Development Grants Act, which will repeal the current Export Market Development Grants Act 1974. As members are aware, the export market development grants scheme
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          provides grants mainly to small or medium sized companies to assist in offsetting overseas marketing costs while the companies are entering and/or developing export markets. The present scheme which this legislation will replace has morphed into what many of the previous Labor government policies had shown themselves to be: fat, overly complicated, troublesome and a monetary black hole.

         The current government recognises the export market development grants scheme as a highly worthwhile operation that has been assisting Australian exporters for over 22 years—we in fact say it has been helping Australian exporters over 22 years—and that has the potential to continue to do so. However, the legislation before the House today is evidence that the scheme needed to be updated. As outlined in the second reading speech, these bills simplify the structure and make the criteria of the scheme easier to understand. Something we need to do in export is to understand more easily how to go about exporting. The focus on assistance to small to medium enterprises will be increased, and an upper limit of $150,000 per year will be placed on the cost of the scheme.

         Full rate eligibility is delivered for the first time to the tourism industry. The minimum expenditure threshold has been lowered to $20,000 per grant to benefit more small and medium enterprises. In addition, applicants with income in the grant year in excess of $50 million will no longer be eligible to receive a grant for that year, thus freeing up available funds for those exporters most in need of assistance. Who could argue with that? The option left to the present government is to fix the leaky boat left by the previous Labor government or else let it sink to the bottom under the weight of its own complexity. The scheme remains a well&amp;hyphen;funded program, despite the cap of $150 million placed on the grants.

It is important to support them, especially the small ones, and that is what the government is trying to do.

         While we are on the topic of Labor's failures, let us just take a brief look at the trade and industry sectors under the last Labor government. Labor's policies resulted in a decline in Australia's total market share of world trade. From 1989 to 1994, Australia's total market share declined by nine per cent. Labor failed to take advantage of the high growth economies in Asia, although there is a lot of rhetoric on that particular issue. From 1989 to 1994, Australia's total market share declined by 13 per cent in ASEAN and by 20 per cent in east Asian areas.

         According to the Western Australia branch of Austrade, last year 450 claims were made for grants, of which 421 were successful. This was approximately 10 per cent of the total grants allocated nationally. The total grants awarded in Western Australia came to somewhere in the vicinity of $21 million—money that would have been of great use to the successful companies. It is hard to know at this stage how the proposed cap on expenditure, with the maximum limit of $50,000 being paid out to a company, will affect the current system in Western Australia. However, the average Western Australian claim tends to be $42,000—less than the maximum limit. In this sense, the changes to the scheme in terms of the amount of grants offered will possibly not make a huge amount of difference to the current situation in that state.

          —The member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) made some unkind characterisations of the approach of the former government to industry policy and support for exporters. Whilst rejecting those characterisations, I think the appropriate characterisation of this government's approach to such matters is dumb, destructive and penny&amp;hyphen;wise and pound&amp;hyphen;foolish. The Export Market Development Grants Bill and the debate about this bill give plenty of opportunity to illustrate those points.

         The bill is part of a package of this government's efforts to exert blows to export performance and to exert blows to manufacturing industry in particular as an important and growing segment of that part of Australia's livelihood. We have seen in recent times the attacks on the shipbuilding industry, attacks on printing, attacks on computing and information technology. Yesterday's

         We have seen the continuing uncertainty over important Australian industries, such as the car industry. The answers by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to questions in the House yesterday can hardly be reassuring to that industry—obviously lending weight to the position of his Treasurer (Mr Costello), who wants to close down Mitsubishi. The government's approach can hardly be encouraging to the textile, clothing and footwear industry. The government's decisions in relation to the engineering industry, with the machine tools and robots bounty, are significant blows to Australian industry and to the most significant growing part of Australian exports, which is manufacturing industry.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Cuts to support for exporters have also become very noticeable in this government's term. We have seen $480 million cut out of the DIFF scheme, the development import finance facility, over several years, despite the established multiplier effects of that scheme and the huge benefits that that scheme provides to Australian businesses in gaining access to markets against fierce competition from a range of other countries that provide mixed credit schemes and other soft loan supports for their operators. This government has bounced Australian business out of that and provided a huge disadvantage to Australian business. The international trade enhancement scheme was abolished to save $117 million. Now we have the slashing of the export market development grants scheme.

         The government, to its limited credit, is quite honest about what its intentions are here. In the explanatory memorandum circulated to the House, the government says, under `Financial impact':

         As I said before, it is dumb, destructive and penny&amp;hyphen;wise and pound&amp;hyphen;foolish. At a time when the government has made very clear in its mid-year economic and fiscal outlook that a negative contribution to GDP growth is being made by net exports for this year and projected next year against a background of a positive contribution of one per cent in the previous financial year, nothing is more important to this country's economic prosperity, nothing is more important to creating jobs and nothing is more important ultimately to the budget coming back into some sort of balance than performance in terms of export and making this country increasingly competitive in world markets. As I said: dumb, destructive and penny&amp;hyphen;wise and pound&amp;hyphen;foolish.

         There is one particular program I ought to also refer to before I move on. I think the member for Griffith (Mr McDougall) was referring earlier in the debate to the situation that if every Australian spent an extra dollar on a local product instead of an imported product that would make a huge contribution. Indeed it would, and that is precisely why the opposition, when in government, supported the Buy Australian campaign. Instead of directing his comments somewhat gratuitously to this House, he ought to be addressing them to the Treasurer and seeking to reinstate that campaign. I certainly call on him in a spirit of bipartisanship to put some effort where his mouth was on that issue in the House today and in fact make a very strong statement of support for the reinstatement of the Buy Australian campaign.

         Government speakers on this bill have made a great song and dance about the inclusion of tourism in this particular bill and the EMDG scheme. That is certainly something which the opposition supports. But, before they get too carried away with that, it ought to be looked at in the context of other aspects of tourism. The tourism and expo program has suffered a 50 per cent cut. Programs supporting Australian bids for infrastructure projects in Asia and support for Australian suppliers have been abolished. North Queensland tourism operators obviously feel betrayed by the 600 per cent increase in the visitor charge to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The ATC, the
         <break page="2407" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Australian Tourist Commission, will have $18&amp;half; million wiped from its budget over the next four years. Before government members crow too much about a welcome but somewhat limited initiative in this scheme for the tourism industry, it ought to be seen in the context of the net loss that this government's activities have represented for that industry.

         The opposition does not oppose the features in the bill whereby the eligible expenditure threshold is reduced from $30,000 to $20,000, firms with a turnover of more than $50 million per annum will no longer be eligible and there is an upper limit of $25 million in export earnings. However, we rigorously oppose a number of other provisions in the bill. The member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), who spoke earlier, received a most impressive letter from a Victorian company that he quoted fairly extensively. I wish to refer to the very well argued position that has been put obviously to a number of members by G.W. Lucas and Sons in Beechworth, Victoria in relation to a number of unsatisfactory aspects of this legislation.

         Beechworth is in the electorate of the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman). It would be good if he came into the chamber to make some observations in support of his constituents. Beechworth is a community in rural Victoria that has suffered fairly dramatically in recent times from a range of measures taken by Liberal governments at both the state and federal level, and it needs to be defended. For the record, I have some personal association with and interest in that community because my parents live there.

Our company therefore, due to lack of financial assistance of the EMDG, will be unable to pursue export sales into as many countries as we would like to.

         Another feature of the legislation which the opposition is opposed to is that airfares will be eligible expenditure for the first two years only. I once again refer to this very well argued submission from a very successful small business in rural Victoria that is actively selling on world markets:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The best method for export sales of the "Lucas Mill" is to attend International trade shows, which allow working demonstrations of our machine and exposure to international travellers. This is a costly, but very effective exercise and assists us to establish Agents world wide. Therefore by only allowing airfares for the first two grant years to be eligible, there is no possible way that we can adequately cover the countries world wide in that time span. In the past we have been disadvantaged because we are a family company and all six members of the company all work full time within the business. Current legislation has only allowed us to claim one family member's airfare and visit allowance when family members travelled to exhibit at trade shows since the business had not been operating for five years at the time of the claims.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         That argument once again demonstrates the importance of allowing businesses to make claims that enable them to ensure exposure at a range of trade events internationally over a longer period than that limited by this government's proposal.

         The opposition is opposed to another provision in the bill which provides that trusts are no longer eligible corporate entities. We do not necessarily oppose that proposal as such, but we would very much welcome hearing from the government why they do not
         <break page="2408" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          believe trusts are an appropriate entity. We have an open mind on that, but we certainly are deeply concerned about the retrospective application of that change because it will very significantly disadvantage companies that in good faith have proceeded to make arrangements, make business decisions, in anticipation of EMDG support. Effective from the date according to the announcement of the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer)—I think it is 16 December—they are going to bomb out. Once again, the Lucas letter says:

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Our family company operates as a family trust and through the trust it allows us to disperse our income. If proposed legislation is accepted, it will mean that we are no longer eligible to claim the EMDG. Our company was one that started with very little financial resource, but due to sound business management which included considerable future planning and a very dedicated family company with a unique product, we have gone from strength to strength, in particular due to assistance from the EMDG. At present our company directly employs 16 people full time as well as 6 family members. Indirectly it gives work to over 250 other Australian companies. At the moment there is a slight decline in local sales, but an increase in export sales, due largely to  International Trade Shows that we attend. If our company was no longer eligible for the EMDG, due to our trust structure, it would mean that there would probably be a fall in export sales and our direct staffing levels could fall as low as 6 or 7, not to mention the 250 odd other Australian companies that receive work from us.

         It would be extraordinarily helpful to receive from the government some sort of explanation as to why they believe a trust is not an appropriate corporate structure. It would be particularly helpful and fair of the government to enable organisations, corporate entities such as the Lucas entity and others, to have an opportunity to adjust their structure so that they do not find themselves just left out in the cold willy&amp;hyphen;nilly without explanation overnight. That is clearly not a fair or sensible way. The retrospective application of that is most pernicious and ought to be, in all sense of fairness, opposed by both sides of the House.

          —I am delighted to be able to join in this debate, which of course is outside my portfolio, but there are aspects of the Export Market Development Grants Bill that I would like to refer to and commend the government for its foresight. I think probably the two most significant measures that have been introduced to direct more funds to small and medium enterprises are those with the minimal level threshold, which has been lowered to $20,000 per grant, to benefit more small and medium enterprises. In addition to that, applicants with incomes in the grant year in excess of $50 million will no longer be eligible to receive a grant for that year, which really does free up available funds for those exporters who are most in need of assistance.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I have been interested to be sitting in on this debate and learning of the attitude of the opposition to the decision to make tourism part of that particular process. I think at last we are getting a real recognition that the tourist industry is very much part of our export effort. The government has increased the grant rate for all tourism providers to provide the full rate of 50 per cent, allowing free samples of services provided and access to approved joint venturers. I think that is to be commended.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think one of the real difficulties that the previous government had was its failure to recognise the very nature of the tourism industry and what it was all about. The plain facts are that 92 per cent of the operations of the Australian tourism industry are undertaken by small businesses. That is a phenomenal figure when you consider that, I suppose, most people would consider tourism is made up of airlines and large international hotels. The figures show that in fact 92 per cent of the entire operation are small and medium enterprises.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It has been a very great problem for those small operators to get into some of those
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          international markets, yet they are the very essence of the whole industry. At least now they have some access to it. When you look around the world and you see what is evolving out of international tourism and the potential for Australia to cash in on some of those markets over the next few years, obviously it is absolutely essential that those small operators do have the capacity to get into some of those markets.

        <para first-indent="16">
         If you look at some of the predictions that are happening out of the Asian countries in terms of their tourism efforts into Australia over the next five years, the figures are really quite staggering. I will cite as an example some figures that came out a little while ago from the World Tourism Organisation. They estimated that something like 124 million Asian tourists would be travelling offshore from their homelands for holidays by the turn of the century. That is indeed a phenomenal figure.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Quite frankly, if Australia got about one per cent of that business we would have very great difficulties in handling the business. Obviously, it is essential that, if we are going to go into competition with some of our Asian neighbours at the moment in gaining our fair share of that international tourism business, our providers, our operators and basically the small business group have the capacity to get in to sell their goods and services.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think some tremendous potential exists there to develop those Asian markets. But obviously, unless our small operators and big attractions can get in there, we will have very great difficulty competing with countries such as Indonesia, which has a major expansion of its infrastructure and plant under way at the moment, and Thailand and Malaysia, which really have recognised their capacity and ability to go and get those tourism dollars. Of course, I think we also have difficulties at the moment with areas like Japan, whose numbers coming to Australia, while still very strong, have declined slightly in recent years, because we are facing very great competition from places like Hawaii, who are spending that money and making that investment in international promotion.

          —I am very pleased to be able to join in this debate on the Export Market Development Grants (Repeal and Consequential Provisions) Bill 1997 and the Export Market Development Grants Bill 1997 and to follow the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull), who has just given one his very erudite exposes on the value of the tourism industry for Australia and the export dollars that it earns. I think everyone in this chamber would know that not only does he have an abiding and passionate interest in tourism but also he would easily be the most knowledgeable person in the chamber when it comes to talking about tourism. When this minister gives his endorsement to something, I am sure all honourable members would know that it is something very important and worth while.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would suggest that this legislation with its endorsement by the minister shows that the government does have a very real and ongoing commitment—not only through the export market development grants scheme in association with this legislation but in expanding that scheme to include the tourism industry—and that we recognise this is a very important, very big but also, more importantly, very rapidly growing area that Australia has benefited from, particularly because of our geographical location and the fact that we are now starting to market ourselves in a way that gives us access to such a huge source in the region. I think the growth in the number of visitors from overseas in recent years coming to this country, particularly from some of the Asian countries, is nothing short of phenomenal.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think, with the changes we have put in this legislation, we are recognising that the majority of small operators are the ones who can benefit from this. We are giving them that opportunity to expand their markets and at the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          same time, of course, earn those badly needed export dollars.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I have said, this legislation does very much recognise the importance of small business, and I think that is something that this government, particularly the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), has shown that we are very much committed to. With this change, I think we do expand that commitment and show that we are continuing to make sure we give small business the encouragement it desperately needs not only to continue but also to expand and, most importantly of course, to employ more people. We recognise that the opportunities for reducing unemployment will be coming very much from the small business sector.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another important point to note about this legislation is that it will lower the threshold that business must spend to receive the grants from $30,000 to $20,000. I believe that that is something that recognises some of the challenges small businesses face when they try to seek out new markets overseas and the fact that for many of them it is not easy. By giving this incentive, we believe that it will encourage more to have a go. As we are well aware, not only have we inherited some budgetary problems from the previous government but also Australia as a nation does have a trading imbalance that we desperately need to reverse, and this is part of helping to attack that problem.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is also important to note that, for the tourism operators, the rate payable for expenditure will rise from 25c in the dollar to 50c in the dollar. This will provide a service to all sectors of the tourism industry, not just the single service providers. So, again, I think it is very important to note that this legislation is recognising the industry as whole.

         A further important point to note about the legislation is that it will reduce some of the complexities. In fact, it has halved the length of the legislation, making it somewhat easier to appreciate. As people would be aware, under the export market development grants, claims can still be a maximum of $200,000 by any one business. There is a qualification on that which recognises that there is an upper limit to the amount of money that the
         <break page="2411" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          budget will allocate in any one year for the whole scheme.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But it is important to note also that 70 per cent of the claims are for under $50,000, and of course they will all get the full grant. So it really is, I think, a very more part of the government's involvement in developing exports in this nation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is important also to note that this legislation repeals the 1974 export market development grants scheme, and it deals with all the matters that arise from that repeal. It also has a number of other major effects, but I think I would just like to concentrate on the importance it will have for a number of tourism operators in western Victoria and, in particular, in my electorate of Wannon. I think this does provide some tremendous opportunities to encourage the local tourist operators. Not only have they worked very hard to be part of the intrastate development of tourism in Victoria but also they have worked very hard at the interstate and, indeed, international level.

         I well recall some years ago, when leaving with a delegation to go to Japan, speaking to the then Warrnambool City Council and asked whether they had any promotional material they would like me to take. I must admit that I had mixed feelings when I felt the weight of what I had been given. But I was very impressed to see that amongst some of that material, which included videos, was one in Japanese. I think that shows the sort of level of understanding and commitment some of the local tourism operators have when it comes to attracting overseas tourists into western Victoria.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is also important to note that three&amp;hyphen;quarters of Victoria's 15 million overnight visitors spent time in regional or rural areas, so obviously the opportunities are there for regional operators, and particularly local operators in western Victoria, to capitalise on this. A tourism survey in Victoria last year found that the Great Ocean Road, which is one of the great icons not only of Victoria but of Australia, was the most popular area in regional Victoria. It attracted 2.1 million overnight stays and 2.8 million day trips. This is in very large part due to the work of
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          Shipwreck Coast Tourism, which has worked very hard with local operators along the Great Ocean Road all the way to Port Fairy to promote the area and to ensure that we do attract as many  tourists as we can into the region.

         These operations are not just for the region; they have also been promoting them in other parts of Australia. In fact, they have been promoting them overseas, as I mentioned, not only through the local member but in a number of initiatives of their own. I think it is to the credit of Shipwreck Coast Tourism that they have been named the No. 1 regional association in Victoria in 1993, in 1994 and again in 1995. It is something that I am very proud of and I think the people of western Victoria are also very proud of. Of course, the only reason they did not get there in 1996 was that, having had three consecutive wins, they did not feel it was right to enter the fourth year.

         I would like to talk about a couple of other areas in my region as well that I think this bill is going to help promote, particularly through the local tourism operators. If we look at the Grampians region in western Victoria, again a very large tourism destination, in 1995 over 500,000 people visited the Grampians region. The stay here tended to be longer, an average of 3.6 nights. Again, this is largely due to the work of some of the local bodies and in particular the shires of the Southern Grampians and the Northern Grampians, which have worked very hard to attract visitors and to ensure that there is ongoing patronage of the region. I believe they are working very well. Of these 500,000 people, 75 per cent came from Victoria, 24 per cent came from interstate and only one per cent came from overseas, so I think we do have some big opportunities here to expand that. I believe that people from overseas, when they get an opportunity to see the region, cannot fail to be impressed by some of the great scenery and the many other attractions that the region has got.
        </para>
        <break page="2412" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          What this bill also does is to address the concern of the tourist operators in the region where they have felt that in the past export market development grants have been too hard to access. Many, I know, are keen to take advantage of it, not only those who operate motels and so on but even the coach operators, who feel there are probably going to be some opportunities to take advantage of this.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As I said earlier, this bill is half the size of the previous one. That shows that not only is this government committed to reducing paperwork for small business but we are actually committed to making understanding of the legislation a lot easier too. When we look at the bill, the number of categories under which people can qualify for support has been reduced from 11 to six. These are overseas representation, overseas marketing visits, communications, free samples, trade fairs and advertising and short&amp;hyphen;term consultancy. So I think this does focus export market development grants very much into the areas we can get maximum benefit from, and I congratulate the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) for the work he has done here. It certainly shows that he is very much in touch with what is needed and understands the way we can get the maximum benefits from this government expenditure.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is interesting to note some of the things that have been removed from the old scheme. They include patents, labelling, unmatched eligible expenditure, foreign language training, educational courses, tenders and quotations, free technical information, overseas visitors to Australia, subscriptions to industry associations, prescribed services in the construction industry, half&amp;hyphen;yearly claims and trusts. It is an interesting long list which tried to include everyone. Bringing it down to six I think helps a lot in focusing the scheme very much towards the people who will get the maximum benefit.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As I said, it will be much easier for smaller operators to access grants with the threshold being cut from $30,000 to $20,000, which means, of course, that people will qualify more easily and not have to outlay as much to get access. Applicants with incomes greater
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           than $50 million a year will not be able to access it, which I think is fair enough. That recognises that we have to target the support to those who most need it and will most benefit.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In conclusion, it is important for me just to reiterate that I believe that these changes to the export market development scheme are positive and that they focus the scheme very much towards the small business end of export development. I think all of us have had experiences where we have seen that small businesses have really worked very hard to get export opportunities and have never found it easy. It is much harder in many cases than trying to expand locally, yet we all recognise the importance of making sure that our businesses do expand.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The important addition here is to include the tourism operators and in particular the small tourism operators. That shows that this government does have a very real commitment to assisting in this area. I believe that the region I come from is one of the really great parts of Australia and I know that many tourism operators are already keen to take advantage of these opportunities to develop what is already a very successful series of tourism operations in western Victoria. They are keen to expand tourism so that we not only have more opportunities for jobs in the region but we also get our fair share of the overseas dollars that are coming in and therefore can make our contribution to the national interest. This will give the region the opportunity to be very proud of the achievements it has had up to date and will be building on. I support the bill.

          —I am pleased to speak in the debate on the export market development grants bills. I thought it important to remind the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) what the coalition said to the Australian people about this policy at the time of the last election. The coalition made a firm commitment to maintain the scheme, to expand the scheme, to improve the scheme.

         I found very amusing the contributions of the members for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) and Wannon, congratulating the Minister for
         <break page="2413" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Trade (Mr Tim Fischer). Effectively, they are congratulating him on breaking either a non-core promise or a core promise, because this scheme is being gutted. It is being slashed and hacked at, but government members are standing up in this chamber wanting to congratulate the minister for the coalition's breaching its own election document, breaching its word to the Australian people. I am staggered under those circumstances. If the shoe were on the other foot, I would be a little embarrassed about it. I would not want to take pride in the fact that my government has broken serious commitments given to the Australian people at the time of the last election.

         Talking of promises, I think it is interesting to put this in context because the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) has reminded the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) of his statements to the Australian people that they should look at unemployment—12 months after he came to office—given his promises during the election to fix the unemployment problem and, particularly for an electorate like mine, fix youth unemployment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Looking at the situation 12 months later, unemployment has not improved. It has not stabilised; it has got worse. Youth unemployment particularly has gotten worse. I think that is a shame. The Prime Minister says, `What we need in this economy is more growth.' I think we all agree with that. In fact, we are one party that has always said, in government and in opposition, that growth is our target, our mission.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But here you have a scheme designed to assist Australian industries, Australian small companies, get into exports and what are you doing? Are you assisting growth? The member for Wannon said, `Well, we're making access much easier by reducing the minimum amount from $30,000 to $20,000.' I support him in the proposition that this is a good move. But what he fails to say is that there is a cap of $150 million  on the scheme. Had the scheme not changed and continued to be funded, by 1998-99 we would have seen $292 million being spent on this scheme.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The member for Wannon said that a majority of claims were $50,000. If we were to get
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          another $150 million in this scheme assisting small business claiming $50,000, we would be helping 30,000 small businesses in this country. Here are government members boasting that they are denying 30,000 small businesses the opportunity to get into the export market, help growth, help the economy, create jobs and get unemployment down.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is what we could be doing, but we are not. This government is doing the reverse. It is saying, `We are not going to help 30,000 Australian small businesses, we won't get the growth that we would get if they got into the export business, we are not going to have the jobs and therefore we are going to have unemployment increasing.' Shame on them! What hypocrisy! How can they get up in this House and say how proud they are?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is even worse if you look at the impact over four years. It is half a billion dollars. One hundred thousand small businesses over four years will not be able to take advantage of this scheme, and the government are proud of it! They get up and say how proud they are! I find it absolutely amazing that government members can get up and say how proud they are that we are denying 100,000 small businesses over four years the opportunity to get into exports, to expand into exports, for companies to grow, to put on extra staff, to see the economy bubbling along and make an impact on the unemployed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The reality is that those opposite do not give a damn about the unemployed. They do not give a damn about Australian jobs. I think that is the truth of it, because they would not embrace the cutting back of this scheme with such fervour if they did. I cannot understand how small business organisations can believe the rhetoric of government members that these are measures designed to help them when in one year 30,000 will be denied and over four years 100,000 will be denied.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The member for Cowan said that the trouble with the opposition speakers is that we do not learn, that we want to hang on to the old scheme. I have indicated at least one change that I approve of. But if we could actually have that extra funding continuing, in the way we had made a commitment to the scheme,
         <break page="2414" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          and if those extra small businesses were able to take advantage of it, then yes, I really would want to stick with the old scheme.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Fundamentally, on this side of politics we believe that creating Australian jobs is probably the most important thing that any government can do. A failure to create jobs horrifically affects Australian society. To deny the opportunity when opportunity presents itself is the worst aspect of any government, and this government is showing it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The point I wanted to make about the scheme and the comments of the member for Cowan is that over the past 10 years it has been estimated that over 500,000 jobs were created as a result of this scheme. That is a phenomenal number of jobs. You would hope that over the next 10 years you would see that increase, but we are not going to see it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Given the amount of information around, I think it would be most interesting if subsequent government speakers, or even a minister in summing up, might tell us what is the estimated impact of cutting back the scheme. The member for Cowan was very proud of the savings and the fact that it is being slashed and hacked and you will get all the money over four years. That is fair enough; that is on the public record. But could the minister give the House and the Australian people an idea of how many Australian jobs will be lost as a result of this cutback? What will it cost in the first 12 months of operation? What will it cost over four years? What is the value of the exports that we will not achieve because of this cutback?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think the opposition is entitled to have that information. Certainly the minister has the benefit of a whole department to rely upon to assist him to make these calculations. If they are in an ungenerous mood, if they do not have the spirit or feeling for the proper processes of this chamber, I think the Australian people are entitled to that information. I will be looking forward to that summing up and our being given those figures.

          mineral production. I never deprecate those who are involved in primary production. Under Labor we have understood how dramatically important it is to get some value adding out of that.

         I note that in the government's trade outcomes and  objectives statement, they are making it very clear that they are going to continue to look at value adding in primary production and look to value adding in the minerals area. I welcome that. I do not want to knock that. All I am trying to say is that primary production exports have been falling as a percentage of our total exports. They have gone from something like 53 per cent of exports to 38 per cent.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The real dramatic increases have come from manufacturing in elaborately transformed manufactures. They have grown by 17 per cent, whereas the primary production exports have only increased by five per cent. I am not saying that that is of no value—I think it is critically important that we look at value adding in terms of primary production—but we must continue to see that growth in manufactured exports and service exports.

         This bill that is being debated in this House today is not going to do its job. It is going to make sure—I have given the figures—that 30,000 Australian small business companies are not going to be eligible. If they want to get into the export market, they will not be able to because the government has put a cap on this scheme. It is not that they cannot successfully export or develop their business, but the government has put a cap on this scheme and they will not be eligible. They will not be able to do it. Over four years, 100,000 small and medium sized businesses will not be able to do it because the coalition has come in and put a cap on it.

         You often hear the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in question time saying, `I'm going to cut business welfare,' as though these schemes are something slothful, something to be ashamed of and something that not only does not assist small business but heads them in the wrong direction. Of course, that is wrong.

          It is a very neat Treasury view of the world, and consistent, I note from time to time, notwithstanding the government of the day, but it is a very wrong view. It has never been the case that Australia, whether it is in export facilitation programs or assistance programs, DIFF funding or EFIC, has had a superior or stronger system of encouraging exports over and above countries like the United States, Japan or Germany.

I think that is a great shame.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I do want to say that, when we are in opposition it does give us an opportunity to re&amp;hyphen;evaluate our approaches.

It is the case that we have an opportunity to reassess our policies and refashion them for the next century to make sure that we can give small and medium sized businesses a fair go. It is an opportunity for us to demonstrate quite clearly that we are concerned about the creation and preservation of Australian jobs, that we are not intimidated by the challenge of exporting and that we want to get more Australian companies, small and medium sized, into the exporting business.

         Last but not least, there have been a number of reviews of this EMDG scheme. The principal point about it is that it is working. Because the scheme is working, the new coalition government is prepared to break its promise to maintain the scheme. It went to the Australian people and said, `We are going to maintain the scheme,' but when it got into government it put a cap on the scheme. It capped the scheme at $150 million and pocketed almost $150 million in the first year. Over four years it is pocketing $500 million and it is handicapping small and medium sized businesses when they want to export.

         You are costing Australians jobs. You are adding to unemployment and in particular you are adding to the despair of youth unemployment. It is really hypocritical that you can have the Prime Minister open a youth suicide conference, then in economic policy you promise on the one hand that you will solve unemployment and you say on the other hand that you want more growth while at the same time you abandon schemes like DIFF and you emasculate a scheme like this.

         The export market development grants scheme was introduced back in 1974 by the then Whitlam Labor government to encourage both small and medium sized businesses to seek out export market opportunities for Australian goods and services. Some 70,000 such export market grants were awarded under the scheme between its inception in 1974 and 1991 with the average value of these grants being some $65,000. In the last financial year alone, some 3,400 grants were awarded worth a total of $211 million. This scheme under Labor was expected to grow to some $292 million by the 1998-99 financial year.

         It is important that we note that both small and medium sized businesses are the major beneficiaries of this scheme, making up approximately 70 per cent of grant recipients. The Keating Labor government had announced in 1994 the extension of the EMDG scheme for a further five years as part of its Working Nation initiatives, which would have resulted in an expected 5,000 exporters receiving grants and assistance under the scheme each year.

However, I would like to indicate briefly to the House that—and you would be well aware of this, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick—our main point of contention regarding the Howard government's new EMDG scheme is not so much the specific workings of the program but rather that we on this side of the House join with both industry and financial commentators in expressing our fears about the long&amp;hyphen;term consequences for our exporting businesses in the face of the government's funding cutbacks to export assistance measures such as the EMDG and DIFF schemes.

         Much of the debate on the worth and level of funding for the EMDG program occurred last year in the lead-up to the Howard government's first budget. It is perhaps instructive to reflect on some of the comments made at that time, given that the government, through this legislation, has fulfilled the worst fears of industry by reducing funding of this program to less than $150 million per annum.

         It has taken Australia many long painful years to build up an export culture and improve our competitiveness on world markets.

         The coalition's often repeated position on the EMDG scheme during the last election campaign was that not only would they maintain the scheme but also that they would look to expand it and improve it as well.

         I must add that the public comment of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) that `EMDG stays' will linger in the mind of the business community, I am sure, for many years.

         It is interesting that he has just flown in for this debate. If you look at some of his visits and some of the trips that he has made it seems like a collection of good shopping centres—Hong Kong, for example. He has been over to Brunei and through South America, et cetera. As I said, I really question whether he might better spend his time in reviewing this legislation and having a real input into it. It is alright for him to say, speaking about some internecine war within the government, that all meetings should occur when he is present. As indicated, the government is having increasing difficulty in actually scheduling those meetings because of this plethora of trips he is making.

        <para first-indent="16">
         This legislation, I think, shows where the real emphasis should be from this minister. Before I move on, I should note that he is probably one of the leaders in defying the April admonition from the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) that these frequent flyer points should be utilised for the purposes of reducing the government's bill for travel. As would be noted in a variety of articles, he has defied that and basically said that the Minister for Administrative Services can go jump. There is a real question as to where his emphasis has been.

That is the contribution and we see here today that it is out the door in a very real sense. That
         <break page="2420" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         For all the qualifications at the edges, for all the rhetoric about the fact that there are going to be fewer pages in this legislation, that it is going to be simpler to read, that it is a matter of really getting rid of technicalities and making it easy for small business, the reality is that this legislation fundamentally undermines export potential in this country. It undermines the possibility of small operators actually getting into the field and it undermines job availability in this country. Essentially, it is an anti-job measure by the government.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Quite frankly, it is very interesting to note this rhetoric about the availability of these grants for small business and how they are being facilitated by these changes. If the minister were here long enough, if he cared enough about this legislation, he would actually be aware that Austrade has indicated that 70 per cent of previous recipients are in fact small to medium exporters with fewer than 25 employees. If the justification for this legislation is to make it more available, to make it easier for small and medium enterprise, and if that is the total, intelligent basis of this legislation—and that seems to have been the argument of those opposite—then one has to question whether that legislation has a fundamental justification.

We are saying that there is no justification if that is all that the government can put forward here today. It is already applicable, it is already available and it is already utilised by small and medium enterprise in this country.

        <para first-indent="16">
         As indicated, there has been a series of similar surrenders by ministers in this government. The international trade enhancement scheme has been successful in promoting export consciousness among small to medium sized firms—once again, small to medium sized firms—and the export to funding ratio achieved to 1994&amp;hyphen;95 was 15:1. That came under the hammer. The export access scheme providing services to about 400 new or inexperienced exporters through the chambers of commerce and industry associations, yet the budget reduced funding for that by over 20 per cent. There is the Asia&amp;hyphen;Pacific fellowship scheme which enables managers and graduate employers of Australian organisations to work and study in Asian markets. Those fellowships are for six to 12 months and once again are under very strong assault.

        <para first-indent="16">
         These schemes under assault are to a large extent directed at small to medium business and they have gone on the scrap heap. They have been thrown out. Basically, they have been condemned to oblivion and yet the rhetoric here today is, `Oh, we're not really abandoning the scheme. We're not really undermining it. We're trying to help these small operators. They can't get into the market at the moment. They can't get help.' But what we have seen is that they have simultaneously scrapped schemes that are fundamentally directed to that area. Of course, late last year we had the legendary shemozzle over the DIFF and the performance of the foreign minister when he tried to say that Asia was not concerned. We have had a series of attacks on the potential of this country and again in recent days an attack on the bounties.

         In summary, once again this is an indictment of the measure and an attack upon it. It is a view that it is a bit more than fiddling at the edges and that it is fundamentally undermining Australian companies and employment and fundamentally condemning the young people of Australia to mindless rhetoric about forced work for the dole because this government has failed to move youth unemployment from the 30 per cent level it was at when it came to government. Essentially this measure will worsen that picture.

         The Australian Business Chamber also came into the debate on 27 February. They have argued, amongst other things:

         . . . that reducing the EMDG cap to $150 million, a cut of more than 25%, cannot be rationalised, given the potential for future growth in exports of manufactured goods, especially elaborately transformed manufactures. The Chamber says while manufactured exports have increased strongly in recent years, only 13% of manufacturers are exporting in a substantial way.

         They are saying that, rather than bring in these caps and limit the classes of work that it will be available for, perhaps the government should look at making it more available to manufacturing industry and increase the number of exporters in that field. We all know that a variety of finance writers are questioning whether the manufacturing sector in this country can essentially take up the slack and are bemoaning the lack of investment and the problems it faces.

         Here we have an assault on a very necessary piece of legislation. This scheme has been in operation since the Whitlam government and it is worth noting some of the aspects that the government is now saying will no longer be financed. I noticed that an Austrade publication listed some of the items of expenditure that will not be financed, such as gifts, unsupported or estimated expenditure, promotion of X&amp;hyphen;rated films, and entertainment expenses. No&amp;hyphen;one would assert that those items should be covered by it, but what they failed to stress strongly enough was that other items under assault which companies will no longer be able to get finance for or recoup finance for are patents, labelling, unmatched eligible expenditure, foreign language training, educational courses, and tenders and quotations. This gives a greater perspective on what is happening. Export packing and labelling, free technical information, air fares after two years, tender and quotation costs, patent registration and overseas buyer visits—all these things which companies assert are all necessary, worth while and helpful will no longer be covered.

        <para first-indent="16">
         This is not just tinkering. It is a very basic, contrived and well understood attempt to reduce expenditure in this field and make it less worth while to this country simply because of the bottom line in the budget. That is what is dictating this; not any kind of analysis of what we need or how worth while it is. When we talk about how worth while the scheme is, we also know that there have been a variety of reviews of it which have said over a period of time that it is of value to this country, it is doing something worth while and it should not be scuttled in any way as this legislation intends.

It noted the multiplier effect and there are various estimates. None of them are negative. None of them have been regarded as pointless and useless.

          When putting this legislation into perspective it is worth while noting the track record of some of those members opposite. One of the provisions of this legislation is to further expand its availability to the tourist industry. I seem to recall the member for Latrobe (Mr Charles) entering this debate and being a very vociferous supporter of the expansion of these grants into the tourist industry. I for one have continually questioned the order of priorities and whether it should be expanded to single tourist operators.

           Basically, the amount of money put into the scheme has been reduced, but at the same time they are expanding its availability and the amount of money going into it into the tourist sector. Today the member for Latrobe said that essentially he wants industry to stand on its own feet and that we do not need these schemes. He has been on the House of Representatives industry, science and technology committee in the past few years and he has said at those meetings that we should expand this grant to these sectors and that it was outrageous that single tourist operators were not getting it. It is very questionable as to how many people these single tourist operators actually attract to this country. I have said previously and I will say again that I do not know many people in Seoul or Tokyo who would get on a plane because of a TV advertisement for one hotel in Sydney, because of the Hertz rent&amp;hyphen;a&amp;hyphen;car scheme or because of one other tourist provider in this country. These people had a track record when in opposition of saying that the scheme was not wide enough, available enough and needed to be expanded. Here today they are trying to defend reductions in the scheme which will essentially undermine its viability and make it less available to Australian exporters.

           There is the question of trusts and the retrospective effect of this upon people already in the scheme. Like many other opposition speakers in this debate, I say that if there is something that the government feels is essentially wrong with trusts, then it should say it up&amp;hyphen;front and do something about it in the spheres where it should be tackled. The government should not retrospectively hurt individual trusts and companies which went into this on a certain understanding, believing that they were making commitments to help this country and its exports and then slam the door on them after they have made those commitments.

           I note in passing a typical example which has been referred to me of why a company might create a trust. This company essentially created a trust not to cheat the Australian taxpayer, but because of the product liability laws in the United States and the way they

It should not try to undermine people who have made this commitment and tried to help our unemployment situation and our exports. In conclusion, I support the opposition's amendments to ensure that this cap is replaced and that this scheme, which is supported by a variety of investigations, is upheld.

          —The government's attitude to developing export industries in Australia is typified in the response I received to a question on notice I asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) on 9 September last year. I asked about the government's attitude to the forthcoming world exposition which is to take place in Lisbon, Portugal, in 1998. I asked the minister whether Australia would be represented at the next exposition. The simple one word answer was, `No.' I asked what form the representation would take. The answer was, `Not applicable.' I asked what theme would be presented by Australia at the expo and how far plans had been developed for Australia's representation. `Not applicable' was the answer.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That sums up to a tee this government's policy in respect of developing Australian industry and Australian exports—`not applicable'. There is a complete silence, a complete vacuum, on the part of this government. No more is it demonstrated than in respect of three areas—the cutting back of research and development, the cutting back of the EMDG scheme as in this legislation and the removal of bounties, which affects at least four industries.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The fact of the matter is that, in respect of the EMDG scheme, it has been small and medium businesses that have been promoted. It is universally acknowledged that, since it was introduced by the Whitlam government in the early 1970s, the scheme has promoted an export culture. There is no doubt that it has had substantial successes.

         All major reviews and reports over the last four years have praised the scheme and its accountability. Indeed, they have shown that there is no more than a one per cent rate of fraud or inappropriate claims in the scheme, and that is quite an exceptional effort by those administering it. We in the opposition favour any steps which would remove any abuse whatsoever, but the reality is that the scheme is benefiting genuine and committed exporters—genuine and committed exporters who are doing a great service not only for themselves but also for Australia.

         In 1994 Professor Ron Bewley of the University of New South Wales indicated that the return was between $15 and $25 for every dollar spent on the EMDG scheme. The government's own papers show that return to be about 33:1 in the present day and age. So the scheme, by any measure and by any objective analysis, has been highly successful.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The scheme is also not nearly as expensive as the government would have us believe. As a result of the profits which come into businesses and which, in turn, are taxed and as a result of the salaries which are paid to workers producing goods sold overseas, the government gets about a 42 per cent return on any of the funds it pays out. So, all around, it has been a win&amp;hyphen;win situation.

That is short-sighted in the extreme because, at the present time, there is a negative growth in the contribution of exports to our gross domestic product. In other words, this government has picked the very wrong time to cut back on the scheme. It is a time when it is vitally needed—it is vitally required.

They are well and truly sitting in the grandstand. It will not be very long before our Australian exporting industries take up the issue and when they look around they will see that the government is nowhere to be found. It will not take long before they realise that fact and it will not be long before they withdraw their support from the government.

         The member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) has had the opportunity to look at this and, of course, has moved a second reading amendment on behalf of the opposition. The government has gutted the export marketing development legislation. During last year's budget it announced what it was going to do and now, of course, these latest moves are entrenching it in legislation. However, surely the reasons for doing this are not only fiscal. Let us consider what is really happening. The measures include slashing more than $425 million over four years and include the capping of the scheme at $150 million per annum, including the cost of the administration.

         Of course, when you look at that article and reflect back on what is actually happening, this government's actions have been a major blow to the economy and the opportunity for employment to keep growing. It certainly is not taking a lot of the good things put into place by Labor. It is taking them and it is trashing them. It is just throwing them out without really giving the proper consideration it should. I do not believe that Labor got everything right but it certainly got a lot right and the economy growth is proof to that.

         on 18 March 1997, and journalist Stan Beer says that senior Austrade officials at CeBIT 97 have warned that Australia's IT—information technology—export drive, could be sabotaged unless the federal government allocates more resources to promoting local technology. He says that, while the United States and Canada continue to expand their profiles at the world's largest information technology trade fair, a 30 per cent reduction in Austrade's already tight CeBIT 97 budget has forced it to significantly diminish our presence this year.

          I would think that would have to be looked on by most people in Australia as being a damn silly thing to be doing. Information technology is very important in the world and it is very important to Australia. It is very important that we have some growth in that area and that we maintain our position and keep up wherever we can. Here the cuts of this government are having a direct effect on our opportunities in world trade. Austrade has less resources to attract visitors to the Australian IT displays because there has been such a severe cutback in its marketing activities. It is a terrible thing that this government is doing. Australia is going back; it is being a backwater. Industry cannot take on the battle alone. Governments have a role to play.

          The federal Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) is wiping his hands of assisting industry when he said that we expect companies to mature at some stage and go out on their own, and that we have a large debt to get under control. The Minister said that in the

That stage, I would say to the minister, is not now, not when those companies have not reached their markets but are still gathering their markets, when they have not reached their targets. When they have an opportunity is when they are moving into their next expansion, not when they are struggling to capture a part of the highly competitive marketplace. We need to be smarter and more inventive to keep going in the export field. We need to keep an eye on what other countries are doing and making sure they are not putting us at an unfair disadvantage by holding on to some tariffs. The government needs to play its proper role as a facilitator and as a driver of economic direction.

First, Australia is in a very competitive circumstance there with many other trading nations pushing their exports of goods and services in the growing markets in the Middle East. Secondly, there was the very sad occurrence of the shooting of seven schoolchildren last Thursday. The update and advice in respect of that came in during the meeting I had with Prime Minister Netanyahu. This allowed me to immediately express, on behalf of the Australian government and the Australian people, our condemnation of terrorism in respect of this further atrocity taking place in the Middle East and to give our condolences.

         I want to realistically assess these visits. They take a lot of resource from Austrade and from Foreign Affairs and Trade in respect of very busy schedule commitments, but this is one region where a ministerial visit can have a good impact in particular. More particularly, it is one area where we are in fierce competition with a number of European nations and other competitive traders; that is why it was important to go. I am delighted that, as a consequence, there will be more jobs here in Australia flowing from increased trade with the Middle East.

         I am advised by some people who have worked in the field over a long period of time that there is an awareness that some folk are manipulating the system by applying for protection from countries where one would not normally expect applications to be generated.

         Let me say from the outset that I would expect any officer of my department, or any member of the Refugee Review Tribunal, to grant refugee status to a person who has met the internationally accepted definition of `refugee'. That is our obligation and it is one that we accept. However, the government's determination to address the problem of abuse is not code for denying protection to genuine refugees. Unfortunately, we seem to be confronted with a prevalence of abuse which delays assessment and is disadvantaging bona fide refugees.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The abuse of the system is costing the taxpayer millions of dollars and is undermining public confidence. The fact is that people who enter Australia, say, as a tourist, can apply for a protection visa, and the fee for that is $30. On that application, they are given work rights and access to Medicare while they are awaiting a decision. However, there are some applying to my department who are not seeking protection but who simply come in and ask for the $30 work visa. These people are seeking only to access work rights and Medicare, and they are not bona fide. There are unscrupulous promoters, who I am told can charge as much as $8,000 for generating applications and advising people how to use each stage of the process to advantage. The applicants seek to delay their departure as long as possible, knowing full well that they are not refugees.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We saw this year a 20 per cent increase in the number of applications for asylum. In the last budget, we allocated additional resources to speed up the process to ensure genuine applicants are considered but non&amp;hyphen;genuine applicants are removed. The Refugee Review Tribunal is at the moment providing priority

The clear message will be that abuse of the system will not be allowed to continue.

          —Makin. Any other questions? They are very pleased about their housing affordability. Housing affordability in Australia now is at its best since December 1984—at its best since they started taking records. That is, of course, because the standard variable interest rate in Australia has fallen by three per cent since this government came to office. Nothing makes the members of the coalition feel better about the benefits they have been able to deliver to middle income earners in Australia than the delivery of lower interest rates—for a person on a standard mortgage, a saving of over $200 a month after tax. That is the consequence of a responsible economic policy. These are the benefits of putting behind us the Labor Party failure of deficit and debt and high interest rates which had locked Australia in a vice throughout the late 1980s and into the 1990s.

         Total dwelling investment rose three per cent in the December quarter, driven by strong growth in both alterations and additions and new dwelling investments.

The reality in Australia today is that health is provided, to the sum of $20 billion, through the federal budget. The combined impact of the state budgets is about another $20 billion and approximately $5 billion is contributed through the Medicare health levy.

         This gives me a great opportunity in fact to highlight some of the characteristics of the child-care sector under the mismanagement of Labor when they were in government. Child care under the previous government was characterised by an oversupply in many areas, an undersupply in others, a general lack of information to parents in the community about where their best options were located and in fact a lack of information to people out there who were trying to provide the child-care facilities for the community. So families' needs were not always met under the Labor Party's policies when they were in government—far from it.

That is a specific set of questions; it is not a general ambit claim for a discussion on child care. The minister ought to answer the questions, as her colleague minister did when these sorts of points were put to him on television over the weekend.

He has been a leader in this field over the last few months in bringing forward the interests and views of his own constituency, many of whom are employed by Australian National Rail and are somewhat in discord with some of the things that the Labor Party are saying now that they are in opposition.

         Late last year, at the end of November, the government announced the rail reform package that we had been working on for several months since coming into office. That rail reform package was designed to overcome the 13 years of neglect, mismanagement and failed policies of the former Labor government, which saw rail lines closed, thousands of jobs lost at AN and of course a huge blow&amp;hyphen;out in the debt that AN suffered and in its losses on an operational basis.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Because of those losses and those debts, this government has taken action. Today the Minister for Finance has advertised in papers right around Australia, calling for expressions of interest in all or part of AN and its business enterprises. This, I am pleased to report, is a welcome event because AN has been
         <break page="2435" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          losing a considerable amount of money. On average, over the last few months AN has had to be topped up by the government with about $10 million in extra cash in order to keep it operating. In fact, over the last few months some $90 million has been given to AN to keep it going.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is considerable interest from the private sector in buying all or part of AN and its business enterprises. A very pleasing degree of interest has come forward in the period prior to the official calling of expressions of interest.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This reform package will bring enormous benefit, enormous gains, to places like South Australia and Tasmania. The reason this will happen is that, as a result of this government's commitment to rail reform, AN will be completely freed of all its debt. When I first spoke to union representatives representing AN workers last year, one of the things they said that had to be done in order to get AN back in business properly was to free it of all its debts—and that is precisely what this government is doing in its rail reform initiatives that we announced late last year.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         With that will come new opportunities for this business. The new owners of this business will bring fresh capital investment, new management expertise and a commitment to grow the business of rail in Australia. That is exactly what this government wants. We believe that, as a result of this, South Australia and Tasmania will see, over time, a growth in the number of people employed in rail businesses in those two states. Considerable economic advantage will come to those states as rail becomes a more efficient service provider to the transport industry.

         We can compare this new future, giving rail a real chance of growth, with the future that was provided by the former Labor government, which saw rail declining over the years under their mismanagement, which saw all of those lines being closed down and which saw thousands of jobs lost under Labor's mismanagement of AN and its business enterprises.

          —Yes. Well, there are some issues here that are important and I thank the member for raising them. He is the member for Wannon but he did indicate that he is asking about the shire of Corangamite. That is not his seat; that is the other member's seat. You look after more than a shire, don't you, Stewart? The first thing to be said is that this government has provided in this financial year $1.2 billion to local councils. That amount of money was an increase of four per cent on the previous financial year, which is obviously extremely generous and which local government have welcomed. But in that $1.2 billion there is an amount of $372 million which is notionally accorded as being for nominated local roads.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That money goes to councils. It is in an untied fashion so that councils that receive this money can spend it on roads, bridges or other matters as they please—but it is untied. In addition, they are receiving some $36 million through the black spots program administered by my colleague the Minister for Transport and Regional Development.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If you have a look at the state of Victoria, there is some $285 million in federal government funding through this process, the financial assistance grants, of which $77 million goes to identified local roads plus $8.2 million of the black spots funding. If you take into account the national funding that comes from Minister Sharp's area for roads and state roads, there is another $200 million as well. A significant amount goes to roads in Victoria.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If the member for Wannon has a look at his own electorate, it is estimated that somewhere
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          in the vicinity of $28 million goes to that electorate for funding under the federal grants system and $11 million of that goes to identified local roads.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The point for the shire of Corangamite is this: they receive about $3.4 million which they can choose to spend on what they want. So my argument to them is that they receive very significant amounts of funds in an untied form that they can apply to roads as they see appropriate. I am surprised to hear that they are now ripping up roads.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other important point is the question of employment. It is estimated by the Bureau of Transport Economics that there are 17 direct and indirect jobs created by every million dollars that is spent on road creation—that is, some 1,300 jobs in Victoria. That equates to 470 jobs in Wannon. Right across Australia there are some 6,000-odd jobs created by these funds being expended on roads.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In answer to the member's question about the shire that has made the complaint, I am surprised that they are making the complaint. They are generously treated. They are given funds that they can use at their own discretion to address the needs in their own particular area.

The other thing that ought to be noted is that slap&amp;hyphen;sided generic advertising—`Go and spend $25 million a year in Japan no matter what' sort of approach—is being phased out for a more sensible approach, a branded sort of approach, which I think is very much the way of the future.

         His second major concern is that producers and processors ought to be separated. This is interesting on two counts. The first is that, when I met with him in Brisbane a few weeks ago, he wanted them separated. The second is that I have not allowed them to be separated—and will not allow them to be separated. They will be kept together under a memorandum of understanding.

         Under this government's, I think, very fair approach to the imposition of levies, we make it plain that if an industry wants to go it on a voluntary basis that is their right. And if in this case, as they have said, they want to do it voluntarily, that is fine, we will give them a run. But they have agreed with me that, if there is clear market failure, we can put the levy back on. That is the best possible outcome under the circumstances. I believe that it will work very well. The meat processors have made it absolutely plain to me that they understand the need to work cooperatively, hand in hand, in a determined way with the rest of the industry to advance the interests of this great industry, both domestically and internationally.

          All I can say is that those who yesterday—perhaps rather too quickly—made a couple of comments about the package could perhaps learn from the example of the others. They had a good calm look at it, recognised that it is enormous change and that it really does empower the industry to take control of their own destiny. As has been so widely acknowledged today, it is excellent policy. It is hardly insignificant. The three statutory authorities will go and there will be a new producer organisation. It is very much, in my view, the way to go, and I believe that industry are rapidly drawing that same conclusion.

In fact, it was said that Australia Post's response to its concerns was `so out of proportion, ill-founded, unjust and illogical that, by independent objective standards, it was tantamount to capriciousness and spitefulness'.

         It is also timely to note that Quentin Cook has been having a running battle with the factional allies and mates of those on the other side within certain elements of the trade union movement. It was Quentin Cook who was able to expose the rorts in certain union elections. Members might remember the spectre of the four trade unionists sitting around the kitchen table, filling out the ballot papers to get their mates back—who just happened to be mates of certain people on the other side. Members won't forget that, as Quentin Cook was raising his concerns, there was nothing but silence from the member for Dobell, the member for Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith and the member for Denison. They turned a blind eye. Why would they turn a blind eye?

          The fact of the matter is that this bloke has had a very rough time. The other side turned a blind eye to it. He has taken the avenues available to him for reasonable redress. He has had a win here. He has now said that he is going to set up an enterprise union. The good news is that, since the Workplace Relations Act was established, if you can get 50 people to band together to set up a responsible union then you are able to do so subject to the provisions of the act. We welcome responsible unionism, and we say to Quentin Cook, `We reckon there are another 49 who will join you and will put up and provide reasonable services to members in the communications industry.'

A personal explanation does not take up much time of the House, and that is when he should do it. Mr Speaker, you need to be aware here that you are creating, if you permit this process, a definite precedent. This has not happened before.

I have indicated before in the House, but the question asked by the member for Hotham allows me to indicate it again, that the government will take a decision on the recommendations of the Productivity Commission relating to the Australian motor vehicle industry. When that report has been received that decision will be taken in the light of our assessment of the Australian national interest and will also be taken against the background of our commitment to maintain in this country a strong motor manufacturing industry.

The survey by KPMG for the Australian Institute of Company Directors is yet more good news of the uplift in the economy, particularly relating to the small business sector. From large business and small business the interesting thing to come from the survey was that, of those covered, 67 per cent expect an improvement in the next 12 months in the outlook of the Australian economy; 56 per cent expect sales to increase; and 53 per cent expect an increase in profits.

         This survey comes on top of the ACCI survey, which also indicated that there is a strong uplift in business confidence, particularly during 1996.

          , of proposals that have been floated by the government which would see Holsworthy as the site for Sydney's second airport and, as part of the package, what we would see is the movement of the Lucas Heights nuclear plant from its present location to Jervis Bay. Some members of the government, including the local member, have been at pains to point out that this is not correct, but I want to outline exactly what is on the government's agenda and what the community should know about this very important matter.

        <para first-indent="16">
         What we had was a report given to this journalist which very clearly indicates that the government has been considering the Lucas Heights matter. Despite the fact that we have been reassured in this parliament that no decisions had been made, we know that an interdepartmental committee has actually been examining precisely that question. It has been asked whether we should simply refurbish the present facility or whether there should be a replacement.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Our very clear understanding is that that IDC has made recommendations to the government and that there is now a cabinet submission which exactly addresses that point. In fact, we understand the federal government will soon consider a submission that recommends that the 38-year-old reactor at Lucas Heights, bordering the Holsworthy site in southern Sydney, be shut because of safety fears and that an alternative facility be built. That, as far as we know it, is what is going on within government. Does the wider community know about this? Have they been taken into the government's confidence? No, they have not. There has been no discussion of this.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We also learn that not only has the discussion about the future of Lucas Heights been going on within government through an interdepartmental committee in the preparation of cabinet's submission but also there has been action by one of the ministers—the
         <break page="2446" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp). The minister for transport and members of his staff have been pressing that Holsworthy should be excluded and that the facility at Lucas Heights should be abandoned, whether it is a replacement or a refurbishment. He apparently has some other plans. What we need to know from this government is what those plans are, because there is a very real suggestion that the plans are to relocate the Lucas Heights facility and to build a new facility and waste reprocessing plant at Jervis Bay.

         At the time this story came out, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) avoided the question. He did not say this is not on. It was very interesting. He avoided answering the question that was put to him by a journalist. He had one of his staff, a spokeswoman, answer it. When it was put to him that there was a proposal to move the Lucas Heights facility to Jervis Bay, the spokeswoman said, `It is not, and never has been, considered by the government.' That seems clear enough. But why use a spokeswoman? Where is the minister? Why isn't the minister saying this?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Very interestingly, and that was reported to a journalist in the

          Sydney Morning Herald
         </emphasis>
         , a little further down the track, and I do not know whether it was before or after that statement, presumably the same spokeswoman—she was certainly identified as Mr McGauran's spokeswoman—said, and this is a very interesting quote, `The minister was unaware of any official documents and, if they do exist, they have no official status.' So he does not know about any official documents. But, if they do exist, they have no official status, which is a bit of a move from the earlier position that, `It is not, and never has been, considered by the government.' So the minister is inferring that maybe there are some documents around that refer to this possibility, but he is not giving them official status. Interestingly, the minister is not speaking either.

         A similar report was clearly given to the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

         I want to outline—before I go on to the particular source of this material and the argument that is being put within government about the Jervis Bay location—why it is that this should simply not be considered, that Jervis Bay should be ruled out right from the outset and that there should not be any pussyfooting about the status of this area. I know the local member would want to see that happen; I know the member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel) would want to see that happen; and I know that we on this side would want to see that happen. It is most important that this be ruled out altogether and that there are no sneaky discussions going on within government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think members need to be reminded about Jervis Bay. It is a unique part of our wonderful coastline. It is of international significance. It is a key habitat for international migratory birds. It is already recognised for its outstanding diversity of both the terrestrial and marine environments, and many species in this area are at the limits of their biogeographical range. There are extensive species rich heathlands, and there is a very high concentration of rare and threatened plant and animal species.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Jervis Bay is now on the Register of the National Estate and is a terrestrial breeding colony of little penguins—at least on Bowen Island. There is a population of bottlenose dolphins which reside in the bay. The area contains a coastal dune system; a diversity of associated aquatic habitats and wetlands; extensive and diverse saltmarshes; and seagrasses, including the largest Posidonia meadows in New South Wales. So this is an area not to be messed with. It is certainly not an area in which to put a nuclear facility, waste reprocessing plant or a harbour.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I am sure that many will be aware of the fact that there were proposals at one stage to locate an armaments depot and to relocate the fleet from Sydney into this area. The former government made a very clear commitment that they would not be used for either of those
         <break page="2447" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          purposes. They also made a very clear commitment that it would not be used for a nuclear facility, as was originally proposed by a conservative government. It sat there for a long time as a possibility, worrying local residents. There was an environmental assessment process undertaken in relation to the fleet, which meant that both the nuclear option and the fleet option were stopped, that people could at last feel some comfort. What do we see now? The spectre is again being raised that this may well end up being a nuclear facility.

         Mr Deputy Speaker, you might say that the government would not possibly contemplate such a move. But the minister here and the minister for transport have very clearly played around with a nuclear option over the years. This is a minister who has, from time to time, advocated that Australia become a nuclear power. I am sure the Minister for Science and Technology, at the table, will agree that he has. Not only has the minister been fooling around with the possibility of reprocessing nuclear wastes but also when he was in opposition he recommended that Australia become a nuclear power—that we actually have facilities here for the nuclear generation of electricity.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So this is a minister who thinks there are no problems with the disposal of wastes, and he has said so very publicly on a number of occasions. In 1989 he argued that Australia establish a nuclear industry. In the coalition's 1993 energy policy, the coalition actually committed itself to removing:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . Federal Legislation and policies that preclude any particular type of generation from being considered and assessed in a fair and balanced way with other generation methods. The Federal Government would not, therefore, oppose the development of nuclear fuel cycle in Australia.

        <para style="Para">
         This minister has a record on this point. Now, almost 10 years after a Labor government clearly ruled out a nuclear future for Jervis Bay, it is back on the agenda. You would have to ask why they find Jervis Bay so appealing. It is because right now it allows the minister for transport—

          The same minister misled this parliament about the safety of the 1,600 spent fuel rods when he was talking about the need to keep open the reprocessing option, the need to keep open the possibility of importing nuclear waste from other countries. In a matter of public importance, the minister said about the nuclear fuel rods:

           Sydney Morning Herald
          </emphasis>
          , the latest report from ANSTO, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, affirms that the rods are `in very good condition'. Yet the minister says they are corroding—present tense. ANSTO went on to say:

          Why then did the minister mislead this parliament? How did he correct it? He left it to a spokesperson to correct the record. The spokesperson admitted, `It would be wrong to say they are corroding at this point.' But the minister has not actually corrected the record in this place.

          I want to raise not only the values associated with Jervis Bay but the source of this information that is supposed to have some status. They do not know if there is an official document and, if there is, they do not know what status it has. I will tell you what status it has, Minister. It is a memo to you, and I quote from it:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          I met with Lachlan McComish, Adviser, Land, Transport, Rail to John Sharp, last Tuesday. We discussed the location of the HIFAR reactor at
          <break page="2448" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           Lucas Heights in relation to the proposal to locate Sydney's new airport at Holsworthy. Lachlan made it clear that Badgerys Creek was dead as a viable option for the airport, mainly due to the build&amp;hyphen;up of residential housing in the area since the site was first proposed. He believes that Holsworthy will be selected as the preferred site subject to a satisfactory outcome of the EIS.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          This memorandum does not come from way outside government; this is a senior government adviser. That is why the minister said he does not know if it exists and, if it does, it does not have official status. It is a memorandum to him, and he has seen it and read it. He knows it exists. So he needs to correct what his spokeswoman said during the week. Lachlan McComish, the adviser to John Sharp, said Holsworthy is the option, Badgerys Creek is dead. That creates a problem for this minister: what do you do with Lucas Heights? The memo goes on to say:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          The location of a new airport at Holsworthy would make it impossible for the HIFAR reactor to remain in operation at Lucas Heights or for a possible replacement reactor to be built there.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          He has had a senior minister take away the place where he wants to build a reactor. That, by the way, is the recommendation of the interdepartmental committee. They say, `Yes, you do have to build a new reactor, it is necessary for Australia, and it should be in the general Lucas Heights area'—the Holsworthy area, according to ANSTO.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          They have got a problem. Minister Sharp does not want it there; he wants it somewhere else. One of the helpful people suggested, `Well, you've already got a facility located, in some people's minds, at Jervis Bay. Let's put it there. That is where it was originally scheduled to go. Let's return to that option.' It may be, as the minister says, that he is not promoting that option, but as sure as any argument can be mounted there are people in government who are promoting that option. They reckon you can sell off the land at the current Badgerys Creek site to purchase the necessary additional land for the Lucas Heights reactor, wherever it might go, and pay for its establishment. That information is all contained in this memo. It goes on to say:

          In other words, he goes on to argue you cannot simply refurbish it—and there are a whole range of reasons given for that—and clearly that is the view of the IDC. If you look at the respective costs of refurbishment versus replacement, there is not really all that much difference. He talks about some of the technical problems associated with each of the options. He goes on to conclude—we understand this is now contained in a cabinet minute—as the IDC did:

It is bad enough that there is all that unexploded ordnance there but now they want to have a brand&amp;hyphen;new nuclear reactor, complete with a reprocessing facility, an expanded facility, not only in the middle of an electorate—I am sure the local member would not want to see it located there—but right smack bang next to a brand&amp;hyphen;new second Sydney airport.

The Jervis Bay option in that memo is but one or two sentences—no supporting documents, no arguments; just plucked out of thin air. Suddenly this memo that finds its way into the public domain is taken as government views. Somebody sits down at a typewriter, types in a sentence, `Maybe you should think about shifting the plant to Jervis Bay,' and suddenly that is government policy. There is no plural in this. There is one document, one paragraph, and suddenly that is ascribed to the government as its view.

In any case, it is not environmentally responsible to store research reactor spent fuels indefinitely because their aluminium cladding may corrode over time, resulting in increased risk of radioactive release and environmental contamination.

Five hundred thousand people in the south-west of Sydney would give him this answer: because of the government's deceitful and disgraceful handling of the Holsworthy airport issue.

         I know there are divisions in the National Party about leadership, present and future, but I did not really expect the member for Gippsland to so thoroughly drop his colleague the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the member for Hume (Mr Sharp), right in it. This is what the minister for transport told this House on 21 May 1996—it was the day he announced the new EIS process for Sydney's second international airport:

          written in June 1996. That is just a few weeks after the minister for transport tells this House that Badgerys Creek is his first option. We have a senior adviser to the minister for transport telling staff of the science minister, `Lachlan made it clear that Badgerys Creek was dead as a viable option for the airport.' That is Lachlan McComish, adviser, land transport rail to John Sharp in June 1996.

         If these words passed on to the science minister are true, the minister for transport has misled this House. He has misled this House by telling the House on 21 May 1996 that his first priority was Badgerys Creek. Here is his senior adviser on land transport, Mr McComish, telling other government staffers just a few weeks later, according to the science minister, that Badgerys Creek is dead. What a disgrace; what deceit; what misleading of the people of Sydney over a key lifestyle and economic issue like Sydney's second international airport.

         That is a disgusting episode in this government's history—to think that the minister is telling the House on 21 May that his first priority is Badgerys Creek; meanwhile, in the back corridors of Parliament House, around the ministerial wing of this place, senior advisers to the minister for transport are telling other government staffers that Badgerys Creek is dead. They are telling other staff that their minister has misled this House. He is an absolute disgrace. He not only misled people in the lead-up to the election campaign about his intentions with Holsworthy but also misled the members of this place when he told them that Badgerys Creek was his first priority. The truth is that he has only ever had one priority—one priority alone—and that is to build his airport at Holsworthy.

         But there is not only that—not only the misleading of people in the lead-up to the election; not only the misleading of the parliament on the announcement of the new EIS process—he then tries to treat the people of south-west Sydney as mugs. For him it is all a Monopoly game where he is playing with the pieces. He is playing around the board with the minister for science. He says, `I'll swap you a nuclear reactor at Lucas

What is their role in this Monopoly game at the expense of people in south-west Sydney? They are sitting at the board picking up the Chance cards. They got the one that said, `Go to gaol; do not pass go; do not represent your electorate.' That is their sole role in this tawdry affair within the Howard government.

         The member for Hughes was not even told about the EIS to be announced on 21 May. It was all news to her, not representing her electorate. I would bet my bottom dollar—not Monopoly money but real money—that the member for Gilmore was not told about this memo written in June 1996 foreshadowing the location of the new nuclear plant and facility at Jervis Bay in her electorate. There is something very interesting for the member for Gilmore. If you look at this document, you will see one page full of analysis, full of the things that you would have to be worried about, full of the things that are of concern, full of the political implications the government needs to consider. It goes on for hundreds and hundreds of words, but not once is there a reference to the member for Gilmore.

She is as forgotten as the member for Hughes was on the issue of international airports.

          in Hughes and Gilmore are getting zero representation in this place. For them, they are just the pieces on the Monopoly board—`Trade away the nuclear reactor for the international airport. Put the nuclear reactor down to Jervis Bay.'

What is the point in the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) pretending in the Senate that he has some regard for the environmental and planning laws of the Commonwealth if staffers and ministers were telling each other in June 1996 that the process is a sham because Badgerys Creek is dead?

How can the Prime Minister talk about honesty and integrity when, as has been revealed today by the science minister, in June 1996 Badgerys Creek was dead in the water and the government never had any intention whatsoever of giving it proper consideration in the EIS process? How can the Prime Minister talk about family values? It is all right for the Howard family.

The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) talks about the enormous waste of time in this debate. Clearly he is right and clearly his government is equally guilty of that. The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) talks about the arrogance of lack of consultation with the people. He is right and of course his party is equally guilty of that.

         I want to read a little history about this nuclear debate in Australia. Up until 1976, it was the policy of the Labor Party to mine, process and reprocess uranium. I know because I, foolishly at the time, was one of the people involved in changing that policy. I was in the Labor Party then when many on the front bench were not. Having achieved that change, I realised that Australia was irrelevant in the wider game and we had to stop nuclear energy in France if we were going to be successful.

         So I set off to France at my own expense and campaigned across France, standing up in picture theatres lecturing the crowds with my wife translating. I took the opportunity to look at the industry in both France and Britain and I realised that I was talking nonsense. I came back to Australia convinced that the nuclear industry was safe, it was environmentally friendly and it is was an industry which we should be looking at very seriously.

Malcolm Fraser had the ability and the opportunity to change the Labor Party's stupid two&amp;hyphen;mine policy. And did he do it? The answer is no, he did not.

         I was one of the people involved very heavily in lobbying for a three-mine policy. It was my view that, if we could get three mines up, the third mine being Roxby Downs, so ridiculous would the uranium policy be shown to be that the parliament would have to rescind it. Here we were saying that we were going to have three mines, with the capacity of the third mine, Roxby Downs, being larger than any other capacity in the rest of Australia and representing a substantial part of the world's capacity. It was an enormous addition to our capacity.

         But the industry does not buy on capacity; it buys on security.

Graham Richardson, I must say, did not get much right, and I think some of his judgments were very awry. However, I would say that his judgment was consistently better than Keating's, and he was right on uranium.

          The truth is that no party in this place can hold its head up on this issue. What did we see in respect of the French nuclear testing on Mururoa Atoll? We saw John Howard set off across this country a wave of revulsion against the French—mainly, again, on the east coast. But it was a wave of revulsion that John Howard knew had no basis in fact. He knew there was not one scintilla of evidence to show any threat to Australia from nuclear testing—not any evidence at all. Of course, there is no threat to Australia from French nuclear testing.

It was a political stunt. It was a stunt to try to raise the stature of the Liberal Party, just as John Howard's performance on guns was an attempt to raise the stature of John Howard.

I think the titanium oxide conversion, rather than the silicone conversion, will bestow great benefits on us and be seen as a source of real power for the community.

          Australia, which, under this government and the previous government, has continued to put itself in the hands of foreign treaties and foreign domination, is now being berated over greenhouse output. Mr Deputy Speaker, let me tell you and the people of Australia: there is no evidence for the greenhouse theory. We know that in times past—and I am talking about millennia past, thousands and thousands of years ago—the greenhouse levels were higher than they are now. I think it is a measure of man's arrogance that they think that man's puny efforts are going to cause the trauma that is being suggested. Every time a volcano explodes it probably does more than the combined effort of man since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.

          —The honourable member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash) said last night in response to this debate that members of her electorate are concerned about the prospect raised in relation to a nuclear reprocessing facility at Jervis Bay.

         If the member for Gilmore had bothered to listen to the opposition spokesperson for the environment, she would have learned the source of the rumour. It is actually from the government.

         The removal of the dangerous Lucas Heights reactor to a more suitable location would be welcomed by the Sutherland Shire. It may partly negate the negative impact of this new airport.

         Since it was announced, the government has received strong public support for the work for the dole initiative.

         The value of the work for the dole initiative lies in bringing young unemployed people back into a work culture to help rebuild a work ethic. It will give young people a chance to engage with the community rather than being alienated from it.

          This bill would provide for the changes necessary to implement the government's work for the dole initiative in a way which is consistent with feedback the government has had from the community. At the same time the initiative is based firmly on the principle of mutual obligation: that it is fair and just that people receiving unemployment allowances be asked to make a contribution to their community in return.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The government recognises that the work for the dole initiative is not a solution to youth unemployment and has not represented it as such. Real jobs can only be created by the government providing a business environment that secures our economic future. The government's strong but fair budget has put downward pressure on interest rates. Policies for small business will reduce the paperwork burden on businesses, and capital gains tax relief on the sale of businesses provides an incentive to small business owners to expand their businesses.

          The abolition of the previous government's unfair dismissal laws has removed a significant disincentive for businesses to take on new employees and it will encourage more productive labour relations.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The government recognises that the particular disadvantages young people face in getting jobs are structural—the low skilled jobs that young people used to take on leaving school have gradually disappeared and those jobs that remain are increasingly being taken by older and more experienced job seekers. Fundamental reforms are necessary to deal with this to make sure that young people are better prepared when they enter the labour market. We need to strengthen the relationship between schools and the workplace to provide young people with the means to overcome these disadvantages.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          A number of recent government initiatives are already addressing these fundamental issues. These include the new national apprenticeship and traineeship system, our numeracy and literacy strategy to ensure that students acquire appropriate standards of competence in these areas and the introduction of incentives to complete vocational education courses through the jobs pathway program, which
          <break page="2460" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

          The introduction of pilot work for the dole projects should also be seen in the broader context of the government's commitments to young Australians through the government's reforms to employment services, legislation for which is also currently before the parliament. Complementary strategies are also being put in place to address other important youth issues such as family breakdown, youth suicide and homelessness.

          The government considers the work for the dole initiative will combat the drift to despair and despondency felt by many unemployed young people.

            The government is targeting regional Australia in the pilot stage for many reasons, not the least of which is because our rural communities perhaps best illustrate the disastrous results of thirteen years of Labor's economic mismanagement. All communities have witnessed the fabric of our Australian society unravel under Labor. Initiatives such as `work for the dole' are important steps towards repairing the damage of the previous government.

          Having said that, may I turn now to

          </emphasis>
          . Three public hearings were held in order to take evidence on the 14 reports selected by the JCPA for closer scrutiny. Among the reports listed is
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Audit Report No. 28 1995&amp;hyphen;96: Jindalee operational radar network project: Department of Defence
          </emphasis>
          . After considering the evidence taken in relation to audit report No. 28 on the JORN project, the JCPA decided that the issues canvassed in the audit report warranted further examinations as part of a full and separate inquiry. The inquiry is currently still under way and will be reported separately, probably in the 1997 autumn sittings.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In regard to the remaining audit reports, further examination of the issues involved resulted in six recommendations contained in report No. 349. I would draw particular attention to recommendation 1, in which the JCPA seeks amendments to the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Cabinet Handbook
          </emphasis>
          so that any potential liabilities to which the Commonwealth may be exposed as a result of action being recommended in a cabinet submission or discussed in a cabinet memorandum are clearly identified and costed.

          This recommendation arose from the public hearing into

          , Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, when the committee discovered that the then Minister for Health had been provided with verbal briefings only prior to committing to the arrangements underpinning the sale of CSL. Consequently, the Commonwealth incurred an uncapped liability in relation to a number of potential claims.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The committee considers that it is totally unsatisfactory for departmental officials to enter into substantial agreements on behalf of the Commonwealth without written ministerial consent or approval. There needs to be an appropriate paper trail so that accountability and probity questions may be answered.

           The JCPA is pleased that recently the Department of Health and Family Services has been successfully investigating commercial insurance arrangements in relation to CSL indemnities. The committee supports such initiatives and considers that greater incentive and flexibility to consider risk retention and risk transfer in relation to the Commonwealth's exposures will result in greater accountability in public agencies.

          <para first-indent="16">
           In its third public hearing for 1995-96 audit reports, the JCPA focused on the client service programs. Announcements made in the 1996-97 budget impacted significantly on the programs and methods of service delivery, which were the subject of six audit reports being examined at that public hearing. The committee therefore decided to review the programs in light of future changes so that relevant departments and agencies take client service needs and accountability into consideration when implementing the budget changes.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           One concern which emerged during this public hearing was the difficulty experienced by ANAO officers in gaining audit access to information from third-party providers of client service programs. Although the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General Bill 1996, which is currently before the parliament, provides the Auditor-General with unfettered powers to obtain any information required to fulfil audit functions, this power would be enhanced considerably if it were specifically referred to in contracts between the Commonwealth and third-party providers.

          <para first-indent="16">
           Recommendation 6 in report No. 349 therefore urges the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs—when establishing contracts with private sector employment placement agencies—to include contract provisions which make explicit the Auditor-General's statutory authority to obtain information from third-party service providers.

The committee believes that it has played a part in ensuring that both departments are fully aware of the need to incorporate accountability requirements into the management arrangements they are drafting for the new programs. A response to this recommendation is urgent, and I would ask the government to respond positively and quickly so that these accountability measures can be put in place without delay.

           The JCPA notes the audit finding in the audit report No. 5 that AusAID's regime for the management of funding to NGOs is generally of a high standard and that aspects of the management framework are at the leading edge of international best practice. The committee is reassured by AusAID's advice that evaluation and audit activities will continue as a check on the new performance reports particularly provided by the NGOs. The JCPA awaits with interest the Simon's review of the overall priorities, objectives and focus of the Australian aid program and, in particular, the findings of the review in relation to the role of NGOs in the delivery of Australian aid.

           —by leave—Occasionally some people are tempted to regard reports of parliamentary committees as being a step removed from the main game of government. This temptation is increased when a committee reports on an examination of other reports. However, a great deal of the parliament's work is done by its committees, and the Joint Committee of Public Account's reports Nos. 349 and 350 are cases in point. They are the first arising from the committee's new public hearing based review process which provides for speedier examination of ANAO reports and subsequent report to the parliament.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Obviously, in the time allotted I cannot go through the detail of all 16 reports considered by the committee, but I would like to touch briefly on a few of the issues which indicate the importance and, I believe, the effectiveness, of the committee's review process.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Firstly, the committee's examination of the report on the Jindalee Operational Radar Network found significant but unspecified time and cost overruns, as well as continued uncertainty about final delivery. It was the public hearing process that generated a further JCPA inquiry into JORN, designed to shed
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           further light on this project. The inquiry is still on foot.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Secondly, the JCPA's examination in September of a number of reports covering client services delivered by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs brought to notice the somewhat dismissive response of DEETYA to the recommendations by the ANAO. By adopting such an approach, DEETYA ignored valid criticisms of operating procedures which, indeed, surfaced again in its own evaluation material later on. The committee's pursuit of this issue at the public hearing and the discussion of it in report No. 349 will, I believe, in future discourage any similarly dismissive responses from departments to what are carefully considered recommendations on the part of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Finally, following its examination of the report on the sale of CSL and the reports on Commonwealth guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort, the committee noted serious deficiencies in estimation of and reporting on potential Commonwealth exposures from these, and it highlighted its concerns about the management of the Commonwealth's exposure.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The inclusion of recommendation 1 in report No. 350 calling on the Department of Finance to seek up&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;date statements from all agencies with guarantees and indemnities is, I believe, further evidence of the importance of the JCPA's review of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General's reports in monitoring the activities of the executive and reporting to the parliament.

           —by leave—I rise to support the tabling of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts reports Nos. 349 and 350. Our committee chairman, the member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) has already referred to the key recommendations of report No. 349. They were echoed by the member for Kooyong ((Mr Georgiou). The key recommendation in report No. 349 calls
           <break page="2467" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            for the amendment of the Cabinet Handbook to ensure that agencies clearly identify and cost any potential liabilities when preparing costings information for cabinet submissions.

          For example, the findings of audit report No. 7, which looked at the financial management of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, had clear implications for all Commonwealth agencies. In particular, they showed the need to educate program managers in the importance of financial management in program administration. They also clearly indicated the need to develop improved financial management training. The audit also identified that the Department of Veterans' Affairs needed more user orientated financial management systems, and that barriers needed to be broken down between the corporate services and program delivery areas. This is particularly important, given that the Commonwealth is moving towards an accrual accounting environment. In such an environment, managers will be held to account more directly for the full cost of service provision, not just the cash costs.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The Joint Committee of Public Accounts commended the ANAO production of a profile of best practice financial management objectives and practices in its report No. 7, 1995&amp;hyphen;96. The committee recommended that such advice and guidance should be promulgated widely.

         <para first-indent="16">
          In reviewing audit report No. 19, 1995&amp;hyphen;96, which dealt with the management of small and medium&amp;hyphen;sized overseas posts, the Joint Public Accounts Committee supported the ANAO's call for cost transparency. Once again, looking at that issue was most significant. Such transparency would, we believe, enable the Commonwealth to better assess the resource impact of decisions more accurately. Such transparency depends, of course, on initially agreed costing methodology. We recommended that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, together with Austrade, the
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           ANAO and the Department of Finance, should develop such an agreed methodology.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I will turn very briefly to some of the important findings and recommendations in report No. 350. In particular, in audit report No. 6, 1996&amp;hyphen;97, we considered Commonwealth guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort. This report followed a hearing at which evidence was taken from numerous government agencies, as well as from the ANAO, on recording, management and reporting, as well as the level of risk exposure to federal government through guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort. We discovered that the government's exposure through these instruments amounts to many billions of dollars. The results of this inquiry have led to a number of very significant recommendations.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          These have already been referred to by the committee chairman and by the member for Kooyong. The committee in particular was concerned that there was no central or uniform system for registration of these indemnities in each department. Furthermore, there were clear deficiencies in the reporting of these exposures. The JCPA therefore strongly supports audit recommendations 1 and 2 which concern steps to be taken to ensure this situation is urgently addressed. I commend these reports to the House. They contain recommendations of great significance to the nation.

          I just want to make a quick comment on two issues that arose while preparing these two reports. When we reviewed the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General's reports for 1995&amp;hyphen;96, we came across a very interesting circumstance where $40 million worth of taxpayers' and levy payers' money had been lost in an abortive project called Fututech. This project was operated by the board of the MRC which, following the
          <break page="2468" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           announcement of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) yesterday, will no longer exist in that form.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The point I want to raise is that the day when public servants can come before a parliamentary committee, where they have been found wanting in their management, put their hands up, plead guilty and expect absolution should be gone. I think we are living in an age of transparency and accountability. That is what this committee of this parliament exists for, and I do not think this committee or this parliament should accept that as an excuse for some of the practices that have been undertaken.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I highlight that in this exercise, because there was $40 million—$20 million of taxpayers' funds and $20 million of levy payers' funds—lost. The funds disappeared into the sand and all we got from the representatives of the MRC was yes, they were guilty, and they expected absolution. In clause 3.39 of the report, the JCPA says:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          While the JCPA appreciates the candour of the MRC witnesses in admitting to the Board's serious errors of judgement, and recognises that the MRC seems to have learned the lessons of the failure of the project, it was, nevertheless, a $40 million failure for which the MRC Board is responsible.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          It is not acceptable for anyone to put their hand up and say, `Yes, I'm guilty,' because those public servants can walk away from that loss. It is not a loss out of their pocket. It is a loss for a lot of the hardworking taxpayers of Australia and, more importantly as far as I am concerned, a lot of the primary producers in this country that pay those levies.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Hopefully, under the new arrangements that are going to be put in place by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, that situation will not arise again, but it should be brought to the attention of this parliament that this committee is going to hold these public servants to account for the decisions that they make. No longer can they expect, as they have always done in the past, to be able to walk away from their mistakes. We will continue to hold them to account in this place.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Contained in report No. 350, which I want to mention in regard to accountability and transparency, is a report on Audit Report No.

           . As we have found in previous reports that we have done on Commonwealth agencies, this area is left wanting. If we were to ask the Department of Finance to give us a clear indication in dollar terms of the Commonwealth's exposure in this area of letters of comfort and indemnities, it could not tell us. If you went to individual agencies and asked the chief executive officer of those agencies for an indication of the Commonwealth's exposure, they could not tell us. That is not good enough in this day and age. We as members of the JCPA, and certainly all members of this parliament, should expect better from the professional managers of our departments and agencies that are operating on behalf of the taxpayers of Australia. Again, it is an area that this committee will continue to pursue until things have improved.

          Finally, in public hearings we continually get evidence from professional officers from these departments, particularly the central agencies, and when we continually ask about the progress of accrual accounting and reporting we keep getting fobbed off.

          —The Export Market Development Grants Bill 1997 represents a targeted approach to assisting Australian exporters in a fiscally responsible way and is a boost for the tourism industry, which will see full rate of EMDG for the first time. The measures introduced in this bill squarely focus the scheme on small and medium enterprises as they enter export markets. I thank all members who have participated in the debate which is moving through to the second reading amendment, which the government opposes, and the consideration in detail stage. I have taken careful note of the contributions made in the debate last night and again today.

         I advise the House that the government will further examine the issue of trusts in respect of this legislation. I am not in a position to provide a concluded view on this matter for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the Senate committee report on this legislation. The matter was the subject of deliberation before a Senate committee only last Monday and the report is not yet available, but I expect it to be available later this week. If the government's examination of trusts leads to a variation of its position—taking into account consultations with parliament as well as with export industry and the submissions which have been variously made—this would obviously obviate the need to proceed with regard to the issue of retrospectivity. In any event, on the question of retrospectivity, governments frequently—and the convention has been long established—provide announcements in the budget which are backdated to the start of the financial year. I acknowledge that a particular view has been submitted on the question of trusts by the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and other members in the debate. I give an undertaking to the House that the government will examine those issues.

         I thank the other members who participated, including the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) for his longstanding interest in the scheme, the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) with his emphasis on small business and the members for Griffith (Mr McDougall), Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) and
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          Fadden (Mr Jull) with their emphasis on the tourism industry and the big advantages contained in the bill for this industry. I have referred to the members for Curtin and Perth and I thank them for the spirit of their contribution. I note particularly their comments on trusts. The members for Blaxland (Mr Hatton), Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe), Chifley (Mr Price), Isaacs (Mr Wilton), Barton (Mr McClelland) and Lyons (Mr Adams) provided general criticisms, many of them also covering the issue of trusts.

         The member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) went on to deal with another matter. I am sorry he has just stepped out, but I have discussed this informally with him. He criticised the fact that I had been overseas 13 times as Minister for Trade. Let me tell you that I have screwed down the amount of overseas travel; you could be overseas every week of the year as Minister for Trade. I have micro&amp;hyphen;managed it. Indeed, I had not been out of the country for three months prior to this most recent visit to the Middle East.

         If the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for trade have now reached a concluded view and are supporting the member for Reid that the Minister for Trade should not travel, well, I take note of that particular view, and I am interested to know whether the member for Perth endorses the criticisms of the member for Reid on the general point that he made.

         On the specific point, the frequent flyer points are, of course, available to ease the budgetary circumstances associated with the travel. My costings have in fact been comparable with, and in some categories lower than, those of my predecessor, the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) and, frankly, with a young family, I do not want to be out of this country one day longer than is necessary. I have a job to do and I will represent this country fully, and full on when that is required in the overseas setting as well as back in Australia.

         There are two other areas. On the cap: this is a matter which has been dealt with in the appropriation bill. It is a budget decision and reflects the need to close up the deficit, which I strongly support. It has provided the framework for lower interest rates and this is the fairest possible way of administering the cap in respect of the scheme, a matter already decided in the appropriation bill of the parliament.

         Finally, I reiterate that there is a need to tighten up, streamline and simplify and there is a good deal of gain to be obtained from the process of simplification which is delivered by this legislation as well. I commend the bill to the House. I commend particularly the advantages to the tourism industry. I reject the second reading amendment brought forward and I leave the other undertakings, as given, on the table.

          —I have 39 amendments listed for the Export Market Development Grants Bill and two amendments listed for the Export Market Development Grants (Repeal and Consequential Provisions) Bill. It might assist the House if I indicated how it has been agreed to deal with those so that members can be aware of the order in which those amendments will be discussed and also when they can expect divisions.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The amendments essentially fall into four categories, firstly in respect of trusts, about which the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) made some comments in summing up the second reading debate. I will refer to that in more detail later. They go, secondly, to the proposed capping of the scheme; thirdly, to the range of export activity which is proposed to no longer be eligible under the scheme; and, fourthly, to elements of retrospectivity.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         They are conveniently found. Clauses 1 to 10 deal with trusts, clauses 11 to 53 deal with the eligibility categories, clause 54 deals with trusts and clauses 55 to 107 deal with the capping aspect of the bill. In due course I will request two divisions by way of symbolism, if nothing else. In respect of the eligibility categories, I will propose that we divide over proposed new division 2A. In respect of the capping nature of the scheme, I will propose that we divide over my amendment to clause 61.

          I would have called a division in relation to the proposed treatment of trusts under the bill but I will not on the basis of the undertaking given on behalf of the government by the Minister for Trade to examine that issue in light of the representations made by industry associations and groups and exporters before the Senate hearing earlier this week and in light of the contributions made in this House. In light of that undertaking, which I have absolutely no qualm will be respected and genuinely pursued, I do not propose to call a division on that issue, although I will make some comments that I regard as pertinent.

         <para first-indent="16">
          At the outset it is important to make the general comment that this bill was put out for exposure on 16 December last year. It was the subject of some 180 submissions. It has now been the subject of a public hearing before the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, with some 40-odd submissions in written form and a range of associations and companies appearing before it. If we synthesise those industry responses, we clearly find that a significant industry and exporting company concern is in the areas that the opposition has struck upon by way of its second reading amendment and also by way of the consideration in detail amendments that I have listed and referred to.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Industry and exporters are massively unhappy about the $150 million cap. They are massively unhappy about the exclusion of the previously eligible expenditure items and, in particular, that goes to the restriction of airfares overseas to two years rather than eight years. They are also particularly unhappy about retrospective aspects of the bill. I think it is fair to say—and the minister acknowledged this—they go to the heart of the trusts issue.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Some of the organisations who have made submissions include the Australian Publishers Association, the Australian Information Industries Association, the Australian Institute of Export, New South Wales branch and Western Australian branch, the Australian Business Chamber, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and a number of companies adversely affected by the proposals—Pureharvest, Mediherb and G.

          So far as the trusts issue is concerned, the fact that the minister has agreed to review this particular issue and the retrospective elements attached to it indicate that this was far and away the most pernicious and most unfair of all of the measures that the government proposed in the bill.

          On the question of the trusts and the matter of retrospectivity, the very unfair aspect is that while the budget was announced on 20 August last year with the consequences here to take effect from 1 July, the minister announced only on 16 December that trusts would be excluded. That goes beyond the comment that the minister made in his second reading speech about budget measures applying retrospectively. The trusts aspect was not part of the budget announcement and is particularly pernicious as a consequence.

          A range of companies have made representations, which the minister would be aware of—Crommelin Chemicals from Western Australia, Mediherb from Queensland, Pureharvest and G. W. Lucas and Sons from Victoria. There are a couple of submissions that struck me as being particularly pertinent. One was a submission by South Pacific Reef Pty Ltd which stated:

          In the current financial year, our company continued to promote aggressively, and, in good faith,
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           budgeted for EMDG support under legislation in force at that time. In fact, our decision to participate in the forthcoming HOFEX `97 trade fair, was influenced largely by our eligibility to claim EMDG for these costs. The attached copy of correspondence from Austrade, dated 4th October 1996, specifically mentions the potential eligibility of such expenses under the EMDG scheme.

         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          Here we have a company which is being actively encouraged to go to a trade fair in Hong Kong in May of this year and by a letter dated 4 October 1996 Austrade included the comment that these costs plus additional costs may be claimable under the EMDG scheme. So the company relies upon those representations by Austrade. This legislation would have the effect of rendering the company ineligible under the scheme.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The other point I thought was particularly worthy of making, because it seizes upon the question of the method of incorporation, was from Cochlear Implants International Pty Ltd, again, in a submission to the Senate hearing. The submission states:

The latest export figures for manufactured goods show that they grew to 22 billion in 1995-96. That represents 31 per cent of total exports, which is up from 19 per cent 10 years before.

It is a family firm which has, in the course of two years, increased its exports of circular sawmills and mechanical lifting devices from 85,000 to around one million and which, as I said today, has been on the receiving end of this government's clawback approach. The company's reward and encouragement from this government is that it will no longer be eligible to receive an export market development grant under this new legislation.

Of course, as I have just outlined, the company is increasing export sales on an ongoing annual basis.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Mr Deputy Speaker, I will take you briefly though those points one by one. For example, in terms of the trust matter, if G. W. Lucas was no longer eligible for EMDG due to its trust structure, it would mean that in this case there would probably be a fall in export sales, and its direct staffing levels could fall as low as six or seven per cent. This was said by Ms Jennifer Lucas, the company's managing director, in a letter to the member for Franklin, Mr Quick, dated 10 February this year. So these staffing levels could fall as low as six or seven per cent, not to mention the 250&amp;hyphen;odd other Australian companies that receive work from this company.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This company has just received its CE approval—its European Community occupational health and safety approval—which is recognised as the world's highest standard of safety. It is the first sawmill of its type in the world to have received this approval, which can only add to its exporting success.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         On its concern about the patent question—that is, patent registration no longer being an eligible expense—can I say on behalf of this company that, due to lack of financial assistance of the EMDG, it will be unable to pursue export sales into as many countries as it would like to. Its patent attorney estimates that patents in new markets will cost it in excess of $140,000. This does not include, of course, ongoing patent costs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If the company attends international trade shows and exhibits its Lucas Mill and has sales into a country where it has no patent protection, the danger is that its product is then no longer unique and can be copied in that market and possibly other unprotected markets. The company can understand if the EMDG did not wish to be seen to be financially contributing to the value of the product, but when the patent costs are ongoing and not just one initial payment it then disadvantages products that are unique to export markets and reduces potential export earnings for Australia.

        <break page="2475" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          On the third and final point—the question of airfares being eligible for EMDG arrangements only for the first two grant years—the company has put to the member for Franklin that the best method for export sales of the Lucas Mill is to attend international trade shows, which allow working demonstrations for its machine and exposure to international travellers. This is a costly but very effective exercise and assists the company to establish agents worldwide. Therefore, by allowing airfares to be eligible only for the first two grant years, there is no possible way that this company can adequately cover the countries worldwide in that time span. In the past it has been disadvantaged because it is a family company and all six members of the company work full time within the business. Current legislation has allowed the company to claim only one family member's airfare and visit allowance when family members travelled to exhibit at trade shows, since the business had not been operating for five years at the time of the claims.

         It went on to say that Western Australian exports will be particularly disadvantaged because Western Australia's exports are predominantly from service industries and providers of property rights. Western Australia has very little manufacturing and a small amount of tourism.

It has been estimated that around 70 per cent of EMDG recipients are small and medium exporters with 25 or fewer employees. These are not companies with great financial firepower to bear the brunt of these expenditures.

         I wanted to spend a short time going over a couple of examples from my own state of Western Australia. I made the point that the Institute of Export, Western Australian branch, had made a submission to the Senate committee. It submitted that Western Australian exporters will be particularly disadvan

         Mr Denver Davies gave evidence to the Senate committee's hearing earlier in the week on the impact of the legislation from Western Australia. He was of the view that it would have a disproportionately greater adverse impact on Western Australian industry because the key growth areas for Western Australian exporters are in the industrial property and services areas and the removal of patent costs, quotations, airfares and technical information would have a disproportionately disadvantageous effect in Western Australia. Having spoken to him, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, I know that he also takes the same view about Tasmania, which would be of considerable concern to you when you are sitting in a different place.

         There are a couple of Western Australian examples which are worthy of drawing to the attention of the House. Both of these companies have made submissions to the Minister for Trade. Entech, an environmental and energy technologies company in Maddington, Western Australia, wrote to the minister on 20 February in response to the exposure bill, saying:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         We are manufacturers of specialised thermal processing/recycling systems that are custom built to meet the specific requirements of our customers. Our export sales this financial year are expected to be approximately $2 million. We have no domestic sales of any significance.

         So here you have a company which is almost exclusively export oriented. They go on to talk about their two areas of major concern. They refer to the two major items of promotional expenditure that they incur, namely, airfares and tender preparation expenses. Under the government's bill they would no longer be eligible. This is a successful exporting company in Western Australia. Export sales this financial year are expected to be $2 million. They have no domestic sales of any significance. The two things that they rely upon to make the difference between zero to successful export are airfares and tender preparation expenses, given the specialised thermal processing and recycling system industry that they are in. That is a classic example of the sort of company which Denver

         A second example that I draw to the attention of the House is a submission that has been made to the Minister for Trade and also made directly to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) by Crommelin Chemicals, manufacturers of quality waterproofing and sealing systems from Welshpool in Western Australia. The submission that Crommelin Chemicals made to the Minister for Trade was made shortly after the budget on 29 August 1996. The submission states:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         We are a typical small company established for 38 years which has taken advantage of the E.M.D.G. Scheme and ventured successfully into export. We are entering our fourth year and our success can be measured by the fact that the company tax on our profits from export in the first year was greater than the payment received from our E.M.D.G. and our export sales will for this financial year represent 25% of our turnover.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         (Extension of time granted)  They then went on to say:

         So they are none too happy with the decision. The submission reflects, as Mr Davies put to the Senate committee, `particular disproportionate adverse effect' in Western Australia.

         To move from Western Australia to South Australia, I made the point in the second reading debate that I had recently been to Hamilton Pharmaceutical Pty Ltd in South Australia. This is a successful exporting pharmaceutical company. Referring to airfares in their submission, they said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         This is one of our greatest areas of expense as there is no selling tool better than face-to-face selling. We need to visit our distributors and prospect for distributors in new markets to keep our exports going and growing.

        <para style="Para">
         The one thing that is vital for them is the airfares. A similar submission made to me indirectly by Filmont Pty Ltd, export packers of citrus fruits in New South Wales, again

         Being cognisant of the time, I am happy to leave my remarks on those matters at that. Suffice to say, when you sift through the submissions made by the various companies to individual members or by companies to the Senate committee or companies or export associations to the minister or the Prime Minister, they reverberate around a familiar theme: that one of the most important things you can do to help small and medium sized enterprises is the EMDG airfare assistance.

         The regrettable thing—the point I made in my second reading contribution—is that it is not as if this has been the subject of an objective review of value for effort or export ratio to dollar spent. It has simply been a matter of the minister being told that he has a particular amount of money and the minister and Austrade and his various officials are working backwards from that. That has never been the way in which various changes to this scheme over the 22-odd years have occurred or been made. On this occasion it is clear that our exporting companies are saying that this is bad for our export enhancement, bad for export culture and bad, in particular, for small companies.

         The honourable member for Perth nominated two categories of expenses which are very important to small and medium firms in that exporting effort—that is, the airfares that are involved in establishing that personal and face&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;face contact with clients and buyers in overseas countries and, of course, the expenditures that occur in preparing tender promotion documents to win valuable business for those countries.

         He mentioned one very important point in the remarks that he has just made, and that is
         <break page="2480" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          the damage that this legislation will do to the ongoing development of an export culture in Australia. I refer again to the article `The rebirth of Australian industry' prepared by the Centre for Strategic Economic Studies in Melbourne. One very important reason this paper identifies as leading to such a dramatic increase in exports and elaborately transformed manufactures was the changes in Australia's business attitude to competitiveness, to exporting, to best practices and to an economic future linked to world markets, in particular to Asia. All of those have been important factors in the improvement of ETM trading outcomes. It is this very factor that is being affected by the legislation now before the House.

         The government ought to be aware that the measures it is proposing in limiting access to this scheme by small and medium enterprises, especially in the manufacturing sector, are going to affect job growth not only across the length and breadth of the national economy but also in specific regions throughout Australia. I have referred to the potential of the manufacturing sector in the export area. Let me refer once again to that article in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australian Financial Review

         of 28 February which identified some substantial improvements in Australia's manufacture exporting performance. I am interested in the quotes by the ACM's National Chief Executive, Mr Alan Handberg. In that article, he said:

         This scheme in the form that it was in under the previous government constituted part of a long-term strategy which had yielded enormous fruit in improvements in export performance to the national economy. The article further stated:

         Australia supports the accession of China to the WTO as soon as the negotiations and the negotiating gap can be closed up. I do make the point in response to the member from Perth that there will be a situation which is unlikely to trigger a change in the circumstances operating under the export market development grants scheme, but I think that is a fair question which needs to be verified. I undertake to do that and to provide further advice either way. I make the additional point that I wish Hong Kong well in its transition and I hope that before too much longer both China and Hong Kong will be forthright and constructive members of the World Trade Organisation.

I take this opportunity of again thanking the minister for his undertaking in respect of trusts and retrospectivity and also thank him for the courtesies that he extends when we consider legislation in this place, which are, more often than not, over and above the usual courtesies. Whilst on very many of these issues we might disagree, we do that behind the scenes in an amicable fashion. This minister conducts himself in a parliamentary fashion at the highest standard, and that is appreciated on this side.

          —As I indicated in question time today, this legislation constitutes one of the most unholy messes ever created in Australian financial administration. The opposition does not oppose the principles of this legislation, applying, as it does, an additional burden on the superannuation contributions of high income earners starting at $70,000 and going up to $85,000 a year and beyond. Accordingly, we will not be voting against the second reading of this bill.

         But the method of collection that has been chosen by the government is, frankly, an unmitigated disaster. Not only is it a nightmare for the major superannuation funds and the whole superannuation industry to make it work because of the impossibly cumbersome, indirect and inefficient method of collection that has been adopted; not only will it involve a heap of additional red tape for small businesses administering their own funds, at a time that the government is supposed to be cutting their red tape in half; not only will it be spread in its impact far beyond the stated target group of those with incomes above $70,000 to reach all those lower and middle income fund members whose returns will be diminished by having to bear a share of the extraordinarily high compliance costs involved, estimated by the industry itself at up to $100 million initially and up to $30 million per annum thereafter; not only will something over one million Australians be penalised, the vast majority of them again low to middle income earners, because they will not have their tax file numbers submitted by the time the legislation specifies and will be caught as a result for the 15 per cent superannuation tax plus the advance payment of 7&amp;half; per cent; but, in addition to all those things, the package as presently constructed does not fall evenly on all high income earners.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It does not fall on federal judges, because of a constitutional problem in reducing their incomes during the course of their tenure. It
         <break page="2487" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          does not fall, more importantly, on some 25,000 higher income earners in the state public sector, because again of constitutional problems involved in directly taxing state property—here in the form of superannuation funds. Again, if Dennis Rose QC is right—and he is one of the finest constitutional lawyers in the country and he is not often wrong—the legislation will end up not biting into any high income earners or indeed anyone else at all, because it is wholly invalid for the simple reason that the impost is expressed to be biting on one person, the superannuation fund, but provision being made for the payment to be actually made by individual fund members, a quite different person.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Just to top off this litany of sins: even if the legislation is wholly valid, there is now a strong body of industry and professional opinion that the surcharge will not bring in anything like the $500 million a year which is budgeted over the next three years. That seems to be a perfectly likely outcome, given the government's absolutely abominable record so far in forecasting tax collection outcomes.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Indeed, on information that has just come to hand through the rather extraordinary mechanism of a financial impact statement attached to a later government amendment, it has become apparent that the government's own estimates of the income reduction for this particular measure in the coming financial year, 1997-98, are of a reduction of some $46 million, from an expected return of $480 million that appeared in the budget papers to $434 million in the latest information we have. So already the government is acknowledging a revenue shortfall of some $46 million for this coming year.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Already there is a further black hole in the budget to that extent which no-one has been told about yet—it has just come to light—as a result of this measure, quite apart from all its other numerous deficiencies, apparently being quite likely to fail in its income receipt projections so far as the revenue is concerned. So this package of bills, which is after all the major tax measure of the entire 1996-97 budget, estimated originally to raise around
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          $1&amp;half; billion over the next three years, comes to this House—and I choose my words quite carefully—as an unmitigated shambles.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is hardly surprising that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) is not here personally to defend the package under these circumstances. He could not be bothered to introduce the bills. He could not be bothered to debate them. He could not be bothered to act as the minister in this debate, rather leaving it to the poor, benighted Attorney-General (Mr Williams), who I would have thought has more things on his plate than to be worrying about even this important legislation at the moment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Treasurer has gone on record to say that he is very proud that he has had the courage to take this legislation on. He really thinks this is a terrific bit of legislation. He is so proud of it that he does not even bother to carry it through this House and he is so proud of it, I might also add, that he refuses to release the actuarial report which he commissioned into the operation of the new tax.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What is he afraid of? Because he was advised that the administration of this measure was going to be a disaster, because he was advised that there is in fact, as we are saying, a better way to raise the revenue? We can only speculate upon that. His colleague the Western Australian finance minister, Mr Max Evans, had no doubt about it when he said on

         Why has the Treasurer got himself into such an unholy mess with these bills? Why has he incurred the absolute disgust of the superannuation finance industry, which he and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) have been bagging unmercifully as a kind of diversionary tactic, by his wilful refusal to consult seriously, to adopt a more streamlined, workable collection method? Why has he got himself into the impossible legal and constitutional tangles that I have just briefly described? Why has he adopted a collection
         <break page="2488" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          method that will, in practice, bite hard on a whole legion of low and middle income earners earning way below the threshold of $70,000 who, the government wants us to believe, will not be affected at all?
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The answer is really very simple: all this twisting, all this turning and all this performance of legal and administrative gymnastics—all these triple somersaults with pike—that we are seeing from Mr Costello are because he does not want to concede the simple reality that this superannuation surcharge is a tax—a t-a-x tax—involving a tax increase, and a whopping tax increase at that. The reason he does not want to own up to this is that, if it was a tax, the government would be totally exposed in breaching yet again another major election promise—that famous election promise not to increase taxes and not to introduce any new ones.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is the promise the government has broken on at least two previous occasions, with the tariff increase on thousands of consumer items and the Medicare levy surcharge. Obviously, the Treasurer did not want to be caught out yet again, so an absurd fiction has been maintained about this particular legislative package. We have heard over and over again that this superannuation surcharge is not a tax. We have had the Treasurer, we have had poor, benighted Senator Short, who is now going off to London to occupy a $150,000 tax-free job—it is the only job Peter Costello has created all year and he puts Jim Short in it!—and we have had Senator Kemp, various officials and the revenue agencies bending over backwards to not say that the surcharge is a tax, to avoid at all costs blurting out the `t' word.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have seen obfuscation throughout this House, through the Senate, through the estimates committees, through numerous media interviews in a quite deliberate not telling of the truth. All of these semantic gymnastics have further diminished the Treasurer's rapidly diminishing standing with the public and the media. Unequivocally the surcharge is a tax. It is classified that way in the budget papers and by the Bureau of Statistics. Even the Treasurer's department, representatives of which are looking rather
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          embarrassed in the box over there at the moment, have effectively conceded that of course it is a tax. They have structured the thing in accordance with section 55 of the constitution by splitting the package into imposition and assessment bills as required by the constitution because they know it is a tax and it is absurd to maintain this fiction. Why else would they have made this already ludicrously complex package of legislation even more complex in that way?
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Of course, not even the Treasurer can maintain day in, day out this preposterous claim forever, and over time the Treasurer has slipped up on a couple of occasions. We first heard him do so on the John Laws program on 27 February when he said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . the tax that is collected on employer contributions will be 30% rather than 15%—
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         a clear, if no doubt inadvertent, admission that he had been comprehensively fibbing, with a capital `f', since the budget. Then on 12 March on the breakfast program on Radio National he told Pru Goward:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         At the moment, where an employer makes a contribution, there's a tax of 15 per cent. What we've done is we have said, `Well, for higher&amp;hyphen;income earners starting over $70,000 and going up to $85,000 or beyond, the contributions tax should be higher, peaking at 30 per cent.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         So there it was: a blatant admission, overdue but not one that we have heard subsequently made on more formal occasions when his guard has been further up. Yet an hour later, in fact, the Treasurer was back in media on the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          AM
         </emphasis>
         program. In one particularly gymnastic piece of language, the Treasurer, in response to a question about why wasn't it time he dropped the pretence that it was not a tax, said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         No, it's a surcharge which reduces the tax concession currently available to high income earners—
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         Jesuitical casuistry of the kind that would make even the senior Jesuit Pooh-Bah, whoever he is at the moment, positively cringe, I think, with the squalor of it all.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A simple alternative model has always been available for the implementation of this particular legislation. If the Treasurer came out of his squalor, if he swallowed his political pride, if he openly, honestly and frankly
         <break page="2489" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          conceded that this was a new tax on high income earners, the method of collection would be straightforward and simple.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the case of employees, what would it mean? It would mean the following simple four-step process. Let me spell it out: one, the employer provides contribution details to employees via group certificates; two, the employee lodges the usual tax return, including contribution details; three, the Australian Taxation Office levies the surcharge where it applies as part of the usual assessment; and, four, the employee meets the surcharge by one of the following alternatives—either by offset against other tax refund due, if any, or by payment in cash as part of the settlement of tax, or by passing the liability to a super fund to make the payment and to debit the employee's account. It is as simple and as straightforward as that.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the case of self-employed people, no additional paperwork would be imposed. The calculation of the correct amount of the surcharge could be done automatically from the information already provided on the income tax form. The only information that is necessary is the taxable income and the deductible super contributions made during the year, which are already disclosed facts in the tax return. The tax office would automatically make the calculation of how much surcharge is payable and would then advise the relevant fund how much surcharge should be deducted from the member's account. All the super fund would have to do is send in the required amount—no fuss, no additional administrative load to the self-employed and no additional cost to fund members, which will otherwise arise under the government's absurd system.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Compare what I have just described with the government's absurd system, its absurdly complex administrative procedures. The simplest account of it I have seen prepared by ASFA, the Superannuation Funds Association, involves the following eight steps, nearly every one of which eight steps involves a great slab of administrative effort.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">

Three: the ATO matches the return and the information provided by all the funds of which the taxpayer is a member—there may well be more than one—and determines the amount of the surcharge, if any.

Seven: the liability for the surcharge is transferred to another fund or funds or to the member if the group assessment occurs after the member has left the fund. Eight: from 1998 each superannuation fund makes a provisional surcharge payment at 15 June of 50 per cent of the surcharge paid in the last tax year. And that is the simple version of how the process operates.

          —Some of them. So what you have to do is you have to publicise the new measures to members. You have to collect tax file numbers from all members to provide to the ATO by 31 August. You have to change systems to report TFN and details of contributions for each fund member to the ATO every year. You have to change systems to debit each affected members' account by the amount of the surcharge after receipt of assessment batches from the ATO. You have to establish procedures for members who have exited.

         You have to change fund accounting procedures to accommodate surcharge payments to the ATO on the required dates, including the 50 per cent of the previous year's surcharge from 15 July 1998. You have to change systems for annual member statements and the exit statements to show details of the amount of contributions reported to the ATO and the surcharge deducted. You have to establish procedures to credit any refund from the ATO after a dispute has resolved. If you are still alive, well and sane after that little lot, `You're a better man than I am, Gunga Din!' That is the attitude of the superannua

         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let me now look in a little bit more detail at some of the implications of this mechanism for Australians, for the wider community. First of all, this problem of submitting tax file numbers. It is the case on industry evidence given to the Senate last week that at least one million Australians, the overwhelming majority of whom would be low and middle income earners earning far less than the $85,000 a year that would be normally necessary to make you pay the 15 per cent new tax, will be liable for the full new 15 per cent superannuation tax, plus a compulsory advance instalment of 7&amp;half; per cent, because they will not have provided tax file numbers to the superannuation funds in the time required by the legislation, by August this year.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Why won't the tax file numbers be submitted by then? Simply because in the real world—the world of my electorate in Dandenong, for example, as distinct from the world occupied and inhabited by the Prime Minister with his view from Kirribilli and by the Treasurer with his view from Toorak and Malvern—that is the way things are. People either do not get their mail or when they do get their mail they do not always understand its significance. People's command of written English is often very poor. People may be simply reluctant to give any information, especially confidential tax related information, to anyone in apparent authority.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The fact is that the experience of the industry and funds management in the past is that only about 50 per cent of members ever reply to requests for information made by the funds, even if the provision of that information is enormously to the member's advantage. The funds—and I am not just making this up: this is not an opposition estimate; this is the testimony of groups such as Life Insurance and Superannuation Association of Australia, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, AMP, Jacques Martin—have all voiced their significant concerns about the way this will operate so far as the TFN provision is concerned.
        </para>
        <break page="2491" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          When people do not comply by submitting their tax file numbers then the legislation, on its face, bites to impose the 15 per cent surcharge until such time as they do. Even when someone does finally get the message that they are suffering a financial penalty by not complying with this request, if they ever get around to understanding and absorbing what the request is, the member still loses out because any subsequent return of overpaid surcharge does not get any interest from the government. So even if a member finds out that they have been wrongly charged, even if they manage to get a refund, they still lose as they have lost the income that would have accrued if the money had stayed in the superannuation fund.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          That is the first big fat problem. Over a million Australians, not just a few hundred thousand but three times the number who are targeted by this legislation—335,000 high income earners, we were told—will for this reason alone because of the way this legislation is constructed now be caught by the fund: a million low to middle income Australians, not the high fliers, not the high earners.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Then we have the impact of these administrative costs on the members themselves. To tax around 335,000 high income earners, which is the target, 15.7 million superannuation accounts, because that is how many there are in this country, have to be brought into the administrative system. For every one of the thousands of funds in the system, major steps have to be taken—steps I listed before when I retailed what I was not allowed to incorporate. All those steps are necessary, even if no members earn more than the income threshold of $70,000. Even if not one single member of a fund earns that amount, the fund nonetheless has to go through these administrative hooplas in order to fit into this government's collection system.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The sheer waste and the sheer lunacy of these administrative arrangements are very hard to comprehend. The cost of the legislation's administration will simply be huge. Precision is really impossible at this stage. But there are serious estimates, as I have already said, of around $100 million in
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           start&amp;hyphen;up costs and something like $30 million per annum in ongoing costs.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Ongoing costs include handling the massive physical data flows which are necessary to comply with these proposals, the costs of running more sophisticated information technology and, in particular, the costs of communicating much more often with fund members, whether those communications are requited or not. Defined benefit funds will also need to employ actuaries at a cost of some hundreds of dollars per hour to advise on how the surcharge will affect their members, bearing in mind that just about every individual case is different and the calculations are in each case quite complex.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          All of this is a deliberate decision by the government which has the effect of increasing costs massively, because the government simply does not have the courage to say what it is doing, to call a spade a spade and to tax high income earners directly. The real crime in all of this is that it means, again, that lower and middle income earners bear the brunt of these cost increases. They can only be recouped from members' funds, and the overwhelming majority of members of those funds earn way below the threshold limit of $70,000&amp;hyphen;plus.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is unfair the way the system operates, in this respect. It has been acknowledged to be unfair throughout the superannuation industry and by all those who have commented upon it. The only people in the country who are not prepared to acknowledge that, it seems at the moment, are Mr Costello, the Treasurer, and the government.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The third big problem that arises, after you look at the TFN problem and the costs of administration that will be borne by ordinary members, is that of high income earners probably escaping this net anyway. Some certainly will because of the Treasurer's pig&amp;hyphen;headed determination to set this up as an impost on the funds themselves rather than on individual members.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The Treasurer keeps saying that he is basing and building this on an existing scheme. But, of course, this is quite different. To the extent that you are imposing this surcharge on a personal income related basis,
          <break page="2492" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           this extra 15 per cent, being dependent as it is on the individual's income in a year being above $70,000, makes it very different from the original 15 per cent which is just imposed across the board on all members.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          So you have the problem of Federal Court judges, 150 of them, being excluded, let off the hook, because of the constitutional concern that their incomes cannot be reduced during their tenure. It should not be difficult to recast the surcharge here on judges' superannuation equivalent entitlements in a way that meets the constitutional problem. But the government's face is set against that because of the particular collection mechanism they have chosen for reasons I have already mentioned.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          State public sector employees are also effectively excluded at the moment. The way the legislation is drafted, it bites on the funds themselves, which count as state property and which are therefore ruled out from Commonwealth taxation by another provision of the constitution. This is easy enough to avoid if you tax the individual's contributions as individuals. But the government has chosen not to go down that route.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Then you have Mr Rose's opinion based on clause 34 of the bill as it stands, which I have already described in rough outline. That puts really under a very serious cloud, I would have thought, that analysis of the constitutional viability, not just of some groups but of the legislation's impact as a whole.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Moreover, it has become increasingly clear that the legislation is not going to meet its revenue targets, quite apart from its failure to effectively impact on some particular individual groups, because the government, once again, seems to have rather comprehensively miscalculated what the returns will be. The budget estimated, as I said, that just on $1.5 billion will be collected over the next three years. The latest figures that have just come out and been circulated as part of the amendments distributed a little while ago suggest that, at least in the first year, that rate of collection will be dramatically down by, as I said, some $46 million, generating a new contribution to the government's budgeting difficulties in the process.
         </para>
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          <para first-indent="16">
           The reason underlying this is, of course, the reality that behavioural change will almost certainly ensure that the surcharge does not bring in anything like what it would be if it is simply adding on 15 per cent to what is being contributed at the moment. That view is not just an opposition look from the outside in; it comes from the inside, from the accountants and financial advisers who are providing advice on remuneration package structuring.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The Institute of Chartered Accountants issued the results recently of a survey it had undertaken which showed that nearly 60 per cent of the clients of chartered accountants are being advised right now to change their retirement plans because of this surcharge. If that advice is being taken, then clearly the government's revenue estimates are even more shaky than has been apparently the case so far. Given the government's track record and its revenue collection forecasts over the last few months, one can only assume that it is utterly unclear what the income returns will be.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The unhappy underlying irony, of course, in all of this is that again, due to the poor design of the collection method—about which I have been speaking for most of the last half hour—it may be that, while those at whom the tax is aimed will be easily able to avoid its operation, those who are low income earners but who do not provide their tax file number will, in fact, be paying the surcharge instead. That frankly outrageous scenario is now looking increasingly likely.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           So there we have it. This legislation is possibly unique in Australian political history. It combines in its impact, in effect, a blatant repudiation of cast&amp;hyphen;iron pre-election commitments not to introduce new taxes, and at the same time we are seeing a steadfast refusal by the government to honestly acknowledge that particular breach.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           It has given us a massive increase in compliance costs and procedures from a government which is supposedly committed to lessening the burden of red tape. It has given us a reduction in the benefits of all members of super funds from the surcharge, a complete alienation of the super industry and related
           <break page="2493" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            professional advisers, angst and non&amp;hyphen;cooperation from the states and the territories and the prospect at the end of the day that the revenue estimated to be collected will not in fact be collected from those at whom the new tax is aimed.
           </break>
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Far from being confined in its operation to the 335,000 high income earners who can manifestly afford to pay it, it will operate in practice to directly reduce the retirement benefits of over one million other lower and middle income earning Australians. Far from being fair in its operation, it will be manifestly unfair to those lower and middle income fund members who have to bear the huge administrative burden of the collection methods that have been chosen.

           The opposition has not and never has opposed the principle of this legislation.

         I would like to give the House some interesting figures. There are five public high schools in Mount Druitt. The total enrolment of years 11 and 12 students for those high schools was 668. The equivalent enrolment for years 11 and 12 for St Marys Senior High School was 808 students. I happen to agree with Dr Laughlin's suggestion that the 55&amp;hyphen;student enrolment in year 12 means that Mount Druitt High School really is not a comprehensive high school.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I must say that I have always argued that a senior high school provides students with greater subject choice, greater choice for those who want to go on to tertiary education, greater choice to see the world of work as their goal and greater choice in vocational training. Among the 55 students in year 12,
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          46 subjects were taken. If you just divide that one figure into the other, you can come to some understanding that there must have been some very low class numbers.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I have always said—I say with great respect—to the Teachers Federation that they need to understand that teaching resources are precious resources. We cannot afford to have them squandered, particularly when the issue of aggregation of those numbers and greater productivity and outcomes are available to them. I am indebted to the Laughlin report because I had forgotten—shame on me for having forgotten, because I was part of the handover process—that there will be two new senior high schools in the Nirimba educational precinct: one is Catholic and the other is a public senior high school, which is coming on-line in 1998.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is going to further exacerbate the problem. Indeed, there will be an Anglican high school established in Oakhurst and that again will exacerbate the problem. For example, at Mount Druitt High School, it is expected that the enrolments will decline in the year 2002 to 43 students in year 12 and, with the opening of the other schools, it may in fact decline to 30 to 35. Clearly, something needs to be done. I have suggested that we need to look at a senior high school—not as a total response to the problem but as part of the response that we need to make.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The report makes 10 recommendations. The first, I guess, and most important, is that there needs to be a wider assessment of the demographic, structural and educational needs of the high schools and their feeder primary schools in Mount Druitt. I support that. I say to any parent or any teacher that not only am I prepared to come out and discuss the issue but that I am also absolutely delighted to send a copy of the Laughlin report to them should they require it.

          —Just over a month ago I raised in this House the activities of Mr Alan Jorgensen as an example of the problem of phoenix companies—that is, companies which go bankrupt and leave their debts and their creditors behind them, with a new company being set up to carry on the same, now debt free, business.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Australian Securities Commission reported in May last year that phoenix companies are a $1.3 billion drain on the national economy each year, that at least 9,000 businesses are affected by phoenix company activities each year and that phoenix companies, and not unfair dismissals, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) would have us believe, now rate as the biggest problem for small and medium sized businesses.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I pointed out to the House Mr Jorgensen's trail of new companies designed to avoid paying creditors their due entitlements—Townsend and Parker Pty Ltd, then Consolidated Diecaster Pty Ltd, then Townsend and Parker Gravity Centre Pty Ltd, then Townsend and Parker Vic Pty Ltd, then Machland Pty Ltd. A meeting of creditors of Machland on 29 January this year was presented a damning administrators report which made highly critical findings of Mr Jorgensen's company's conduct in at least three areas—preferential payments to creditors, related party transactions and insolvent trading.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As the administrator points out, section 588 of the Corporations Law makes voidable transactions which confer a preference on particular creditors. It is clear from the report that the administrator suspected that this was going on, for he had been requesting from past and present directors the company records concerning payments made to creditors. He said, `These records appear to exist; however, they have not been provided to me.' He noted that payments made during the period from June to December 1996 may have conferred an advantage greater than if the company had been wound up, but he needed further analysis of the company's creditors records.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          Since I made that address to the parliament, two different sources have informed me that Alan Jorgensen offered them money in exchange for their proxy votes at the creditors meetings held during that period at the end of 1995 and early 1996, following the collapse of Townsend and Parker Gravity Caster Pty Ltd. This was clearly an attempt by Mr Jorgensen to rort the creditors meeting and represented a plan by him to effectively defraud other creditors.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In the light of this, I again urge the Australian Securities Commission and the administrator to examine Mr Jorgensen's conduct and the conduct of his companies concerning preferential treatment of creditors and insolvent trading pursuant to section 588G, breach of which is both a civil and criminal offence, and also sections 588FA and 588FB.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I again call on the government to examine the problem of phoenix companies and look at increasing the disqualification period of directors associated with these companies from five years to 10 years and in some cases to life suspension.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It has also been brought to my attention that disqualified directors do try to get around disqualification by acting as consultants. I suspect that we need to look at prohibiting disqualified directors from consulting to directors on matters of company management and prohibiting directors from accepting advice from a disqualified person, given the frequency with which phoenix companies have relatives and friends of the former directors as their new directors.
         </para>

          The workers at Townsend and Parker deserve much better than a man who is killing this company's business by failing to pay his debts and syphoning off money to his family company. For example, $270,000 was paid to Freeway Management, the present directors of which are the parents of Mr Alan Jorgensen.

         There are two issues I would like to briefly mention tonight. One is the outcome of the municipal elections in my region last weekend. I would like to extend my congratulations and best wishes to all the successful councillors of the Frankston City Council and the Mornington Peninsula Shire Council. I hope I can look forward to a very productive and healthy relationship with all of them as we work towards  serving our community.

         On the same issue, the three retiring commissioners who had that difficult and quite taxing job of managing the transition to a modernised local government in the state of Victoria and the move to larger municipal areas deserve a mention. In the Frankston City Council area, our Chief Commissioner, Tom Sweeney, and commissioners Max Batchelor and James McCoy did their utmost in representing the interests of our community and in tackling the challenges with diligence and a very genuine commitment to the community and a great deal of enthusiasm, which I think many of us warm to.

         The Mornington Peninsula Shire Council was ably guided through this transition period by Chief Commissioner Nick Hudson and commissioners Jane Moffat and Peter Newman. My congratulations and the thanks of the community also go to them.

         The second issue I would like to briefly mention this evening relates to the Mornington Racing Club. I would like to pay tribute to the racing club, the recently incorporated Mornington Racing Club, which I am in

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As one of the largest employers in Mornington, the racing club is extremely important. Not only are 450 horses trained on the track by 90 licensed trainers with over 600 horses in stables within the area of Rosebud down to Moorooduc, but 55 full&amp;hyphen;time and 80 part-time people are employed in positions such as stable hands and in other areas around the racetrack. This makes a very welcome increase to the employment generated from the 80 horses that were operating out of Mornington when Mr Carr arrived.

         On Mornington Cup Day, O'Briens caterers employ up to 100 staff and approximately 50 staff on each of the other racing days. The club itself employs 35 casual staff on a normal race day and 70 on cup day. Mornington's success in supplying as many racehorses as it has to Victorian meetings at Flemington and Caulfield, creating jobs for float transporters, saddleries, blacksmiths and stud owners, reflects the importance that the club has to our local community.

         Mornington Cup Day on Wednesday, 19 February with a $85,000 purse up for grabs saw Palos Verde storm home. The heatwave conditions of around 40 degrees kept attendances down to a still impressive 6,500, down slightly from the 9,000 in 1996. Thanks to the Mornington Peninsula Business Council's suggestion, the 1997 cup carnival will be held over two days, which is something I encourage all of my colleagues to attend if they can.

Sir Reg chaired the club from 1947 to 1981 and was the driving force behind the resumption of racing there after the Second World War.

          The phenomenal success of the racing industry in Victoria is because it is taxed at 28 per cent compared with the New South Wales Labor government's high tax of 52 per cent. This has played a large part in shaping the sort of prize money that is available and is partly why racetracks around Victoria like Mornington and Seymour seem to be going from strength to strength.

Horse breeding and preparation are very important industries to the Mornington Peninsula economy. I think it is Dizzy Carlyon who reminds me regularly that it is the third or fourth largest industry on the Mornington Peninsula. This locally won prize money at race meetings is also a great boost to the local economy.

          The club has gone through many transitional periods over its time, but it is now in very good shape, due in no small part to the management and the guidance provided by Mr Carr and the board. There are plans for redevelopment of the club and improvement of facilities. I think it is a great credit to the club that they have been planning for the future and providing improved facilities at Mornington.

          Race day at Mornington has always been a very welcoming atmosphere and enjoyable experience for the whole family. Horse breeding and racing preparation are job creators and entrenched industries on the Mornington Peninsula. It is another example of how important leisure related activity is to the people and the economy of our region. I congratulate the continuing good work of Mr Carr, the committee and members of the Mornington Racing Club for the development of an important local asset to the community of Dunkley.

          —Tonight I would like to discuss two issues in the adjournment debate. The first issue is child care and the second is changes which the government is making to nursing homes. On the first
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           issue, I had the pleasure of visiting the Jelli Beanz Child Care Centre at Blue Haven in my electorate last Friday. Mr Speaker, I am sure you would be welcome at any time if you are passing near Blue Haven.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The issue that the management of the Jelli Beanz Child Care Centre spent some time discussing with me is the government's decision to impose a limit of 50 hours on the number of hours that are subject to fee relief for parents who send their children to child-care centres such as that at Blue Haven. Despite what a number of government members have been saying, this is going to affect parents whose children spend less than 50 hours per week at a child-care centre as well as those parents who do have their children at those centres for more than 50 hours per week.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the government members shakes her head, but the reason that is the case is that most of these centres charge a flat rate per day. If the honourable member for Bowman (Mrs West) wants to check with her own minister, she will learn that the Department of Health and Family Services is encouraging these child-care centres to charge the same amount per day, no matter how many hours parents might be having their children supervised at the child-care centres.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As a result of this government's decision, the amount of fee relief subsidy is reduced for those parents who have their children for whatever reason at the child-care centre for more than 50 hours a week and that is going to mean that they are paying up to $15 a week more. When you consider that the first round of cutbacks in last year's budget takes effect only on 1 April and that we already have a secret document from the Department of Health and Family Services to the minister, which the minister has confirmed, proposing another $400 million worth of cuts to child care, then it can mean only that more parents will be paying even more after this year's budget for child care.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There will be an opportunity for senators to disallow that limit of 50 hours a week in a little while. I hope that people such as my friend the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Lloyd) might consider supporting the
         <break page="2499" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Labor attempts to disallow that limit of 50 hours per week. I am sure there would be a number of parents in his own electorate who will have to pay more as a result of his government's decision.

         The introduction of these up-front fees, even according to the government's own figures, means that there will be an average of $26,000 charged in the up-front fee, or the accommodation bond, as the government calls it.

          The biggest flaw in the legislation is that there is no cap on that up-front fee. The government says that it will be an average of $26,000, but, because there is no cap, it means that people, especially in areas where there are high quality nursing homes such as the Central Coast, will be expected to pay very large up-front fees.

          When you consider that there is also the imposition of the new 25c in the dollar means test, it means that some people are going to be paying more than 95c in the dollar in effective taxation as a result of the means test on social security, the withdrawal of the taxation and this new 25c in the dollar means test on nursing home benefits. For all of these reasons, I believe these measures should be defeated. We would hope that there are more members on the government side of the House who would speak up and try to make sure that this legislation does not proceed.

         For 13 years they let that system fall apart. They let it get to the stage where we have four elderly residents to a room, sharing bathrooms. We have elderly couples who are separated after a lifetime of marriage together. One of those people may have to go into a nursing home and they are separated because there is not enough nursing home accommodation on the Central Coast of New South Wales and in many places throughout Australia. They are forced to get accommodation in Sydney or Newcastle. Can you imagine the distress that is caused to those couples and to their families, when couples who have been married for 50 years are separated and an elderly person then has to try to find their way from Woy Woy to Sydney or to Newcastle? It has a devastating effect on those couples. The couples are separated and are devastated by those sorts of incidents.

         When I was elected to this place some 12 months ago, I certainly was not aware of that magnificent service provided by these people. Each year thousands of children—some 102,500 last year and an even greater number expected by the end of this year—visit Parliament House. Almost every day of the year you can witness school groups entering this magnificent place and being informed and educated on not only the building but the actual workings of the parliamentary system.

It is quiet enlightening and, dare I say it, the level of parliamentary debate that I have witnessed on some of these occasions has exceeded the level of debate that happens in this great place on some occasions.

I must say, though, I was very surprised that the government members of the Avoca Beach school did use their numbers to force through a bill calling for longer school hours. Although it was strongly opposed by the opposition, the government did have the numbers and this bill was passed. One does feel, however, that the bill may have trouble passing through the Senate, and I understand that there is a strong push to have this bill amended before it becomes law. The parliamentary Guide Services operates public tours of Parliament House every half&amp;hyphen;hour. Parliament House is a building which I am immensely proud of, and I believe it is a most fitting building for our national parliament.

          —The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) told this House in October last year that we should all wait 12 months from the point of his election before we start asking him questions about the unemployment rate in this country. Yesterday's ABS figures showed that the Hunter region's unemployment rate has hit a 13&amp;hyphen;month high, to a point of 12.8 per cent. That equates to 32,800 people looking for work in the Hunter region—a very sad figure.

         Prior to the election we heard ad nauseam from the now Prime Minister and the now Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) about how appalling the unemployment rate, particularly the youth unemployment rate, was. Since their election we have heard the now minister speak ad nauseam about how unsuccessful the former Labor government's labour market programs were. What an absolutely ridiculous statement.

          —The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Bill before the Main Committee brings into effect a measure that was announced in last year's budget. It has the effect of transferring the DIFF loan liabilities from EFIC to the government's national interest account and for the consequent payment to the Commonwealth of a portion—$40 million—of EFIC's reserves.

        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill means that the Commonwealth will assume contingent liabilities of some $1.7 billion in respect of the DIFF loans. The removal of DIFF loans from EFIC's account removes the difficulties which EFIC has faced through concentration of exposure on the fairly narrow range of countries assisted through DIFF.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The opposition does not oppose the legislation. In itself it is non&amp;hyphen;controversial. However, I point out that the DIFF scheme and the potential for loans under it have been far from non&amp;hyphen;controversial. I remind the committee of the circumstance we got ourselves into earlier this year when, unilaterally, the government announced the ending of the DIFF scheme.

         We remember the embarrassment that was caused to the nation and, specifically, to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) in his telling the parliament that not one country had complained to him about the abolition of the scheme. It was shown, in a very short space of time, that it was true that not one had, but that many had. The minister was forced to come into the parliament and indicate that he had misled it.

         The decision of the government, and of the foreign minister in particular, embarrassing as it was for him, was also a very significant setback for a lot of Australian companies which had come to rely on the DIFF scheme. At the time, the minister said that every formal offer for DIFF would be honoured. However, that formal offer only covered seven projects worth some $186 million. In addition to that formal offer, there were 50 other projects which were worth $1 billion which were effectively scuttled because they had received letters of advice to proceed, but not the technicality of the formal offer. The circumstances of this were that this scheme had been in existence over a long period of time—

         Not only is this scheme important for our bilateral relationships, but it has also been an important driving force for industry development because it has been through this scheme that our heavy engineering industry has actually positioned itself into export markets. Think back a decade ago. At that time, heavy engineering in this country did very little by way of exports. The difficulty is that it is very hard to get into export markets, particularly in developing countries where what you have to do is compete against other companies bidding for projects where their governments are prepared to back them.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Essentially, the backing for those companies comes in the form of either assistance with soft loans through the aid budget or else through a cushioning of the impact, a lessening of the risk. There is risk associated with these things, sovereign risk, but there is also risk in the sense that there is a fairly long lead time before you get payment for the completion of the product.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The nature of the DIFF scheme was an essential part not just of our aid program but also it was a sensible use of aid, the leverage of government money, to assist Australian investment, Australian manufactures, Australian expertise and Australian services being exported. This heavy engineering sector has seen a huge growth in exports due in no small measure to the fact that many of the companies were able to rely on the DIFF scheme.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There were 52 projects in the DIFF pipeline before the foreign minister created this mess. There were 52 projects but they involved something in the order of 600 Australian companies. There is a multiplier effect in terms of the companies that can be brought into the network. That is what we talk about when we say we should use the leverage of government assistance, assistance which both parties agreed to, and assistance which is important for the countries to where it is directed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Why can we not have it both ways? Why can we not at the same time say we are prepared to give you that assistance, we are prepared to assist you in your development projects but, provided our own contractors, our own businesses are up to the mark, then they should be able to use this assistance and get themselves into the marketplace? They could be the most efficient producers in the world, they could have the best expertise in the world, but without this assistance they would not be competing on a level playing field. They would have to compete in circumstances where the companies against which they have to bid have the backing of their governments.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The point that we are making here is that whilst this technical change in terms of the transfer of the DIFF loan liabilities from EFIC to the government national interest account is taking place, we want to take the opportunity to urge the government to rethink its position on this scheme. It is not the only scheme being changed that has hit Australian manufacturers. The export market development grants scheme, which is being debated in the other chamber, is also a scheme which the government promised would be maintained at the last election but, whilst it is being maintained, it has been heavily slashed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is very interesting to note these simple facts. Over the last decade, Australia's manufacturing exports have been our fastest growing sector. They now represent 31 per cent of our exports. They are a bigger export earner now than agriculture and they will outpace minerals in the early part of the next decade. The manufacturing sector is not the poor relation
         <break page="2505" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          any longer of industry sectors or of potential export earners in this country. However, the simple fact remains that whilst we have seen huge growth in manufactures as a proportion of our exports, still today only 13 per cent of our manufacturers export.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So what we have is a huge growth in exports, a marketplace out there into which Australia can position itself. But the assistance is not sufficiently based to encourage more exporters to come into the game and that is why we need export schemes. We need assistance to get us into the export market. That is where the growth in world trade is. It is where our expertise has the capacity to position us but it cannot do it on its own.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Australia did have to embrace the notion of reducing its protection levels. Protection is the wrong way to go about trade policy and expanding export opportunities; protection is about stopping imports. Australia has to be about growing its exports. It is too small a domestic market to find the critical mass here alone. But it has the potential to position itself with that critical mass in the global economy and, in particular, in the Asian region. But at the same time as reducing our protection levels we have to have a strategy for positioning our industries for a post&amp;hyphen;tariff environment. It is not good enough to strip away the protection without also underpinning the support mechanisms to get us into the export markets.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is very interesting, looking at that growth in exports of those manufactures that I have talked about before, that the group that has grown the fastest and the strongest is the group called elaborately transformed manufactures, or ETMs—if you like, the high value&amp;hyphen;added end of the marketplace. Within that group of ETMs, the areas that have grown the fastest, just to name a few, include automobiles, clothing and textile, food processing, information technology and telecommunications equipment. I name them not because they have been the fastest growers in export values per year—at least 20 per cent per annum growth in all of those sectors—but because they are all sectors that have had some form of assistance. Pharmaceuticals is another group.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We are looking at the automobile plan and not the tariff level. It is true that Labor significantly reduced tariffs across the board. It treated automobiles and textiles as a separate category but nevertheless reduced tariff levels, and they are still on their way down to 15 per cent. The reason for the growth in automobiles has not been that we have reduced tariffs but that we have had an export facilitation scheme in place. It is because we have deliberately encouraged and given incentives to these companies not just to produce for a domestic market but also to get out there and flog the things into the world market. And it is not just whole cars, it is the componentry industry. It is the positioning of Australia, because of its expertise, to get into the global market for car componentry.

I am trying to point to the position that this bill, whilst technically correct, is part of a much broader issue that we want the government to focus on. It is not good enough to bury this bill in the Main Committee because it is non&amp;hyphen;controversial, without understanding the context from which it comes. The context from which it comes is a slate of measures that the government has taken, which is driving our manufacturing base backwards and is restricting our capacity to get into export markets; and DIFF is one of those schemes.

         To give an example, in relation to the automotive industry, of how these export schemes work in encouraging manufactures, the Henderson seat operation in Adelaide is a very good case in point. It started 12 months ago from nothing. It takes leather from another company, Howe Leather—a beneficiary of the export facilitation scheme, but almost lost because of the bungling of that aggressive bilateralism that the Minister for Trade (Mr Fischer) goes parroting on about. That bungling almost cost Howe Leather its business in Australia, but that has been patched up in some way that has not been completely divulged to the public.

         Henderson's takes Howe leather and makes a seat for a vehicle which is exported. Henderson's is not part of the Mitsubishi plant in Adelaide, but is peripheral to it. It supplies those seats just in time. Every two hours, seats are going out into export vehicles. This is an example of what the export facilitation scheme has done. This is an example of a company in car componentry, which has mushroomed all around the country as a result of the car plan and a commitment to exports—just as DIFF was a commitment to getting exports up.

         We know what the Treasurer's stance is in all of this, because it was divulged over that cosy little dinner at the Commonwealth Club some two weeks ago—over cigars and port, the sort of nightcap that some of that side of politics revel in. Some even stay in this very lavish club, so they can afford to indulge a bit more. This is when the truth comes out, and the truth was, of course, revealed a couple of weeks ago. The Treasurer's secret vision for the future of the

         We know that their agenda is to push under the carpet the significance of these measures and their impact on exports. Whether it is the DIFF scheme, the changes in terms of EFIC, the export market development grants scheme or the specific industry plans, this is a government that is driving manufactures down. This is a government that is not committed

         DIFF is a vital arrow in the quiver, if you like, for going out into the international marketplace and trying to win the battle. There are many arrows that have to be in the quiver and they have to be selected, because some of them will apply differently to different targets. But that is the nature of trade. It is the nature of manufacturing. It is the nature of picking where your niche opportunities are. Not government picking it—not that at all—but government saying to industries, `You get in there and compete on your own merits. But if, in fact, there isn't a level playing field, then we will try to level it up for you.'

         There is not another country in the world competing for these projects in developing countries that does not back its heavy engineering industry. It is only Australia that dud its industry and it is only the Liberals in Australia that dud it. Labor was prepared to have a scheme. It was prepared to develop DIFF and the Export Finance Insurance Corporation. It was prepared to put the substance of government in partnership behind industry development. It is prepared to support the goers. You cannot just get up there and preach to manufacturers on the basis of, `Get out there, chase exports and we will see what happens.' It does not work that way. It needs a partnership, and DIFF was a vital part of the partnership.

         The opposition, as I said, supports the measures that are before us today but it laments the circumstances in which it comes to us. It urges the government, and those who represent the government in this chamber today, to rethink its position, to restore the DIFF scheme, to honour its election promise in relation to DIFF and to keep the export market development grants scheme going. We urge them to adopt, in a bipartisan way, Labor's plan for the automotive industry. If the government does not do that, we will see not just one manufacturer close but maybe all of them, and that will be a sorry day for Australia.

         This is a circumstance in which we can build the strength of one of our great industries, just as we can build on the strength of our heavy engineering capacity. But it will not happen on its own. It requires a partnership. It requires government to be working with industry. The great tragedy of this government is that it is not prepared to work with industry. It thinks it understands industry but it just has no idea. The litany of complaints that comes through from businesses these days is about the government not listening to them and not being prepared to act. It is a sorry indictment on a party that claims to represent business interests that those businesses now have to turn again to Labor to try to argue their case.

         I hope the government takes note of our concerns. We are offering a preparedness to be involved in a bipartisan way in the development of a sensible industry policy for this country; one that embraces schemes such as DIFF and the export market development grants scheme.

         That is an expectation that people had, when they went to the last election, in relation to the DIFF scheme. It is a promise dishonoured—one of many. The government should be shamed on that ground alone. But let us look forward to where these industries can be taken. Let us try to support the heavy engineering capacity of this nation. Let us re&amp;hyphen;establish the DIFF scheme, not just transfer the remnants of it to another arrangement against which those that were lucky enough to get in can still be administered. For all of those projects that were given the go&amp;hyphen;ahead, we require that that be honoured. I think that is the appropriate course for us to follow. We would certainly join in any change to arrangements that saw that happen.

          —You are very welcome to it. I recall that, as I was importing these goods from Germany and from other countries, they approached me at a given time and said that they were willing to substantially increase the stockholding at no cost to me—very long term—to repay over a period of, say, 12 to 15 months. Because I had that flexibility, I did not need to obtain the finance to import goods from the other parts of the world that were of a similar nature and similar in price. That meant that my emphasis was on that product from Germany almost to the exclusion of that similar product from other parts of the world. The Germans were able to establish a very strong foothold in Australia for a product that was not manufactured in Australia. What that meant was that they were able to lock out their competitors from other parts of the world. That is one of the added incentives that is there for the government to get strongly involved in export finance.

         As the minister stated in his second reading speech, in last year's budget the coalition government stated that DIFF loans would be divorced from EFIC and those liabilities transferred to the government's responsibility. The reason for that is the DIFF loans are invariably long&amp;hyphen;term loans, in the vicinity of up to 25 years. This restricted EFIC in its ability to assist small and medium sized enterprises with their requirements, which are invariably for much shorter terms, with faster turnover and thus being able to assist more enterprises because of the faster turnover.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The clients of EFIC are invariably small and medium sized enterprises with a very smallish turnover, in the vicinity of up to about $50 million. These are exactly the sorts of enterprises that are strong in manufacturing that need a bit of a boost to enter the export market and to develop Australia's export drive, especially into the Asia&amp;hyphen;Pacific region.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In his second reading speech, the minister detailed the comparisons. A DIFF grant of some $120 million, needed to develop the export market of a small to medium sized company, translates roughly to an equivalent soft loan through EFIC of something like $350 million. That means that, because of the restriction of the time, less money is available to provide the necessary moneys for export. That has restricted EFIC very strongly. As a result, the potential to assist small and medium sized enterprises with quicker turnover and shorter term loans has been greatly enhanced.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In 1995&amp;hyphen;96, EFIC financed some $7.5 billion of Australian exports to more than 150 countries around the world, benefiting about 1,000 Australian enterprises. There is no doubt that a great deal of that business would have been lost because the availability of finance and the cost of export risk mitigation would have precluded those Australian enterprises from obtaining their share of the export markets around the world.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The main function of a DIFF grant is to provide finance for Australia's overseas aid programs, which are invariably focused in the Asia&amp;hyphen;Pacific region. As a result, their exposure is concentrated in a small number of countries that are very regionalised just to the north of
         <break page="2511" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Australia. Consequently, EFIC found itself in the very unenviable position of having the risk unevenly balanced.

         When Australian exporters approached EFIC for funds to export products of a non&amp;hyphen;aid type to the Asia&amp;hyphen;Pacific region, the problem was further exacerbated, especially in view of the fact that Australia's exports are growing exponentially into the Asia&amp;hyphen;Pacific region. In other words, the risk factor is concentrated and it meant that EFIC had to look at expanding the risk and, as a result, had to reduce the amounts of money available for this non&amp;hyphen;aid type export.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The amendments will allow EFIC more room to move and to more efficiently expand loans for short to medium periods for enterprises wishing to export their goods, especially in the Asia&amp;hyphen;Pacific region. The Commonwealth will receive a special payment from EFIC of $40 million, which is intended to cover any potential losses that may occur, and the Commonwealth will pay EFIC a fee for managing the loans.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This amendment will substantially strengthen EFIC's role, which is a niche that needed to be filled because the private sector was unwilling and/or unable or reluctant to provide risk venture capital in some overseas markets because of the risks involved—and quite understandably. EFIC was able to provide that much needed service.

        <para first-indent="16">
         EFIC has demonstrated that it can meet most of the Australian exporters' requirements by operating on a commercial basis and paying its way, as well as building up reserves to meet potential future losses. In fact, not only has EFIC operated efficiently and effectively but, in addition, it has paid a dividend to the government during this financial year of $12.6 million. I strongly support the amendment to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment Bill 1997.

         It is all very well to say, `EFIC is moving in and filling the gap,' but, in fact, it has not changed at all.

         This whole sorry saga of DIFF funding needs to be again placed on the record. Let me be quite frank. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), when in opposition—I think in about November 1995—asked the most comprehensive question on notice about DIFF funding to the then Minister Bilney and got a response. The coalition went into the election saying that they were going to maintain DIFF funding. Of course, we know once they were elected they cancelled it. One can only conclude that during the election there was dishonesty when the people of Australia were told that the coalition would maintain DIFF funding.

         DIFF funding is a mixed credit scheme which allows Australian companies to tender competitive contracts for the supply of Australian goods and services for projects in developing countries. Normally DIFF funding will cover an amount equal to 35 per cent of the contract and is combined with export credit from the Export Finance Insurance Commission of Austrade to provide a concessional loan to the recipient country.

Quite frankly, when you discussed it with the officials there, it was not that it was an inferior bid; it was not that the equipment could not and would not have made a significant difference.

And these companies were narked because the government did not say that they are going to cut the scheme off and give businesses some advance warning. They did it overnight, and projects that were in the middle of approval processes were caught up.

         Given that the coalition, the originators of the DIFF scheme, have now emasculated and removed it, perhaps the parliamentary secretary (Mr Andrew Thomson) who is going to sum up in this debate might tell us when he comes to this place: what were the conditions? Does he agree with me? What were their reasons for implementing the scheme in the first place, and have those conditions changed? Is Australian manufacturing industry so absolutely robust, flushed with funds and success that it no longer needs DIFF, and what are the implications of the cancellation of DIFF? How many Australian jobs are going to be lost? How many Australian dollars' worth of exports are going to be lost because of the cancellation of DIFF funding?

         There is one other aspect of DIFF funding that I have not mentioned and that is that, yes, it certainly helps some companies get into the export business. But when you get into the export business, it does not conform to Australian accountants' theory of business. You do not get success in three months, or six months, or twelve months. The export business is a long&amp;hyphen;term business and you have got to be patient. You have got to be in there; you have got to prove yourself, and after a period of time one success will breed success again. So perhaps the parliamentary secretary might take the trouble to tell us how many Australian companies will be deterred from making that long&amp;hyphen;term commitment to exports.

But I do want to say this: the Australian Labor Party in opposition is most concerned to do all that it can do to work with industry. The member for Hotham talked about industry plans that had been put in place when we were in government. Of course we are proud of those industry plans. The essential feature of them is that you need, in the first instance, to sit down with the industry, whether that is management or the workers, to ascertain where they are and where they see the potential to be, and develop a plan based around that. Industry plans do not necessarily mean forking out taxpayers' dollars for assistance. For example, the car plan involved an export facilitation approach. This did not cost any dollars, but it put the car manufacturers on notice that they really had to export. Again, with communications, it was looking at the role of the dominant carrier and the new carrier, Optus, in trying to get as many dollars and jobs as they are able to pull through Australian industry.

I think that when we go to the next election, there will be a distinct contrast between a Treasury&amp;hyphen;led government indifferent to jobs and to firms surviving, and an opposition where we are concerned about Australian jobs, about growing Australian small and medium businesses and about developing plans that allow them to grow and to export. I think that when we go to the next election, the Australian people are going to see that we are reflecting their concerns on this. They are concerned about it. They are very worried about you mob over there because they believe that you have no commitment to Australian jobs or to Australian industry or services, and you may very well reap the reward of being indifferent to their concerns.

          supported almost $7.5 billion in Australian exports, up some 20 per cent. It had 240 new clients, most of which were small to medium enterprises, 60 per cent of which were manufacturers. Its insurance against non&amp;hyphen;payment increased by 14 per cent to $6.5 billion. It introduced export finance guarantees, which are a package of EFIC and bank arrangements which provide competitive, medium to long&amp;hyphen;term finance to Australian exporters. The first loan under that arrangement was made in July 1996 for a project in Thailand. We are talking about an organisation which is growing in importance in terms of Australia's export effort, and one which ought to be acknowledged, I am sure, on a bipartisan basis.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But we need to understand, as other speakers have said, that EFIC and Australian exporters operate in a pretty competitive world, and a pretty competitive one in relation to access to finance and insurance. I had a look at some figures that were produced recently in an OECD publication. They are a little dated, but they show the scale of support from organisations comparable to EFIC in other countries with relatively small economies, such as Austria. In 1992, Austria provided cover for export contracts of some 296&amp;half; billion Austrian schillings. On a quick and dirty calculation, that works out at about over $A32 billion. Sweden's equivalent organisation to EFIC can incur liabilities of up to 72 billion Swedish kronor, which works out at about $A12&amp;half; billion. Germany, which the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) referred to, at the end of 1991 had commitments of DM152 billion—on the OECD figures I had—for export credit insurance, working out at some $A117 billion.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I have a slightly more generous view of the example the member for Lowe gave about his experience as an importer than has the member for Chifley (Mr Price). In a somewhat garbled way, I must concede—and perhaps that is why he confused the member for Chifley—the member for Lowe was making a point, as an importer dealing with a German company, about just how important the package of financial support was that the German company was able to offer him. When you look at the figure of over DM152 billion as the level of commitment that the German equivalent to EFIC offers to its exporters, you can understand what a competitive world this country is operating in, and why it is so important that EFIC be supported. You can see what a tragedy it is for a range of Australian industries, particularly in the engineering area, that the government has proceeded to break its election commitments and abolish DIFF.

         EFIC's last annual report gives some examples of DIFF supported projects—the sorts of projects which are now not going to happen, which is going to place Australian companies at a huge competitive disadvantage compared with their overseas competitors. A $17 million project for China of machinery for filtering or purifying water is just one that springs to my attention, with the Overseas Project Corporation of Victoria having a project of $6.7 million for a water treatment plant in China. In Indonesia, the Vocational and Technical Training Corporation of Australia has a $27 million occupational health and safety project. In the Philippines, AWA has a project of $30 million for the upgrading and rehabilitation of existing metro&amp;hyphen;Manila traffic signal systems. These are just some of the projects listed in the EFIC annual report, projects which are simply not going to be there in future. Australian companies are simply not going to have a competitive advantage in obtaining those sorts of projects.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I recently picked up another example in the Philippines of a $40 million BP solar project, which apparently is one of the last ones that slipped through the net, as it were, with EFIC making an announcement about providing a concessional loan which included a $13 million Australian government grant from AusAID. As I said, these are going to cost Australians jobs.

         If we were talking about an inefficient scheme, one that was not achieving its mark, one might argue that the government could have acted appropriately in wanting to review it. But in government budget papers, in Budget Related Paper No. 2 on the 1995&amp;hyphen;96 Australian overseas aid program, there is a report of the review by AusAID which says:

        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         The review also found that the DIFF had generated substantial commercial benefits for Australia.

         This is in addition to the earlier part of the report which talks about the benefits offshore to recipient countries of DIFF. The report goes on to say:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Almost all firms surveyed reported that DIFF had been important to their business, with half stating it was either crucial or very important to their operations. Commercial returns from 51 of the 53 projects—involving some $285m of AusAID funds—were examined in detail. The 51 projects resulted in expenditure in Australia worth some $709m. Follow&amp;hyphen;on business already won by companies at the time of the survey, and directly related to the original DIFF project, was estimated at $263m. Firms indicated they expected to achieve further follow&amp;hyphen;on business, in the order of $400m, by the end of 1994.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         Companies indicated there was a range of significant, but non&amp;hyphen;quantifiable, benefits arising from the scheme. For many organisations, a DIFF project was their first overseas contract; several noted that undertaking the project had "internationalised" their firm and had changed their focus from solely concentrating on the domestic market to including a significant export orientation in their activities. Other important benefits arising from participation included: establishing credibility in international markets; enabling investments in plant and equipment; fostering new research and development initiatives; gaining international experience for staff; and setting up joint ventures.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         And so the report goes on. What this government has done is to throw out all those gains—gains which are directly quantifiable in many respects—and also many gains which, while not quantifiable, are clearly contributing and have contributed towards an export culture for Australian enterprises. It is a real tragedy that this has occurred.

         It has also been very damaging for Australia's international credibility. Media reports last year in the period when Alexander Downer, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, was making a real dill of himself on this issue, make that quite clear. In the

          —It is my task, in the absence of the minister, to sum up the debate on this bill. It is really rather a small, perhaps technical bill in the greater scheme of things. It has come from a decision made in the process of the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 budget and it is essentially about improving the efficiency and effectiveness of EFIC, a government business enterprise that is of demonstrated value to our exporters. One of its roles in the past has been to deliver DIFF loans under an agreement with AusAID, the agency that I have some responsibility for.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government announced the scrapping of DIFF last year during the election campaign, a promise that was kept in the budget last year with some adjustment, and formed part of the government's deficit reduction strategy, which is a central plank of our economic policy. An unintended consequence of the use of EFIC in this role was pressure on EFIC's capitalisation, which was adversely affecting its ability to assist exporters in the two markets—Indonesia and China—where DIFF had been concentrating. It is a case perhaps of not wanting to put too many eggs in the one basket. As these loans were very long-term loans—in the case of Indonesia, 25 years—they were tying up a large amount of EFIC's capital. The EFIC board advised the government of this problem, that in effect there were too many eggs in the one basket. As a result, the government decided to remove DIFF's liabilities from EFIC and place them on the government's account.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As the government will henceforth be directly assuming some $1.7 billion in liabilities for these loans, it was decided also that EFIC be required to transfer to the government some of the capital that it was holding as a measure against the risk of default on these loans. The figure of $40 million contained in this bill represents less than half the capital tied up by EFIC for these loans. The result is that it will dramatically free up EFIC's ability to provide medium&amp;hyphen;term and long-term finance in support of our exporters, and for this reason of course it has the full support of EFIC's board. EFIC will continue to administer these loans and will be paid an administration fee by the government for doing so. The government will, however, be liable to reimburse EFIC for any losses occasioned by loan defaults or other interruptions to payment on the DIFF loans.

         I have not had perhaps as much opportunity to listen to the arguments put by opposition speakers on this bill, although I welcome their gracious act in supporting it. My friend the member for Chifley (Mr Price) I heard on the monitor as I was preparing to leave my office to make my way to the chamber. I believe he asked whether I had any pride of ownership in Australia's exports—perhaps that is what he meant. I simply ask: does the member for Chifley likewise have pride of ownership in the sort of disruption we see on our waterfronts? Or does he share pride of ownership perhaps in acts such as Mr Kelty's letter to Chubu Electric Power, advising them not to buy Australian coal? If that is the sort of thing that the organisation that supports his party is liable to do, I wonder if he would volunteer that same sort of pride. I have pride in lower interest rates, I have pride in a more flexible labour market, and I have pride in some of those Australian products such as our great wines, for example. My friend the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) is sitting here beside me and, indeed, I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, which are the finer wines, those from his electorate or those from yours?

         The opposition also supports the stated intention of the bill to improve the planning and financial management of the Food Authority. But we question whether this bill will really bring about reform or whether it is more to do with budget cuts to the authority and the government setting up arbitrary charging powers for the authority to make up the shortfall which was announced by the government in the budget.

        <break page="2519" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          The bill enables the government to make substantial savings by cutting funds to the Food Authority. It does so by setting up a process which allows the authority to charge applicants for dealing with their applications. The provisions which give the Food Authority these charging powers are extremely broad. The opposition believes they need to be far more explicit.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The basis on which those charges can be levied appears arbitrary and possibly ill thought out. There is certainly not sufficient detail in this bill to demonstrate otherwise. The bill allows the Food Authority to impose charges or to waive them, but it does not provide sufficient information on how or why this will be done. I believe it would be far better if the government had provided explicit criteria for these circumstances.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Similarly, it is of concern that there are apparently no guidelines for the Food Authority decisions on which applications will be treated as a priority. There is nothing in the legislation which indicates which particular food groups or applications will be processed free of charge and which will be subject to full cost recovery.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I understand that the government might believe that regulations or some other administrative procedures might make that clearer. But, at this stage, the parliament is dealing with this bill unless we can have some draft regulations made available or the government can provide some greater clarity on this. I think that is to be encouraged.
         </para>

          It is clearly in the interests of all parties to have a clear and explicit set of rules so that applicants know well in advance what procedures are to be followed and what charges will be involved in any application. It is also important that there be appropriate appeal mechanisms available. My understanding of the bill is that there is no provision for industry to appeal against a decision to impose cost recovery.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The government is asking to be taken on trust on this important legislation, and I do not think that is good enough. The opposition has demonstrated in the past that we were prepared to deal constructively with proposals for genuine reform, but we do not look kindly on half&amp;hyphen;baked savings schemes, especially not in an industry as important as this, with such enormous potential for future growth in exports. There is a real danger that this legislation, which is being introduced during a period of reform for the Food Authority, will undermine the current reform program—which would be a very unfortunate outcome for the industry and for Australian consumers.

          Whilst the opposition will not be seeking to oppose the legislation in the House of Representatives, that is on the basis that we understand that the legislation is going to be subject to close scrutiny in the Senate. Of course, the opposition reserves the right to move amendments in the other place. We will be hoping to consult not just with the industry but also with the government, the department and the Food Authority, to try to see if there are some amendments that perhaps in consultation we could put together to try to deal with the concerns that I have raised this morning.

          People are aware that there are some very aggressive diseases that are resistant to some of the best antibiotics in the world, and that some of these diseases can cause great distress and illness in some of our hospitals, both public and private. We need to be very careful about how we use antibiotics, in order to make sure that we are not the only century that has the ability to control diseases through the use of antibiotics.

          I understand that there are probably some industry codes that are followed by the chicken growing industry in Australia, codes that seek to put limits on the levels of antibiotics that are fed to chickens grown in Australia. I would be interested to know the answer to the question I raise in connection with this legislation—even if the minister takes it on notice, as I do not expect an answer off the cuff this morning. If the officials know, I am keen to know whether the Food Authority in Australia does actually set a limit on the level of antibiotics in any of our foods, and in particular, in chicken meat. If we do not do so already, should we have such a limit? In particular, if we do not have any such limits in Australia, what action do we intend to take against the possible importation of Thai chicken meat, which I am informed is subject to much less rigorous standards?
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Chickens grown in Thailand apparently are fed much larger concentrations of antibiotics. I am sure that means that more chickens survive, but it also means that those of us who consume the chicken meat are ingesting higher levels of antibiotics. In the long term that might mean we have diseases in Australia that are resistant to antibiotics and that may become more common in Australian hospitals. That would be a retrograde step. I know this issue is not directly connected to the bill, but can we get some advice on whether we have any standards on levels of antibiotics? I am not even sure that we can measure these concentrations—because they might be quite low—or whether we simply rely on the practices of various industries to limit their use of antibiotics.

          —I speak today in support of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 1996. This bill will enable the authority to establish a standards review work program which will set priorities for food safety, consumer protection, and international and industry harmonisation issues over the next three years. The bill therefore redresses deficiencies in the current legislation which prevent the authority from having the capacity to plan, manage and prioritise its workload.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The amendments change the statutory obligation to finalise applications within 12 months. The authority will no longer have to assess applications on a first come, first serve basis and it will no longer be obliged to assess each application individually. Current requirements have prevented the authority in the past from undertaking comprehensive and thorough reviews of groupings of foods.

         No&amp;hyphen;one here would dispute the importance of the Australia-New Zealand food industry. In Australia that industry is worth over $40 billion per year and this figure is, of course, substantially higher when the New Zealand industry is included. We would all agree that Australia enjoys an extremely close relationship with New Zealand, both culturally and geographically. We have no language barriers. We share a common colonial heritage which means that our food, in particular, is similar. It costs less to transfer food between Australia and New Zealand than it often costs to transport it from one side of Australia to the other. Thus this bill, which helps facilitate the food exchanges between the two countries, is of enormous mutual economic advantage to the two countries.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         New Zealand has a population of 3.64 million and that provides it with a food market in Australia roughly six times that of its own domestic market. New Zealand is our third largest trading partner; the trans&amp;hyphen;Tasman food trade is now worth more than $1 billion annually. This bill builds on the cooperative and mutually beneficial economic and trade framework first developed under the Australia&amp;hyphen;New Zealand closer economic relations trade agreement. It is a logical extension of that agreement and it is part of our building on that agreement. We expect that the outcomes of these amendments will provide an even closer model of cooperation, one that other people in this region look to as a model of coordination, cooperation and mutual satisfaction.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Already, the closer economic relations trade agreement between Australia and New Zealand has eliminated barriers to trade between the two countries and it has led, in particular, to the creation of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority. In many ways, this authority complements the new Trans&amp;hyphen;Tasman Mutual Recognition Bill—which was recently in the House and debated in this chamber—which will allow goods legally sold in an Australian jurisdiction to be sold in New Zealand without further testing and vice versa. Producers only have to ensure that their products comply with the laws in the home country in order for them to be available and saleable in the other.

         The new Trans&amp;hyphen;Tasman Mutual Recognition Bill, for example, opens up substantially new opportunities in the confectionery and dairy manufacturing areas. We can therefore expect, with the passage of the new Trans&amp;hyphen;Tasman Mutual Recognition Bill, a substantially greater workload for the Australia New Zealand Food Authority. The amendments contained in this ANZFA amendment bill that we have before us this morning will improve our ability to handle that increased workload. The two bills are a step towards mutual recognition and harmonisation
         <break page="2522" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         The National Food Authority—that is, the Australian Food Authority—was formed in 1991, in consultation with industry, governments and the community, to ensure uniformity in food standards across Australia. Australian governments accepted the food standards as recommended by the national authority. In 1995, New Zealand joined and legislation was passed forming the Australia New Zealand Food Authority. This ANZFA initiative allows for a joint food standards setting system for Australia and New Zealand. As I said before, it provides for harmonisation of food standards and consumer information on the ingredients in foods between the two countries. The authority is responsible for developing, varying and reviewing standards for food available in Australia and New Zealand, as well as coordinating national food surveillance and recall systems.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The authority is funded by the Australian and New Zealand governments, as well as by industry. In particular, the objectives of the authority in developing or varying standards are, chiefly: the protection of public health and safety; the provision of information to consumers to enable them to make informed choices about foods; to prevent fraud and deception; the promotion of fair trading in food and the promotion of trade and commerce in the food industry. As well, the authority aims to achieve the harmonisation of Australian and New Zealand food standards with international food standards, provided that those standards are not lower than the Australian and New Zealand requirements.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         At present, we are faced with the unacceptable situation where the Australia New Zealand Food Authority is unable to meet its management objectives, or to effectively develop any comprehensive joint food standard systems or, indeed, to harmonise food standards and consumer information. This situation has arisen due to the current regulatory and legislative framework which, as I mentioned before, places severe restrictions on the authority's flexibility and ability to control its own targets, priorities and management plans. In particular, the authority needs assistance in achieving its main objectives and targets as it aims to produce a food standards code by March 1998.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Given the importance of the growing economic relationship between Australia and New Zealand, it is essential that we address the problems created by the current framework of ANZFA. This bill addresses those problems. The main obstacles facing the authority's attempts to be totally efficient are, firstly, that the authority, as I said before, has no control over a number of applications it is legally bound to handle at any one time. It must accept all applications that meet certain basic criteria. As well, the authority currently has a legal obligation to complete the relevant assessment of each application within 12 months, regardless of the circumstances and where the application fits in relation to public safety or industry priorities. If there is an urgent requirement the authority cannot bend its rules. The authority must assess the applications in order of receipt, effectively on a first come, first served basis, irrespective of any more urgent demands or later applications.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The authority also has an obligation to assess each application individually. This leads to a fragmented response and approach to food standards and it undermines the important principle that the National Food Authority has, which is that it should achieve a coordinated, thorough and effective response to assessing food standards throughout Australia and New Zealand. In particular, the authority cannot respond urgently to public health and safety

         These proposed amendments will help to advance the authority to a position where it will be a leader in the field of setting and monitoring food standards internationally. They will also help, as I said before, to ensure cooperation and the continued advancement of the mutuality between Australia and New Zealand in relation to trade in food products, and in doing so will advance the closer economic ties between the two countries. This new program will be supported by industry, the states, the territories in Australia, and New Zealand. All major stakeholders will be consulted.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In terms of setting the new work plans that this amendment makes possible, the industry will be consulted in order to ascertain which priorities are pre&amp;hyphen;eminent in the industry. The main players will be consulted. They include federal, state and territory governments in Australia, as well as New Zealand.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Applications that are given a priority will be assessed within 12 months and without charge. Other applications that do not fall within the new priorities of the three&amp;hyphen;year work plan will still be accepted and assessed, but on the basis of cost recovery or fee for service. If the relevant charges are not paid, the assessment will be able to be delayed until the charge is paid. This latter amendment is in line with the contemporary approach to cost recovery and with industry cooperation and commitment to their own regulatory regimes. It gives the industry greater flexibility and autonomy. The industry can set its own priorities and it can control its own future.

         There are a number of recent cases in Australia where the standards of food have caused major community concern. For example, we had a recent scare with Kraft Foods and their peanut products. This is an example where, if you have a more flexible authority, you can have urgent and instant action. We have seen the damage when food safety is allowed to be compromised. In fact, in that case it has cost the industry many millions of dollars both in reclaiming a lost market share and in having to recall their product.

It is also essential for the safety of all consumers.

         As outlined previously, the authority will now be able to charge fee for service for assessments that are not classed as priority issues under their three&amp;hyphen;year work plan. That is very important for a government which sees industry paying its way.

In fact, this new set of amendments makes sure that, into the future, Australia and New Zealand will be known internationally as countries that produce the best foodstuffs in the world.

The situation is that, during the period of the previous Labor government—and certainly when I was parliamentary secretary—all issues concerning the National Food Authority were dealt with in a very consultative way with industry. Indeed, I worked together with representatives from consumer organisations, industry and other stakeholders from state governments. I used to often bring these representatives together, or ask the authority to bring the representatives together, and we would discuss these issues. If a matter arose, as it did, for example, with the country of origin exercise, the labelling exercise which was very long and difficult and where there were significant differences of view, even then we brought people together.

          Therefore, I was a bit shocked to see that the peak body of the food industry in Australia, the Australian Food Council, has written to the opposition and basically they are so concerned with this bill that they say in their conclusion:

          The industry wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). We are not just talking about one food industry, we are talking about the Council of Food Industries.

As I say, what is really puzzling to me is the poor administration in this government which has led to this situation.

          As the shadow minister, Michael Lee, has indicated, although we will allow passage of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 1996, we will be moving amendments in the Senate. Those amendments are intended to take account of the concerns not just of industry but also of others in relation to the issues which have been raised. As I say, I am puzzled that we got to this position because, as someone who was involved so intimately—virtually on a daily basis—in matters concerning the National Food Authority, I have been happy to see all the developments in the closer economic relations that have taken place between Australia and New Zealand because of the formation of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority and as a result of the different aspects that we have taken up.

         <para first-indent="16">
          It is a unique structure. We are not objecting to the idea that there have to be certain other provisions to deal with the workload of the authority. But the question is: does this bill adequately deal with those? We do not believe that it does. The shadow minister, Michael Lee, indicated that there are certain serious problems because there are not specific regulations put forward. Maybe it is the intention of the government to bring specific regulations to help determine which of these groups are going forward as non fee for service and which are going forward as fee for service. It appears that we do not have any indication of those regulations and that is one of the things that we will be asking to have a look at.

          One of the concerns raised by the industry is that it is going to give the food authority the ability, as it is presently worded, to charge willy&amp;hyphen;nilly in relation to the industry. There are two basic concerns. Firstly, because it is unclear which are going to fall within the charged group and which are not—and it is left very much up to the authority—there will be a real risk that the authority increasingly and effectively will, as the letter from the food council says, push applications into the fee for service category and levy charges at any figure it determines, subject to the taxation caveat discussed in the legal opinion which has been presented on this matter.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It seems to me that this objection has not been dealt with. No&amp;hyphen;one is saying that the authority is inefficient, or anything of that sort, but let us assume that under the current administration anything can happen. If we have a situation in the future, there could be an incentive for the
          <break page="2526" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           authority, as the food council says, to push applications into this fee for service category when they should have been in the other category, and then impose further burdens on the industry.

          Already we are saying that one of the reasons we formed the Australia New Zealand Food Authority was that we wanted to streamline the determination of food standards at the state level, at the federal level and with New Zealand into the one body, to have not only uniformity for consumers but also efficiency in terms of the charges which are put on industry. I do not think that it is an unreasonable request from industry to seek clarification of this. One has to ask why the Prime Minister has not responded to these concerns of industry which were raised with him by the chairman of the Australian Food Council on 9 December 1996. I would be interested to see what the minister's answer is to that.

          The situation is that we are interested in getting this bill through and in getting the main ideas of this bill through, but we are not going to support clauses which effectively are going to totally alienate the very industries that the food authority is supposed to be dealing with. That would be totally counterproductive and I cannot understand why this has taken place.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I will now go to the other point, which is this question of the authority having the ability to determine which applications fall within, and which fall without, its predetermined work programs. In principle, that does not sound too bad, and one might say that they can have a look at the work program. But one has got to ask: if the authority is aware of the situation, and it knows that some applicants have a good ability to pay and others do not, then it might be tempted to predetermine its work program on the basis of saying, `We know that this lot is not going to have the ability to pay, and we know that this group has the ability to pay.' Therefore, an arbitrary selection, or a selection based on the possible ability of the applicant to pay rather than on the merits of the work program, could make a determination. This reinforces the need for some kind of regulation or indication about the work program to be put in the context of this bill.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is true that the industry does have a representative on the committee looking at the work program but, of course, there is no necessity for that representative to be listened to. I think that in dealing with industry—at least this was my experience when I was parliamentary secretary—especially in this regulatory area, it is always good to have them on side about these matters.

         <para first-indent="16">
          It is not as if the industry says, `We will not pay.' One of the things that I certainly achieved, and even my predecessors achieved, was the agreement of industry to pay their fair share in this process for the National Food Authority. But when there are concerns about equity, when there are concerns about the application of the system, it is time for the authority and the minister responsible to talk again to industry and come out with some resolution.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          That is the general structure of my comments about the bill but I want to say that we can resolve this in a positive way if the minister wishes to discuss it with the industry. We in the opposition are happy to discuss it. In other words, I am talking here about a constructive resolution of the problem. We think that it is possible to bring together industry, other stakeholders and the Food Authority to find a way out of this impasse and achieve the goals of allowing the authority to have certain structured work programs, as well as achieve the goals of equity and of an efficient charging system—and keep the parties quite happy in the process.

          This is not an impossible job. I can say that there were much more impossible and difficult jobs than this one that the Food Authority and I had to negotiate. The honourable member for Murray referred to one of those. We have to take a grip on ourselves and ask, `Do we really
          <break page="2527" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           want a battle in this situation?' I have indicated very clearly that, if the government persists with this approach, we will move amendments in the Senate and we will seek to gain the support of the minor parties for our amendments so as to be sure that the concerns of industry and of others are met in relation to the comments that I made.

I give a word of warning, now that we are discussing the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill, about the general tendency of the coalition government to push things back onto the states. I hope that we are not going to be tempted to hand back powers that currently exist in the Food Authority to the state governments.

         <para first-indent="16">
          One of the things that came out during the period I was parliamentary secretary was the frustration we had about the fact that far too many of the features that involved ensuring that the rules and the laws were actually met rested on state governments. We should be thinking about a national enforcement regime in food standards if we are really going to try to prevent the sorts of sensational cases that happen, such as when the little girl died in Adelaide because of salami poisoning. That had a dramatic impact on the whole of that industry for a long time. When we look at what happened, the Food Authority had done everything properly. The problem was that the government of South Australia had not, in terms of enforcement of food standards.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The minister who is going to be responsible for the Australia New Zealand Food Authority in the future should be aware that we need to look at that issue. It is all very well to set standards, to have consumer protection councils looking at things and to have proper labelling—and that has been one of the big issues on which ANZFA has done a great job—but in the final analysis, you have to look at the enforcement of standards.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This is where many of the state governments have starved it of resources, and yet they feel when it suits their interests that perhaps they ought to think about taking back some of the powers that have been given to the Food Authority. I think any such pressure should be totally resisted. We should be looking at the opposite, which is to increase the powers of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority in the enforcement area.

          —When one listens to many of the comments made by my colleagues in this place on the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill, it is obvious that the Australia New Zealand Food Authority is held in fairly high regard, as is the work it has done since it was established in 1995. The aim of this bill is to enable the Food Authority to better manage, plan and prioritise its workload. I suspect that no&amp;hyphen;one would be opposed to such an idea.

         It is important that Australia maintains its reputation for clean food. It is eminently sensible, given the closeness of the relationship between this country and New Zealand, that we have cooperative arrangements such as that set up when the National Food Authority became the Australia New Zealand Food Authority in 1995. That legislation enabled the full participation of New Zealand, with the aim of having common food standards and common food quality between the two countries across the Tasman.

         I wish to question, however, the competence of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority in the way in which it seems to be determined to damage the health of Australians by increasing the level of cadmium which is permissible in foods. The Australia New Zealand Food Authority has failed to consult widely with respect to its proposal to increase the level of cadmium from 0.05 milligrams per kilogram to 0.1 milligrams per kilogram.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This approach by the Australia New Zealand Food Authority has concerned me greatly. While I support the principles of this legislation, I am worried that within the legislation we find that the Australia New Zealand Food Authority is able to bring forward proposals which will undermine the productivity and incomes of Australian food producers. In addition, it will be placing in jeopardy the health of Australians of various ages.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I have received numerous representations from around my electorate from people who are extremely concerned at the proposal to increase the acceptable cadmium levels in foods and, in particular, in peanuts. Until recently it was considered gospel that cadmium is extremely dangerous in foods beyond 0.05 milligrams per kilogram. Research has indicated that long&amp;hyphen;term exposure to cadmium might lead to considerable accumulation in the liver and kidneys, particularly in the renal cortex, resulting in liver damage.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Australian and New Zealand Food Authority recently decided that cadmium levels could safely be increased to 0.1 milligrams per kilogram without affecting the health of consumers. This appears to run contrary to research done throughout the world which indicates that what we should be doing is seeking to reduce the level of cadmium, rather than increasing it. Yet the Australia New Zealand Food Authority appears to be heading along the direction of increasing the level of cadmium. I see that as being totally unacceptable and I hope that the Food Authority rethinks this proposal.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It ought to be noted also that the main argument advanced by the food authority for increasing the level of cadmium, particularly with respect to peanuts, is that this is a non&amp;hyphen;tariff barrier excluding the importation of peanuts to this country. The simple fact is that every peanut producing country in the world can meet the Australian standards for cadmium and I have to ask: why should the Australian New Zealand Food Authority seek to expose the Australian public to twice the cadmium level when there is simply no need? At present, there is no restriction on the importation into Australia of peanuts which meet the current guidelines as peanut producing countries throughout the world have no difficulty in meeting the standards which we currently have.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Australian producers, and particularly those in the South Burnett and Kingaroy areas of my electorate, have worked very hard over many years to ensure that their peanuts are as free as possible from cadmium and other residues. Cadmium is a heavy metal that is possibly a major contributor to kidney disease and it can cause bone disorders. High risk groups include young children, pregnant women, vegetarians and smokers. Given the very real concerns and the fact that there has not been adequate consultation, I think it is important that the Australian New Zealand Food Authority re&amp;hyphen;considers this matter.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There have been some studies done in Sweden and I wish to refer to an article in a publication in August 1996. It says:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . exposure to cadmium can give rise to a tubular kidney dysfunction which may proceed to a more generalised renal damage and bone disease if exposure has been high and prolonged. Recent scientific
         <break page="2529" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          work shows that early renal effects develop at lower levels of exposure than previously anticipated. Previous risk assessments for cadmium were mainly based on studies on healthy male workers. The general population, however, also include particularly susceptible groups such as elderly and individuals with illnesses (e.g. diabetes) that may predispose the cadmium&amp;hyphen;induced health effects. A significant proportion of the general population displays early signs of toxicity already at urinary cadmium concentrations around 3 mmol creatinine. In addition to early tubular effects, cadmium may exert direct or indirect effects on mineral metabolism and the materialization of the skeleton at relatively low levels of exposure. This may have important health implications as poor and easily fractured bones is a major problem among the elderly in all industrialised countries.

        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         It is interesting to note that in Sweden the cadmium content in wheat has increased during the 20th century, but that concentrations in Swedish food are still much lower than in food from, for example, cadmium polluted areas of Japan. The article says:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Comparisons between the Cd concentration in human kidneys preserved at anatomical museums in Sweden and in kidney samples obtained in recent decades show that the kidney and body burdens of Cd have increased severalfold during the last century.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         There is no reason to believe that the situation in Sweden with regard to cadmium pollution is worse than in many other places and clearly cadmium pollution is a global problem. So, in the face of this evidence from Sweden, we find the Australian New Zealand Food Authority is moving to increase the level at which food in this country is able to be riddled with this heavy metal. This is absolutely unacceptable.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is interesting to note, too, that the National Food Authority had a cadmium workshop in Canberra in 1995 where it was considered that all regulatory bodies should work to put in place a strategy to minimise the exposure of the Australian population to cadmium by reducing cadmium in fertilisers and by maintaining maximum permissible content. Therefore, the activities of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority appear to be running contrary to the recommendations from this particular workshop. I believe that the food authority really has a case to answer. The Food Authority ought to be looked at very closely.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This legislation currently before the House is legislation which is supported broadly by both sides of politics. Clearly, it is important not to force the authority to divert all of its resources to the handling of applications and that, indeed, it ought to get on with its other work. I have no complaint with any of that but my constituents are extremely concerned that the authority seems determined to double the level of cadmium which is deemed to be acceptable in Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There were two proposals to go before the Commonwealth, state, territory and New Zealand ministers for health and these were proposals 148 and 144. Proposal 148 sought to double the permitted levels of cadmium in peanuts from 0.05 milligrams per kilogram to 0.1 and proposal 144 seeks to achieve a general increase in permitted cadmium levels. I have outlined the situation in relation to peanuts and how this could create increased health problems for Australians. It now seems, however, that the Food Authority has said that while it is not going to proceed with proposal 148, which deals with peanuts in isolation, it is going to impose increased cadmium levels on all Australians in relation to all food products. That is clearly unacceptable.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It is interesting to note that a very reputable member of the Queensland community, in fact, the president of the Queensland grain growers association, has opposed strongly what is proposed by the Australia New Zealand Food Authority. It is very hard to find supporters out there in the community for the proposal of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority. I have heard it reported that pressure is being imposed on the ANZ Food Authority because
         <break page="2530" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          apparently there has been a consignment of condemned peanuts already in the country and the intention is to increase the level of cadmium to permit these condemned peanuts to be inflicted on the Australian community.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think the Australia New Zealand Food Authority needs to answer some questions here. It is unacceptable that the authority should be acting contrary to the health interests of Australians. All of the evidence, both in Australia and elsewhere, shows that we should be moving towards reduced cadmium levels and yet the Australia New Zealand Food Authority seems hell bent on doubling the maximum permissible levels in Australia. As the Swedish studies indicate, such an action by the authority could well impact on the health of not only young Australians but also older Australians.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, the government is to be commended for this legislation. It will improve the procedures of the Food Authority. It will enable the authority to concentrate not on applications but rather on the very major projects at which the Food Authority is looking. I ask at this stage that the government, and particularly the minister, look closely at the authority's advocacy of doubling the levels of acceptable cadmium in Australian food with a view to preserving the present levels which I believe is in the interests of reasonable health standards for Australians. I commend the bill to the Committee.

          —I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate on the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Bill, particularly as the standards that apply to Australian food are of such essential importance to every Australian. It is true that we have an image of which we are justly proud, an image as a clean and green producer of Australian food. In fact, we have a reputation as a country which ensures that most Australian consumers can be assured that what they pick up from the shelf of Australian supermarkets, or acquire through their retailers, comes with recommendations that ensure that the health of the consumer will not be put at risk. It is fair to say that so good is our reputation as the provider of clean and green food and foodstuffs that Australians generally take that reputation for granted.

        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) in his participation in this debate referred to the very tragic circumstances surrounding the Garibaldi case—a case with which I am familiar because the young girl who died as a result of the food poisoning contracted in the Garibaldi case happened to be resident in my electorate. That, mercifully, is very much the exception. Every Australian travelling overseas returns to Australia breathing a sigh of relief that the standards applying here are so much more rigorous than those applying in other countries around the globe.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In fact, in order to ensure that the standards are consistent trans&amp;hyphen;Tasman, that there is a level of cooperation between Australia and New Zealand in policing Australian food standards, we have in place the Australia New Zealand Food Authority. It is the amendments to the act that has set that authority in place that we are dealing with in this debate this afternoon. It is fair to say that Australians, as I indicated earlier, tend to take food standards for granted. It is also fair to say that the focus of this debate has been on the opposition's particular concern about the proposal in the amendments that we are considering in this debate to allow the Australia New Zealand Food Authority to charge for some of the services that it offers.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I understand the concerns expressed by the opposition, although I thought it was a little inconsistent for the member for Calwell to say that he was desperately bothered about all of this, but he would not oppose the legislation. I also felt it was a little inconsistent for the
         <break page="2531" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          member for Dobell (Mr Lee) to imply that there was some sort of inadequate standard being policed in Australia and that, under existing arrangements in Australia, so far as he knew, it may be possible for higher levels of antibiotics to apply in Australian food than he would find acceptable.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In my participation in this debate I want to pick up two points. Firstly, I want to make a comment or two about what I see as the general standard of Australian food and, secondly, to refer specifically to the legislation and the proposal to allow the Australia New Zealand Food Authority to make some charges for some of the services that it is delivering.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         My background, as most of the parliament knows, has been in the food industry as a fruit grower. I can reassure this chamber and the parliament that standards do apply and that every fruit grower is conscious of that in terms of the fruit supplied to any retail outlet across Australia. The member for Calwell is to be commended, as indeed is the former government, for the work done in bringing state and national standards into some sort of uniformity. That was important. I thought the member for Calwell might have been a little more generous in his remarks, had he recognised that part of the Garibaldi disaster had occurred as much under a Labor Party state administration as any other. But that sort of generous comment was not something that he was volunteering in this debate. Nonetheless, as the parliamentary secretary he played a key role in ensuring that these standards were made uniform.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The result of this is that food producers, food processors and food retailers across the nation are obliged to adhere to a standard which ensures that spray residues, antibiotics, and any other things that are seen as deleterious to human health are kept to an absolute minimum; a minimum that is seen as more than adequate by any of the other standards applying around the globe. As a fruit grower, I was obliged to ensure that if any form of spray had been used on the fruit that was being produced then that fruit was not harvested until it had met particular withholding periods.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I also knew, as did all of the people who were fruit growers around me—and that includes those people from ethnic backgrounds who were without the same capacity to soak up the immediate information as those with European backgrounds automatically were—that any one of the deliveries made to, say, a fruit processor or a fruit canner had to meet minimum standards and that there would be random regular selections of processed fruit off the line that would be assessed for its contaminant free status. So Australians, generally, have little to fear from the foods that they consume and from the standards that are applied.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Of course there are exceptions. The member for Calwell focused on one of those exceptions. The most recent food scare, which concerned the Arnott's biscuit chain, had nothing to do with producers or processors, but very much to do with what was little more than a terrorist attack. Nonetheless, the Australian community and Australian retailers ensured that every step was taken to make sure that Australian consumers could be assured that the food they were consuming was of the very highest possible standard.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Australia New Zealand Food Authority was set up so that we could ensure that the standards that apply across Australia would apply across the Tasman, in New Zealand. The first point of the authority was to develop and maintain an Australia New Zealand food standards code. The second was to develop and implement new hygiene standards for food processing, manufacturing and handling. The third was to ensure that national arrangements were in place for the surveillance and for compliance with the code. This has largely been successful.
        </para>
        <break page="2532" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          But, as a result of the involvement of the New Zealanders in what was once an Australian standard, we now have a situation in which the workload that the authority is facing is larger than it can reasonably process in order to meet the March 1998 deadline originally set down for the authority to have firm trans&amp;hyphen;Tasman arrangements in place. The authority has come to the government saying that it has no control over the number of applications made to it for compliance with these standards and that it is obliged under the existing legislation to deal with the applications on a first come, first served basis, so it cannot accurately assess the relevant importance of some applications over others—and even if it could, it cannot process them as it would choose to.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It also has the problem that every application that comes to it must be individually assessed, even if it parallels another application on which the authority has already made a determination. For those reasons, the authority has asked for these changes. The member for Calwell has said that the changes proposed do not meet with the approval of the Australian Food Industry Council. He indicated that the particular concern the council had was a concern over the charging regime, and the member for Dobell tends to have reinforced that point. What has been overlooked in this debate is that the advice of the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams) on the charging regime that is being proposed is that any fee charged under this legislation must be related to the expense incurred.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The Attorney&amp;hyphen;General has indicated that some of the activities cannot be characterised as a service and, consequently, the costs will not be fully recovered, so there is still an obligation on the government to make an input into the way in which the Australia New Zealand Food Authority goes about exercising its important task. Furthermore, the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's office has indicated that existing constitutional arrangements mean that we cannot impose a charge which would constitute a tax.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          So much of the concern expressed, justifiably, by the member for Calwell on behalf of the Australian Food Industry Council is a concern that the government knows is unfounded. This is not a proposal to find a way to tax the industry. In fact, the industry should be aware of that. The government not only indicates that in the second reading speech by the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), but it is reinforced by the advice gained from the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's office. I will quote a portion of the minister's second reading speech where she said:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          The bill:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">

         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          . specifically limits the level of the charge to recovering the authority's expenses in assessing an application.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          I therefore suggest that much of the concern expressed about this charge regime is unfounded and is, in fact, scaremongering. There is no intent by the authority or the government that these charges should provide a revenue raising measure for the government.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I want to pick up a couple of other points that have come out of this debate and reinforce the remarks made by the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) when she said that, in her own electorate, the SPC people had found, following the movement of New Zealand into the authority to make the Australia New Zealand Food Authority complete, that there had been delays in their processing applications that they were anxious to have accelerated. The legislation before the House is designed to allow the government to accelerate these applications and, as I said earlier, to meet the 1998 deadline.

         <break page="2533" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          <para first-indent="16">
           This is important, because there is a great number of opportunities for food processors, not only in exports to New Zealand—which are already very important to us—but, furthermore, in exports to other APEC countries. These opportunities will best be resolved when we can maintain our clean and green image through the successful operation of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority. This bill allows the operation of that authority to be enhanced. I am pleased to support it.

          —I am pleased to have the opportunity to comment on the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill. The bill amends the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act 1991 to overcome operational limitations within the current principal act. The proposed amendments to the bill will enable the Australia New Zealand Food Authority to better plan, manage and prioritise its workload.

         The background to this bill is that the principal act amended by this bill was originally the National Food Authority Act 1991. The main goal of the authority is to provide a national focus within Australia for cooperation between governments, industry and the community in developing a safe and wholesome food supply.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is that topic that I wish to address, because one of the most important things for Australia is that it has enjoyed a very strong reputation overseas for clean, wholesome food products. It indicates how important it is, not only in our relationship with New Zealand but also—as the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) mentioned—with our near Asian neighbours, and the wonderful opportunities that that provides for Australia to provide food to what we now term `the supermarket to Asia'.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I was delighted to hear recently of the move by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to create the Supermarket to Asia Council. The Australian food industry is one with tremendous potential to generate wealth, jobs and exports for Australians. It is one of the largest sectors of the Australian economy, with retail sales and exports valued at $64 billion. Exports of food in 1995&amp;hyphen;96 were $15 billion, with approximately 40 per cent of these exports going to Asia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The industry's potential for further growth is considerable because of the natural production advantages in Australia and its proximity to rapidly growing markets for food in Asia. This Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill ensures that both Australia and New Zealand reach agreement on joint food standards.
        </para>

         It is imperative that New Zealand and Australia are in a position to present a united force to the Asian opportunities which are currently available. The diets of Asians are becoming more westernised, and this is creating new opportunities for the export of food products like meat—and I relate that to my own electorate where we produce beef, lamb and pork—dairy products, horticulture and grains, as well as a number of other very important primary products and foods which are suitable for inclusion in the strategy that the Supermarket to Asia Council is embarking on.

         We need to ensure that, if Asian customers are looking at a supplier from within the Australia&amp;hyphen;New Zealand providers who are emerging in the marketplace and they are looking for food products, obviously they are going to be looking for the standard of quality, ingredients and information that is provided between those two countries to be compatible and

         Under the terms of this legislation, I am delighted to see that we are, in fact, bringing Australia and New Zealand much closer together in the standards that they provide, particularly on their consumer information on the ingredients. This is a complaint that a lot of members, I am sure, would receive in their electorate offices from time to time. People ask what the ingredients are in a lot of the products on the supermarket shelves, and there is no doubt that people who visit a supermarket these days have a pretty close look at the labels to make sure that they know what the ingredients are. It is important because of our close economic relationship with New Zealand that those standards are harmonised and, in fact, that there is close cooperation between the two countries.

         The proposed amendments will enable the authority to complete the major task of a three&amp;hyphen;year standards review work program. Support and agreement to this program will set priorities for a food standards review and will involve negotiations with the food industry. I think that this is important because I just heard my colleague, the honourable member for Wakefield, who obviously had some discussions with the Food Industry Council of Australia. They have written to me also on this matter. They were concerned about the charges and I just arrived in the chamber in time to hear the honourable member for Wakefield address that question. I know the minister has made a note of that and, no doubt, will respond in the latter part of this debate. I have not had the opportunity of meeting with them but I am sure that those concerns of the Food Industry Council of Australia will be allayed by the minister.

We already enjoy closer cooperation under the economic cooperation which we have between New Zealand and Australia and I welcome this further move.

           workload. I know that there have been many compliments paid to the Australia New Zealand Food Authority by colleagues this morning for the work that it does but, as with any authority, from time to time things change and it needs to adjust its practices. It is important for us to have a look at the underlying reasons why we need to address some of the pressures on management and the growing workload on this authority.

         It is enormously important that Australia's food standards are dealt with in a timely manner so that we can continue to have public confidence and good public health practice in this country. We also cannot overlook the fact that the enhancement of the industry's ability to compete domestically and internationally has a very important economic purpose. We have also heard today from my colleagues just how important the food industry is in Australia and, indeed, it is an industry that is worth $40 billion.

         The current act requires the authority to assess, within a 12&amp;hyphen;month time frame, all applications made to it to vary the food standards code. This means that applications have first call on the authority resources regardless of their relative importance or their priority in the whole scheme of things. In practice, this has meant that resources have been diverted from the more important tasks, such as the review of food standards and the development of a joint Australia New Zealand food standard code, in order to deal with the sheer volume of applications that come in.

         The impact of the new bill will be to enable the authority, firstly, to allocate its resources to an agreed work plan that incorporates public health and industry and, of course, consumer priorities. It is immensely important, as I said, that we have public confidence in the system that we have in place.

         The second part of the legislation enables the authority to ensure a review of the entire food standard code and that it is completed in a timely manner, not interrupted by perhaps less important code changes. An important part of this legislation will allow for a charge for goods it produces, as well as for the existing power to charge for services and to waive fees, for example, for all work done in relation to the agreed work plan including, and in particular, public health priorities.

         The member for Dobell (Mr Lee) did raise some points that I would like to cover in the operation of this bill. The first point that he raised was the fact that the detail was not available. I am a little surprised at his comments because we all know in this place that it is hardly unusual for the main bill to come without those detailed principles in the first instance. But the detail will be scrutinised by the House and the Senate in the form of regulations to be introduced. The powers are not arbitrary; they are subject to disallowable instruments.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The member for Dobell also sought details of priorities for setting out the work plan. I have to say that, again, I am a little surprised at the member's criticism here about not having detail because I understand that in the principal act the three key criteria are clearly set out. They go to issues of importance in terms of public health, consumer information which would prevent fraud and, of course, consistency within the industry and the elements of fair trading. So the three main priorities, or criteria if you like, for work to be progressed are set out clearly in the principal act.

         In addition to that, we also have a priority for setting a work plan. The first phase of this process has already been advertised in the national press and consultations have commenced with the state and territory governments and with the New Zealand government.

         <break page="2536" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          importance of the food standards review. Given that they see this as an important priority, this bill will ensure that the project can be progressed and it cannot progress in a timely manner without this bill being passed.

         The member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) also made some comments, not unlike those from the member for Dobell, about the detail that was necessary. As I said, that will come forward in the regulations. His other concern was about a letter received from the Australian Food Council, a peak industry body. I think it is fair to say that the main concern in that letter revolved around the charging practices and, as I have said, the detail of those practices will come forward in the regulations and be scrutinised by this House and, indeed, by the Senate.

         This bill is about removing legislative impediments to the implementation of reforms in the electricity industry. These reforms, together with the gas reforms agreed by the Council of Australian Governments in February 1994, have been estimated by the Industry Commission to lead to an increase in annual gross domestic product of $5.8 billion.

        <break page="2537" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          To do this, the bill will amend part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974, the principal act. Part IIIA includes provisions whereby third parties can seek access to services provided by essential infrastructure facilities of national significance. These provisions are an important feature of Australia's national competition policy reforms. They promote competitive markets in order to improve efficiency and service delivery. The amendments to part IIIA will provide a legislative framework to support reforms in network industries where a co&amp;hyphen;regulatory approach, as an alternative to direct regulation, is being used to implement pro&amp;hyphen;competitive market structures.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This approach, which is being pursued in the electricity industry, involves the development of a code of conduct by industry participants and governments, setting out market rules, including rules about third party access to network infrastructure. In order to implement the access provisions of the code, it is envisaged that network service providers will offer access undertakings to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, later referred to as the commission, under part IIIA, setting out obligations in relation to network access. These undertakings are enforced by the Federal Court, upon application by the commission.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There are, however, a number of shortcomings with the principal act which would prevent the timely implementation of this approach to access regulation. Firstly, the principal act requires the commission to undertake multiple public consultation processes before such arrangements can be established: one in relation to the code, if the code requires authorisation under part VII of the principal act, and others in relation to the access undertakings of individual service providers. This unnecessary duplication of public consultation processes is an inefficient way of processing access undertakings in network industries, and runs the risk of unduly delaying progress towards more competitive infrastructure industries. Also, it may be difficult for the commission to assess whether separate access undertakings will achieve coherent industry&amp;hyphen;wide access arrangements.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Secondly, the principal act requires an undertaking to set out a high level of detail about the terms and conditions of access. Accordingly, an undertaking cannot include a maximum price or a formula with factors which are reset from time to time. Inclusion of highly detailed terms and conditions about access may be undesirable and impractical in certain network industries, such as the electricity industry, where an industry&amp;hyphen;wide approach to access is to be adopted.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Thirdly, the principal act does not enable an access provider to confer power on the commission to make decisions about access issues pursuant to an undertaking. For example, in the case of access to the national electricity grid, it is envisaged that undertakings will provide for the commission to make decisions which will affect the price for access, in accordance with criteria set out in the undertakings.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The bill will address these shortcomings by setting out a process whereby the commission can accept industry access codes, following public consultation. Each access code would set out rules about access for the industry. Once the commission has accepted an access code, the commission can accept access undertakings in accordance with the code, without the need for further public consultation. This process allows for the development of coherent access arrangements through a single consultation process. Furthermore, the bill will relax the level of detail required in an access undertaking. The appropriate level of detail will be determined by the commission and access providers, on a case&amp;hyphen;by&amp;hyphen;case basis.
         </para>
         <break page="2538" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          <para first-indent="16">
           The bill will also enable access providers to confer power on the commission to make decisions in connection with access. The undertaking would set out how the commission is to make its decisions, along with other relevant ancillary matters. In this regard, an undertaking could confer on the commission a role that is similar to its role under part IIIA of the principal act in relation to declared services, should an access provider choose to give the commission such a role.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           In addition, the bill includes a provision to preserve the integrity of the competitive conduct rules and authorisation provisions of the principal act. The bill provides that the access provisions in the principal act will not affect the liability of the relevant parties for contraventions of the competitive conduct rules in the principal act. The cost to revenue of the proposed amendments is expected to be nil. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and I commend the bill to the House.

          —The member for Corangamite will find, in my case, that consistency is a virtue. I am speaking in favour of the competition reforms we introduced in government and which remain in the national interest. The principle is very sound. In the case of infrastructure characterised by monopoly or oligopoly features you should not need to own an electricity power station to retail electricity and you should not need to own a gas pipeline to retail gas. I would also argue that, in the petrol industry, you should not need to own and have tied access arrangements to a petroleum terminal to be an effective retailer in that particular industry.

         So the concept of downstream access makes sense.

         The bill brought into the Senate is something that we have no problem with. The idea of an industry&amp;hyphen;wide access code seems to make some sense. The problem the Labor Party has with the provision concerns the amendments that the government put to its own bill in the Senate. They are amendments which minimise the public consultation process. They allow the
         <break page="2539" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         I believe, in principle—and I know I am supported throughout wide sectors of private industry in Australia—that the undertakings power and discretion of the ACCC needs to be treated with caution. It is not necessarily good public policy to expand the undertakings capacity of the ACCC without public consultation when there are, within the boardrooms of Australia and in the public arena, a whole set of concerns about the way in which the ACCC has been exercising those powers in the past.

         Now we have an aggressive campaign by Ampol&amp;hyphen;Caltex to try to apply those same standards of access to its three main competitors: BP, Shell and Ampol. It is not the role of the competition regulator, like the ACCC, to set one standard of regulations for one company in an industry and have the other three major competitors under a different set of industry rules. But that was the net effect of the ACCC discretionary use of the undertakings power in that industry. This was an instance of industry moulding—industry moulding in the case of petrol, the world according to Fels—rather than strict industry regulation where the regulations apply equally across the entire industry.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That has been a concern to participants in the petrol industry. It has been a concern remarked on by academics around Australia and, from my discussions, a concern with members on both sides of this parliament. Why should Ampol&amp;hyphen;Caltex have a different set of industry regulations and rules applied to it compared with its three major competitors? If undertakings are to be applied, they should be in the name of fair competition. They should be in the name of equal regulation right across all parts of a particular industry. This was a case of industry moulding.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The ACCC subsequently produced a report on petrol that used the Ampol&amp;hyphen;Caltex merger as an argument for retail market entry in the industry. You get more competition because Ampol&amp;hyphen;Caltex has opened up its terminals, and with extra imports of petrol this could facilitate new retail players in the market. This is an instance where, clearly, the ACCC decision or undertakings in terms of the Ampol and Caltex merger were framed to accommodate the matters ACCC had in mind for its petrol report to the federal government. It was an instance where it was moulding this industry according to its own priorities; moulding the industry in its own image, rather than setting regulations across the board that apply equally and fairly to all competitors in the industry. I am an opponent of industry moulding.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am an opponent of the way in which the ACCC used its undertakings power in the Ampol&amp;hyphen;Caltex case. If it was good enough for Ampol&amp;hyphen;Caltex to have terminal access imposed upon it by the ACCC, it should be good enough for BP and it should be good enough for Shell and Mobil. That is the best way to cleanly regulate an industry, instead of moulding it, knowing that there is a report coming up to be used in a fashion consistent with the dirty regulation of the petrol industry.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is the first instance that has been raised. I noticed recently, again, criticisms of the ACCC in these matters. Mr John David, the executive chairman of the wholesaler and grocery
         <break page="2540" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          retailer, Davids, has accused the ACCC of moving the goalposts to allow Woolworths Ltd into the wholesaling market. I will quote from the Australian
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Financial Review
          </emphasis>
          of 12 March:
         </break>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Mr David told reporters yesterday the ACCC had previously ruled that wholesaling and retailing were the one market for the purposes of making a decision on Davids' acquisition of QIW and Composite Buyers, and was now defining the markets as separate.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         This is another instance where the ACCC inconsistently is trying to mould industry outcomes—in this case to the benefit of Woolworths—instead of operating as a clean and consistent regulator that applies the same standard across time and the same standard to all participants in a particular industry.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is why the Labor Party is concerned about the government's decision to open up further powers of undertaking by the ACCC in this legislation without public consultation. If the industry code is to be altered by way of the ACCC's discretionary use of undertakings, why should the public not be involved in that process? Why should not all those industry players particularly affected by that decision be notified, be able to make submissions and, moreover, beyond that, why should they not have some power of appeal? Why should there not be a third party appeal right in these particular instances? The parliament is placing too much power and authority in the ACCC when on its track record it is not acting as a clean industry regulator, consistent across time and across the board with market participants. It is acting as a dirty regulator, moulding these industries according to its own priorities.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I express that concern in relation to the bill. I further point out to the Main Committee, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the Labor Party has amendments to move in detail. We seek to use this Trade Practices Amendment (Industry Access Codes) Bill 1996 to apply part 3A access—the downstream access regime—to petroleum terminals. These were amendments that were also moved in the Senate and defeated on the casting vote of Senator Colston in that chamber. The Labor Party will be persevering with those amendments, once the consideration in detail is referred to the main chamber of the House of Representatives.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is a debate that is, of course, relevant to this bill but it does not detract from the support that we can lend to the concept of general industry access code approval processes. It uses this bill, and the parliament's consideration of part 3A of the Trade Practices Act, as a vehicle for establishing downstream access in the petroleum industry. I see no difference between the structure of electricity, for instance, an homogenous product with a vertically integrated structure, and downstream access applying there. There is no difference to the way in which downstream access can be applied in petrol—again, an undifferentiated product with a vertical industry structure.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is interesting to note in that earlier decision by the ACCC that, for the purpose of groceries, retailing and wholesaling are part of the one market. If that standard were applied in petrol, why did the ACCC not recommend some vertical separation? Why are they willing to tolerate the situation where the major oil companies in Australia control the exploration, refining, distribution and retailing through the vertical control and ownership structure in this industry? Why did the ACCC not recommend some element of vertical separation? Why did they not recommend in their report last year the amendments that I will be moving in the Main Chamber; that is, to place the petroleum industry on the access regime, to give every single service station operator and distributor in Australia his or her chance to shop around for the cheapest wholesale petrol?

         <para first-indent="16">
          Those particular concepts, that particular use of part 3A of the Trade Practices Act, is becoming more relevant by the day. I refer to the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Daily Liberal
          </emphasis>
          , the newspaper in Dubbo where Woolworths has entered the industry. This is a report from last week, 14 March. It says that plunging petrol prices have Dubbo's fuel retailers on the brink of turmoil. One couple is netting as little as $300 for a combined total of 140 hours per week's work, slightly more than $2 per hour. Because Woolworths has got access to cheaper wholesale petrol than the oil majors will provide to their retailers, the whole generation of small businesses around country New South Wales—and it will happen right around the country—is being wiped out because of unfair competition.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Why should Woolworths have access to cheaper wholesale petrol that is being denied to existing service stations in country towns? There is a real risk right around the country that these country towns will become planet Woolworths. Woolworths will do all the petrol retailing, all the pharmacy work, all the newsagency work, and all the groceries. Every country town will become nothing more than a planet Woolworths where all other business interests are orbiting around the main business interest.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          That is not healthy at all. There is a legitimate argument to place the petrol industry on the access regime so that these retailers in Dubbo and beyond can access the same cheap wholesale petrol. I am getting into National Party language, aren't I? Someone has got to represent them effectively and it will be the Labor Party that says that those retailers in Dubbo should have the same access to cheaper wholesale petrol that Woolworths enjoys.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          For a government that talks about industry, entrepreneurialism and small business effort, how can they just sit there and grin at the prospect of small business—the Prime Minister's family once ran a business like this—netting as little as $300 for a combined total of 140 hours of work, all because the government will not accept the principle of fair wholesale competition in the petrol industry? All the government needs to do is tick off the Labor Party amendments in the Main Chamber and these people in Dubbo and hundreds like them around New South Wales and, indeed, the entire country, will have fair access to wholesale petrol and a fair chance to compete against Woolworths.

          I look forward to that debate in the main chamber. We had a very good debate, as I mentioned, in the Senate on these matters. The National Party, particularly the Queenslanders, went missing. Senator Boswell from Queensland, who talks the language of assisting small petrol retailers around his state, voted against the concept of putting the petrol industry on the access regime. He opposed the means by which these small businesses, these small petrol retailers, can have a fair crack at competition with the likes of Woolworths. If this government does not stand for something better than $300 total income for 140 hours of small business work, then something has gone wrong. There is a big gap between its rhetoric and the way in which its policies are playing out around regional Australia. So the Labor Party will be representing the interests of these people.
