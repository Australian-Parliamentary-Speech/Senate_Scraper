Mr Broinowski was tasked by my department on 3 March this year to provide information on the extradition and deportation arrangements in Honduras. I can inform the House that the tasking note did not allege or claim that Mr Dunn was certainly in Honduras, although it alluded to the fact that, first of all, his whereabouts was unknown and, secondly, that it was possible he was in Honduras.

There is this magnificent front page showing two Telstra employees. It was a happy day for Rebecca Trichter and Kylie Neal. Rebecca Trichter is a Telstra employee from Campbelltown in the western suburbs of Sydney. She is delighted. Kim is sad; she is happy. She lives in the electorate of the member for Werriwa who has a bit of form on the sale of public assets. You actually favour it, don't you? You actually think our policy is right. If you were an employee of Telstra, you would be one of the 92 per cent.

         Mr Speaker, I cannot think of a bigger majority than 92 per cent. I think it is a thumping endorsement from 92 per cent of the workers, many of them I am sure are traditional Labor Party voters and many of them would shake their heads. Look at the happy, excited faces! They absolutely radiate the enthusiastic embrace! But what do you get from the fellow opposite? `Oh, I'm sad. I'm sad.' I will tell you what, Kim: Rebecca is not sad. The other 92 per cent of the Telstra employees are not sad, the 600,000 Australians who bought shares for the first time are not sad either and the 1.8 million Australians who own shares in Telstra are not sad.

         I remind the House that once again the coalition has over&amp;hyphen;delivered. We have not just delivered on what we promised. We said we would sell a third. The coalition promised in the election campaign that two per cent would be reserved for Telstra employees. We delivered a 100 per cent improvement on that—four per cent of Telstra has been sold to the workers, to the battlers, to the people who normally regarded you people opposite as their friends, but no longer.

          Telstra has been a huge triumph. It is a good news story for the Australian economy. It is a good news story for the employees of Telstra. It is a good news story for the future of Australia. As this is the first question time that he has been present at since this very successful float, I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating my outstanding Minister for Finance and Administration—the Mr Telstra of the government—on the absolutely fantastic job he has done. All of those people who have enthusiastically embraced the Telstra float should be very grateful for the skill and professionalism that John Fahey has brought to the discharge of his responsibilities. In other words, I think it is a good result.

In fact, I said at a press conference 20 minutes after the share listed yesterday at 12.30 p.m. that I had no doubt that the Democrats would be preparing a press release saying that we sold it too cheaply. It is fairly obvious that the Democrats do not have the slightest idea of what the process is about. They have indicated from the very beginning that they were not the slightest bit interested in assisting with the sale of one-third of Telstra to give the Australian people a chance to purchase those shares, and they were aided and abetted by Labor in that process.

          —Some of your constituents have bought those shares. Throughout this process, the demand remained constant both in volume and in price—notwithstanding the correction that occurred on the market. On an examination of the book during the course of last week, it became clear that that demand, particularly from Australian price leadership, was above the upper end of the retail range—that is, $3.30. We had to test that demand in the interests of the taxpayers. I announced on Thursday morning that the range for institutional bidders, the upper end, would be $3.40.

         The other aspect which is very important in all of this is that, in the course of this period, our market has gone down seven per cent over the past few weeks.

The reason is that this government has the fundamentals right. We made it abundantly clear to the world that the stability of the Australian economy is there for all to see. That is why the investors continue to come for Telstra, and they continue to come from Australia and elsewhere.

          —I did not hear what you ruled out of order, sir, so I will not dispute your ruling. Can I say in response to the member for Kalgoorlie that I do not know all of the background to the question but, if the circumstances claimed by the member do in fact exist, this legislation certainly will provide a degree of predictability and certainty that is completely absent in the present law. Whatever views one may hold about the government's legislation, of one thing one can be absolutely certain: the proposition that in some way the existing law can be left as it is and the idea that you just sit there and do absolutely nothing is simply not an option.

         In answering the question raised by the honourable member I take the opportunity not only to confirm that the purpose of the legislation is to give certainty where there is now uncertainty and to give predictability where there is now unpredictability, but also to brand as completely misleading one or two of the general criticisms that are made of the government's native title proposals.

         There was an attempt made at the weekend, and it has been repeated in this parliament, to brand the legislation as in some way overturning the principles of the Mabo decision. It does not. The legislation leaves intact the principles laid down in the Mabo decision of the High Court of Australia. There is also a claim made by the critics of the legislation that the legislation extinguishes the common law rights of indigenous people as enunciated
         <break page="10615" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          in the Mabo and Wik decisions. Once again, that allegation is untrue.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In fact the very basis of the criticism of the legislation as being inadequate from some people on the government side of politics was that it did not go far enough in responding to the principles enunciated by the High Court in the Wik decision. The whole basis of the bill is to confirm the common law of Australia as defined by the High Court in the Wik decision and the Mabo decision, but to do it in a way that provides a less expensive, less cumbersome, more predictable and more balanced procedural set&amp;hyphen;up.

         One of the most argued issues in relation to the legislation is the right to negotiate. One of those things for which the government has been most trenchantly criticised in relation to the bill is that we propose to take away the right to negotiate concerning pastoral leases. I remind those people who make that criticism that the right to negotiate is not a common law right. The right to negotiate was not laid down as part of the common law of Australia or the Anglo&amp;hyphen;Australian common law by the High Court in the Mabo case. The right to negotiate was a special arrangement entered into by the former government in relation to the formation of its native title bill.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Those people who run around Australia, including those who sit opposite, saying that the right to negotiate is in some way a common law right are wrong. No other section of the community has a right to negotiate. I remind those people who are critics of the legislation that under the legislation it is still possible for the indigenous people of this country to make claims over 79 per cent of the landmass of Australia. We have a land acquisition fund of $1.3 billion. There are also large tracts of the Northern Territory which are in Aboriginal ownership as a result of the Northern Territory land rights legislation. On top of that, like any other Australian citizen, indigenous people have the right to own freehold land. Yet, in the face of all of that, the critics of the government would dare to say that this is unfair, racially based legislation.

         It is not unfair, racially based legislation. It is an honest, fair, balanced attempt by the

Listen to this: in 1991 Commonwealth net debt was $16.6 billion. After five more years of Keating government it went from $16.6 billion to $93.2 billion—5.6 times higher over five years, with no end in sight. The thing about these people is that not only were they wantonly irresponsible then; these people are recidivists—they want to do it again. They are out there opposing the Telstra sale because they do not want to retire debt. They are out there opposing measures to bring the budget back into balance because they want to drive it back into deficit again.

         In the past 20 months the government has already established a proud record of increasing opportunities in education and training. According to the latest estimates, the number of undergraduates in Australian universities this year is up some 17,000 over last year. There are some 55,000 extra places in TAFE this year, of which 43,000 are Commonwealth funded. In 1996&amp;hyphen;97 we anticipate that there will be some 98,000 apprenticeship and traineeship opportunities coming into existence, a 20 per cent increase on the previous year.

Tens of thousands of Australian students were locked out because you would not permit them to invest in their own education. Because the government has permitted that, we now know that in my home state of Victoria alone there have been some 10,000 applications from young Australians to take up these places, and there have been tens of thousands of applications in other states as well.

The group will be deployed in four locations on the island, comprising two elements: some truce monitors and a sizeable support and logistics element, and they will be made up of both military and civilian officers.

         Abolishing compulsory unionism is one of the great reforms of this government. When it comes to the Australian Public Service, not only have we introduced laws which protect the right of people to join a union or not to join a union but we have also written to people in the Australian Public Service and made it quite clear that, from our perspective as the employer, this must be a real choice. It is not just a choice which is legislated but a real choice in the options that people have. So we wrote to members of the Australian Public Service and said, `If you want to be in the union and you want the government to deduct the union fee from your wage packet, we will do so—no questions asked. Give us an authority and we will do so. If you do not wish to do so then of course we will not deduct from your pay.'

The exact number is 38.5 per cent and the actual number of employees affected is 12,961.

         There are proposals about to effectively repeal the changes that we made to the Workplace Relations Act. For example, the Labor Party are proposing the abolition of the office of employment advocate. The practical consequences of that would be to remove from employees an opportunity to have in force their rights as to whether or not they join a union. That is the implication of the abolition of the office of employment advocate, which was actually established to give real force and effect to the protections under our law to people who wish to exercise choice.

         The Labor Party's policy also proposes that development of representative organisations should be fostered. That is code for a special deal for the trade union organisations; in fact, a particular deal to prop up organisations which otherwise are not able to attract members by the quality of services. They also propose that:

         There are already, within the law, reasonable provisions to allow right of entry. This is code for allowing union people to get into businesses where they are not invited by the employees. It is the key for some union official to get into every small business in this country to bludgeon people into the trade union movement. The trade union movement today is losing members because it is unable to provide the services that rank and file people are looking for.

         We achieved all this at the same time as we reduced the cost to industry and improved our meat quality and safety record. Today, in conjunction with industry, I announced further major changes. The first is a series of technical reforms which will reduce the cost to industry by about $12 million or $13 million a year and which have been very widely welcomed by industry. The second achievement that we announced—and I am very proud of this, if I can say so to Mr Reith—is in the area of workplace reform: the first certified agreement to be ratified for the Commonwealth Public Service. It will reduce cost to industry by a further $5 million a year. It will deliver further substantial reductions in administration and processing costs by providing more flexible employment arrangements for meat inspectors, and it will harmonise AQIS and industry working hours, which is something that you could never do and are incapable of doing.

          —Does the Prime Minister recall saying at the time of the sell-off that it was all the gold producers' fault and the Treasurer asserting indifference to the consequences of the sell&amp;hyphen;off on the basis that people still wore gold jewellery? Prime Minister, how is this defending regional jobs and sticking up for Australian miners?

          —I have not seen the full context of those remarks. Although it is always an enormous risk to do so, let us for a moment assume that perhaps on this occasion a member of the Labor Party frontbench may have correctly quoted in part what somebody said. Judging by the reaction of my colleague the Treasurer, I do not think that is likely. I gather that a search is now being undertaken for the full text. We will be very happy to facilitate an addition to the answer that I am going to give.

         I say to the member for Perth that the decision that was taken by the Reserve Bank of Australia to sell gold was fully in accord with well developed international practice in
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          relation to gold. In other words, what the Reserve Bank did on that occasion was what you will never do: that is, look after the Australian national interest. What the Reserve Bank did on that occasion was to ensure the proper investment of the assets held by the Reserve Bank. It was clearly in the interests of the Reserve Bank and clearly in Australia's interests that there be some change in gold holdings into other currencies. It is a practice that has been followed for years, but you allow me once again to draw the House's attention to the fact that all the time over the last six months that we have been defending Australia's national interest overseas you have been denigrating our efforts.

You have not been defending the interests of Australian workers. Just as you are out of touch with 92 per cent of Telstra workers, so you are out of touch with the fact that our policy on greenhouse has won more plaudits in the member for Cunningham's electorate, more plaudits in the member for Charlton's electorate and more plaudits in the member for Hunter's electorate.

        The committee believes that the disclosures referred to in items (1) to (3) above, both separately and taken together, constitute a substantial interference with its work because they provide the basis upon which a totally one&amp;hyphen;sided view of it activities is presented to the public. Such disclosures give an unfair and unconscionable advantage to those members of the committee who provide these materials before they are agreed to be published. It denies the recipients of the selected information the opportunity to assist the whole of the committee's deliberations in context. Therefore, there tends to be biased reporting of the operations of the committee being presented to the public.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The committee believes that the disclosures have certainly damaged the committee and have made it much less likely that our work can be completed in a cooperative atmosphere. This has exacerbated the partisan atmosphere that has unfortunately entered recent deliberations and it has diminished the prospects of building mutual trust and respect between committee members.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The disclosures referred to in item (4) have allowed the media to suggest that the committee is trying to suppress evidence provided to it by the Aboriginal people. This in turn has the potential to create an atmosphere of hostility towards the committee by non-English speaking Aboriginal people. Given the nature of the committee's statutory duties, any perception in the Aboriginal community that the committee does not deal fairly with the evidence clearly constitutes a substantial interference with its work.

        The disclosures referred to in item (5) constitute a substantial interference with the committee's work because it exposes the internal working and preliminary thinking of the committee to public comment and pressure in inappropriate ways. It undermines the confidence that private deliberations will remain confidential. This severely impairs the workings of the committee, especially in its private deliberations. Because the

        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Sydney Morning Herald
        </emphasis>
        had already run articles, the value of the committee's report had been downgraded and, consequently, the committee's report was not given the prominence in those papers which the committee might otherwise have expected. There is also the concern that the inability to prevent these disclosures or to take action against the people who have so damaged the committee may spill over and affect the work of other committees.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The disclosure of the matter referred to in item (6) also constitutes substantial interference in that it purports to present a private deliberation of the committee into the public domain without the committee authorising such disclosure or explaining the circumstances surrounding the particular resolution. This has done damage to the reputation of the committee. Any recurrence will lead to the committee system needing a
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Hansard
        </emphasis>
        for its private proceedings so that all considerations taken into account in supporting or defeating a motion can be properly weighed up.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Finally, the committee believes that the accumulative effect of these apparent unauthorised disclosures constitutes a substantial and serious interference with the work of the committee in that it creates a perception that the committee cannot maintain confidentiality and is unable to appropriately conduct its affairs, particularly in relation to sensitive issues such as the matters dealt with in this inquiry.
       </para>

        The committee accordingly considers that a prima facie case of substantial interference has been established and requests that a

          —I present a progress report from KPMG, the Department of House Representatives' internal auditor, on their audit of members' travelling allowance for 1995-96. The progress report relates to the 1995-96 period of the 1995-97 audit. It describes the methodology used in the data matching and reports on preliminary findings to date. There were 9,357 individual travel allowance claims matched against the then Department of Administrative Services and other travel records. As of today, 9,339 claims or 99.8 per cent have been reconciled, leaving 18 remaining. Of these 18 claims, 14 were not able to be reconciled because information was not available from former members, and KPMG is continuing the reconciliation process for the remaining four. As a result of the audit checking process, it is currently anticipated that net repayments to the department will total around $11,670. This amount
          <break page="10634" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           represents 0.8 per cent of expenditure on travel allowance by the Department of the House of Representatives for 1995-96. The overall outcome of the audit to date is, in my view, very positive both for members and for the Department of the House of Representatives' administration.

         Mass poverty is the single most important economic and social issue on our planet today. Some 1.3 billion people, nearly a quarter of the world's population, continue to live in extreme poverty, trying to survive on less than $1 a day. Over half of these poor are in the Asia&amp;hyphen;Pacific. Even in countries which have been developing rapidly, the vast majority of people are incomparably worse off than ourselves. The average income of people living in Indonesia is a mere six per cent of that in Australia, people in China earn only three per cent of what we do. The enduring challenge for most of these countries is to provide their people with such basics as food, clean water and education for their children. Meeting this challenge has proven to be no easy task.

         On my most recent visit to Papua New Guinea, earlier this month, I saw at first hand the devastating effects of the worst drought in perhaps 100 years. Expert assessments—funded by Australia's aid program—show that as many as half a million people, in a population of only four million, are affected. With my colleagues, the Minister for Defence, Mr McLachlan, and my parliamentary secretary, Kathy Sullivan, I flew by RAAF Caribou to Pumani in Milne Bay Province. We wanted to see for ourselves the work funded by our aid program. Stowed in the aircraft were 150 sacks of rice. When we set down, the plight of the people of Papua New Guinea was clear.

        <para first-indent="16">
         These people had not seen rain in many months. There was no fruit on the trees. Vines were brown and withered. The soil had turned to dust. Water supplies were a long distance from homes, and were polluted. Children had the distended bellies we know is a sign of malnutrition.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Australia has reacted rapidly and generously to the prospect of this human suffering on our doorstep. Ten Australian Defence Force aircraft are now ferrying essential foods into the most inaccessible areas of Papua New Guinea to feed the worst affected people. Several Australian NGOs are also assisting with drought relief.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Both the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and I have reassured the government and the people of Papua New Guinea that Australia will stand by them in their hour of need. If the rains fail, and the next growing season is lost, that need will be immense.

         The Australian aid program has played a vital role in nearly every major humanitarian emergency in the world over the last 30 years. But by far the greatest focus of our aid efforts has been on the basic building blocks of sustainable development. Since the establishment of the Colombo Plan in the early 1950s, our aid program has touched the lives
         <break page="10636" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          of millions of people in developing countries, many of whom are our immediate neighbours. This is a record of which Australia can be proud. It is a record I am committed to continuing.

         For some time I have been concerned that the aid program has been in danger of losing focus on its core developmental role. For this reason, an independent review of Australia's aid program was foreshadowed in our pre&amp;hyphen;election platform, known as A Confident Australia—and in June last year I instituted such a review. The review committee, headed by Paul Simons and including Gaye Hart and Cliff Walsh, all of whom are in the House today, produced an excellent report. This report, and the public comments on its recommendations, have played a key role in determining the future directions of Australia's aid program.

         Objective of the Aid Program
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Simons committee confirmed my concern that the aid program had become burdened by a range of competing interests. A clear development objective for the aid program is needed. The aid program cannot and should not be a vehicle for other purposes, such as short&amp;hyphen;term commercial goals.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Government has determined that the objective of the Australian overseas aid program will be `to advance Australia's national interest by assisting developing countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development'. This objective is consistent with the course set in the government's white paper on foreign and trade policy.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I know that some people in the community think that there is a choice between dealing with problems at home or providing assistance overseas. This is a misunderstanding and it is self&amp;hyphen;defeating. The promotion of sustainable development overseas and the pursuit of Australia's long&amp;hyphen;term national interest are inextricably linked.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Those who say Australia should not have an overseas aid program are nothing more than political opportunists whose world view extends no further than their front gate. Let us remember, it was the member for Oxley (Ms
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          Hanson) who called for Australia to disband its aid program and then almost immediately after called for increased support for the people of North Korea. She cannot have it both ways. The fact is the provision of well&amp;hyphen;targeted aid gives Australia another strong means of playing a leading role in our developing region.

         Economic growth and rising incomes in developing countries foster stability and expand trade and investment opportunities for Australia. The aid program generates considerable goodwill in the region and provides an important foundation for broader bilateral relations.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The aid program is an important instrument for addressing the non&amp;hyphen;military threats to Australian security. The effects of poverty extend beyond national boundaries. Pandemics, illegal migration, refugee flows, global environment problems, narcotics and transnational crime are often directly related to poverty.

Our program will be determined and implemented in partnership with developing countries. This will guarantee that it remains focused on meeting their priority needs. Second, we will be responsive to urgent needs and development trends. Our aid program will provide rapid relief to victims of natural disasters and emergencies and take account of changing pressures in developing countries.

          on practical efforts that can alleviate poverty and promote sustainable development. Fourth, there will be greater targeting. Australia's aid program cannot afford to be all things to all people—greater definition and targeting is essential. Clear priorities have been identified, and our efforts will be assessed against these priorities. Fifth, our aid program will remain identifiably Australian—it is a reflection of Australian values and is a projection of these values abroad. Finally, the program will be outward looking. It will be open to new ideas and approaches. It will seek to draw on the best ideas in Australia and overseas.

NGOs will be expected to demonstrate tangible community support for their development activities. The government now requires NGOs seeking funding from AusAID to have a recognised development expenditure of at least $30,000 annually. This is part of a rigorous accreditation process to ensure government funds are channelled through NGOs that have substantial community support and are of sufficient size and professionalism to be able to deliver aid programs overseas.

         The Australian aid program currently provides bilateral assistance only in the form of grants, regardless of the country, sector and project involved. Grants are not the only way to deliver aid. I believe that, if introduced, the right sort of soft loans would be a useful instrument for aid delivery. Such loans should not be an imitation of Labor's discredited DIFF scheme, which the Simons committee considered flawed as both aid and industry assistance. I notice that even the Labor Party, which made such a fuss at the time of its abolition, has now decided that a DIFF&amp;hyphen;style scheme should not be part of the aid program. I congratulate the Labor Party on seeing some sense.

          —by leave—I am very pleased to have this opportunity to speak on Australia's overseas aid program. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) has just tabled the government's response to the Simon's committee report to review Australia's overseas aid program, commissioned in May last year and presented to the foreign minister 12 months later. Today we have heard the government's response.

         The Minister for Foreign Affairs has rightly identified the existence of mass poverty as the single most important economic and social issue on our planet today. Eliminating the disparities between the world's rich and poor is one of the critical international challenges of our time. There is no doubt that the overall success of development in recent decades has been very significant. Many more people live longer, fewer mothers die in childbirth and fewer infants die from preventable diseases, but the numbers living in poverty have continued to grow. Too many people—indeed 1.3
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

         Global inequality has increased. It is a salutary fact that the poorest fifth of the world's population have seen their share of global income fall to less than two per cent while the richest fifth, by contrast, have seen their share rise to 85 per cent. Such inequality is grotesque when one considers the fact that the combined net income of the seven richest individuals in the world would easily cover the estimated $80 billion cost of achieving basic social services for everyone currently living in absolute poverty and would get them out of income poverty.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Eliminating poverty is affordable and achievable. The major UN conferences of recent years have drawn together a broad framework for cooperation that should deliver sustained progress, but to succeed we clearly need to mobilise greater political will across the international community. Both altruism and self&amp;hyphen;interest require that Australia embrace its responsibility to actively assist the economic and social advancement of people in developing countries, especially the poorest countries and communities.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In the first instance, the provision of development assistance by countries such as Australia does reflect a basic and fundamental obligation—an obligation deeply embedded in our core national values. It is our duty to care about other people, in particular those less well off than ourselves. We have a moral duty to reach out to the poor and the needy.

If we do not do so, there is a real danger that, by the middle of the next century, the world may simply not be sustainable. It could certainly be dangerously unstable. Global poverty is unquestionably a leading source of international insecurity with high levels of poverty linked to political and economic instability, human rights abuses, unrest and war, uncontrolled migration and population growth, and environmental degradation. If we are to pass on a safe world to the next generation, we must eradicate these

The problem of global poverty and injustice is right here on Australia's doorstep and we cannot shirk this responsibility.

         When the foreign minister announced the establishment of the review headed by Mr Paul Simons, he rightly said that Australia has an overseas aid program of which all Australians can be proud. In his press release on 28 May last year, he put the following on the record:

        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         Eighteen months on, I think it is worth noting the very large degree of continuity in approach manifested both in the Simons committee report and in the government's broad acceptance of its recommendations today. The introduction to the report states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         We do not advocate revolutionary change. The basic arrangement of the aid program is sound. The design and management of the program should continue to be the responsibility of a single, independent agency. The countries of East Asia and the Pacific should continue to be the primary focus.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         Similarly, the minister's statement today is not a statement signalling dramatic change. It is essentially a further step in the ongoing evolution of our overseas aid program—a program which enjoys strong bipartisan support. For our part, the Labor opposition welcomed the establishment of the Simons review. In ever changing international circumstances, the continued review of Australia's overseas aid program is critically important for maximising its effectiveness and for making sure that we maintain its primary focus of contributing to lasting poverty reduction while advancing Australia's national interests.

         Although many individual Australian aid programs and projects have been subject to

         I should also acknowledge today that the Simons report and many submissions by NGOs to the review committee and to the government in response to the report itself have made very useful contributions to the Labor Party's review of our own approach to overseas aid issues in the run&amp;hyphen;up to our next national conference in the coming January.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Against that background, I would like to take this opportunity to comment briefly on some of the major recommendations of the Simons report and to make some remarks about our overall approach to these vital issues. The primary recommendation of the Simons report is that there should be one clear, development focused objective for Australia's overseas aid program. The government have accepted this recommendation and determined that the objective of the aid program will be to:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">

        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         The minister has, from time to time, sought to make something of a political point by suggesting that our overseas aid program has come to be characterised by a confusion of goals and objectives under the former Labor government. He can make that point, as he has, when he wishes, but it is not one that we accept.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For my part today, I would like to welcome, on a bipartisan basis, the adoption of a single, development focused objective as being very positive indeed. Such an objective is fully consistent with and supportive of Australia's long&amp;hyphen;term security and economic interest. While the provision of development assistance may also support immediate foreign policy objectives, the pursuit of short&amp;hyphen;term diplomatic and trade interests can easily undermine the effectiveness of our aid program and should not determine development
         <break page="10641" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          assistance priorities. The challenge for the government will now be to give practical effect to this new objective and to maintain that focus amidst the inevitable diplomatic and economic pressure on our overseas aid program. To do that will require real commitment, and the opposition will keep a close watch on the government's performance.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the course of his statement today, the minister has also set out a number of key principles to underpin Australia's aid programs, primarily through a by no means exclusive concentration on development assistance activities in the Asia&amp;hyphen;Pacific. For the record, I would like to take this opportunity to spell out some of the elements of Labor's approach, as recently approved by the national security and trade policy committee, for consideration by our forthcoming national conference.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Australia's overseas aid program should, in cooperative partnership with developing countries and peoples, assist in building foundations for broadly based, equitably distributed and sustainable economic growth. We should encourage responsible national economic policies, including support for the development of efficient, accountable and fair government administration. Our aid program should give priority to breaking down barriers to the participation by the poor in economic and social development, and especially support activities which enable women to contribute and benefit from development. We should also seek to increase the productivity of the poor by facilitating access by them to productive assets and credit, and access to supporting activities including health care, education and training, and appropriate agricultural technology.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In broad terms, these are the goals which find expression in the Simons report. In a number of respects, however, the report and the government's response to it fall short of what we might have hoped for. One of these is in the issue of human rights. Aid to reduce poverty must be based on fundamental human rights principles, including the right to development. The Simons report is unquestionably weak in the human rights area. It speaks loosely of support for good governance and
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          there is clearly scope to see a much greater recognition of the international human rights framework as a framework for aid policy programs. It is significant that the Simons report does not have a single recommendation on human rights, and the government's response is little better. For our part, Labor is determined to give high priority to support for and enhancement of the full range of human rights for people in developing countries. To do so is a central and integrating element of our approach to overseas aid.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the time available, and I accept that it is brief, I would like to take up two recommendations in the Simons report which have not been accepted by the government. The first of these relates to the issue of tied aid. At present, Australia requires approximately 44.4 per cent of our aid to be used to buy Australian goods and services. That is twice the OECD average of 22.2 per cent. There is certainly a case, from a development point of view, that whatever goods and services can be sourced at reasonable prices in a developing country should be. That way, multiplier effects of aid within the country are greater, and skills and capabilities are developed. At the same time there is good reason, in terms of accountability, economic interest and national profile, for Australia's aid programs to utilise Australian suppliers.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is clearly a difficult issue. I am aware of the considerable support within the NGOs for the report's recommendations that AusAID move towards greater untying of the aid program and that it untie aid totally for the poorest countries, particularly untying bilateral aid programs elsewhere. Here the government has accepted the Simons recommendations only in part, encouraging a greater participation of recipient country personnel in the delivery of aid while continuing to maintain a strong Australian identity for our aid program. The Labor opposition concurs with this broad approach.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The final issue I want to take up is that of the overall level of Australia's overseas development assistance. As the minister has noted, the volume of aid spending will always be a difficult issue. The opposition welcomes the government's expressed commitment to supp
         <break page="10642" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
          ort the United Nations 0.7 per cent ODA&amp;hyphen;GNP ratio target. As the Simons report makes clear, such a commitment has little credibility unless a realistic framework is set for Australia to work towards that ultimate goal.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As we stand, thanks to the last two years of real budget cuts, Australia's level of overseas development assistance is at an all&amp;hyphen;time low at 0.27 per cent of GNP. Australia's aid level now rates 13th out of 21 OECD countries—a drop from ninth in the previous year. In that context, it is no surprise that the government has declined to set any interim target whatsoever.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Ultimately, however, overseas aid is about practical outcomes and the allocation of real resources. Commissioning reports and reviews is no substitute for real political commitment to deliver the goods and to be held accountable for one's performance. As I said earlier in my remarks, we clearly need to mobilise greater political will across the international community if the world is to successfully meet the challenge of global poverty. For our part, I anticipate that at our national conference next January Labor will undertake to ensure that Australia's overseas aid as a percentage of GNP is not further reduced and will commit us to working towards an interim development assistance target of 0.4 per cent of GNP by the year 2005. This is, I believe, a realistic and achievable goal. With an overseas aid level of 0.2 per cent, Australia is not merely failing to give leadership on this vital global issue, we are dragging the chain.

          —The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) at CHOGM proclaimed what he called `differentiation in our time'. It is a peculiarly apposite reference, for all its connotations of ignorance, naivety and, most importantly, impending doom. We have to have a far more ambitious point of reference to deal with this problem than that of Neville Chamberlain in 1938. As with so much else, this government is incapable of offering the leadership to provide one. Greenhouse is a defining challenge for political leadership. It does not respect national borders, it resists easy solutions and it requires energy, unity, purpose and courage.

         With all the information that is available to our Prime Minister and with his capacity to analyse the effects that this could conceivably have on the Australian economy, on the Australian environment and on our social life, his contribution to this over the last 18 months has been not only to preside over the removal of very substantial programs that were in place to deal with greenhouse gas emission problems in this country which were to make a contribution to the international reduction of greenhouse gas emissions but also to eliminate $100 million of direct expenditure and another $300 million of expenditure that related to the environment. My colleague, our spokesman on the environment, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) will deal with details of all of this a bit later. The Prime Minister's contribution was to eliminate all of that. He then wanders around the globe like Orphan Annie, despe

         He stands up and says that in this process he is defending the Australian national interest. Competence in diplomacy is what defends the Australian national interest, and we have not had that from the Prime Minister. Instead, when anybody moves away from a negotiating position which they have put down, we have these pathetic claims that somehow or other they were influenced by Australia to that position, that they arrived at that conclusion because at last they got the idea that Australia should be left alone in these processes.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The obvious point to make is this: there is a whole range of people out there in the international community taking different negotiating positions to Kyoto, expressing those positions vehemently and being ready at the end of the day to compromise them in relation to targets, the level of mandatory application and what will be acceptable practices in the international community to meet a set of targets, if they are set.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The problem with all of the Prime Minister's approaches is this: everybody else is operating on the assumption that, if not at Kyoto then at least at some point subsequently, international targets will be met. There will be an international consensus about what ought to be done. The Prime Minister, in the various statements he has been making—and remember that now, 18 months on, we are only two weeks away from Kyoto—has dealt himself persistently out of any international consensus. He knows that that has potential economic consequences for this country, as evidenced by the fact that there is leaking from the foreign minister's department about defensive positions being prepared by us at the WTO to evade the position of `should mandatory targets produce mandatory sanctions?' As far as that is concerned, the opposition shares the concern of those bureaucrats that that may well be what eventuates.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Underlying all of this is the militant refusal of the Prime Minister to say we have a problem. It may be said in parentheses and footnotes but never directly. The fundamental issue here is that there is a greenhouse gas

          problem. While there are differences among scientists as to what it constitutes, there are no differences among scientists as to whether or not there is one. It is merely gradations now. All scientific opinion of any reliability now assumes that there is a substantial greenhouse problem, to which Australia contributes. Some 1.4 per cent of greenhouse gas is generated from Australia—by 0.3 per cent of the world's population.

         The Prime Minister says that, if we accept the sorts of targets the Americans or the Europeans put up, 90,000 jobs will be lost and 70c per litre will be added to the cost of our petrol. The Prime Minister has advice but he does not share it with the community. That is one set of his economic statistics. None emerge on what the consequences would be were we to confront over the next 50 years what the scientists, either moderately or in extremity, say would be the effects of global warming.

          What are some of the dimensions that we need? We need—there is no-one else to advocate it—the inclusion of carbon sinks in the global abatement equation. We must have the opportunity to address our target with reafforestation programs—like Labor's one billion trees program—and with programs which can also provide valuable employment, opportunities for our young unemployed, control of soil erosion, and a relief of pressure on our native forests by providing an expanded timber resource stream to ensure continuing opportunity for our forestry and timber industries.

          Only Australia is going to argue for the concept of a carbon sink. The Europeans could not give a damn. They are not going to do any reafforestation. It is out of the ken of the way in which the Americans see the world. The developing countries are not going to argue too heavily for it, given their propensity to deforest themselves. Therefore, Australia, if we are going to be able to produce an outcome which gets anywhere near any targets which anybody expects of us, will have to put that in the ledger, will have to put that in the pot, will have to come to some conclusions on that.

What we are going to get is Mr Hill. He is the only person who will be appearing from the government side in these discussions; discussions which the Prime Minister says may produce outcomes devastating to the Australian economy. It was the same sort of speech of the problems that we confront which presaged his non-appearance at New York. He chose Lords as his location instead of New York when this issue was last taken up.

         The Leader of the Opposition has picked up the alarmist rhetoric that some of the environmental groups use in claiming that science shows that by the year 2010 sea levels could rise between one and two metres. If you hold a senior position in government or in opposition, you should mount your argument based on some sort of fact. The simple fact is that the science that has been done internationally on this issue by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change shows that, unlike the Leader of the Opposition's claim, by the year 2010 sea levels are likely to rise between 15 and 95 centimetres, with an average of 50 centimetres.

You are going to have to explain to the Australian people why, in net present value terms, the welfare of each Australian under your proposal could fall by around $US6,500. That is what you are going to have to explain to the Australian people. If you wish to attempt to disabuse the ABARE model—the Megabare model—then you are disabusing yourselves because it was originally established under your government, by your government, according to the guidelines laid down by your government.

         We have done a number of different analyses on what is now the Labor proposition. Another of those analyses shows that, in the energy intensive sector alone, projects valued at around $68 billion would be placed at risk by your proposal. Let us have a look at the regional impact of this. In regional terms, the people whom the Labor Party are going to strike at are the people overwhelmingly represented by the Labor Party. You think you can take your blue&amp;hyphen;collar workers in safe Labor seats completely for granted. How are you going to explain that the regions of Australia that will be most directly affected by your proposals will be places like the Illawarra and the Hunter in New South Wales, the Bowen Basin and Gladstone in Queensland, Geelong and Latrobe Valley in Victoria, the Iron Triangle in South Australia and, as the Leader of the Opposition himself readily concedes, the Kwinana region in Western Australia.

Let me tell you—not according to me but according to those officials who loyally served the Labor Party in government and loyally serve the coalition, and they do so with the greatest objectivity. Those officials say that the sectors that would be hardest hit in Australia include the non&amp;hyphen;ferrous metals industry whose output, it is estimated, will be 50 per cent lower in 2010 than it would otherwise have been. So you are happy to reduce the output of the non&amp;hyphen;ferrous metal industry sector by 50 per cent.

The likely impact of that, which we have had modelled, would be that the wheat industry alone, which is worth $3.4 billion to the Australian economy in Western Australia—they have already seen average rainfall fall 22 per cent since the 1930s—will be severely hit.

         Another interesting option has developed on the  international stage. It has been developed by an Australian working at one of the world's most prestigious research institutions—the Brooking Institute—Professor Warwick McKibbin. Professor McKibbin proposes the development in each country of a domestic system of tradeable emission credits designed to encourage the most economically efficient developments to meet internationally determined greenhouse reduction targets. The volume of credits issued in each country would be determined initially, and over future years, within each country but would clearly need to be within the parameters set by the international community.

         —On a personal explanation, I have inadvertently misled the House, and I want to correct my misleading of the House. In my remarks I talked about a one- to two-metre rise and the potential impact that would have on various coastal areas of my constituency. The federal parliamentary library research paper on which we rely that went to these things talked about a temperature increase of 3.5 degrees Celsius producing a sea level rise of 0.95 of a metre—effectively a metre. So the one to two metres was, in that sense, an exaggeration. Based on that parliamentary research, a rise of effectively one metre, or 0.95 of a metre, would indeed have a very substantial impact, as I outlined.

          . I am sure that is no surprise to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Vaile), who is at the table, or to the government. I will briefly explain why the opposition will be voting against these particular measures. These measures seek to sell the assets that are currently contained within the National Transmission Agency. The National Transmission Agency is one of the world's largest broadcasting facilities. It includes 1,197 transmitters used to broadcast the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Special Broadcasting Service's radio and television services right around the Australian continent. The NTA facilities also accommodate 503 transmitters belonging to licensed broadcasters and more than 1,000 radio communications transmitters.

         The NTA is a very important organisation that has performed its role more than admirably over the last few decades. I will outline in a few minutes some of the improved and more efficient performances and achievements which the NTA has clocked up in the last few years. We believe that, because of the NTA's excellent performance in recent days, there is no argument for the government to be bringing these measures before the parliament to seek to flog off the National Transmission Agency. I make it clear that the opposition has not been provided with a copy of the scoping study which has been ordered by the government and provided to the government. That scoping study certainly would have
         <break page="10655" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          provided the opposition with a great deal more financial information and more information about whether the government is proceeding down the best route in maximising the return to taxpayers and seeking to protect the public interest.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Although the bill guarantees access to the NTA facilities for the ABC and SBS for the next five years, there is very little information as to what will happen after those five years. You can imagine the difficulty that the national broadcasters will be in in seeking to negotiate with a company or a series of companies which will have a clear monopoly over the transmission facilities and the transmission network. The bill also contains no guarantees regarding maintenance of services in rural and regional areas. While the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) in his second reading speech made certain claims that the contract with the purchaser of the network would look after these matters, this guarantee should appear in the bill if this parliament is to have any faith that the government and the new owner will meet these obligations of looking after the bush. There is also nothing in the bill that guarantees that the current policy objectives of the NTA will be maintained. While the bill does contain some limited community service obligations, these are much more constrained than those which are currently in existence.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Finally, the government claims that it will draw up a compact with SBS and the ABC which will seek to spell out what the coverage and quality expectations will be for the new owner. In return, the government claims it will be covering the cost of the transmission contracts for the next five years. But, when you look at the fine detail, Madam Deputy Speaker, you see that there are a number of questions which are left up in the air. They are the reasons why the opposition remains concerned about the impact of this particular bill and they are the reasons why the opposition believes the government has not made the case for privatising and selling off the National Transmission Agency's assets. We believe that the ABC and SBS should continue to be able to use the facilities of an
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          organisation which is owned and controlled by the Commonwealth of Australia.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let me go through our reasons for saying this. I think it is very difficult for anyone to claim that the NTA today is an inefficient organisation. The NTA has over the last few years dramatically expanded its network. In June 1992 the NTA's predecessor was looking after 862 transmitters broadcasting the national services. By June 1997 there were 1,197. We can see that there has been a dramatic expansion in the NTA's network, which required a substantial injection of capital from the former federal government, in which I had the honour of serving for part of the time as Minister for Communications and the Arts. That expansion of services, for example, has seen national radio and television services extended to a further 1.3 million Australians. In particular, I know you, Madam Speaker Kelly, as a keen Triple J listener, would welcome the fact that ABC services have been extended to a further 468,000 Australians. I am not sure whether there are any in your electorate. I imagine there are some.

        <para first-indent="16">
         But let me return to the matter before the House. The expansion of services has also seen SBS television provided to another 453,000 Australians. So the NTA has dramatically extended its network, particularly in rural and regional areas, where under the former government there was a dramatic expansion in the provision of radio services to Australians living in the bush. The most important of these of course was the expansion of Triple J. That expansion has revolutionised Triple J. So it has been good not only for the many Triple J listeners in the bush but also for the nature of the service which Triple J provides to its listeners in capital cities.

          CDs have allowed city people to have better access to the great Australian music out there in rural and regional areas.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Madam Deputy Speaker, for those Australians in your electorate who might not be tuned in every day to Triple J, there has also been a dramatic expansion in the provision of Radio National and Classic FM services and that has also provided a much wider choice to those Australians who live in the bush. That has not been cheap and has required a significant injection of capital under the former government. To be fair to this government, it has also provided some money for a continuation of the former government's program to expand SBS television to electorates around the country.

Anyone who owns a network of this size always has to make sure that the transmitters remain relatively modern and up to date, otherwise the costs of maintenance go through the roof. At the moment the average life of NTA transmitters is about 7&amp;half; years. The average working life of a transmitter these days is about 15 years, so the NTA is doing pretty well on that score as well.

          The NTA, under its current general manager, Vic Jones, and through a lot of hard work by it dedicated staff, has been able to make these dramatic expansions in the size and the reach of the network and has been able to spend a lot of money replacing out&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;date equipment, despite dramatic budget cuts being made to that organisation. That might be no surprise, given that the peak of the expansion of the program has passed in recent days, but the NTA, through its program of putting maintenance activities to tender, has implemented some quite significant savings in its

           recurrent costs. All that has meant that the NTA is delivering a service not just to the national broadcasters but also to the taxpayer in an efficient manner, one which I think has been very good for the Australian community.

          The government claims that it has to go through with this privatisation process so that, basically, it can get its hands on the cash. The government believes that, by selling off the National Transmission Agency, the money that it gets from that sale can be used to pay off government debt. We also have the claim that the national broadcasters will be happier little vegemites, according to the government. Let me quote from the speech in this House of the Minister for Family Services, who said:

          You can almost hear the champagne corks popping at Ultimo, according to the minister's remarks here about how the ABC and SBS `have been seeking such a relationship for many years'. That is not quite true. For many years the ABC and SBS have wanted to own the NTA. The ABC and SBS have campaigned for many years for these assets to be transferred to the national broadcasters. The ABC and SBS have never, to the best of my knowledge, been arguing for the NTA to be sold off. During the time I was the Minister for Communications and the Arts, the reason why the ABC and SBS never came to me arguing for the NTA to be sold off is that they knew what was going to happen as a result of this government's ideological obsession with privatisation.

          There will be a significant and dramatic change once the NTA's assets are sold off, and in some ways it is already starting to happen. My evidence for this has been provided by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), who is not able to speak in this debate tonight because of some events that happened at question time today. On behalf of the member for Hunter and at his request, I would like to explain to the House one matter which has already seen a clear indication that certain promises that have been made and certain actions that were promised and were expected to take place have now been cancelled simply because this government has decided to sell off the National Transmission Agency.

          It affects an area called Wollombi on the edge of my electorate. The honourable member for Hunter has worked very hard to look after the constituents that live in this area. I will read from a letter to the honourable member for Hunter written by Graeme Barrow, of the Business Development Unit of the NTA, dated 10 November this year in response to a request from the member for Hunter for background information on the NTA's decision not to proceed with a project to install a translator facility for ABC and SBS television services in the Wollombi area.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It goes on to explain that the reason the NTA intended to install the infill translator in the Wollombi area is that the ABC is currently broadcast on Channel 5A in the Newcastle region but, as we all know, at some stage in the future proposals will be put to the government to shut down Channel 3 and Channel 5A on the VHF spectrum. People living in the Hunter area will then be relying on UHF services to continue to receive signals such as ABC television. The letter says:

         <para font-size="-=2">
          The NTA is aware of several localities in the Newcastle region where reception of UHF services is difficult, chiefly because of the terrain. As indicated, Wollombi is one of these localities. With this in mind, the NTA decided to work towards installing an infill translator facility for the area. The community was consulted about its views on a suitable site for the facility and other possibilities were investigated before the NTA presented two
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           site options designed to serve the greatest number of people. The Wollombi &amp; Lower Hunter TV Action Group gave support to one of these sites in a letter to the NTA dated 6 March 1996.

What is quite clear is that, as a result of this government's decision to sell the National Transmission Agency, the people who were hoping that the government would be continuing to fund and install that infill translator—the residents of Wollombi—have been disappointed. That is now on hold and those residents will not hold their breath waiting for a private sector operator to spend a substantial amount of money to provide ABC and SBS services to a new group of Australians who live in the bush. That raises the general question—

           —The difficulty the honourable member for Moreton has is that his government, through its decision to sell the National Transmission Agency, as evidenced in this letter, is going to deny any opportunities for adequate services to be provided to people who live in places such as Wollombi and to  Australians who do not currently receive national broadcaster services.

          That goes to the nub of the causes for our concerns about the National Transmission Network Sale Bill. We believe that the National Transmission Agency should be kept under pressure and should be required to operate as efficiently as possible. Through the provision of contracting its maintenance, it has certainly lifted its game, but I think it is going to be very hard for the government to argue that privatising is going to provide significant benefits. The basis for that claim is that, according to the NTA's general manager, Mr Vic Jones, in the draft annual report for 1996&amp;hyphen;97:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          The cost to the Government of funding the network has been reduced to the level at which it is hard to discern where other economies might be found or how further savings could be made—except at the cost of reduced coverage or poorer performance.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          That is the difficulty the government members have in this debate today. Those who are arguing that you can run this operation with less money need to understand that, according to Mr Jones, that can only be achieved at the cost of reduced coverage—that means shutting down some transmitters—or poorer performance. That means that, if lightning strikes a transmitter or some damage is done or some maintenance is required, it will take longer for the services to be restored. For those reasons we quite naturally have concerns about the decision of the government to privatise these things.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          One of the other difficulties that I think the government members are going to have relates to their claim that the ABC and SBS will be no worse off because the government will fund the initial costs. Currently the ABC and SBS receive a budget to produce their radio and television services. Once the National Transmission Agency is privatised, the ABC and SBS will have to have an additional sum of money to pay the new privatised
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           owner the recurrent cost of running the services and also, I presume, some additional fee to cover the capital cost—the amount that these companies will tender to purchase the network.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The difficulty that I think the ABC and SBS are going to have is that this government promised in the past that the ABC and SBS would have funding maintained in real terms. What that meant in practice was a 10 per cent cut in the funding which this Prime Minister (Mr Howard), this Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) and this secretary of the government's backbench committee on communications delivered to our national broadcasters. This is a Prime Minister who crossed his heart, hoped to die and promised not to cut ABC and SBS funding but in practice delivered 10 per cent cuts. He was trusted once and he let down the national broadcasters. I am sure the ABC and SBS are sitting up there full of confidence, knowing that this government will not break its undertakings a second time.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          But let us give them the benefit of the doubt. Let us assume that this is not another sneaky attempt by the Howard government to cut back funding to the ABC and SBS because they have an ideological obsession about our national broadcasters. Let us assume that they will keep their promise on the second occasion. In five years time, everything is up for grabs. In five years time, there is no guarantee that the ABC and SBS will have this funding restored. There is no guarantee how much the national broadcasters will be expected to pay in five years time.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The new owner or owners of the national network are in the very definition of a monopoly position. The ABC and SBS cannot build an alternative broadcast network from scratch. The minister's bill says it is now open to the ABC to look for alternative methods to those offered by the new NTA owner to deliver ABC services across the country, but you can imagine what it would mean for the ABC and SBS to have to start from scratch and build entirely new networks. It would be extremely expensive and it would mean that the ABC would have to cut back its
          <break page="10659" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           expenditure on programming by even greater amounts than has been the case to date.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The bill says, `Don't worry. If you're the ABC, SBS or a community broadcaster, the new telecommunications access arrangements will ensure that you get a fair deal.' Senator Alston says, `Trust us, have we got a deal for you. We'll have Allan Fels be the policeman who will make sure that you get fair access'—Allan Fels, the man who has delivered to Australis, Foxtel and Optus fair access to their customers over the last couple of weeks!
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Even if we say that the ACCC will fairly and impartially be brought in to arbitrate if there is no agreement between the ABC and the new owner, SBS and the new owner or some local community broadcaster in Hobart and the new owner, we are relying on the ACCC to set some agreement, and I think we are entitled to ask what factors will be taken into account by the ACCC in reaching agreement, in using its arbitration powers. As I am sure you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, commercial television broadcasters and national broadcasters have more money to spend than local community broadcasters. If local community broadcasters were expected to pay the full market rate for access to broadcasting services, they would simply have to shut down.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          If local community radio stations and a small number of community television stations are shut down as a result of this government's decision to privatise the National Transmission Agency, then I think that would be a backward step, given the very vibrant role that community broadcasters have played in Australia. In particular, community radio has played an excellent role right across the country in promoting a greater diversity of views and music formats and has given many Australians access to forms of radio that otherwise would not be available. If those local community radio stations were expected to start paying full commercial rates for access to these transmitters, then I think that would mean that many of them would be forced to close down, which would be a tremendous loss.

         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          <para first-indent="16">
           For all of these reasons, let me emphasise the point that the opposition remains concerned about the impact of these changes. We think that the NTA has certainly been able to demonstrate in the last seven years that it has been able to protect the public interest by efficiently spending funding provided by the former federal government in expanding national services for ABC and SBS right across the country.

          —Since coming to office, the Howard government has kept faith with the people of Australia in a number of different ways as we progress along the very difficult road of building a better nation. It certainly takes a deal of time. It takes time to undo the mess that was left by the previous government. It takes time to rebuild the solid financial base that the people of Australia rightly expect the government to do.

         One of the things that we are doing is keeping faith with the people of Australia when it comes to asset sales. In recent days, it has been very obvious how well we have done that with the partial sale of Telstra. Like any individual in some sort of financial crisis, something can be sold to make your day to day a bit better.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Labor Party used that sort of approach—quite different to the approach that we have taken with the proceeds of any sales of assets. The Labor Party used the approach of simply selling off the family silver, even when they said they would not. Remember back in 1990? `No sale of Qantas.' They sold 49 per cent, and later the whole lot went. Remember 1993? The Commonwealth Bank—`Never do it.' They sold a bit and then
         <break page="10660" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          the whole lot went. They have never opened up, never been up&amp;hyphen;front with the voters. Is it any wonder people are cynical about politicians! We are using asset sales to wipe off the budget deficit, to pay off the national debt. Labor used it to pay for programs—literally selling the family car to pay for fuel or food—while we are retiring debt with sales of assets.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Labor Party are awfully touchy in this place today. We have been lambasted for even daring to partially sell Telstra. We have promised and delivered and 600,000 Australians, for the first time ever, bought shares as a vote of support for this government's approach. They made money in the last day or so—$14 billion also for the nation, and the National Heritage Trust Fund will do well out of it. Eighty-one per cent of Telstra remains owned by Australia and Australians—four per cent in fact by Telstra employees.

         This is important background to the  National Transmission Network Sale Bill  and the  National Transmission Network Sale (Consequential Amendments) Bill before us today. We have just heard an interesting contribution from the former Minister for Communications and the Arts, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee)—a former minister in the failed Keating government—who tried to talk about ideological obsessions with privatisation and tried to create scare campaigns amongst rural and regional Australians about their access to television and radio transmissions. He tried to create a scare campaign about public radio and public broadcasting access to the National Transmission Agency's network throughout Australia, all because this government is going down yet another one of the paths it promised it would go down and that is the sale of this worthwhile asset to private concerns with a view to trying to return some more money to pay off debt, with a view to trying to get some greater efficiencies within the system and with a view to keeping faith with the ABC and the Special Broadcasting Service by giving them something they wanted—that is, some sort of commercial linkage, some sort of ability to be able to gain a better network, an even more improved network, than the NTA already offers. We are

To think we did all of that and that so many people took up the prospect of being able to buy Telstra shares—the shares of a great Australian institution—with such vigour. Of course, the government reserves its right to perhaps sell more of Telstra at a later stage, but it will only do so after it has been given a mandate to act by the people of Australia, just as we have been given a mandate to act in the sale of the National Transmission Agency's network. It fulfils a pre&amp;hyphen;election commitment regarding the ABC and SBS and their collective access to transmission infrastructure.

         The honourable member for Dobell talked about ideological obsessions. Let me quote from a speech by the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) on 24 August 1994, when he told the National Press Club:

        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         Privatisation fits in with the Government's broader imperative to create jobs . . . Privatisation is not pursued because of a New Right ideology that says government ownership has no benefits and must be relinquished at all costs. The real measure for whether privatisation should occur is whether there will be a net social and economic gain from moving a particular enterprise into private ownership. The `net gain' may take many forms: potentially better services and lower prices for consumers; stronger enterprises and greater competition for our economy; and, in the broader sense, making government funds available for new policy.

         Privatisation, for instance, can strengthen the performance of enterprises by allowing private capital injections, as happened with the sale of the Commonwealth Bank, and international alliances to be formed, as with the sale of 25 per cent of Qantas to British Airways. It can remove the constraints that are placed by public ownership in terms of freedom to take risks, freedom to borrow, the need to pursue diversification and so on.

I am delighted to hear the member for Dobell talking up the efficiency and the capability of the NTA in his contribution today. I hope that that may contribute, despite perhaps some other curious sidetracks in his contribution, to the actual value of the NTA when it is sold.

         These particular bills also keep faith with the pre&amp;hyphen;election commitment to increase the national broadcasters' responsibility for transmission of their own programs.

It is not necessary with this particular bill; after all, the expansion programs and the possibilities of expansion throughout other parts of Australia, including the Taree area, which would be of great interest to the minister at the table, will continue—more likely so because more commercial imperatives will apply. It will not just simply be a matter of planning and looking at a map and seeing what the coverage is like; it will be a matter of looking and saying, `The people of Wollombi could not get the member for Dobell and the member for Hunter to get their acts together sufficiently to get the particular transmission they wanted in their areas.' But the National Transmission Agency sale will put in a commercial operator who will say to the people of Wollombi, if they want those services and they are viable, `Why wouldn't we want to put those particular services in there?' Those services will be ordered by the ABC and SBS, based on their desire to get into those areas. Apart from realising proceeds to retire debt, the sale of the National Transmission Network will mean the ABC, SBS and other network users will finally operate in a purchaser&amp;hyphen;provider relationship.

         It is the same as the way the repatriation general hospitals were sold a few years ago by the former Hawke&amp;hyphen;Keating government. Those sorts of moves made good sense to the members of the now government parties. Why should we be in the position of owning those sorts of infrastructure if private enterprise wants to take them over? We should be in the business of purchasing the services, which is the situation that will exist as a result of these bills. This transferring of operational activity to the private sector will increase client focus and responsiveness, because it is what happens in normal commercial practice. Down the track, a greater degree of competition in the transmission services market will emerge, especially with the introduction of digital terrestrial broadcasting.

          The shape of the network ownership arrangements will evolve from the sale.

This puts the onus on the ABC, SBS and all other users to enforce their own agreements with the transmission service providers to ensure there is quality as well as coverage. It is an arrangement that the ABC and SBS have been looking for. Others may need to be reassured of their particular position as a result of these changes. These bills also introduce a regulatory framework which will underpin all of these arrangements. This is simply because the government has an eye on the potential on&amp;hyphen;sale of the network and, in turn, the transfer of assets necessary for the continuation of the ABC, SBS, Radio for the Print Handicapped services and emergency services.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The bills provide a combination of contractual and legislative provisions, giving balance to the terms and conditions which will exist. They will make the new regime a reasonable one for national broadcasters and other users seeking access to services from those with significant market power. In other words, no future transmission network owner will be able to derail the extent of services currently accessed through the NTA. As you would imagine, commercial users of the network can also exercise standard fair trading legal safeguards, including those under section 3A of the Trade Practices Act 1974.

The bills also allow and encourage the ABC and SBS to establish their own transmission services, which enables them to pick and choose the areas in which it might well be of more benefit economically for their particular organisation to have a stand&amp;hyphen;alone facility.

Likewise, the ABC and SBS will be responsible directly to the public for dealing with any complaints about reception quality and coverage. This could be taken up with a particular service provider if necessary. If a substantial problem appears to exist in changed transmission coverage of a community, the minister will have the option of directing the Australian Broadcasting Authority to investigate a matter if a suitable and timely response is not provided by the broadcaster.

          —I know you said you would not divide, and we do appreciate that. There are a few issues that you raised. It is proposed to provide for continuity of transmission services for the ABC, SBS and Radio for the Print Handicapped and access to sites and facilities for those parties and emergency service organisations, remote commercial licensees and self-help groups by a combination of the contractual obligations, reinforced by statutory projections as are outlined in the second reading speech.

         The contracts between those groups and the NTC will set out the core performance obligations for continued supply of transmission services until such time as those bodies cease to require those services. It is intended that the contracts will be for five years, with an

          option for those bodies to renew for a further two terms of five years on terms and conditions to be negotiated. The contracts will be enforceable through contractual remedies, and this will form the basis of the arrangements behind the sale of the National Transmission Agency.

         The access regime, which I heard my colleague talking about, is important. It will impose an obligation to supply nominated services to nominated customers, on terms either agreed or arbitrated. The access regime could result in the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission arbitrating on the terms and conditions of renewal of the five-year terms for the ABC, SBS and others in addition to arbitrating on access arrangements for any other nominated customers if the parties cannot reach agreement. I heard the member mention some similarity to the telecommunications legislation.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The member for Dobell also expressed a little concern about CSOs. As was outlined in the second reading speech, which I introduced when introducing the legislation, the sale bill does make provision for an access regime which will give the groups such as I have just mentioned—the emergency services, remote commercial licenses, the self-help groups, community broadcasters, as well as the ABC—access to those services and/or sites and towers. That is the key part. They will get access. If they cannot agree, then it will be under arbitrated arrangements. We believe that this arrangement will bring to the transmission arrangements in this country a greater degree of certainty. Certainly, the public broadcasters welcome it. It gives them far greater control over a cost centre that they had no control over previously. I know that they would welcome it as well.

         It is important to remember that we are debating here some very significant changes to child care that follow from some significant cuts that have been made by this government in the child&amp;hyphen;care area. Some $820 million has been taken out of child care by this budget. In the interests of time, I will not go through all the areas from which that has been taken, except to say that we are now seeing areas in which this is having a very significant effect.

         I am sure that the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) has seen the results of a major survey that has been undertaken in New South Wales. People's responses to that child-care survey emphasise the impact that the federal government's cuts have had on staff, services, food and equipment. Many talked about the increase in stress on families that paying the higher fees has brought about.

          We have seen a large number of community based child&amp;hyphen;care centres close. Many of these centres have had significant reductions in staff which can only result in a reduction in the quality of care that children in those centres experience. One commentator has said in response to this survey that the government's child-care cuts have created a two-tier system of child care. Those who can afford good quality child care can still go to the long day care centres that receive government subsidies, but those who can no longer afford that sort of child care because of the government's cuts are now being forced into poorer quality backyard care.

          On average, the fee increase for families around the country is around $20 a week per child. In some places families are facing considerably higher increases in their fees than this. The result of these increases in fees has been very significant. What families are doing in response to these increases in fees, which are the direct result of the government's withdrawal of $820 million from child care, are that women—and it is mostly women—are changing their working arrangements. Some of them are reducing their hours, some are taking their children out of day care for a day or two a week, some are making arrangements with other people in the neighbourhood and some are trying to fit their five&amp;hyphen;day working week into a shorter period or trying to work at home when the children are asleep.

         <para first-indent="16">
          These options are not serious options that any parent should have to face. They are options that no parent wants to take up. Families cannot afford to reduce their hours of work. They need to make sure that they continue to participate in the work force. The government needs to recognise that the only way families can do that is if they have decent provision of affordable child care.

         There are concerns that have just been expressed by the shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin). I hear what she is saying and I have seen the material in New South Wales today. I would reject some of it, and I have addressed that in a press release. But I do not want to prolong the debate. I think that the major point is that the changes to the child&amp;hyphen;care payments arrangements which will start after Easter next year—I have changed the date of start&amp;hyphen;up—will enhance the opportunities for Australians to have a continued, affordable child&amp;hyphen;care system, enhancing quality right across the country with an additional 83,000 places over the four&amp;hyphen;year period.

         The changes that are made go through with the support of both sides of the parliament, with the reservations, of course, which I acknowledge, that the shadow minister has made. But the fundamental change has been accepted: a better planning system and a better overall approach to child care. I accept that we need to address some of the matters you have raised.

          —In speaking to the Migration Legislation Amendment (Strengthening of Provisions Relating to Character and Conduct) Bill I foreshadow at the outset that at a later stage I will seek to move a series of amendments. On that basis, I indicate that I have no opposition to those amendments being circulated at the moment. Despite that, can I say that the opposition very much accepts and supports the basic stated aims of this bill. The opposition, in doing so, accepts that, unfortunately, there have been instances where people who are clearly not of good character have been granted visas and have been able to come to Australia, often at considerable cost to the Australian community. I do not believe anyone in the House is of the view that that is the way we ought to be developing the migration system in Australia.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There have also, unfortunately, been credible reports of criminals being able to access visas to come to Australia. On that basis, the opposition endorse—and I endorse it very much—any proposal to keep out criminals or members of criminal gangs. I also agree that those who indulge in racial vilification should not be allowed to come to Australia to spread that poison. Some would argue that is a denial of freedom of speech. Alternatively, I would argue that the strength of democracy and the question of freedom of speech also require people to accept certain responsibilities going with freedom of speech. Those who might harass or intimidate Australian residents should not be welcome here.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The opposition agrees that a person who has a substantial criminal record, as defined by the bill, may be said to have failed the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          character test and should not be allowed to enter this country. I agree that if a person has managed to enter Australia, despite not being of good character, the government should be able to act quickly to remove that person. We accept that if a person has characteristics as set out in the proposed amendment in section 501, he or she can be judged as not being of good character. If, despite these characteristics, he or she wants to be granted a visa, he or she would need to convince the minister or his delegate—or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal—that he or she should be allowed to enter. In essence, despite some reservations, we would accept a reverse onus, the onus now being on the applicant to show that he is of good character in the circumstances set out in the proposed section 501.

         I have said on many occasions that I do not accept people who rort the system, people who take advantage of us. Having said that, I agree with the basic principle but I do not agree with all the methods advanced in this bill. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) is trying to put in place some major changes without making it clear that that is what he is doing. I think that is very fundamental to the debate in the House this evening and will be an issue that is explored to a large extent in detail if we succeed in the Senate in having the bill referred to a committee for further consideration.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is why I have also indicated at the outset that we will be seeking to move a series of amendments. Six of those amendments will be put on the table this evening for consideration. That is mainly because this bill would allow the minister to take decisions about granting a visa without that decision being subject to natural justice requirements. Since I assumed responsibility for this sensitive area, I have indicated on a range of bills going to the issue of migration that natural justice is exceptionally important in our consideration of these issues.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That goes to our view that the minister can make decisions that are totally unreasonable; he can make decisions that are potentially biased; he can make decisions that are potentially not based on any evidence; he can
         <break page="10670" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          ignore available evidence when making these decisions. These are among the main elements of natural justice and the potential concerns that we raise in the debate this evening.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am not saying that the minister would make such decisions but they are issues that we have to consider in a proper and fit way, considering the nature of the bill before the House tonight. If the minister is exempt from the requirements of natural justice he might make such decisions should he want to. That is the real issue. The finger is not being pointed at the minister at the table this evening, it is being pointed at the capacity of a minister to make such decisions. It was in reference to this very area of cancelling a visa without following the requirements of natural justice that the Chief Justice of the High Court, Mr Justice Brennan, said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         It is a matter of the gravest constitutional importance to think that the proposition would be advanced on behalf of the minister that this court does not have the jurisdiction to control unlawful acts committed by the minister.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         That was with regard to the cancellation of the visa of Mr Ervin. The government can propose legislation which allows the minister to act without regard to natural justice—but why do it? If you intend to make decisions which are reasonable, which are based on available evidence and which are not biased, why exclude natural justice? I go to section 501C(10). This bill proposes to exclude some people from the right of appeal against the decision to refuse to grant them a visa or to cancel an existing visa. There is no indication in this bill which individuals or groups should be excluded, nor is there any indication of what grounds they should be excluded on. That is an issue of concern to the opposition.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I suggest that if you feel that some people should not have these rights, at least make it clear who these people are and why you think so. I raise this because I think this is also an issue that should be more properly considered if we succeed in having the bill referred to the Senate committee for further detailed consideration. I think the minister should seriously give consideration to the question I pose with respect to this issue this evening. Otherwise I suggest that you are proposing a very wide power with nothing to fetter such discre
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          tion and nothing even apparently to guide it. That is of major concern to the community at large. That is the basis of our contentions on natural justice and that is the basis of our various amendments on the natural justice question.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We will also move an amendment on the limitations that the minister is placing on the Administrative Appeals Tribunal's processes. We are concerned that 42 days is too constrictive. This subsection compresses the time frame for a person seeking review of a decision to refuse a visa application entry permit to 42 days. If the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has not made a decision within 42 days, the proposed provisions deem the tribunal to have affirmed the decision under review. Assuming that the person takes the allowable seven days to lodge their application, this gives the Administrative Appeals Tribunal a mere 35 days to hear and determine the matter and give a decision. In practical terms, this will have a significant impact on the access to justice of persons denied visas.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The current process for all applications to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, not just migration ones, is an average of 45 weeks. According to the 1996-97 annual report, from the filing of the bill, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will be under considerable pressure to drop other matters that do not have such statutory time limits in favour of these section 501 applications. In addition, section 501 applications tend to take longer than other applications as the applicants themselves are frequently unrepresented, sometimes in gaol or often in need of an interpreter. That is why we are eager to see adopted our amendment which substitutes 42 days with 90 days. I have proposed that the many dubious aspects of the bill be referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee as a result of consideration of these issues within the opposition.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In conclusion, I will return to where I started. The Labor opposition supports the stated intentions of this bill. In doing so, I want to ensure that we keep out of Australia those whose behaviour poses a threat to Australia. We do not support those aspects of
         <break page="10671" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          this bill which would see us behaving not as a democracy but as a dictatorship, allowing people to enter the country, or not, at the whim of the minister.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Clearly, the amendments that we are going to seek to move during the consideration in detail stage are aimed at trying to overcome potential difficulties that we have with the bill. They are not aimed at trying to weaken the intent of the government or to frustrate the government's endeavours. From our point of view, issues of major concern have to be properly considered in this debate. On that basis, I would clearly indicate that we will seek to move the amendments that I have outlined during the consideration in detail stage of the bill.

          That is really what in so many ways the bill before us provides for. We are, after all, a nation which has been built on immigration. This government has an absolute responsibility to effectively discharge a very fundamental responsibility as far as the integrity of those who come to Australia come to stay and those who come to visit are concerned. It makes very good sense to me and all on the government side—and I am sure those on the other side share the concern too—that those who have some criminal background or criminal association should not be given easy passage or an easy time when coming to us here in Australia.

I submit that this country needs to be able to manage change in a way which provides real confidence to all of our citizenry. Whether you have been here for 150 years like my family or whether you have been here for 150 days, you need to know the government is acting in an open, honest and accountable way to ensure the integrity of those who come to this country.

          I support this bill before us today, especially because I want everybody in my electorate—wherever they have come from or wherever they were born—and everybody in this country to be very satisfied this is a government looking very openly and directly at how quickly the world is changing, how people's movements are increasing, how migration arrangements must be designed to streamline the entry and stay of genuine visitors while filtering out those we do not want here, ensuring those who have substantial criminal backgrounds and criminal associations stay out.

         <para first-indent="16">
          It has come about because existing legislative provisions are totally inadequate for this particular task. This bill is all about protecting the Australian community by strengthening the provisions in the Migration Act 1958 and the various amendments made in 1992 by the previous government which relate to the refusal or cancellation of visas on character grounds. It will enable the government to act
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           more quickly and effectively in dealing with applications made by non&amp;hyphen;citizens who are not of good character. It will do this in three ways.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Firstly, it is effectively going to reverse the onus onto the applicant to prove good character rather than the department, as is the case currently, by standardising the levels of criminal sentences which will attract automatic refusal of a visa application. This will allow the minister to give binding directions to decision makers within the department. Most people recognise the need for these changes, as only last year we had the case of Lorenzo Ervin, a convicted terrorist and hijacker who was able, by courtesy of our own laws, to thumb his nose at all attempts to cancel his visa. The setting of a clear benchmark in respect of criminal behaviour will avoid charges of arbitrary decision making like those levelled in the contribution by the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson).
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This means we can send a clear message to intending applicants about the standards of honesty and behaviour Australians expect. It will also send a message to all Australians born here and those who have become citizens since arriving here that standards of honesty and behaviour will be enforced by this government. As the minister said in his own second reading speech, the level of criminal behaviour we are talking about is:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          Non-citizens who have been convicted to a single sentence of detention of 12 months or more, or where the length of several sentences aggregates to two years or more, will fail the character test.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          I do not believe any responsible person in this place will disagree with that measure. Since 1992, the decision makers have been required to establish whether or not a person is not of good character before they could refuse a visa application or cancel a visa. If there has ever been any doubt about criminal background or criminal association of a non-citizen, it has tended to be the case that the doubt has been resolved in the non-citizen's favour. Is it any wonder some make great mileage out of matters relating to migration? So this government is doing a lot to put to bed some of the urban myths that have been portrayed, even by people in this place. The second provision
          <break page="10673" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           contained within this bill gives the minister the authority to decide in exceptional circumstances or emergency circumstances whether a visa should be refused or cancelled or whether a non-citizen should actually be deported.

          Australia is certainly noted for its social stability. People in my electorate come from all sorts of sides of all sorts of arguments. I have people who come from both sides of the argument in Sri Lanka. I have people who come from the very many sides of the argument from the former Yugoslavia. I have people of Muslim background who have very strong beliefs. In the main, these people leave those arguments at the doorstep. When they become Australian citizens they conduct themselves as Australian citizens should—with a broad range of tolerance for a range of views which they may not necessarily agree with but will, in this free democratic society in which we live, listen to providing those views are expressed in a responsible way. New migrants understand there could be viewpoints contrary to their own.

          This bill means people like Gerry Adams and David Irving, people who have applied to come to this country on various occasions, quite rightly, because they have caused controversy, because they have some interesting backgrounds associated with their conduct, should not be given an automatic right of entry into this country. That is in Australia's national interest.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The third provision within this bill relates to confidential information which is passed from Australian and international law enforcement agencies to immigration decision makers. Information will be given greater protection protocols to prevent unauthorised access or release. This makes perfect sense because anybody who is in the criminal information and related information business realises it is crucial, when assessing the criminal background or associations of non-citizen visa applicants and visa holders, such information should be protected.

           We need greater protection for such material. It will certainly complement the broader national and international strategies needed to counter transnational crime, for instance. So I think in this regard the bill is painting a very sensible measure for consideration.

          Unlike the contribution of the member for Batman, I submit to this House the bill does not signal any sort of witch-hunt; nor should its intentions be misinterpreted as a call to the people, like perhaps the one made by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), to differentiate and discriminate between people born here and newer Australians. It really is one of those unifying acts of this place. It gives all people—as I said, whether they have been here 150 years or 150 days—a great deal of confidence in knowing all who pass the tests and all who pass through the hoops and barriers put in their way and qualify as either Australian citizens or visitors to this country do so because they are people of great integrity.

          The member for Batman suggests perhaps there should be some provision because there is a problem associated with a sense of natural justice and perhaps detention should be extended to 90 days—all at great cost to the taxpayer. This is one of the matters which have been dealt with in this bill. We are looking at the various review processes necessary to ensure people's integrity or otherwise. We want to streamline those processes. We also want to ensure the time limits which apply are far more reasonable both to the detainee and to the taxpayer. A great expense is being borne by the Australian taxpayer as we set out determining whether or not people should be allowed to stay. The provision of interpreter services and legal aid, all met by the Australian taxpayer, is a great generosity I think we should continue to extend, but I must submit there are some in our country who find it difficult to understand.

It sends a clear and unequivocal message on behalf of the Australian community to all those intending to move here. As well, it sends a message to the Australian community that their government is determined to ensure non-citizens coming to Australia are of good character.

          </xref>
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           fundamentally changes the current character provisions in a number of ways. First, it prescribes a character test which a person cannot pass if they have a substantial criminal record as set out in the act. That includes any person who has been sentenced to imprisonment for more than 12 months at any time and at any age. It further includes any person who has an association with another person or group which the minister reasonably suspects has been involved in criminal conduct regardless of whether that association has in fact affected the person's character.

         I suppose the second important area is that it removes the rules of natural justice in cases where the minister acting personally decides to refuse or cancel a visa `in the national interest', which I observe is not defined. Third, it provides a non-reviewable personal power to the minister to refuse or cancel a visa despite an earlier decision by either a delegate or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to either grant or not cancel a visa on the same grounds. That effectively allows the minister to intervene `in the national interest' and substitute a less favourable decision despite there being no further or other evidence reflecting on the person's character.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That certainly does do away with the review process because, even if a person has satisfied an independent tribunal that they should be granted a visa or not have their visa cancelled, the minister, without appealing that decision in the Federal Court, can simply substitute another decision which cannot be appealed again to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. So we do effectively end up with an arbitrary and non-reviewable power to refuse or cancel visas vesting personally in the minister.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It also allows the minister to set aside a decision of his delegate or refuse or cancel a visa which has been appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and to substitute a new decision to refuse or cancel under section 501B which is not reviewable, and so effectively ends a person's right to review even though that first decision might still be under consideration by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
        </para>
        <break page="10675" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          It effectively replaces the right to an independent and determinative review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal with a right in some circumstances to make representations to the minister. It also severely restricts the ability of applicants to present their case by reducing the appeal time to seven days. It restricts the applicant's rights to certain documents. It denies the applicant a statement of reasons for the decision and sets very short time limits on the capacity of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to decide a case.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Let us look at that a little further. Clause 21 of this bill inserts, amongst a number of things, proposed section 500(6L), which compresses to 42 days the time frame for a person seeking a review of a decision to refuse a visa application. What it is saying is that, if the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has not made a decision within that 42&amp;hyphen;day time frame, the proposed provisions deem the tribunal to have affirmed the decision under review—that is to say, the minister's decision is what applies unless the Administrative Appeals Tribunal makes a decision within 42 days.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The way this works out is that a person has seven days to lodge an application. That gives the Administrative Appeals Tribunal a mere 35 days to hear and determine the matter and give a decision. This will have a significant impact on the access to justice of persons who are denied visas. It is worth pointing out that the current process for all applications to the AAT—not simply the migration ones—averages 45 weeks, according to the 1996-97 annual report of the AAT, from the filing of the application until the date of hearing. Given the severe compression of the time available proposed by the bill, what you will see is the Administrative Appeals Tribunal under pressure to drop other matters that do not have such statutory time limits in favour of these section 501 applications.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In addition, it is worth noting that section 501 applications tend to take longer than other applications. The applicants themselves are frequently unrepresented, sometimes in gaol and often in need of an interpreter. All those factors of course increase the complexity of the hearing process. It is apparent that
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           in certain circumstances the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will not be able to make a decision until 14 days after the minister has been notified of the application for review.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is also worth spending a little time on clause 23, which replaces the existing section 501 with a much more expansive section that greatly increases the minister's powers to refuse to grant a visa or to cancel a visa. That proposed provision will in effect introduce a two&amp;hyphen;step test such that the decision by the minister to refuse to grant a visa because the applicant does not pass the character test, which is itself expanded, is reviewable. But then the minister may override that initial decision, still refusing to grant the visa or cancel the visa if the minister `reasonably suspects' that the applicant does not pass the character test or is satisfied that it is in the national interest to refuse to grant a visa. That second type of decision is not reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The bill expands the character test so as to define what qualifies as a substantial criminal record. If a person has a substantial criminal record, which includes simply having been sentenced to a term of 12 months imprisonment or two or more terms of imprisonment that add up to two years' imprisonment, then they can be denied a visa or have their visa cancelled. The minister has a broad discretion to override this, and one would indeed hope that that would be used. If we were referring to a political prisoner or something of that character, it would be quite improper to use this provision to deny people in that circumstance the right to come to Australia. So what we end up with is a situation where the minister has been given extremely broad powers to exclude visa applicants.

         <para style="Para">
          I suppose in the most extreme case they raise the issue of criminal lawyers, prison officers, psychologists, church members and so on in the context of association. They also express opposition to the way in which the bill jettisons much of the independent system of merits review and point out that the minister, acting personally, can override a decision made by his own delegate or the AAT without necessarily giving the person the right to know the case against them. I think that is a very important point.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          They also express concern about the fact that, if someone's visa is cancelled by the minister, under these provisions they are automatically banned for life from returning to Australia. They cannot return even for a short visit, regardless of the length of time that has elapsed since the original decision to cancel the visa, and that ban is imposed regardless of whether the person has Australian citizen children or an Australian citizen spouse.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The suggestion is made against that background that the bill might even be unconstitutional, because it vests the executive with functions which are judicial in character. They make reference to a number of factors—the effects of the decision upon the individual, the individual circumstances of the person subject to the decision are not taken into account, it is not subject to effective merits review, and the process precludes natural justice or otherwise limits the ability of the subject of the decision to put their case. Against that background, there is that kind of concern.

We are concerned to ensure that criminals or people who are members of criminal gangs do not come to Australia. I also express the view that those who indulge in racial vilification should not be allowed to come to Australia. I have no problem whatsoever with the decision made by successive governments not to allow David Irving into this country; we do not want to see people who are going to intimidate Australian residents.

          The opposition believes that, if a person who has a substantial criminal record has failed the character test, they should not be allowed to enter the country. This is a question of getting the balance right. The member for Batman and I, and other members of the opposition, are sympathetic to the prospect that a minister ought to be able to decide who comes to Australia on character grounds and that, through the minister, the community ought to be able to decide on character grounds who comes to Australia rather than having these things determined by tribunals or courts.

          —I am pleased to speak in strong support of this Migration Legislation Amendment (Strengthening of Provisions Relating to Character and Conduct) Bill. We all know Australia is a great place to live. Each year for many thousands of people from nations across the world, it is a great place to visit. We have a reputation as an open and friendly nation, welcoming visitors as well as those who want to make Australia their home. This is something we can be proud of. Indeed, it is crucial, to ensure that our tourism industry continues to expand.

         This is why we must have an efficient immigration system designed to streamline the entry of genuine visitors and permanent residents while ensuring that people who enter this country are of sound character and background. It is a reasonable expectation that non&amp;hyphen;citizens who wish to enter Australia must meet certain standards. It is a very strongly held expectation in the Australian community that people who have substantial criminal

         However, there have been examples in recent years of the inadequacy of the system of checks and balances put in place by the former Labor government. It does not meet these reasonable community expectations. That is why the coalition government has introduced this bill. Like most of our legislation it is a good, commonsense approach. It helps ensure that decisive action can be taken to safeguard our national interests.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill enhances the government's ability to deal with this issue in a number of ways. Firstly, the decision making in routine cases will be improved by changing the onus of proof to require that an applicant shows that they are of good character. Since 1992, the onus has been on the government to prove that someone is not of good character before a visa can be refused. This bill will reverse that situation so that the government can refuse an application in the first instance. It will then be up to applicants to mount a case and prove that they are of good character. Also certain levels of criminal sentencing will lead to an automatic finding that the applicant is not of good character.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Basically, non&amp;hyphen;citizens who have been convicted of a single crime which led to their detention for more than a year, or several sentences which add to more than two years, will automatically fail the character test. This makes sense, and I am sure that most Australians would believe that such a basic test should form the benchmark for the character test. It will streamline the assessment process as well as providing greater certainty about who is able to pass the character test.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Also the government will have much greater control over the discretion that is used when deciding whether to refuse an applicant or cancel a visa. The minister will prescribe exactly what factors are to be considered, and those decisions will be binding on all decision makers.

We pay through theft and damage of our property; we pay through increased insurance premiums.

People expect that migration, like almost any other government program, should be delivered fairly and with equity and compassion. Fundamentally, though, they also believe that our migration program must operate primarily in our national interest. Their view insists that government implements their wishes, responsibly manages the program and protects society from any problems that may arise. This legislation goes a considerable way towards satisfying public demand for a migration program which protects Australians from undesirables who may seek entry to our country for whatever purpose, and allows the government to act in the public interest and to remove those who may already have entered Australia.

Firstly, decision making in routine cases will be improved by requiring applicants to show they are of good character by prescribing that certain levels of criminal sentence automatically deem an applicant not to be of good character and allowing the minister to give binding directions to decision makers. Secondly, it will allow the minister to act personally on matters of visa refusal or cancellation and the removal of non&amp;hyphen;citizens. Thirdly, information provided by Australian and international law enforcement agencies will be afforded more effective protection so that such agencies can remain confident that information passed to immigration decision makers will be protected.

          One of the problems we face as a nation, as the previous speaker mentioned, is achieving a proper balance between stimulating growth and investment through the tourism industry, which means making travel and access to Australia much easier for a wider group of travellers, and providing adequate background checks on those visitors so as to protect our citizens. I have been interested in the electronic travel authority, ETA, program sponsored by the government for travellers from Japan, North America, Singapore and parts of Europe. The scale of the situation is illustrated by the facts.

          It may be possible, in the case of Japan, for adequate checks to be conducted with the parent government. However, it seems curious that regular allegations of easy access into and out of Australia by Japanese organised crime figures continue and that we, in conjunction with the Japanese authorities, seem unable to restrict the issue of visas to such people. The parliamentary secretary who was at the table earlier, the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), has been a strident critic in the past of the entry of Yakuza gangland figures, particularly into the Gold Coast area. She thought it was extraordinary that they were moving so effectively and with such ease around Australia, from one casino to another, and that they were able to buy property and the like.

That is an example of the lack of resources which I was referring to earlier.

          This leads me to another situation which I have expounded upon on a number of occasions, and that is where the government has an essential conflict of interest between its role as a beneficiary of, for instance, a casino operation and its responsibilities as the body responsible for making sure that the place is operated according to the expectations of the community.

In my view, irrespective of what one might think of his other writings, some of his more recent writings in relation to Goebbels are offensive. It can be clearly shown by eminent historians that, in some instances, David Irving has indulged in fabrications not only which he knows are offensive but also about which in some instances—in conversations or reported interviews that I have seen—he does not particularly care as to whether they are offensive or not. Quite clearly, the argument that this is an infringement of freedom of speech is ridiculous, given the fact that Irving's materials are quite readily available. His two most recent books are available in the parliamentary library and elsewhere, and I am sure that if one wanted to get hold of David Irving's interviews or videotapes it would be extremely easy to do so. So that argument is not applicable. It is a question of character and, given some of the most recent evidence of his behaviour at some rallies in Germany, there are clear grounds to show that he has behaved extraordinarily in recent times—behaviour that many Australians would find offensive and unacceptable in a visitor to Australia.

          Of course I am a staunch advocate of a strong accountability system, but at the end of the day decisive action seems to be what the Australian community is asking for. The Australian community watch these things happening, throw their hands in the air, figuratively, and ask, `What on earth is the

Then the community find out that the people concerned may have access to legal aid in order to be able to participate in that legal process and defend themselves, and again there is this exasperation throughout the community—an exasperation that grew almost intolerable under the previous government—of `Why on earth can't the government do something about this?' That is why I have to reject in particular amendment No. 3 of the member for Batman. I think he is trying to tie the minister's hands behind his back at a time when the community is demanding decisive action.

If there is a case where the community feels strongly, then you can rest assured that the minister will get to hear about it. Of course, if it is something that is unjustifiable, intolerable or unjust, then I am sure that the minister will suffer the political consequences, and in my view that is a quite strong test in its own right. Therefore, I feel that those amendments ought to be rejected.

I commend the minister for the courage he has shown in introducing the bill in the face of opposition by some of those opposite. I believe this is a much needed bill.

Further to this, we would investigate the means to revoke citizenship in the case of those who commit serious crimes such as rape, murder, drug trafficking and paedophilia, with the criminal assets to be sold to defray costs and compensate victims. In no case would legal aid be granted to anyone other than Australian citizens.

         The particular person I am referring to is Jia Le Geng. He was granted a permanent visa to this country on the basis of his good character.

Believe it or not, in a bizarre twist, this man's victim, also a former Asian student of Perth, had her application for permanent Australian residency rejected by the immigration department.

         I must say, though, that close inspection of Jia Le Geng's case does indicate that there were some unusual circumstances surrounding his behaviour. It certainly appeared that he may have acted out of character.

         The Migration Act was amended in 1992 in order to improve the government's ability to deal with visa applicants and visa holders who had a substantial criminal background. The legislative amendments were clearly not tight enough though because we have since seen many instances of people with criminal records either for crimes committed prior to entering Australia or crimes committed once inside Australia attempting to stay here.

         As has already been outlined, this bill will enable the government to identify an act against those not of good character in the three following ways: firstly, the application of a character test; secondly, by giving the minister, acting personally, powers in exceptional or emergency circumstances to act decisively on matters of visa refusal, cancellation and removal of non-citizens; and, thirdly, by allowing for the provision of information by law enforcement agencies to immigration decision makers.

         Let us address the character test. The amendments proposed in this bill introduce the concept of a character test, as we have said. There have been many high profile cases of people attempting to gain legitimate entry and visitation to Australia through our existing Migration Act which, until this bill is passed, is just not tight enough. I have already mentioned the case in my own state of Western Australia where a student had been gaoled for violent crimes and was deemed to have been of good character, unbelievably. In fact, there was outcry locally and in the media. It was in my electorate. This student attended Curtin University, and it was something that I certainly had to take on board.

We need to have provisions which will allow for a refusal to grant a visa or immediately cancel a visa in the national interest in instances such as this. We know the kerfuffle that occurred around Lorenzo Ervin and his supporters. This bill does provide for this.

         Presently in Western Australia we have a situation where the immigration department is seeking to deport a man who raped his stepdaughter and is wanted by the police over a shooting incident. This man is not in Australia by virtue of legal visas but as a result of an illegal visa gained when he entered Australia from the Philippines in 1981. Nevertheless, it brings to light an area in which the character test will assist the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs by reducing the number of deportees.

        <para first-indent="16">
         With the strengthening of the character test, the obvious result will be that fewer people who are not deemed to be of good character will not be given legal residential status in Australia in the first place and fewer will need to be deported once their crimes have come to light here. This not only alleviates the pressure on the resources of the department of immigration but goes some way to safeguarding the integrity of our immigration laws.

         Whereas the 1992 amendments to the act meant that decision makers were required to establish that a person was not of good conduct before they could refuse or cancel a visa, the government's amendments before us today quite rightly place the onus on the applicant to prove that they meet the criteria of the character test and that they are of good character. So the onus has changed, which is quite sensible. Clear benchmarks through this character test will determine whether someone is of good character. Convictions of single sentences of detention of 12 months or more, or where the length of several sentences combine to two years or more, will lead to a failure of the character test.

This concept is obviously designed to provide more certainty as to who is able to pass the character test. I think this will help the Australian people generally to understand why a person has or has not been granted entry to this country, particularly in those controversial cases such as those we have seen in the past year or more. That would certainly address some public outcry, particularly in those cases where the public is not informed of the detail.

         In relation to ministerial decisions, the  Migration Legislation Amendment (Strengthening of Provisions relating to Character and Conduct) Bill 1997 , which strengthens character and conduct, enables the minister to have the ultimate authority to set aside an unfavourable original decision of a delegate or applicant even while that decision is subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The ministerial decision would not be reviewable by the AAT, so giving the minister ultimate authority in these matters, which again I believe is quite right.

With regard to intelligence, presently the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has difficulty obtaining and utilising vital intelligence on certain applicants due to the possibility that information might become disclosed and breach privacy. This bill increases the level of protection of this type of sensitive information which will give greater confidence to international Australian intelligence agencies.

         Gerry Adams, for example, has been refused a visa by not only this government but also previous governments on the basis of his political alliances with the IRA, which is notorious for using violence, threats, intimidation and murder as a means of bringing attention to their political cause in Northern Ireland and Great Britain. People who are so openly associated with organisations which employ these tactics are, without doubt, not the kinds of people we could just let into Australia and assume they can have the types of freedoms we afford to people of good standing and good character.

         I understand the opposition is also not supporting our amendment which provides that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal must complete its review of decisions made under section 501 within 42 days of the day on which the applicant was advised of the decision. Essentially, if the AAT has not completed its review in this time, the subsection deems the AAT to have affirmed the original decision. I understand the opposition is seeking to extend this to 90 days, which the government thinks is unnecessary. Currently, such reviews are taking on average 200 days. In fact, the 1996-97 Administrative Appeals Tribunal annual report states that the average time of a review is 45 weeks—not too short of an entire year. This bill, quite sensibly, addresses the ridiculous time reviews are taking.

         Unfortunately, the review process has also been used in many cases around the country as a way for applicants to extend their time in Australia. The government's amendment balances the expedition of review of character decisions against the need to ensure that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has relevant information and sufficient time to properly review a particular decision. Once a decision has been made on the basis of an applicant not being of good character, the applicant will not be able to use the review process as a mechanism to prolong their stay.

Many wanted to sue the Australian government because they had been in detention for too long.

         In conclusion, this legislation importantly addresses the aspects of the Australian immigration laws which have not been amended since 1992. This is just another example of the coalition government acting to improve the integrity of the decision making in relation to immigration—something the general Australian public has been crying out for for a long time, and it took a coalition government to do it. The government, with this bill, wishes to ensure that people overseas know there is a strict character requirement in this country. By limiting the number of dangerous criminals within our country, we are therefore improving the security of all Australians.

As the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), who is at the table, would know, we are trying to assist enormous numbers of people to come to Australia. For example, in Belgrade 10,000 people who would like to come to Australia are on the waiting list but only about 250 are accepted per year. These people want to come to this country for the great benefits that it brings. They want to come here legally, and they want to make a contribution.

         I will take the opportunity tonight to reiterate some of the observations that I have made in relation to character issues generally, and I will take the opportunity of responding to each of the amendments that have been proposed and why I believe that it is not in this country's interests that they be supported. The member for Batman, in his remarks earlier this evening, made it clear that the opposition supports the thrust of the proposals that the government is bringing forward and recognised that there is a need for legislation to deal with longstanding issues of concern. I have not sought in this to put too much blame on the opposition when it was in government for some of the difficulties that have been occasioned, but I think it is important to note that at various times when the opposition was in government and sought our cooperation on character issues it had that cooperation and legislation that was in the national interest was supported by the then opposition. I assume that the extent to which the character provisions were weakened, as they were, by the former government was not a deliberate intention on their part to do so.

         But let me make it very clear what is being proposed here tonight by way of amendments: this is a considered view, presumably, of the opposition. The provisions that they are seeking to amend will water down very considerably, as I will explain, the capacity of the government to deal with character issues. Members will see it as clearly not a matter of any inadvertence when I have explained to them the nature of the measures that are proposed, the evil that they are intended to address and why they have been drafted as they have.

         I would like to make some observations about the quality of ministers in whom a great deal of trust has been reposed over a long period in relation to immigration matters. I have known ministers over 20 years, and I would not criticise any one of them for the way they have exercised the responsibilities that have been reposed in them in the national interest. I have known something like seven or eight Labor ministers, and the powers that we are seeking here will undoubtedly be powers that will go into the hands of a Labor minister at some future time and they will be accountable, as any minister from this side will be, for the way in which those powers are exercised. But there are very clear public policy reasons why the interests of this country need to be protected and why we need to have powers to act quite quickly and sensibly in certain circumstances. This is an expectation that the community has of its government.

         The fact is that there has been a considerable weakening in recent years of the way in which our provisions operate. I would like to say to the member for Wills, who has now joined us, that one of the reasons that we have a concern is not the large numbers of cases in which ministerial decisions and departmental decisions have been overturned by the AAT. I recognise that the cases where the AAT have acted to effectively degrade the quality of decision making have occurred not because of the numbers but because essentially of their precedential character.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Every decision that is made by an AAT member, every decision that have been made at that level, becomes a basis upon which officers of my department when they seek then to apply the law are bound to take into account. They have not been made by the parliament; they have not been made by a minister. Essentially the framework of law under which character decisions are reached are degraded because AAT members are substituting their own judgment at times for that of a minister elected by the people.

          It is the view of the government that in these matters the final responsibility rests with the government of the day, not with unelected officials, to determine who shall be able to come and remain here permanently or temporarily in Australia. There are certain principles that the government accepts. We should be very positive in relation to immigration and the benefits that it can bring. We should have a program which is non-discriminatory. It is one that we need to maintain public confidence in.

          We need to ensure that people of character concern can be removed. We need to be able to ensure that the government has the power to regulate entry and to remove non-citizens quickly from Australia. We need to ensure that we do not abrogate our responsibility in providing for the security and wellbeing of Australian citizens. One of the fundamental aspects of government responsibility is in having the power to regulate the entry and presence of non-citizens in Australia who have shown by their conduct that they are not of good character. The community expects that the government will be in the driving seat in these areas because of the potential harm that can be caused to the Australian community.

          The changes that I am about are to restore that public confidence. I want to remind the House that the coalition did make it clear in its policy that it would act as necessary to guarantee confidence in our screening and assessment procedures. Statistics have shown—it has been brought out tonight—that the majority of non-citizens who come to live here are very law abiding. Many demonstrate a total commitment by becoming Australian

           citizens. However, there is a small percentage—and I stress it is only small—who breach our trust and obviously breach the trust of the Australian community as a whole by their actions. The community expects that, as a consequence of people's failure to obey Australian law or by their conduct before they come to Australia, if they commit offences or indulge in conduct which is unacceptable to us, they have forgone their right to remain here and should be removed.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I have previously indicated that the changes this bill makes provide a very clear message, and I want to reiterate what that message is. The community does not want non&amp;hyphen;citizens who are not of good character to be granted visas or be able to stay here. The bill ensures that those who have abused the privilege given to them by the Australian community by committing crimes here are removed.

          I would like to comment on the opposition amendments. The first seeks to restore section 37 of the AAT Act which by this bill is made inoperative. The reason it is made inoperative is that the section deals with providing a statement of reasons in decisions and serving it on the individual. Under the proposed section 501G, those notification provisions founded in section 37 of the AAT Act are intended to be replaced to ensure that a person is properly notified at the time when the government takes its action to deal with the character issue. So potential AAT applicants would, if the opposition's amendment were carried, have double the advice—the advice that is required to be provided under the new section 501G as well as that which is provided under section 37. Clearly, this opposition proposal is simply a nonsense.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Let us go on to the question of the time for decisions. My colleague the member for Swan dealt with this very effectively in his observations tonight. The fact is, and it ought to be understood in the immigration area, that delay is something that very often works to the advantage of a non-citizen and costs the community a great deal. If people are in detention, the delay in decision making means that people are often detained longer than they might otherwise be.

          <para first-indent="16">
           We are seeking to ensure that, to enable the matter to be dealt with quickly, people have all relevant documentation provided at the outset of the process. We do not believe there will be additional workload on the AAT. We believe in fact it will be less, because of the other changes that have been made. There is scope for savings. Currently the AAT is averaging 227 days to make a decision on character issues, whereas most of my departmental decision makers require only a day to make a decision once all of the papers are to hand. We do not consider these provisions are at all unreasonable. We consider the amendments that the opposition is proposing will disadvantage the community as a whole.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           I will just emphasise the cost of detaining people. If they have their visas cancelled, the cost runs to something in the order of $150 a day. The longer you leave people with the opportunity to have matters before the AAT, the greater the cost which the Australian taxpayer is going to have to bear. If the opposition wants to play around with those matters—there are clear disadvantages for the Australian community—I guess we can fiddle at the margin of those questions, if they really want to.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The other four matters which relate essentially to the natural justice issues are of far greater consequence. They go to the very heart of decision making in relation to people who are of character concern. Let us understand the situation. I certainly do not believe a minister will make many decisions personally. I have probably personally made—I do not want to be benchmarked on this—four or five decisions in the time that I have been minister. So they are not something that is done as a matter of course. Some of them have been mentioned in the debate tonight. I do not want to canvass them. Where I, as the minister, am making decisions personally, even though I can exclude the AAT, I cannot exclude the role of the courts. Decisions are being challenged where they are taken by the minister personally, because the present regime enables that to happen.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Let us understand where the opposition comes from on these matters. There are other sections of the act in which a minister is
           <break page="10695" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            enabled to make these decisions, where they can do so without notice and where there are no natural justice provisions. That happens in section 128 of the act, which provides for `cancellation offshore without notice and the right of a non&amp;hyphen;citizen to make a subsequent submission as to why the cancellation or refusal should be revoked'. That subdivision was inserted in the act in 1992 by your government.

          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           So a like provision that I am seeking here to have in the act—which would enable a minister personally and in the national interest where he is accountable to this parliament, to his colleagues and the people of Australia in a case where it is appropriate—is, in my view, deserving of support. Trust ought to be given to ministers, as I believe it has been in the past, to be able to deal with those matters in the national interest.

           I would like to put to you the sort of situation where I believe something like this is important. We have seen today a very tragic set of events in Egypt and a number of people have lost their lives. It may well have been that all those involved could have lost their lives. We have seen other events in other parts of the world where that has been the case. From time to time criminal investigation organisations and security organisations get intelligence about people who are responsible for actions of that kind.

           There are terrorist organisations around the world that do have people who have committed acts of that kind.

That may leave at risk a person who could have been an informant. I would be obliged to put that information before that person. While that was being done, that person, who may be posing a very considerable risk to the

There is a provision where, if there are matters that the persons wants to put after cancellation, they are able to do so. As I say, if a minister is using a power like that in an emergency situation, he is putting at risk his total career, in my view, if he were to make the sort of decision that the honourable member for Wills suggested might be possible, having regard to some selfish personal interest arising out of a family law situation involving a family member or some correspondence that might have come in anonymously. He demeans ministers who have acted in this area and who have powers under the Migration Act now in relation to some areas of responsibility which have been reposed in them with a great deal of confidence by both sides of the House over time.

         The reason we move these amendments is that we are concerned that, taken as a whole, the provisions will give the minister excessive powers. This is an audacious bill in many respects. The risk of abuse is certainly inherent in giving the minister powers which are not fettered by any requirement to apply natural justice or any requirement to a right to reasons on behalf of those who are affected by ministerial decisions.

         The minister says, `You have to trust me, I am the minister.' That is not the way that our system of rule by law generally works. In most areas of administrative decision making, the right to reasons and the provision for natural justice are there. And they are there for good, longstanding reasons to do with the way in which we as a community have seen abuses by ministers of their authority from time to time—not all the time—and have seen individuals who are the victims of bias or unfair process or other things which occur within departments and other places.

Those rights or interests include personal liberty, status and preservation of livelihood and reputation, as well as proprietary rights and interests.

         That section acts in exactly the same way as is proposed here in these provisions.

The regime that we are proposing would enable that to occur.

         This is an area where there is considerable concern. It is not one where I think the minister has satisfactorily made out the case for taking away natural justice rights for those who are affected by the minister's decision. I go back to making the observation that, by any yardstick, the powers being given to the minister by the bill generally are very substantial powers, and the things to which the opposition are proposing to agree are very substantial powers. What we are saying, however, is that, in the exercise of those powers, there are circumstances in which natural justice ought to continue to apply—and that is the legal framework that the minister inherited from the former government—and circumstances in which there is a right to reasons.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other area I want to move on to relates to the question of time. The government has said that if a decision is not made by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal within 42 days, then the decision of the minister will be
         <break page="10698" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          affirmed. So there is no effective right of review to that. That is something that we believe does not reflect the reality of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal process. There is no doubt that there is occasional scope for reducing the time which is presently being taken. I, and other honourable members, I dare say, have some sympathy for the circumstance where people are putting in application after application, appeal after appeal and review after review and effectively tying the government in knots with reviews of these issues. But the fact is that the average time which the current process involves is of the order of 45 weeks.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Given the very severe compression of time available proposed by the bill, there will be pressure on the AAT to drop other matters that do not have such statutory time limits in favour of the section 501 applications. All these things will tend to increase the complexity of the hearing process. As a result, it is highly likely that cases would go through with either the Administrative Appeals Tribunal not making a decision at all and the minister's decision being affirmed in circumstances where that might not be the appropriate outcome or, on the other hand, other cases which are quite deserving in their own right not being heard because the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has been put under pressure to hear the matter within 35 days.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I might add that, in that sort of time, it is quite possible that there will be cases where justice will not be done because the thing is simply being heard too quickly. For example, section 503A restricts the release of information given in confidence by a gazetted agency. Those restrictions on releasing information are much broader than the public interest limitations encompassed by the FOI Act. So, while you might still be able to seek access to those documents under that act, you would not get them back within the 42 days allowed for the review. If you have circumstances like that, there is the possibility of injustice. Any lessened capacity to determine the merits of an application in a manner that the tribunal sees fit could go to its independence. In proposing 90 days, we are saying that we do not support an open&amp;hyphen;ended arrangement.

         We are seeing a development of a view. Whereas, before, deportation was thought to be a natural outcome of people committing serious criminal acts in Australia, that may no longer be the case. We have seen situations in which people found to be of good character have raped and cases where parties have kept people in, essentially, a form of false imprisonment. There was another situation involving millions of dollars. There was a person who committed murder. In each of those situations, positive findings have been made. I do have a concern about the way in which that is opening up. I had regard to the capacity of the AAT, and the arguments that you were putting were put. The matters that are before us were very much a compromise. I had in mind some shorter periods again when I first gave consideration to this matter. Certainly, I would think that, in the ordinary course of events, for most matters of character, there will be the opportunity for review and the bill sets out some changes in relation to the way in which instructions might be able to be given to departmental officers as to matters that might properly be considered, and the ministerial direction would also guide the AAT.

         It seems to me that it ought to be possible for the AAT to deal with these matters in the time frame that is proposed in this bill. The matters are important. There is a degree of urgency when we are dealing with people's liberty and a quick decision means that the question of their being free outside of Australia can be quickly determined or the issue would be dealt with, if it is dealt with positively, in a way that enabled their release within an Australian context.

Sometimes the jobs are part time and sometimes they are only for work experience to assist the young person's ability to fit in.

They are able to travel to social outings, arranged by themselves and as a group. They are able to conduct client committee meetings and assist Workmates by giving advice on improvements to programs. They are able to travel as a group on long trips to the Snowy and to Canberra to visit parliament. All of these things would not have been possible before they started on this program with Workmates.

         The success of Workmates after only five years of operation is quite staggering. Support by willing employers is the key to the success of these young people. Some of these employers have been around for some time, such as the Mount Druitt Hospital and Nu Skin Personal Care Inc. of Castle Hill. Major supporters are the McDonald's outlets in Quakers Hill, Kings Park, Doonside and Dural. To see young men and women who are now full&amp;hyphen;time employees of these outlets is very rewarding for all those involved in this program. Other employers who have given great support to Workmates are: Sizzler restaurant, Penrith; Franklins Ltd, Pennant Hills; API, Northmead; Hawkesbury Frame &amp; Truss, Mulgrave; Church Building Site, Doonside; Jewels, Northmead; Holly's Buffet, Blacktown; Blacktown Hospital; Sterling Services, Prospect; Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service, Blacktown; Sydney Hi&amp;hyphen;Fi, Castle Hill; Grand United, Sydney; and the Diet Factory, Granville.

          —Tonight I wish to speak on an important local institution in my electorate and in my region which is under severe threat, the Adult Migrant English Services in Auburn, adjacent to the electorate of Parramatta. In September 1997, the central west region of Sydney had an unemployment rate of 14.6 per cent, seriously in front of the national picture. If we look at that central region more closely, we find that, even within it, there are severe differences in the figures. In the Auburn municipality, unemployment is far higher than 14.6 per cent. The clear reason is the presence of a high proportion of people born in non&amp;hyphen;English speaking countries. The reality in this economy—and in any economy world wide—is that not being able to speak the native tongue which is prevalent in business, commerce, et cetera, has very dire consequences for employment.

         When we look at the national picture, we find a very serious situation. In ABS figures of people who arrived in Australia before 1981, 190,000 people described themselves as speaking English `not well' or `not at all'. If we look at the overall national situation, in the 1996 census, we find that 416,000&amp;hyphen;plus people put themselves in those categories. There is a very urgent need in this country to ensure that the opportunity is available to people to gain the English skills required for employment in the work force.

The fact is—and this can be seen very clearly by the Australian electorate—that adult migrant English classes in this country are severely threatened. They face the imminent threat of being put out to tender by this government.

          It is very interesting that this government, in September 1997, through the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey), decided that a subsidiary of IBM—no minor player in the world economy—could be given a $30 million contract without a formal tender, with the minister for finance justifying it on the basis that `it had saved the expense of going through a formal tender'.

          —Tonight I want to speak about a man from my electorate, who lives in Lawnton, whom I have come to know in the past few months. He is a man whom I have come to admire greatly. His name is Sydney Kyle Little, a retired army colonel and TPI pensioner. He is a man with a fascinating history and career and life—a real Australian hero. He was the first white man to walk across Arnhem Land. He did that with his two Aboriginal trackers, Oondabund and Narlebar, almost losing his life in the process but for the fact that Oondabund was able to walk 60 miles away from where he had broken down with one of the other trackers and obtain water and come back again—a 60&amp;hyphen;mile round trip.

         An amazing man is Syd Kyle Little. His adventures of that time—he was working as a patrol officer in the Northern Territory in the late forties—are recounted in a book that he wrote called

         . I commend this book to all honourable members. It is a brilliant expose not only of the situation in Arnhem Land but of some incredible adventures. You talk about Crocodile Dundee: this fellow would leave Crocodile Dundee in a kindergarten with baby crocodiles. Syd Kyle Little has swum the rivers up there, and he has encountered the big crocs, the buffalos and what have you.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What was even more fascinating about him was his setting up of the Maningrida trading post in Arnhem Land. That in itself was a phenomenal feat. That trading post served as a place where the Aborigines could trade the results of their hunting—crocodile skins and other game and so forth that they hunted. They could then trade that with items that were useful to them. The system worked extremely well.

         After that he went to Malaya, where he commanded a group of Australian and British

          soldiers in a state in Malaya. He saw service there, having met the great General Sir Gerald Templar. He recounted to my son and me last Saturday being asked by Sir Gerald Templar to take a message to Mr Menzies, as he then was—this was in the mid fifties—to ask him for an improved government commitment to the Malayan emergency.

         All the time, I can assure you, Mr Speaker, he was extremely self-effacing. So fascinating is this man that you really have to pry some of the information out of him. I met his lovely  wife, Marianne. I also met his son, Simon, and grandson, who is named after one of Syd's trackers, Narlebar. The son, Simon, is still running tours in the Northern Territory, in Arnhem Land, at this moment and also speaks of some incredible situations up there and some treks, particularly the escarpment country in Arnhem Land.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I found Syd Kyle Little to have an amazing insight. He said that the situation at Maningrida worked very well until the Whitlam government came along with the sit-down money and with Nugget Coombs. I do not wish this as any great criticism of the late man himself, but from that time onward the situation at Maningrida deteriorated. Once the sit-down money came, as they called it, it was never the same up there. He was very disappointed with what happened as a result of that. Unfortunately, I believe we are going to see the results of that in years to come with the culture being taken away.

          —This evening I would like to speak about a matter which is very important to a number of suburbs in my electorate—the utilisation of Perth airport and the difficulties which utilisation of a modern airport can cause for residents living in suburbs close to that airport. In the case of Perth airport, it applies in particular to the suburb of Guildford, to the north of the airport; the suburbs of Midland, Midvale and Bellevue, to the north-east of the  airport; the suburb of Beechboro, to the north-west of the airport; and potentially in the future, if the airport is not managed properly, suburbs such as East Perth, Maylands, Bayswater, Ashfield and Bassendean, to the west of the airport along the Swan River.

        <para first-indent="16">
         There are a number of issues which go to the management of Perth airport, some of which, in the first instance, fall as a responsibility to the new privatised owners—Westralia Airports Corporation—and some of which fall to the government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I have been a longstanding critic of the failure of this government to continue the previous government's policy of extending the compensation regime for those residents most seriously adversely affected by aircraft noise, from Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport to Perth airport. That compensation, by way of acquisition of residences or amelioration of airport noise by insulation, is particularly the case so far as the residents of the suburb of Guildford and South Guildford are concerned.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So far as the long-term planning of airport is concerned, as many members who have parts of their electorates in or around areas where there are major airports would know, the new owners are required under the legislation to provide a master plan within 12 months of the purchase of the lease. In the case of Perth airport, that is at the end of June next year.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the issues of contention so far as the proposed master development plan of Perth airport is concerned is the proposed extension of runway O6/24, which is the north-east, south-west runway. Any extension of that runway runs a very considerable and grave
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          risk that suburbs to the west of the airport along the river—East Perth, Maylands, Bassendean, Bayswater and Ashfield—will be subject to airport and aircraft noise which they have never previously had. It is for this reason that I and local government officials and members in relevant areas have been putting the view very strongly both to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Vaile) and to the new owners that the master plan ought not to contain a proposal to extend runway 06/24. Indeed, if it does, the minister ought not to approve it.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the reasons for that is that the current master plan for Perth airport which has been in existence for nearly a decade has always been predicated on the basis of a parallel runway. The long-term land use planning around the airport has proceeded accordingly. Perth is very fortunate in having a number of active local authorities, many of whom are in my electorate, who comprise the Perth Municipalities Airport Group. Their mission in life is to ensure that the activities of the Perth and Jandakot airports do not unnecessarily adversely affect their residents. In my own electorate, the local authorities of Bassendean, Bayswater and Swan try to be assiduous to ensure that the adverse impacts for their residents are kept to a minimum.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the key factors in the modern day management of Perth airport is to make sure that there is a much better use of the airspace between Perth airport and the RAAF Pearce air base, which is immediately to the north of Perth airport. Better use of that airspace configuration, better coordination between those two airports and better coordination between RAAF Pearce and Airservices Australia have the potential to dramatically reduce the prospects for adverse aircraft noise, particularly for suburbs to the north of the airport.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That applies in particular to the suburb of Beechboro, because the prevailing north or north-easterly winds in the long, hot summer months in Perth force aircraft to take off to the north and then veer to the west over the edge of the suburb of Beechboro. A better configuration and utilisation of airspace between Perth and Pearce would have the
         <break page="10704" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          potential to eliminate that almost completely so far as Beechboro is concerned.

I know in my electorate of Gilmore, now boasting Australia's newest wine growing industry and agribusiness region, businesses are focusing on the benefits of exporting their products which are in great demand not only in the United States and European boutique wine markets but also in many more countries where opportunities, especially for smaller exporters, are rapidly expanding since the launch of the Supermarket to Asia Council by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard).

One operator can spend thousands of dollars attending a trade show, promoting a product, getting to know the main players in the potential market, conducting market research and identifying a marketing plan before his product even leaves the shores of Australia. And that goes for every single exporter and potential exporter in this country. That is thousands of dollars for each and every person before they even start getting something back in the form of the export dollars we hear so much about.

         Yet these small and medium sized businesses can follow the lead of the Australian wine industry in my electorate of Gilmore and join forces and promote the Australian face of industry overseas, thus saving them time and money. This means a group of oyster growers from Greenwell Point on the south coast, for example, can work with oyster growers in Sydney to market Australian oysters over

          seas—a great initiative. Yet this lack of cooperation is still one of the main impediments to domestic produce hitting foreign markets. It is something which has been identified by the Supermarket to Asia Council, by industry and by the very markets which Australian businesses need to access. Therefore, I believe a scheme which can help bring producers and manufacturers together to jointly promote their export potential deserves the support of this government and this parliament.

         The Supermarket to Asia Council provides the facility body to ensure Australia is well positioned to take advantage of the ever growing Asian food market. The business side of the scheme—the grassroots—needs proactive and ground level support. Export Illawarra, an initiative of the Illawarra Regional Economic Development Organisation, is an exciting and innovative approach to develop a regional cluster of businesses in order to facilitate a local export culture amongst regional business.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Export Illawarra has been established for nearly two years as a federally funded program which was initiated in response to concerns by local businesses that they needed to develop a clear export focus. Export Illawarra's project team, made up of key government and industry representatives, has been looking at the challenge of reducing the time frame and cost for small to medium enterprises, especially in the Shoalhaven region, for entering the export market.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So far they have identified a range of key objectives, including establishing international business partnerships to reduce export risks for local businesses and developing a regional cluster map to clearly identify export capability for the Shoalhaven region. This will result in businesses sharing the cost of entering a new market and sharing market access and information, and research and development costs associated with promotional activities such as trade missions and trade exhibitions.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Export Illawarra has enjoyed strong industry support and is working closely with local education, tourism and agribusiness sectors to identify strategic projects which will help them move into the global market. It has been

        <para first-indent="16">
         Export Illawarra will act as a conduit for local agribusiness, such as the oyster growers at Greenwell Point or the dairy farmers of Berry and Jaspers Brush, to meet the demands of the export market and to develop a local focus for the Australia wide supermarket to Asia program, as has been the case for our Shoalhaven winemakers. I will continue to support such a model as Export Illawarra, which can be a model for the rest of Australia.

        (2) The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1996 requires States receiving Commonwealth schools funding to participate in the production of the Annual National report on Schooling (ANR) in Australia. The legislation requires every State to report against an agreed framework which is closely linked to the Common and Agreed National Goals for Schooling. A review of the ANR led to the framework for the 1995 and future ANRs having a much greater focus than previously on the outcomes of schooling, including outcomes for school students as a whole and for educationally disadvantaged students.

New employees (as well as existing employees) will be free to negotiate with their employers (either collectively through a certified agreement or individually by an Australian Workplace Agreement) the level and components of their remuneration package, including employer superannuation contributions.
