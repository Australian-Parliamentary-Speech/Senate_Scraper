           —The working holiday program, which the Joint Standing Committee on Migration has been investigating for the last year, is a valuable program for Australia because it enhances the cultural and social development of young people; promotes mutual understanding between Australia and other nations; generates economic benefits; and is an important component of the tourism industry.
          </para>
         </talk.start>
         <para first-indent="16">
          However, the program has given rise to legitimate concerns that Australians are losing out on jobs because some employers are employing working holiday makers in preference to Australians. The committee found that working holiday makers can help create jobs in the tourism industry, but it also found that some employers in the tourism industry are choosing to employ working holiday makers with foreign language skills in preference to Australians with foreign language skills. Accordingly, Australians are not being given the opportunity to use the skills they have.

         <para first-indent="16">
          In Queensland, we heard from tour guides, especially those who speak Japanese, who were concerned that they were missing out on jobs because of the ready supply of working holiday makers. The committee also found that sections of the horticultural industry rely too heavily on working holiday makers to bring in the harvest. In Mildura and other horticultural regions across Australia, we heard from horticultural representatives who
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           told us that they need working holiday makers to harvest their crops because there are not enough Australians who want the work.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The committee has responded to the 95 submissions it received with recommendations to ensure that the working holiday program remains what it was intended to be—a chance for people to have an extended holiday in Australia, with work being incidental to that holiday. The committee is adamant that the working holiday program must not be used to solve labour market problems in Australia. It is also convinced that stronger action needs to be taken against people who flout the rules of the working holiday program by employing people illegally. We cannot let a program which is of such value to Australia be brought into disrepute by those who want a quick fix to their labour needs.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          For this reason, the committee has made a number of recommendations. Strategies should be developed to encourage the training and employment of Australians as tour guides, including mandatory accreditation within three years. Harvest labour strategies should be implemented, with appropriate government support to encourage more Australians to undertake horticultural work. A limit should be maintained on the number of working holiday makers allowed into Australia for the next three years so that appropriate judgments can be made about their impact on the labour market.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Further recommendations include: enhanced investigatory powers for the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and more rigorous compliance activity against tourists working illegally; and significant financial penalties for employers where, following appropriate warnings, they employ working holiday makers beyond the permissible time limit, or employ backpackers without work rights.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          During the inquiry, the committee received a number of suggestions for improving the working holiday program. The committee has responded to those suggestions by recommending the following: easier access to the program for applicants who are 26 to 30 years old; more agreements with other countries in order to diversify the program; removal of
          <break page="7386" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           unnecessary restrictions on people applying for working holiday visas; and better promotion of overseas working holiday opportunities for young Australians.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          If Australia is to get the maximum value from the working holiday program, more young Australians need to know about overseas working holidays and the benefits they offer. With high levels of youth unemployment, the committee was surprised that twice the number of working holiday makers arrive in Australia compared with the number of Australians travelling overseas on working holidays. We need to get the message to our young people that working holidays overseas are a great opportunity for personal development and for acquiring skills. In this way, we can tap into their spirit of adventure and help them to benefit from a worthwhile and valuable program.

          My thanks go to all those who contributed to the committee's inquiry. In particular, I would like to thank the Deputy Chair, Senator Jim McKiernan, and my fellow committee members for their support. The committee is particularly grateful to its secretariat, including Andres Lomp, Catherine Cornish, Gabrielle Jess, and Denise Picker and Sophia Konti. Special thanks are also due to our adviser, Christopher Dorrian, and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs for arranging his secondment. I commend the report to the House.

           —I endorse the remarks of the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) and I commend her for her work as chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. This is a very well balanced report. It is important, to begin with, to note that the committee recognises that this program is a valuable one. It is valuable to Australia in terms of its tourism interests. It is also valuable in terms of the cultural interchange that occurs in Australia as young people come here from overseas and spend some time working and developing contacts which they will then take back to their country. In that way, they form a network of people with direct and friendly experience of Australia. It is also valuable to the young Australians who take advantage of it, travel
           <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
            overseas and experience other countries for themselves.

          </para>
         </talk.start>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The committee is unanimously of the view that there is a real risk that this program may become significantly distorted and used for purposes other than for which it was intended. The member for Hindmarsh has mentioned our concerns regarding two specific industries—the tourism industry and the horticultural industry.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The report's recommendations identify strategies which we will press the government to take in order to ensure that the working holiday program is not distorted into a phoney labour market program. Appropriate labour market responses should be developed involving training Australians for those labour market niches but we should not exclude working holiday workers from those areas, unless it proves necessary. But there is a sting in the tail of the report because it says that, if appropriate local initiatives cannot be developed with the cooperation of the tourist industry, then the government must act. So it is a tough report.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Might I also say on behalf of the opposition that we have some real concerns that the numbers of people coming under this program are again becoming distorted. When the working holiday maker program was first capped, it was capped at the level of 33,000; it then rose to 42,000; the current minister increased it to 50,000 in his first year; and now the provisional target is 55,000 people coming as working holiday visa holders. It comes at a time when this government has shamefully engaged in a campaign to argue that immigration to Australia should be restricted so that people cannot meet and marry persons of their choice and bring them or their dependent children here as their family. For the government to have unlocked the working holiday visa program, which has people working in this country for extended periods of time, seems to be a hideously inconsistent message. The minister ought to consider not only the framework of recommendations regarding the measures necessary in particular industry sectors but also the question of what is the appropriate capping level.
         </para>
         <break page="7387" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          <para first-indent="16">
           By way of an example of the degree to which there is reciprocity, in 1995-96 there were only some 22,000 Australians went overseas under the working holiday program. I think we should do more to make this program known so that the advantages of Australians travelling overseas and working can reside in this country. We should be a little concerned that the reciprocity has got a little out of balance. In other words, there is less than half the number of Australians taking advantage of the working holiday scheme in overseas countries as there are of people from overseas coming to Australia to take part in the program.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The opposition strongly supports the existence and value of the working holiday program. It is a useful and constructive part of our tourism infrastructure; it does enable cultural exchange; it has some economic advantages to Australia, both directly and indirectly. However, we have flagged significant concerns with the way in which the scheme is currently operating, concerns that we will be giving attention to when the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) responds to the very significant recommendations contained in this report.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           I commend the report to the House and suggest it is one which correctly identifies the right balance. I commend to the minister the remarks of the member for Hindmarsh. I would press for the retention of the working holiday program because it is of value but I would note that it can be improved. In the absence of those improvements, there will be growing community concern.

I would also commend the work of the Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus). As the only Queenslander on the committee, it was a pleasure to play an active role in the preparation of this report and the inquiry into the working holiday visas, because Queensland is

          Australia has long been a drawcard for tourists and we take great pride in the tourism industry. Some aspects of the report were highlighted to us during our inquiry. In Queensland in particular, as a number of speakers have alluded to, there is a tour guide industry that needs to be looked at seriously. We often see large groups of Japanese coming to enjoy our culture. However, most of the tour guides that take them around from location to location have a very limited understanding of the Australian way of life and culture.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Working holiday makers are drawn to this country for a number of reasons: the wonderful climate we have, a sense of adventure and the wonderful opportunities that exist for them. The committee during its inquiry looked at a number of areas including: the scope and criteria of the program, the granting of the working holiday visas, reciprocal arrangements with other nations and the effect of working holiday makers on employment levels. We went to substantial lengths to ensure that we received reliable, investigative submissions. There were 89 submissions in total. The committee travelled all over Australia holding public hearings and made a point of talking to both employees and employers.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We concluded that the working holiday program does play a very important role in Australia. Working holiday makers who do come to Australia take away with them many experiences, skills and a knowledge of Australian culture. They experience the Australian way of life in a much more detailed way than if they were just a normal visitor. We also have a reliance on these working holiday makers because they bring some $450 million to Australia in tourism dollars.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I would like to stress the importance of the reciprocal nature of the program in that Australians can also experience those wonderful feelings by travelling overseas. We highlighted in the report, and I notice the previous speaker also alluded to this, the fact that not enough Australians are taking advantage of the program and that twice as many working
          <break page="7388" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           holiday makers come to Australia as Australians go overseas. We need to have a better education process so that we encourage Australians to experience those wonderful programs overseas. I strongly emphasise that further promotion and greater strategies should be developed to ensure the benefits of the program are widely known throughout Australia. Promotional material needs to be provided which is targeted to age groups that are more likely to be working holiday makers, and we need to have access to those people.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          One of the focuses of the inquiry was on the labour market area, which has also been mentioned by a number of speakers. The impact on the horticultural industry is absolutely phenomenal. This was evident when we spoke to a number of growers, both in Mildura and in North Queensland, and were told that the horticultural industry could not survive without working holiday makers. We need to be more responsive to this industry; we need to provide greater training opportunities; we need to promote horticultural opportunities for our young people; and we need to look closely at developing courses in TAFE colleges.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I was very proud to be part of the committee. I would like to emphasise that we also need to look at areas and make sure that working holiday makers are not exploited and that insurance is taken out for them in the area of health. Similarly, employers need to play a very active and responsible role and ensure that they do the right thing and employ people with the correct visas.

          As the shadow minister for tourism, obviously my concern with this report is that issues associated with the role that working holiday makers play in Australia be not understated. As was noted by my colleague the member for Denison (Mr Kerr), the government minister has decided that we will increase the number of people who can come to Australia under this particular visa program. I think that needs to be balanced by the fact that, on many occasions at least, the people who are here under this program are carrying out work which, for some reason, Australians do not seem to want to do.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The evidence that we received, for example, in fruit picking areas would seem to indicate that some Australians just are not prepared to do that. As a consequence, people who came from many of these overseas countries who were prepared to travel for the experience did get involved in that. As a consequence, many of the horticulturalists and others who took advantage of working holiday makers did so in the knowledge that they were contributing to their own education about that particular location but, importantly as well, that they were having their crops picked. As a consequence, economically it was so significant for them.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I think the simple fact that in the tourism industry some concerns were raised with us in respect of guides and bus drivers does flag a problem that needs further review and further consideration. For example, I know that there are a number of people in Sydney, as well as in Queensland, who operate with tour companies as bus drivers. They are concerned that a number of tour operators from Japan—and this is something that seems to be spreading to tourists coming from other countries—are actually employing working holiday visa holders as the bus drivers, in
          <break page="7389" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         <para first-indent="16">
          Many Australians who have taken the opportunity to train in languages, particularly Japanese or Chinese or Korean, are finding now that, even though they have those hard-won skills—often supplemented, I might say, by extended periods of time living in those countries to get an appreciation of not only the finer points of the language but also the social mores that accompany people living in those countries—they are being squeezed out of some of the markets.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          What we are finding also is that some of the more unscrupulous people, particularly in North Queensland, are, in fact, swapping workers around. They come here for a period of time. They are only supposed to work for a limited amount of that time that they are here. But those people are, in fact, being employed by one particular company and then three months later, by some sleight of hand, they are going on and being employed by another company. Really, at the end of the day, when you trace through the way in which this is put in place it is the same tourist wholesaler out of one of these foreign countries.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          These are issues which need to be reviewed because I think what we need to always keep in mind is that the reason working holiday makers come to Australia is just that: they come as tourists, but they also have an opportunity to work for a period of time. They do not come here to work the whole time. They come here so that they can experience something of this great country of ours. They come so that they can then go back as ambassadors for Australia and tell other people about how important and how significant we are as a tourist destination.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Too often in this place and elsewhere we understate the importance of tourism to the Australian economy. For Australia, it is a $14 billion a year industry. Yet people say that this is not a real industry; it is not creating real jobs; it is not genuine. In fact, this inquiry has shown that to be anything other than the case.

           —This is the first occasion in its 13-year history that the committee has resolved to present a separate report to the parliament—hence, to the public—of its activities over the preceding financial year period. We have done so because there has been some criticism that the committee in the past has not been as diligent as perhaps it should in carrying out its functions, which are set out in section 55 of the National Crime Authority Act 1984.

          I am very pleased to say that this current committee, which I have the honour of chairing and which was re&amp;hyphen;formed in May 1996, I think, has worked very well and has done its job very effectively. A cursory or careful reading of the report that I am tabling today should indicate to any interested observer that this committee has worked very well.

           I would like to pay tribute to the members of the committee: my colleague and the Labor Party member for Maribyrnong, Mr Sercombe, who is sitting opposite, as the deputy chairman of the committee; Labor Senator Stephen Conroy from Victoria; Liberal Senator Jeannie Ferris from South Australia; Paul Filing, the Independent member for Moore in Western Australia; Labor Senator Brenda Gibbs from Queensland; National Senator Julian McGauran from Victoria; Democrat Senator Natasha Stott Despoja from South Australia; Mr Warren Truss, the member for Wide Bay in Queensland; and my colleague and the member for Bowman in Queensland, Mrs Andrea West, who is in the chamber with me today.

           It is not easy to chair a committee such as this. It is not only a joint standing committee, including both senators and members, but probably more than any other committee in the parliament, I would suggest, it has wider representation—of all the parties in the parliament and the member for Moore, who is an Independent member of the parliament. The committee has worked together well. It is an important committee, and perhaps it is more important today than it has ever been in terms of its given functions, which are spelt out in section 55 of the act.

           The committee has a good relationship with the National Crime Authority itself. Obviously there is a fine line in preserving that relationship in a workman&amp;hyphen;like way: we are not there to act in any respect as a rubber stamp for the NCA; we are there to offer advice and constructive criticism of the authority. The committee has probably found the right balance in that relationship over the past 12 months. I would like to thank particularly the current Chairman of the NCA, Mr Broome, for the cooperation that he has offered to the committee on occasions and, indeed, his availability both to me as chairman of the committee and to individual members of the committee who at any time may wish to discuss a matter with him.

           In particular, the war against drugs has assumed increased prominence over the last 12 months and, in recent days, the issue of paedophilia is very much on the agenda. Other than carrying out a strategic assessment of paedophile activity in Australia, which has recently been completed, the NCA at this moment has no direct role in that particular issue. Nevertheless, it may be a matter which the NCA picks up in the future.

           —One of the things that immediately strikes members of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority in looking at the role of the NCA is the vital nature of the linkages between the NCA and other law enforcement organisations. Those linkages are absolutely critical for effective law enforcement from the Commonwealth level and are crucial for success. The linkages that are critical are, obviously, Customs, the Federal Police and AUSTRAC from the point of view of the federal government directly and then, in terms of cooperative arrangements with the states, organisations such as the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence.

          As the chairman of the committee, the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), has just pointed out, the crime environment with which the NCA is involved is a complex one and one that requires a cohesive effort by those sorts of organisations. It is therefore particularly depressing, I think, to see the way in which the government has in recent times handled the budget appropriations for the organisations to which I refer, particularly for the Federal Police, who are absolutely critical in terms of the NCA's effectiveness.

           Simple statistics speak for themselves. The Federal Police have 651 fewer officers in 1996 than they did in 1988, and that is against the background of a rapid expansion in the functions they are expected to perform. The Australian Federal Police Association recently published a newsletter which, amongst other things, says:
          </para>
          <para font-size="-=2">
           The AFP is in real danger of vanishing into impotency. Only the enemy, and perhaps that includes some politicians, are laughing at this situation. Not only was a critical mass of AFP staffing reached some time ago, but the forecast reductions of 12% over the next two years will make recovery from our dire position of last year impossible. In other words, according to AFP forecasting, at least 1 in 10 of us will have to leave the AFP within the next two years to meet these cuts!
          </para>
          <para style="Para">
           What does that say about the environment in which this government is expecting the NCA as a colleague organisation to operate? I think it says a lot about the government's lack of seriousness in these priorities.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The failure of the government to address these important issues is reflected in a letter the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) sent to the Australian Federal Police Association on 14 August. It is a truculent and a petulant letter. He says in conclusion to his letter:
          </para>
          <para font-size="-=2">
           I do not intend to hold discussions with you . . . I would not wish to enter into cooperative arrangements with a group that is attacking the government's policies and I would not think that the AFP would wish to do so.
          </para>
          <para style="Para">
           In this petulant letter the Attorney-General accuses the Federal Police Association of being patronising. He goes on to say that he could have discussed with them the government's reasons for commissioning a review of the financial practices of the AFP and that he might have discussed with them the importance of government and the parliament being aware of the work of the AFP and the impact of that work on the Australian community. He also said:

           But the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General is not prepared to talk to the Federal Police Association, because they have the audacity to occasionally make public comments that, in his own words, are critical of government policies. I find that to be, as I said, a truculent and a petulant attitude by this second&amp;hyphen;rate Attorney-General and one which really leads this House to have to question his competence. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) appears to have made some judgments about his competence by not promoting him to the cabinet. One can see from this letter perhaps some of the reasons why the Prime Minister's view on that was justified. I seek leave to table this letter to the AFP from the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, because I think it does display his incompetence and his inability to adequately address the problems that his portfolio has.

            —That says volumes for how seriously the Australian people can take the commitments of this government to do something serious about the criminal problems this community faces, particularly in relation to the drug menace. The facts are that the Australian Federal Police and other law enforcement agencies are having their budgets cut to the bone. The response of the Attorney-General to that is to try to shoot the messenger, to have a go at those responsible policemen and policewomen who, through their association, seek to question him and seek to involve him in dialogue and discussion. They get a kick in the teeth for their trouble.

           —The National Crime Authority has come under a fair bit of criticism in recent times. The Chairman of the Joint Statutory Committee on the National Crime Authority, the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), indicated that it is not our job to act as a sort of glee club or defence organisation for the NCA—to the contrary. In our evaluation inquiry, which we are undertaking at present, we have heard a fair bit of evidence from people who are either critics or supporters of the NCA's role.

          It is interesting to note that, in the evidence given by Mr John Elliott in a public hearing
          <break page="7392" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           in Melbourne recently, he accused former Labor prime ministers Hawke and Keating of being involved in a conspiracy with the NCA to bring him down. It is notable that in that public evidence he indicated that there had been a settlement between him and the two former prime ministers. We are hoping that, as part of our evaluation inquiry, we will get to hear from Messrs Hawke and Keating as to what exactly that settlement was. I am sure many people would like to know what happened as a consequence of Mr Elliott's legal action against those two former Labor prime ministers.

          In the report a number of matters are raised. Amongst the most important is the question of complaints to the committee. One of the problems the committee has had ever since I have been a member and before I became a member—I joined in 1990 and I know from a number of previous committee reports that previous committee chairmen and committee personnel had the same problem—is that the committee is underresourced or in a less competent position to be able to properly investigate complaints made to it about the behaviour of the National Crime Authority. That is something that really needs to be resolved, although, having had complaints coming forward from 1984 onwards, I am not holding my breath. Every time there is a report or a comment made by the committee asking for a resolution to this particular problem, the government of the day—whether Liberal or Labor—seems to ignore it.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The next matter is this cutback problem. The member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) indicated that there is a problem. Just about all the evidence we have heard in public and privately would indicate that there is a serious problem in law enforcement, particularly in the area of drugs. We know that the country is awash in heroin and that there are, according to the Victoria Police, children as young as 12 and 13 selling heroin at $7 a pop in Little Bourke Street in Melbourne.

From the perspective of being a member from Western Australia, which is one-third of the continent in terms of area and has the largest coastline of any of the states, we are particularly appalled by the fact that the federal government has cut back so severely the resources of the AFP, the Customs Service and the NCA. Notwithstanding that there was a grant of money to the NCA in the budget, that grant of money was in fact designed to increase its work involved in Commonwealth related fraud—that is, fraud on the Commonwealth government—which is nothing to do with drugs, the No. 1 problem affecting our community today.

          I notice the chairman nodding his head. I hope that in the party room he, along with others, will urge the government to reverse this trend and in fact beef up Commonwealth law enforcement resources. I would suggest that we need a $100 million war against crime and drug trafficking. The proceeds and property and all the cash associated with the trafficking of drugs should be able to be seized and in fact used by the law enforcement agencies to resource themselves against these insidious organisations, who seem to be so very well resourced themselves.

          In the concluding moments, may I make two observations. We noted that Mr Kendall from Interpol appeared before the committee.

I hope they do that properly so that we can succeed at it.

          I also comment on the fact that the Adelaide bombing occurred in March 1994; still nobody has been charged with that. It is one of the most grave attacks on law enforcement and the justice system in this country's history.

          The latest listings provide another opportunity to revisit the subject. We need to be aware that fishing provides many jobs, directly and indirectly, and that too many constraints will have an impact on fishing as a business. At the same time, Australia is a signatory to the Bonn Convention and is therefore legally obliged to introduce and to enforce measures which protect migratory birds like the albatross. Many Australians would be uncomfortable if this nation did not take appropriate steps. Our report supports the listings and we believe that our recommendations will assist in carrying out this published duty more effectively.

          We have therefore recommended that Australia continue its efforts to optimise membership of international agreements; that all Commonwealth departments and agencies involved in managing our membership of the convention harness the available expertise in the most effective way; that the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, AFMA, examine the observer program to establish the costs and benefits of placing trained observers on all boats in Australia's fishing areas; and that AFMA discuss with the tuna fishing industry the testing of such techniques as night setting of bait on the high seas.

          However, we are concerned about three things. Firstly, it is regrettable that the first national interest analysis, NIA, which was tabled, omitted the listing of the two species of cetaceans. I understand that the oversight occurred in spite of a number of organisations involved in the process asking the sponsor whether any other species were involved in these listings as well as the albatrosses.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Secondly, we are concerned about the time it took to produce the record of the proceedings of the conference of the parties. This ended in April and was still not available when the revised NIA was tabled in mid&amp;hyphen;June. While we have not made a recommendation on this matter we have suggested that Australia should offer the secretariat to the conference whatever assistance it can to ensure the
          <break page="7394" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           results of the conference are available as soon as practicable after its conclusion.

          Thirdly, we are still not satisfied with the amount and timing of the consultation involved in the process of parliamentary scrutiny of treaties. Last Monday, in the course of some additional remarks on our eighth report, my colleague the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) drew attention to two examples of inadequate consultation in areas where particular organisations should have been involved in the process. In the case of the Bonn Convention, such consultation as did occur about the listing of the cetaceans was later than desirable.

          The problem of human induced albatross mortality is not new. Indeed, it is pleasing to see the continuation by the current government of the policy of protecting these species that emerged under the Keating government. Albatross populations are declining at a rate of up to 90 per cent and several species are facing extinction if current fishing practices continue. The main threat to the albatross
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           comes from their practice of feeding on bait, catch and offal discarded near long&amp;hyphen;lining boats. Bait is attached to hooks on lines between 10 and 80 metres long. Albatross swallow this bait and the attached hooks which become embedded in their gullet and they drown.

          In 1991, Nigel Brothers published the first of several articles which now provide the foundation for ongoing work in Tasmania and at Latrobe University. Based upon research from 1988, he brought the crisis facing albatross populations into the public sphere. His studies found that a `conservative calculation' of the albatross take by Japanese long&amp;hyphen;liners operating in the Southern Ocean was 44,000 birds annually. Breaking this figure down, it was estimated that for every 1,000 hooks set a minimum of 0.4 birds become entangled and drown. Given that an average of 108 million hooks are set in southern seas each year, this translates to a threatening and unsustainable level of albatross take.

          In response to scientific information, developments are now occurring where a range of interest groups are working together to combat both species specific impacts and more broadly the formation of a Commonwealth bycatch policy. This is an unprecedented alliance of government, industry and conservation bodies wherein no party sees any benefit stemming from the bycatch of conservation significant species. Bycatch refers to species that are incidentally and unintentionally captured in commercial fishing operations.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Technological innovations to combat bycatch include both gear and operational changes. In relation to albatross, this includes setting bait at night, when albatross do not feed, and the use of tori poles and streamers to scare birds away. Despite the initial outlay of capital needed, fishers are positively inclined to use such innovations. Indeed, one estimate suggests that the revenue loss due to seabirds taking bait is $7 million per annum.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The research is, by no means, conclusive, however, and new problems are ever emerging. For example, the practice of setting bait at night has become problematic because, although albatross are not nocturnal feeders,
          <break page="7395" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           petrels and other migratory seabirds are. One of the most crucial factors in reducing or eliminating the unnecessary destruction of wildlife in commercial fisheries is continued funding for research thereinto. There is a need to finance ongoing tracking of juvenile albatross. Moreover, investigations into long-term strategies such as underwater bait setting should be encouraged and appropriately resourced.

          The ninth inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties considered Australia's nomination of 11 species of albatross to the Bonn Convention for the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, to which Australia has been a signatory for close to 20 years. The listing of a species requires that nations either take action to encourage their recovery or form international agreements to benefit such species.

As Myanmar has been a part of ASEAN since 23 July there is a regional connotation which is particularly

         In 1960 her mother was appointed ambassador to New Delhi, the first senior female Burmese diplomat, and she enjoyed a privileged life in India. However, in 1962, after years of ineffectual civilian rule, there was an army coup under General Ne Win, leading to the imposition of an army based authoritarian rule in which Burma, in effect, withdrew into isolation. In her years in India, Suu Kyi studied the works of Mahatma Gandhi, whose life and example had a profound impact. To that must be added the pacifism and respect for all forms of life of her Buddhist faith and her exposure to the Western liberal tradition with its openness to new ideas. She is a fascinating mixture of traditional and radical thinking.

We spent a lot of time talking about the problems of Suu Kyi. We called in the ambassador for Burma. We had an absolutely memorable discussion where he said that, in the view of his government, they were not prepared to throw Burma open to democracy because, in their view, democracy was an experiment which, after 200 years in Europe, could not be seen to have succeeded. I said, `How long before you think you can form a judgment?' He said, `Perhaps another century.' I said, `And in the case of the lady?' He said, `Thirty or 40 years. Who can tell?' Suu Kyi is, for practical purposes, still under house arrest. Although she is not formally under house arrest, for practical purposes access to her is denied.

          —I am pleased to support this motion by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). Having in Australia one of the oldest stable democratic traditions, we largely take those liberal democratic forms for granted. We achieved democracy in Australia without a struggle and without any sort of revolution. There was no reign of terror in Australia. There was no Boston Tea Party. All too often we take the liberal democratic forms we have for granted. Taking democracy for granted is not an option for Aung San Suu Kyi and the 45 million people of Burma, who continue to suffer under the despotic rule of the State Law and Order Restoration Council, or SLORC

         If asked to think of an image that characterises the struggle in Burma, most people would think of Aung San Suu Kyi and her weekend addresses from the walls of her compound, where she has spent six years under house arrest. Just as Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi symbolised their nations' struggle for democracy, Aung San Suu Kyi has become a potent symbol of the democratic aspirations

         As we send our warm birthday wishes, albeit belated, to Aung San Suu Kyi, it is worth reflecting on her life. Born in the middle of Burma's struggle for independence, her father, General Aung San, was the architect of Burma's independence from Britain. General Aung San was assassinated five months before his country achieved independence in 1948.

         Educated in India and at Oxford, Aung San Suu Kyi married an Englishman and had expected to continue her life in England in the cloistered world of English academe. How different it was to the way she spent the last nine years. In 1988 she returned to Burma to care for her mother, who was ill. She returned to a Burma that had been in a state of impoverishment and repression as a result of three decades of the mismanaged ideals of army commander General Ne Win.

         As we have seen former Warsaw Pact countries slowly adopting the practices of market economies and making treaties to join NATO over the last 10 years, Burma, in keeping with the successful tradition of other isolated countries like Albania and North Korea, has remained closed to the world and watched its economy stagnate, its currency depreciate and its people persecuted.

         Aung San Suu Kyi became deeply involved with the democracy movement in Burma and became leader of the newly formed National League for Democracy in September 1988. In 1989 she was placed under house arrest, where she remained until 1995. In May 1990, in the first multiparty elections for 30 years, the National League for Democracy won a landslide victory with 85 per cent of the vote.

          Today, Aung San Suu Kyi is a free person. However, that description is loose. She needs permission to leave her compound, and her phones are frequently disconnected. As we heard from the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), he was turned back three times and not allowed to meet her. Despite everything, Aung San Suu Kyi's determination to free Burma remains strong and remains a shining example of the human spirit.

          How do we in Australia get Burma to change? As the right honourable member for New England and the member for Lalor said, there have been two approaches made to pressure Burma to reform. The approach of the United States, Canada and, to an extent, Europe, has focused on economic sanctions to isolate Burma. That is not an approach that I think will be particularly fruitful. The Association of South East Asian Nations has sought to encourage political reform through constructive engagement, fostering links in the hope that economic growth will lead to political liberalism. Unfortunately, those two approaches are in conflict and tend to cancel each other out.

          The recent admission of Burma into ASEAN has placed both opportunity and responsibility firmly in the lap of ASEAN members. ASEAN must ensure that the admission of Burma is not seen as a reward for its despotic leaders, and that its ensuing leverage is used to pressure Burma into fundamental liberalisation of its political processes. Australia must continue to encourage ASEAN countries to use their links with the junta to encourage change in Burma. I commend this motion to the House.

Quite frankly, I think it severely

         On 27 May last year the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) said that Australia neither encouraged nor discouraged trade with the regime in Burma. I for one certainly feel that this regime—and we have to be very careful about the overuse of these kinds of sanctions—does merit such action.

         The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) commented on the state of the economy. The sad fact of life is that recent international monetary organisations have indicated that the importance of the drug trade in Burma is such that there is a major discrepancy in the country's accounts. That is how extensive it is. By absorbing certain guerilla forces, and by allowing them to be legitimate businessmen, they have actually brought into the economy, into the mainstream through laundering processes, such an amount of money that international agencies are actually focussing on it.

         In 1988, this regime shot down demonstrators who were protesting about economic conditions. In September 1988 there was the decision to seize direct power in a more formal sense through the State Law and Order Restoration Council. Then there was the 1989 detention of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. In May 1990, the electoral victory of the National League for Democracy was basically ignored, and this led to the final process, of course, of people being incarcerated. When the results were ignored a supposedly national convention process was established whereby, once again, a self&amp;hyphen;appointed majority essentially totally ignored the views of those people who could claim to represent the people.

         So we have a track record of very little concern for what the world thinks and we have a track record of allowing very severe restrictions to be placed upon people's rights. This is not a case of an occasional problem with human rights a la Singapore with regard to trying to bankrupt opposition politicians or with respect to other countries in our region where, essentially, as a leading democratic country, we might be able to undertake some occasional questioning. This is intrinsic in this regime, and it is continuing. To my mind we

         There are different analyses of what will happen with Burma's absorption into ASEAN. Despite quibbling at the sides by ASEAN over events in Cambodia and concerns at the way in which the Hun Sen forces sidelined the other parts of the government, essentially the tone of the organisation is still non&amp;hyphen;interference in internal affairs, basically business as usual—that is, `Let us all make sure, regardless of what our partners do and regardless of how few rights people have within their regimes, that we do not interfere internally.' So I must be pessimistic about the possibilities of this organisation, ASEAN, being used in any real sense to undermine the regime.

        <para first-indent="16">
         If this proposal is permitted to proceed, those who have purchased blood glucose meters requiring test strips that attract a premium will have to pay the extra cost, in addition to the standard patient co&amp;hyphen;payment. Effectively, this will increase testing costs by a minimum of 40 per cent per annum.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This premium pricing strategy is an ill&amp;hyphen;advised, cost cutting measure that cannot be rationalised on medical or economic grounds. I urge the government to rethink this proposal so that it will not be allowed to proceed. The government has persisted in its attempt to

          —Australian jobs and job security are guaranteed by creating the right environment for investment in Australia's future. The Howard government, with its hands off the lever attitude to the Australian economy and Australian jobs, cannot deliver new jobs and cannot create job security. And the Hanson formula of fortress Australia and hostility to foreigners—both investors and new Australians—is also doomed to fail those Australians who are looking for a solution to our No. 1 problem, jobs and job security.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The Labor Party argues that the solution to job creation is creative and intelligent intervention in the marketplace by government, something neither the two Hs—Hanson and Howard—seem to appreciate. That is why, when we left government, Labor was developing a new policy focus to work with superannuation funds—whose massive funds are, after all, workers' money—to secure and assist job creation in Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Labor also believes that we have to create an environment for overseas investment so that we can create Australian jobs. Overseas companies investing in Australia—such as Toyota at Altona, Mitsubishi in Adelaide, Simplot in regional Tasmania, Kodak in Coburg, Nestles, Ford, Sheraton Hotels and a variety  of other companies—are companies that we ought to be proud of. They are creating jobs in Australia.

         The Hansonite formula may well scare off further overseas investment to create jobs, to build job security. The Hansonite formula of a simplistic rhetoric of raising and reintroducing tariffs may actually hurt Australian companies which have created good jobs by exporting their products overseas.

         We, the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia in Parliament assembled, have received with profound sorrow the news of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. On behalf of the Australian people, we express deep sympathy to Your Majesty and other members of the Royal Family, especially Their Royal Highnesses, Prince William of Wales and Prince Henry of Wales, and we mourn the loss sustained by so many people.

         The news of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in such harrowing circumstances yesterday was one of those events that can fairly be said to have grabbed the attention, in a profound way, of the entire world, not only because of the news coverage extended but also because of the suddenness of and the shock that always accompanies such events, emphasised by the very public character of the life of the person involved and the particularly distressing circumstances of her death.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I know that the thoughts and, indeed, the prayers of many Australians went immediately to her two sons, William and Harry. The loss of a mother for two boys aged 15 and 12—whoever the people involved and whatever the circumstances—is always a situation of particular sadness and grief. Their grief will not be entirely private because of the very public character of their lives and those of both their parents.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The death of the Princess of Wales has gripped the attention of the world in a way which makes us reflect for a moment on the continued force of the human personality in a world that is meant to be becoming increasingly depersonalised. Our responses to and the emotions caused by these tragic events have absolutely nothing to do with the attitudes we may have about the role of the monarchy or the royal family in our society. Those things do not belong to this condolence motion or to the reactions of the Australian people to these events. I hope that we react like men and women who share the emotions, as best they can, not only of their own circumstances but also of others.

         Diana, Princess of Wales, was a beautiful, stylish woman. Of that there is no doubt. But she was more than that. She was one of those
         <break page="7406" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          people who managed, through a combination of circumstances, to fascinate and interest millions of people around the world.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Diana was only 36 at her death, and she leaves, as we all know, two sons. She was a person who, in her relatively short life, experienced what many would regard as both the highs and lows of the ultimate as far as public life is concerned. I doubt that there is a woman in the world who was more talked about or reported on in recent years than the late Princess of Wales. I doubt that there has been a marriage in recent years whose disintegration was more public and more reported upon than that of Diana and Prince Charles. That adds all the more to the poignancy of the feelings we have for her two sons.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Diana demonstrated a commitment to many worthwhile causes. One of the things which gave her a particular appeal to people right across the social spectrum was the spontaneity of her involvement in so many causes. Her appeal was not an elitist appeal—although she undoubtedly did appeal to many people who might regard themselves as elite—but it had its greatest force amongst the mainstream of not only the British community but, I dare say, the communities of Australia, the United States, France and many other nations of the world. The outpouring of emotion and sadness from so many people within the mainstream of our society and other societies is a testament to that.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Diana's spontaneous commitment to the campaign against landmines, her very early disavowal of some of the myths of association with people who had AIDS, her ready embrace of the cause and the interests of people who suffered such debilitating diseases as leprosy and her constant involvement with charities involved in the care and nurture of children all stamped her as a person willing to associate with those less fortunate in our community.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Some may say that, whatever the circumstances of her life, particularly over the last 16 years, she certainly did not live in straitened circumstances. That is undeniably the case. It is also undeniably the case that many who live in relatively equally comfortable circumstances do not have the commitment

         Diana was welcomed many times to Australia. The four-week royal tour of Australia in 1983 broke with tradition when the infant Prince William accompanied his mother and father. The Prince and Princess of Wales also visited in Australia in 1985, going to both Canberra and Melbourne. They came again in 1988 to celebrate the bicentenary and they handed over Britain's gift to Australia, the sail training ship, the

        <para first-indent="16">
         Many will remember Diana's last visit to Australia in November last year to attend a charity event for the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute—ironically, in memory of a man who had given so much to Australia and to the world and who also died in very sad and tragic circumstances. At that time she took in a visit to the research institute, St Vincent's Hospital, the Sacred Heart Hospice, a charity lunch for the Commonwealth Day Council and the Royal Rehabilitation Centre at Ryde.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Many Australians will remember the images of her embracing people suffering illness and many will remember how she was reunited with Ben Robertson, aged 18, who had struck up a friendship with her some years ago when his father worked as her equerry on a previous royal tour to Australia. Ben had become a quadriplegic the previous June after injuring his spinal cord in a rugby match.

        <para first-indent="16">
         As I have mentioned, she was patron to a variety of charitable causes.

Many Australians who met her on her frequent visits to this country will remember her with very great affection and will want to be associated with the sentiments that are being expressed here today.

I am privileged to be able to speak on our behalf here today and agree with those sentiments well expressed by the Prime Minister. I think all of us will remember what we did yesterday. It is one of those seminal events such that, when a personal life which has become such a public life and so broadly shared is terminated, it impacts upon the lives of all of us.

         The shock was all the more profound because the early reports from the hospital were somewhat more hopeful as to what had been the outcome of the accident, tragic though it had been for the others involved.

         The Prime Minister was right to identify her two sons as the people who will suffer most from this, but there will be many sufferers. First, with her sons, she was a loving mother

          and a caring mother; she was a mother who obviously meant a great deal to them. She obviously had a rapport with children and she incorporated many within her ambit of affection. I suppose it stemmed somewhat from her background as a kindergarten teacher. I guess not many people remember that, but that is what she was trained to be. She obviously learned her lessons well as she extrapolated her professional experience, mixed it with her natural emotions and became a friend to many children everywhere.

         Many in this country and I think most of us in this parliament will have met her at one time or another. Certainly I have on a number of occasions—two of which were referred to by the Prime Minister: in 1983, when, I suspect, he probably met her then himself, and then again in 1988, when she was out here for those celebrations of ours. I met her basically because her then husband was the Honorary Colonel of the Armoured Corps in Australia and there was a reception and parade at Puckapunyal. I had an opportunity to have more than just some cursory words with her and was taken quite by surprise at the considerable depth that she had. It was not quite what I had expected, but it was something that we all came to know over succeeding years and probably should have known by then.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The Prime Minister listed an extraordinary array of charities. It is not uncommon for members of the British aristocracy to associate themselves with charitable activity. What is uncommon is what she chose to associate herself with. There is nothing lovely, nothing necessarily even uplifting, about the circumstances that caused the charities with which she was associated.

         HIV-AIDS sufferers went for many years unrecognised and then, when recognised, despised. When she took up their cause, they were still despised. They are not now. Then she took on charities associated with leprosy. That is still despised. That is still a charity that people find very difficult to come to grips with in many countries, but it was not a problem for her. More recently, of course, there were the tragic circumstances globally associated with profligate mining activities of
         <break page="7408" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         She did all of these things with great daring, great joy, great spontaneous affection. There were pictures of her walking down the roads in not&amp;hyphen;yet&amp;hyphen;cleared mined areas. It must have given her guards heart failure. That was not a very sensible thing to do. Nevertheless, she was prepared to put an image of herself alongside a terrible problem—likewise, sitting for a long period of time holding hands with lepers; likewise, sitting for a long period of time holding an HIV-AIDS affected baby.

         So she won a place in the hearts of all of us through those spontaneous and warm gestures. I think it was probably a surprise to many of us that we missed her. It was a surprise to me when it occurred yesterday. I have to say that the issues affecting the British royal family are not the first thing on my mind every morning, and even the concern about whether or not they should be our head of state is not on my mind first thing every morning as I wake up. All of a sudden, all that service of hers, all those images of her in those circumstances in which she chose to place herself, all came home.

         I guess, as part of that equation, that involved a use of the media and even elements of the paparazzi. But that did not in any way justify the unfettered and very much on the edge of the law, if not beyond the law, intrusion which came from elements of the paparazzi as they hounded Princess Diana through much of her life. I guess we can also ask the question: was her role as a spouse and her role as a free&amp;hyphen;standing charity worker a circus for the sake of a circus and attention? The answer to that question must clearly be no. Given the choice and the level of commitment to the task, it is clearly obvious that she carried a very genuine and determined will to assist those who were worse off: those who were afflicted by leprosy, by AIDS and by antipersonnel mines right around the world.

I remember a beautiful and elegant young woman who was remarkably at ease with ordinary people, notwithstanding her subsequent remarks as to how much a challenge she found this to be initially at places like Alice Springs.

With even Treasury and the Reserve Bank saying that the government has slowed the economy, will the Treasurer now admit that the government has failed on jobs and has failed on growth?

          Building approvals released today for the three months to July 1997 were down, but seasonally adjusted over the year they were up 8.6 per cent. The Citibank REIA index of home affordability increased 5.1 per cent in the March quarter and is now at its highest level since September 1994.

          Housing approvals and building approvals will vary from month to month and quarter to quarter. We had an exceptionally strong one in May, as I recall, because Olympic building was coming through. But for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition it is not enough to look at year long developments, nor is it enough to look at trends, because that does not suit the argument. What he does is ignore all of the strong ones until he can find one that corrects, and then he gets up and asks one of these juvenile questions that he just engaged in. The fact of the matter is that the housing cycle will recover—as we have always said—gradually over the course of 1997&amp;hyphen;98, as it comes off a dramatic excess of supply over demand which pent up in 1994.

          Unquestionably, the economy slowed throughout the course of late 1995, early 1996, as it was intended to, as a result of the Labor Party raising interest rates at the end of 1994 by 2¾ per cent in a determined effort to slow the economy, and it worked. We said at the time that that was necessary because an economy that was running at growth rates in excess of four per cent with huge current account deficits and budget deficits could not sustain growth.

          We would be in the same position if we had not addressed structural problems in the Australian economy.

If we had not been raising savings, we would not have been in a position to sustain increased growth over 1997&amp;hyphen;98 as a result of the current account deficit. If we had not locked in low inflation with a new statement of monetary policy, we would have just gone through the cycle again.

The shadow Treasurer says, `The first 10&amp;half; years we were just warming up, ignore them, and just take into account the last 2&amp;half; of the first 13'—actually 2&amp;half; out of 13 is not a bad pass mark, a great success. All I can say is some mothers do' ave `em. The shadow Treasurer gets up here and asks about foreign debt—when the Labor Party came to office, foreign debt was $23 billion and you took it to $187 billion—and he says, `Oh, but ignore 10&amp;half; years; we were only practising. Only take into account the last 2&amp;half; years.'

         I can also remember one P.J. Keating standing at this dispatch box. In answer to a question from Barry Jones, the member for Lalor, in the caucus meeting, he said that foreign debt was not a problem and he was going to circulate notes to the caucus to prove it. That was a year before the election. Did they ever come? I think the member for Lalor is still looking for them. They might be down at the Hill of Content bookshop, if you have a look down there.

         In relation to Australia's international investment position—for the elucidation of the Labor Party—net external liabilities as at 30 June 1997 were $202 billion and the net equity and other investment was $105 billion. Between the March and the June quarter, net foreign equity in Australia rose 6.3 per cent. I have noticed that there have been complaints in some quarters that Australia is not doing well in relation to foreign investment but let me say again that, between the March and the June quarter, net foreign equity in the Australian economy rose 6.3 per cent while net foreign debt rose 2.2 per cent. But the

         If the coalition had its way, Australia's exposure to net foreign debt would not be of the dimension that it now is, but we inherited an economy which had had 13 years of Keating&amp;hyphen;Beazley Labor mismanagement. If we had inherited foreign debt of $23 billion, as you did, we would not be in the exposed position that we are now. But we had 13 years of Keating-Beazley Labor mismanagement that took foreign debt in this country from $23 billion to $187 billion.

         Here is the Labor Party pretending it was not doing anything for those 13 years and saying, `We weren't here. We weren't responsible.' But the fact is the Labor Party made foreign debt a problem in this country, just as you made the budget deficit a problem and just as you had no idea how to manage the economy. It is going to take years to stabilise that position; it is going to take a very long time, I can tell you. But the good thing is that by next year, as a result of this government's efforts, we will not be running further budget deficits.

         When this government was elected the Commonwealth was spending more than it took in revenue—$10,000 million of Beazley failure. But, instead of having the decency to own up during the election campaign, you went around trying to cover it up. You did not have the decency to come clean to the Australian people. By the end of this first term, we will have turned that deficit around. We will have taken a $10.3 billion Beazley deficit and we will have turned it into a surplus. This is a government that is making the big changes to the Australian economy; this is the government which is taking your failures and righting them.

In 1996-97 we have a preliminary outcome: the coalition government got debt down to $5 billion but there was still a financing requirement. The first time we will free ourselves from financing requirements will be in the forthcoming financial year as a result of asset sales. But, in underlying terms, we will only free ourselves from financing requirements when we get the budget back into balance, which is not in this but in the forthcoming financial year.

She has not even seen the final form of the bill, but she is telling us that there is going to be a six-month delay. That, may I say, is in very stark contrast to what happened in 1993. It would be useful to recall that Democrat support for the committee reference of the Native Title Bill in 1993 saw it dealt with in 15 days. The original native title legislation introduced by the Labor Party was referred to a committee on 25 November and a report was furnished and tabled in the Senate on 9 December 1993.

In so far as Tasmania is concerned, we are putting forward to the Tasmanian government a sensible and rational approach. There are some details yet to be finalised, but they are for us and the Tasmanian government to work through.

         This government immediately put in place a plan to rescue the Commonwealth accounts.

We could not abolish Labor's failure overnight, but we halved the damage that Labor had put in place, and came in by June of 1997 with a deficit of $5 billion.

So over the course of one term we will have taken a budget deficit two per cent of GDP and have put it into surplus.

         On the weekend we saw Senator Kernot from the Democrats come out with a $2 billion expenditure package. She thinks that, if this government can do the hard work of producing a surplus, she has the right to spend it too. You can sit up there in the Senate and do everything possible to try to prevent this government from reversing the deficit and, once the government overcomes your opposition and succeeds, you then get rights to go and spend the money again. Senator Kernot said that she would like to spend $2 billion, that the plan would not add to the underlying deficit for next year because the proposals were mainly one-off. So her logic is that, if you spend it this year, it will not add to the deficit next year. This is what she says.

         The poll shows that, compared with 1996, in 1997 the percentage of workers who wanted to be in unions had declined from 47 per cent to 43 per cent, and it showed that 42 per cent of workers agreed with the statement that unions did not look after their members. That is actually shades of an earlier report which the government released last week, the Australian workplace relations survey, which chartered the declining influence of unions in the workplace. One of the figures that caught my attention was that only 46 per cent of unionists agreed that unions take notice of members' complaints and problems.

         The survey also found that 88 per cent of managers at workplaces with 20 or more employees—a higher percentage in small business—would prefer to deal directly with employees rather than through a trade union. That is a commonsense and practical affirmation of what we have been saying; that is, you ought to have a system to allow people at work to sit down directly and in a cooperative, sensible way manage their relations at work in that direct sense, subject to a set of reasonable safety net criteria.

In a sense, that ultimately deprives their own members with the key to higher wages; that is, a system which allows them at work to come to sensible arrangements which can give us the higher productivity, which can give us the wages.

I have had a number of discussions  with the Tasmanian Premier. The last of those discussions involved the making of a very generous Commonwealth offer and I am yet to hear from him.

I did hear at the end of last week criticism emanating from the member for Melbourne, who represents the Labor Party on transport matters. The criticisms from the honourable member for Melbourne were along the lines that somehow or other we had sold AN too cheaply. I will quote some of the comments made by the honourable member for Melbourne. He said, `It's a serious under&amp;hyphen;repayment for the taxpayer,' `It's only reaped $95 million,' and `It's a serious worry.'

We got a commitment by accepting a lower bid from the new owners of AN that there would be no line closures, unlike the former Labor government which had 16 line closures when they were in office. We got a commitment that there would be more passenger services operated by the former AN, unlike the former Labor government which saw eight passenger services closed during their tenure in office.

But what it will mean, for the benefit of the honourable member, is that within 12 months we can be highly optimistic that rather than it being near impossible to find a hospital now that can send out a single bill for a measure of stay, within 12 months time it should be commonplace.

If that was the case under Labor, I can tell the honourable member that that is no longer the case today under the new law. That is simply not right. One of the sensible changes we made was that we said that under the unfair dismissal provisions there should be procedural fairness, but we should not give it such weight that it overrules commonsense.

         As to whether or not you should give somebody some warning, that depends on the circumstances. If someone has worked for you for 20 years, they have been a very good worker and they make one mistake, then maybe it is in the interests of the employee and of the employer for you to say as an employer, `You did make a mistake; we will give you an opportunity to redress it.' But the three warnings situation is over. There are a whole lot of other practical, sensible changes that we have made. For example, there is now an onus on the employee to show that the dismissal was unfair. That is a significant change to the system. Now the system requires that all these matters be heard in the Industrial Relations Commission instead of the Federal Court because we think that gives a more commercial approach to the issues and, therefore, a more realistic approach to the question of what goes on at work.

         We now have a new system which requires people to pay a $50 filing fee. I will tell you what: that makes a difference to people's attitude when it comes to lodging vexatious applications. There is a new jurisdiction now which will allow the commission to actually award costs against an employee where a vexatious claim has been lodged. Many employers will be amazed to hear that the other day an employer actually won a case in the Industrial Relations Court and an employee was ordered to pay the employer's costs

         Under Labor's scheme there was no definition of `serious misconduct', for example. You could have somebody who were conducting themselves in a way which, as a matter of commonsense, represented serious misconduct but no&amp;hyphen;one could tell you what it meant. We have introduced a new regulation which gives some definition to that particular term.

         Under Labor's scheme you could appoint somebody for a probationary period but there was no way known you could know in advance what was a reasonable probation period. So you could employ somebody on probation for a couple of months and sack them during that period and then find out that the court's view was that a month was the most you should have given them. We now have a clear rule—and that is, up to a period of three months is probation. If you tell somebody when you are employing them that the probation period is three months then you can deal with them in those three months if they do not work. That is a simple measure but, from a practical point of view, a great help to employers and employees.

         We have excluded term contracts from the unfair dismissal law. If you have a contract for a two&amp;hyphen;year period and you are unreasonably terminated during that period your redress is damages for the unexpired portion of the contract. Under Labor's scheme those contracts beyond six months were all subject to the unfair dismissal scheme, which was, again, an unreasonable measure and an impractical one from the point of view of running business.

         One last example of what we have introduced is that where an order is being made against a business we say that the commission should take into account the impact on the viability of that business of any decision that is made.

         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          them wins an unfair dismissal claim but the damages are so great that the business goes out of work and the other people lose their jobs.

We put in place quality training through the new apprenticeships agreements.

         These agreements have been fully discussed with the states and fully agreed to by the states and territories and they represent a very significant element of Commonwealth-state cooperation. The Commonwealth and the states are now engaged in discussing an offer which the Commonwealth has made to the states—a very generous offer. That offer is that the Commonwealth will maintain funding in real terms for five years to the states for
         <break page="7423" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          vocational education and training on condition that the states will continue to grow their TAFE systems through efficiencies which are clearly able to be obtained.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is no reason whatever why the Commonwealth should continue to put money on the table without asking the states to look at the efficiency of their own TAFE system and to grow the number of places in those TAFEs. It is very clear from analysis done by the Australian National Training Authority that there are very significant numbers of places to be gained in growth from the state TAFE systems.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The states would like the Commonwealth to put this money straight down on the table without conditions. The Commonwealth is saying, `We owe it to the taxpayer, we owe it to families, to make sure that taxpayers' funds are properly spent.' We are not going to spend those funds unless the states come to the party and agree to match that level of Commonwealth commitment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Of course the states would like the Commonwealth to provide this money guaranteed for five years without any sort of matching commitment at all. But the Commonwealth is determined to put first the interests of young Australians in making sure that they have excellent and adequate vocational education and training opportunities. That is why at the present time the Commonwealth is spending some $144 million on vocational education and training over and above the sum that was spent by the Labor Party in its last year of government.

It is a very important issue, and I know that in his electorate his constituents are very interested in this because it embraces one of the largest small crop growing areas in Australia as well as quite a slab of Queensland's beef industry. So it is an important issue and an important industry for him, as it is for a lot of other Australians as well. For example, the agricultural industries of this country are directly responsible for the jobs of around 400,000 Australians in rural and regional areas, and they are also critical in underpinning the jobs of a further 200,000 Australians in the biggest part of our manufacturing sector, the food and beverage industries.

         The damage that can be done by the incursions of unwanted pests and diseases is really quite mind&amp;hyphen;boggling. The papaya fruit fly alone has cost something in the order of $63 million in terms of outlays by the Commonwealth and state governments, let alone the industry damage that has been sustained and the jobs that have been lost. If foot and mouth disease were to get here it is estimated that we could do another $3 billion to $4 billion worth of damage annually, and karnal bunt would add $4&amp;half; billion to $5 billion a year.

         It can be said quite fairly that quarantine services represent a critical insurance policy for these great agricultural industries. In pursuit of, if you like, a very serious and significant underwriting of that insurance policy, this government has now provided a $76 million package for the upgrading of quarantine services. In fact, if you add the northern area quarantine strategy to it, it is about $90 million. This gives us a professional, scientifically&amp;hyphen;based and properly resourced quarantine service, one of the fundamental planks on which Australia's reputation as a producer of safe, quality product for international markets is based.

         We all have a role; it is a shared responsibility.

         There will be a major upgrade in our plant health and quarantine services and in consultation mechanisms for risk assessment. Quarantine awareness and the operation of quarantine programs will be substantially upgraded, and an independent advisory council, which I have asked Professor Malcolm Nairn to chair, will be appointed to advise me on quarantine policy and to monitor the implementation of the government's response to the Nairn report. At the same time we are acting on the key issues in relation to fish health and fish policy identified in the report of the national task force on imported fish and fish products.

         I was very pleased to note that the shadow minister, the honourable member for Burke, issued a press release welcoming the announcement and observing that quarantine measures are vital to protect Australia. I was pleased because I was somewhat surprised earlier on at the time of the budget, when we announced that $76 million for quarantine, that he issued a statement saying, `Fire blight shows up stupidity of quarantine cuts.' We put $76 million in on top of the $14&amp;half; million that had already gone to Nairn, yet he called for cuts in quarantine, which I thought was pretty amazing. He went on to have another bit of a niggle about a couple of matters, which I thought was also pretty out of order given that it was really someone on their side—the then minister for agriculture, the honourable member for Hotham, the clean green Crean himself—who never stopped talking about Australia's clean green exports at the very time that he was emasculating Australia's quarantine services.

         The injection of $76 million into quarantine over the next four years demonstrates this government's commitment to this critical activity which gives Australia an animal, plant and fish health status which is the envy of the world.

         Lifelong learning is a principle that has an enormous power to help us move forward in our education and training policies because it recognises that all Australians, of whatever age, have something to contribute to this country. It recognises that many older Australians, with a lifetime of experience behind them, have the capacity to build on that experience, to learn new skills, to build on their abilities and to contribute to their community. The message of adult learners week is clear: no matter how old or young you are, no matter what you want to learn, you can do it by doing an adult and community education course.

         There are two themes for adult learners week this year—promoting learning amongst small business people and amongst Australia's migrant population. Over half the courses taken as a part of adult and community education last year, some 70 per cent, were designed to assist those who took them with their employment prospects.

           —Mr Speaker, I might just say on that matter, though, partly to be of some assistance to the honourable member, that I do think it is important that the Chamber Research Office make a note and running tally of not only the questions which are answered but also the questions which are put. Those questions, as they are put, are an opportunity for a member to ask a question. Whether or not they are later ruled out of order is in the hands of the person who asked the question. Whilst it is true that
           <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
            House of Representatives Practice

           refers to supplementary questions as being part of the one question, that is a statement of the requirement to the standing orders that they must elucidate the first question.

          I can say this from the government's point of view: supplementary questions, whether answered or not, whether in order or not, are certainly part and parcel of the informal arrangement whereby the opposition gets a certain number of questions, which I might say is incredibly more generous than anything that has ever existed.

        Royal Australian Navy: Repatriation Benefits

        To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament:
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        This petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are still the only Australians, sent overseas on active service, whose service has not been recognised in three important areas:
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        1. R.A.N. casualties are not yet included on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial alongside Army and R.A.A.F. casualties;
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        2. R.A.N. service has not yet been recognised with the visible signs of service to Australia; the Returned from Active Service Badge and the Naval campaign medal;
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        3. R.A.N. service is still not acknowledged as eligible service for the Australian Service Pension, while service by Commonwealth and allied veterans from 55 other countries is.
        <break page="7428" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Members of the Army and R.A.A.F. who served during the same period in Malaya had their service fully recognised 24 hours after arriving in Malaya.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        In the 1997 Budget the Government partly recognised that R.A.N. service was `operational' and accepted responsibility for disabilities resulting from that service. Those affected appreciate the belated, partial recognition. However, government departments are still resorting to old, and inventing new excuses, to deny the above 3 points.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Your petitioners therefore request that the House acts to help remove the injustice of 40 years and fully recognise R.A.N. service by providing the same recognition and benefits for that service. The cost will be minuscule, being mainly a transfer of pensions from `age' as paid by the Department of Social Security, to `service' pensions, paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs.

That being under `Operational Service' at Section 6.(1)(c)(ii) of the Act for members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960.

        Royal Australian Navy: Repatriation Benefits

        To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        There are two forms of benefits for ex&amp;hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&amp;hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&amp;hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.

        It is claimed that:
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&amp;hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&amp;hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (f) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for `active service'. The fourth,  for `military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Your petitioners therefore request the Senate to remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act thereby restoring justice and recognition of honourable `active service' with the Royal Australian Navy in direct support of British and Malayan forces during the Malayan Emergency between 1955 and 1960.

         I have moved this motion because the government's decision to cut operational funding to out of hours school care services will drive up fees and force children into substandard services or, worse still, make them latchkey kids.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The history of the out of hours school care service is that it was a federal government
         <break page="7435" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          initiative in the early 1970s. It caters for children five to 12 years of age and provides supervised and planned recreational and homework activities. The success of the program is demonstrated by the numbers. In 1982 there were 7,900 children in out of hours school care; in June 1996 there were 71,846 children, a massive increase in that period.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The funding structure that currently exists is that the services are funded on a per capita enrolment basis in the form of an operational subsidy. That operational subsidy represents a constant stream of income, no matter what variations occur in the student population. Most out of hours school care services are school based and non&amp;hyphen;profit. The community has come together in the interests of the children.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government's proposed changes to the system will completely cut operational subsidies, which will mean a cut of between $24,000 and $41,000 to individual out of hours care services. As a sweetener to that reduction, however, the government has offered a sum of $12 million which is being spent on consultants. So each and every out of hours school service is being given $3,000 to engage a consultant, and that consultancy report is a precondition to an application for a capital grant of $7,000 and a possible grant of $3,000 for equipment. So there is a compulsory expenditure of $3,000 for these consultants for a potential $10,000 grant. It is an administrative absurdity and a gross waste.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In addition to that, the list of consultants was provided only last week, and those consultants have to now be briefed by the out of hours services and they have to provide their consultant's report by October. These are going to be very cursory reports or they are going to be variables filled in on a word processor, all for the princely sum of $3,000 a pop—a ridiculous situation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But the government is working to a timetable where the operational subsidies are going to be cut on 1 January. It is a completely unworkable timetable, and the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) should immediately review it. It is absolutely stupid,
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          and I understand that she is receiving that feedback from the sector.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As it stands, the additional funding that parents of children in out of hours school centres are going to receive—or, at least, a limited number of them are going to receive by way of child&amp;hyphen;care assistance payments—just will not compensate for the loss of the operational subsidy.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The consequences are that many parents, particularly those with several children requiring out of hours care, will be forced to move their kids from the current services. They will have two choices: to put their children into untrained, backyard services or to drop their kids off early in the morning and let them go to an empty home in the afternoon—so that they will literally become latchkey children.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Last week the minister said that as a nation we can do no more important task than `ensure the safety and the protection of our children'. If the minister allows these operational subsidies to be cut, she is a blatant hypocrite.

          —Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to speak on the private member's motion of the member for Barton (Mr McClelland) on outside school hours child care. Child care has played a very important role to play in our community. For many families, it has become an essential daily service. I acknowledge the important and necessary role that outside school hours care centres play in our community, particularly in the Petrie electorate.

         This government inherited a child&amp;hyphen;care sector that was on its knees.

         The federal government has also ensured that it will support the service in a two&amp;hyphen;year establishment phase. With this two&amp;hyphen;year phase, assistance will be provided for business and marketing advice with $12.2 million—as the member for Barton mentioned—over a four&amp;hyphen;year period to specifically target the outside school hours care program. A capital grading initiative is also being offered, with grants available to maintain a service which caters for the needs of families. If these measures ensure a more effective sector for child care, then the result will be a very positive one.

         The government says that it wants to introduce a level playing field, it wants community based operators to be working under the same rules as those seeking profit, but what the government does not understand is that there is no profit in child care in rural and regional Australia.

In some cases, only two or three kids have to withdraw to render that service unviable.

It is about choice for families, choice for parents who wish to work and choice for women who wish to have a career. In short, the system gives Australian families more choice.

         In my electorate of Gilmore, as in many electorates throughout Australia, there is a group of child&amp;hyphen;care providers who provide the vital service of quality child care out of school hours. These services are vital in that, if they were not provided, many parents—and in most cases women—would not have the freedom to work; a choice which many women and many parents in the Gilmore electorate make when they access out of school hours child care for their children.

         One of the most important issues facing parents, certainly those in my Gilmore electorate, is the location of these services. Out of school hours care is not provided by all 36 child&amp;hyphen;care places in the Gilmore electorate, it is not even provided in every village, so parents are forced to decide how far they must travel for out of school hours care. In some cases this can mean a 30&amp;hyphen; or 40&amp;hyphen;kilometre drive every morning and every evening. Those parents must then decide whether this warrants the choice that they make to work.

Despite policies of the previous government preventing the companies they work for from consolidating as well as they might have and from winning additional export trades, they have achieved a lot in design.

They say, `Do not tamper with that. We can cop that. We will accept it to the year 2000. We ask you to be smart. We ask you to not do what the previous government did'—that is, to introduce 70 per cent tariff reductions over a period of a decade without reforming the country's economy and without reforming the tax system or the waterfront system and, in fact, paying huge taxpayers' moneys out. The former government borrowed more money than they could pay back, driving interest up and, in fact, increasing unemployment.

The reason is that the industries would have had a decade to adjust and to benefit from tax reform and waterfront reform. Their export trade would have grown, and their exports would be cheaper because they would not have embedded in them the stupid inefficient tax systems that this country has because of the Labor Party's negligence and failure to address the

         The electorate that I represent is part of the north-eastern region of Melbourne. There can be no other region in Australia where the combined decisions about the futures of the automotive and the textile, clothing and footwear industries are of such devastating importance. Of the 100,000 Australian TCF workers, around 9,700—nearly 10,000 of them—are employed in the north-eastern region of Melbourne. The north-eastern region of Melbourne includes the municipalities of Whittlesea, Darebin, Banyule and Nillumbik. If we take into account the neighbouring municipalities of Hume and Moreland, there is quite a distinct concentration of TCF workers in a region. In fact, 48 per cent of TCF employment is located in Victoria. So TCF is twice as important to the Victorian economy as it is to the national economy.

It would have serious consequences in the machinery and equipment manufacturing sector of the regional economy, on personal and household goods wholesaling and retailing, and on road transport and business services.

         The Industry Commission has been pushing the furphy that the measures to assure viable TCF industries cost consumers $1.9 billion. Sadly, the Australian Consumers Association appears to have fallen for this. The industries themselves dispute this and claim that present government assistance means only an extra 20c on a pair of underpants or $2.44 on a pair of shoes. I am sure that the vast majority of Australian consumers are willing to pay this very small price to keep TCF industries in Australia.

They are represented in all states and have an annual industry turnover of $10 billion and a retail turnover of $15 billion. They make up $4 billion of Australia's value&amp;hyphen;added manufacturing. Their exports are now at $1 billion, with a target of $2 billion in the year 2000 and $3.5 billion by the year 2005.

Although the motion acknowledges that the pause in the reduction of tariffs between the years 2000 and 2005 is vital to the industries, this motion does not take into consideration the importance of the import credit scheme. As important as the tariff freeze is, the retention of the import credit scheme—or an equivalent scheme—is necessary for the continuation of TCF industries in Australia.

          I want to make a couple of points initially. The first is that the recommendations of the Industry Commission for the TCF industries are a continuation of the policies of the previous Labor government over the past 13 years. It is hypocritical for the opposition to criticise the Howard government for a policy of tariff reduction that they strenuously advocated and implemented over a period of 13 years and it is hypocritical of the opposition to criticise this government for the vulnerability of many TCF industries when it was the lack of action of the previous government to implement changes to industrial relations, taxation, transport and the waterfront that have caused this very vulnerability and have failed to provide our TCF industries with the means of reducing their production costs and with the means to be internationally competitive.

         <para first-indent="16">
          It was this inaction that failed to implement the pace of micro-economic reform that the rate of tariff reduction was predicated on. It was this inaction of the previous government that caused the TCF industries to produce and compete in a market with a handicap their competitors did not and still do not have. The task of micro-economic reform that should have been completed by the previous government is now one that we must achieve, and we have begun that process of hastening the pace of reform.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The decision facing us now, however, is similar to that which we faced with the car industry. We must maintain the critical mass of our TCF industries if we are to ensure that as industries they remain internationally competitive, because without viable local industries, there can be no export industry. In order to achieve that, we must reject the recommendations of the Industry Commission report with regard to the tariff reduction rate. We must pause and hasten the pace of micro-economic reform. To do otherwise would see not just a loss of employment in our TCF industries, especially those in regional areas, like those in my electorate of McEwen—the Can't Tear Em factory, Maloufs, the Seymour Dyeworks and Haymag, to name just a few—but also the destruction of those regional

          There is no doubt that the reduction of tariffs since 1985 has seen employment decline by 18 per cent: that is, 21,000 people who used to work in the TCF industries no longer do so. Thanks to research conducted at Melbourne University, where 585 people have been surveyed over a two&amp;hyphen;year period since their retrenchment, we know that almost half of these workers have not found any employment. The Australian Wool Processors Council has produced similar findings from a case study of one factory closure in rural Victoria where, again, almost half of retrenched employees remain without any work.

          This evidence refutes claims made by the Industry Commission in its report on page 157 that, `People can find new jobs in the same region, perhaps in another industry,' or `people can relocate to find work in a new region'. If only that were true—that our regional areas had been able to attract investment to start new industries. What nonsense! What planet do the Industry Commission members inhabit? By making those sorts of statements, they demonstrate that they have no real understanding of the true position of regional industry and the lack of employment opportunities. It is stated on page 146 of the report that the decline in employment in the TCF industries has been countered by growth in employment in other industries.

          —I have argued in this House and publicly that tariffs have never protected jobs. That fundamental truth is clear if you look at the data and information over the last 20 years. The benefits of tariff protection, as members of the former Labor government would understand, have flowed to consumers and exporters. The protected industries have improved under a reducing tariff regime.

         All the evidence suggests that tariffs have never protected jobs. Jobs have declined in the car and TCF industries in recent times. However, if you look at the available information you will find that when tariffs reached their peak in the 1970s jobs still declined. I challenge anyone in this House to argue the case that tariffs have protected jobs in the long term. Members of this House would fully understand that productivity and profitability were poor in the TCF and car industries when tariffs were at their highest peak. The attitude of both management and those employed in TCF industries was that they were owed a job.

          Investment was at a standstill under the high tariff regime and capital stock from the 1900s was not replaced. When tariffs were reduced in both the TCF and car industries productivity, quality and profitability improved—a fact borne out in the Industry Commission report. It is important for members of this House to understand that these industries need to remain profitable—in those terms jobs will be retained.

          People are suggesting that the Industry Commission have not provided factual information. An in&amp;hyphen;depth reading of the Industry Commission report indicates that they have talked to employees and management in that industry and that they have given accurate advice. The important point that is driven home to me is that members of this House and other commentators wish to shoot the messenger because they might be observing factual information about the TCF industries.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I draw the attention of the House yet again to the fact that the Labor Party, when in government, introduced the reduction in tariffs. They reduced tariffs in 1984 to apply to the year 2000. The current debate is about a comparatively small reduction in tariffs from the year 2000 to the year 2008. Everyone in the TCF and car industries knows that tariffs should come down. I have not yet met anyone in those industries who has suggested that tariffs should go up. Let us establish that clear fact.

          The APEC objective is that by 2010 there should be negligible tariff levels of between five and 10 per cent. The former government agreed with that, the present government agrees with that and most commentators in Australia agree with that. The World Trade Organisation is moving towards that objective as all nations will be better off under those arrangements. The current debate in the House is about the rate of reduction of the tariff regime. No other industry receives protection—apart from the car and TCF industries. We need to remember that protection is paid by every other Australian in the form of tax. General manufacturing gets only about five per cent protection.

Those are very important features to understand. The important factor to remember is that we must move to become a global trading nation. Globalisation is here for the TCF industries. I appreciate that the apparel industry is facing competition from low wage countries. The footwear industry can find niche markets if they have quality products and good delivery times. The textiles part of the TCF industries will depend upon investment in new capital.

          The key element of this debate is the timing of tariff reductions not the tariff reductions themselves. Members opposite who are suggesting that the removal or a pause in tariffs will save jobs have been misled. History proves quite conclusively that the tariff reductions and high tariffs under the Labor government did not save jobs. Tariff reductions encourage the industry to remain profitable and, in that way, jobs will be kept in the electorate of the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon).

         Let us look at orange juice. We are told that we cannot do anything about it because of GATT. The Americans do, of course. The Americans levy a flat rate of duty on their orange juice at 80c a litre of concentrate. That puts in protection for their growers when prices are at their lowest. When prices are at their highest it is not very significant. In Australia we put on an ad valorem tax which gives growers some protection when prices are high and they do not need it but no protection when they are low and they desperately need it.

         This issue is of enormous importance not just to the residents of the Central Coast but to the 17,000 Australians who work in and rely on this industry throughout Australia. The reason I have brought these letters into the House this evening is that since May I have been trying to get the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to accept these letters from my constituents. For more than three months we have been writing to the minister asking him for only five minutes of his time so that the people who have taken the trouble to sign these letters objecting to the importation of cooked chicken meat can ensure that the minister hears their voices.

When you realise that people have taken the trouble to sign the letters, send them back and allow themselves to be identified, it is quite clear that there is a very strong view on the Central Coast of New South Wales opposing the importation of cooked chicken meat. These letters have come from as far south as Wyoming and as far north as Kanwal, from Bateau Bay to Wyong.

Japan allowed the importation of cooked chicken meat from Thailand, resulting in 20 per cent of the Japanese market being supplied by Thailand. If the same penetration happened in Australia, there would be a $670 million reduction in Australia's gross national product and the loss of 9,000 jobs. As a result of the government allowing chicken meat imports we would not only see damage done to the Australian economy but also see a severe risk of new diseases brought into Australia.

         Of greatest concern in my electorate amongst the 1,000 central coast residents who work in the chicken growing and chicken processing industry is the threat posed by Newcastle disease. Madam Deputy Speaker, I am sure you are aware that, if introduced, Newcastle disease will be extremely difficult to eradicate. We might well ask: who will pay for the loss of jobs if the government does allow these imports from Thailand, Denmark and the United States and Newcastle disease is introduced to our country? Who will pay for the loss of endangered species, given that there is clear evidence that Australia's native bird life is extremely susceptible to Newcastle disease? I understand that studies have shown that there is a 100 per cent fatality rate for eastern rosellas within six days of exposure to Newcastle disease and that 170 Australian native birds have no antibodies at all for this disease. There is a severe risk of a massive environmental impact on Australia if the government allows the importation of cooked chicken meat and Newcastle disease is introduced.

         We need to understand that, despite the government's claims that there will be checks made in Denmark, Thailand or the United States to ensure the meat is properly cooked before it is exported to Australia, the reason why people have been sending these letters to their members of parliament is that they know it is very difficult to ensure 100 per cent compliance.

         One of the concerns we have is that Australian chicken producers and processors are forced to go to elaborate lengths to make sure that Australians have access to food that has been produced under the proper standards. The CSIRO has carried out tests for one of the manufacturers in my own electorate which ensures that, wherever the birds are located on the cooking belts, there is sufficient heat and that heat is maintained for sufficient time to ensure that the core temperatures of those chickens kill any disease or bacteria.

          —Following on from my speech earlier today, the Elegant Knitting factory in my electorate is run by the Holmick family—three generations of Holmicks—who have manufactured various knitwear in Australia, especially in my electorate, since 1981. Prior to that they moved with the government's decentralisation policy to Tamworth and before that they were in Bankstown.

         The worrying thing for them is the reduction of tariffs in isolation. It is something that this government would not consider. If we were to reduce tariffs, it would be in accordance with a preset plan as well as a reduction in tax, which is something this government has given a major commitment to. We have already reduced capital gains tax for business. We have looked at reducing the provisional tax uplift factor. We have looked at reducing the on&amp;hyphen;costs for business in terms of compliance with ATO requirements. We have developed a one&amp;hyphen;stop shop with various government reporting agencies. We have gone a long way in the interest of small business which has largely been ignored for the last 13 years. We still have a long way to go and we are still working that way. That is why the small businesses in my electorate still support me.

         There is virtually no manufacturing left in Australia after Labor's economic rationalism of the last 13 years. It is something that has really got the goat of people in my electorate. It is certainly not a road this government will go down without a whole policy looking at the entire business environment in which people are operating, where their costs are coming from and where their competition is. We are not unmindful of the tyranny of distance. We are not close to Europe. We are not close to America. We therefore have enormous costs in transporting our goods to market. For those of you who saw a recent

         A number of these low skilled jobs have gone already. What is to replace them in this area? Another point in my contribution to the grievance debate today comes from petrol station operators. They wish to know where we are going with the policy on the removal of sites act and the retail petrol pricing act. It is something that is of great concern to them. It is an area where there are prospects of employment, and that is the number one issue in my electorate. A lot of service station operators are working long hours seven days a week. If they could make the margins, they would be more than willing to employ other employees, even if it were for only two or three days a week, to give themselves and their families a break. Between two stations that would be one extra job in Lindsay.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A lot of petrol stations are making 1c a litre mark&amp;hyphen;up on fuel. That is $140 a week for some of them. On that, they have to pay wages, rent, lighting, electricity and a number of other things. The only way they can make a living from their petrol stations is from the shop and from the workshops that are attached to the fuel pumps. Even now a lot of larger oil companies are looking to move in on that. They are putting black boxes on the cash registers and demanding a certain percentage of the gross turnover.
        </para>

         Something similar has been looked at with retail tenancies in large plazas. I have had a number of complaints in that direction, especially from the Penrith Plaza in Penrith. It was something that was looked at very closely in the report,

         <break page="7451" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          able to come from. Traditionally, in Australia's history, if you were unemployed you could virtually go out, work hard, create your own job, have your own interest, and bingo, you went from being someone who was on a pension, costing the government, to someone who was employed and paying tax. The long-term benefits for this nation are immeasurable. We need to get people back to work in the work force. This is an initiative and a community standard and a work ethic that Australia just cannot afford to lose given our geographic position in the world.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         At this stage our primary emphasis should be to protect jobs. We need to look at that, given current unemployment levels which are a hangover from the 1991-92 recession from which Penrith never really recovered. It sent the shops in our area into a tail&amp;hyphen;spin. We are doing an enormous amount to lift their performance. We are trying very hard to regenerate jobs. In fact, we have had some excellent employment results in Lindsay.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I commend a number of the recommendations in the fair trading report which should see a lot of benefits for franchisees, such as security of tenure. That is incredibly important. People are put in an non&amp;hyphen;viable situation when large organisations have the ability to determine whether or not leases will be extended, as is the case with a number of petrol operators in my area. They are frightened to be associated with me on this issue. It is something about which they cannot individually turn to the media for assistance because they have no security regarding the termination of their leases.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Disclosure statements are to be provided to purchasers on the assignment of leases. If large fuel companies are aware of competition that is going in—quite often, across the road—near the site that they are leasing to a franchisee, this should be made quite clear. I have examples where this has not occurred.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The other issue I would like to raise today is the access to finance, the securing of finance for business. There is a practice of securing small businesses against their real assets, especially in areas like IT. It really is not commercially viable to do that, and they certainly need a lot of assistance when banks
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          and lending agencies look at the ability or the commercial viability of the small business rather than the assets. Again, that is something our government has addressed in the business innovation fund, which is looking at promoting that area.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We can relieve a lot of the grievances in my area by lowering the cost of government and giving the people tax breaks. We have got the books of Australia back into the black. Certainly over the next two years we will be in a much healthier position in order to allow these industries to help themselves but, in the meantime, their jobs need to be protected. They need to find some status quo while recognising that this government, as compared to the previous one, certainly has a vision, a depth and a compassion for the battlers of Lindsay that they have not experienced in the last six years, and possibly not in the last 13 years.

          —The decision confronting the government on Australia's textiles, clothing and footwear industries is one with profound implications for the Geelong regional economy. I cannot put the situation more bluntly than this: if the federal government accepts the recommendations contained in the draft Productivity Commission report on TCF industries, it will have a devastating effect on many Geelong TCF businesses and cause further job losses on a massive scale in a regional economy already badly affected by the policies of the Howard government.

         At stake in Geelong are the jobs of over 3,300 workers and the economic wellbeing of their families. They are industries that pump around $100 million in wages and salaries into the Geelong economy and have an annual turnover of some $400 million. In addition to the 3,300 people directly employed in TCF industries in Geelong, it is estimated that another 4,200 jobs are at risk if massive job losses were to occur in this sector.

They are the concerns of the local government representatives of the City of Greater Geelong, who is sponsoring a Geelong delegation who will be lobbying the government over the next couple of days on behalf of the Geelong community on this issue.

         The Labor Party has set out a clear blueprint for these industries beyond the year 2000. We did the same for cars, and many of those recommendations were sensibly adopted by the government. We are calling on the government to do the same in this instance in the plan that we have put before it with regard to the textiles, clothing and footwear industries.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Labor's position on TCF industries beyond the year 2000 has been articulated by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and our shadow industry minister, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). In government, we would freeze tariffs from the year 2000 to the year 2005, we would retain the import credit scheme and we would conduct a further review of the industry in the year 2004 to judge the performance of our trading partners in granting Australian firms access to their markets. The plan that we have suggested for these industries would see an increase in jobs and investment. So the choice before the government is a very clear one. It is either that very structured and clear plan or what is

         The Productivity Commission has proposed to reduce all tariffs to five per cent by the year 2008 regardless of what our competitors do.

By its own admission, the Productivity Commission says there will be 5,000 job losses in this industry. I expect there will be more.

         I visited many TCF companies in my electorate and they have echoed many concerns to me. I visited Godfrey Hirst, a firm with annual sales of $200 million, which employs 1,200 employees in Geelong. It is the largest carpet exporter in Australia, exporting some $21 million worth of product to 18 countries throughout the world. It is the largest wool spinning company in the world, and it uses 9,000 tonnes of spun woollen yarn per annum.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This particular company knows their market, and they say a couple of very important things about their industry. They believe there is a trigger tariff figure of between 15 per cent and 18 per cent where manufacturers will reduce production investment and some will invest in infrastructure to provide imported product to the marketplace, not Australian-made product. It is a very important point that ought to be understood.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Godfrey Hirst also made another very important point. They said that their particular export plan was developed on two dynamics—the import credit scheme, which the Productivity Commission has recommended ought to be terminated, and a strong domestic base. It is that domestic base that they consider is under threat from the recommendations of the Productivity Commission.

         I have also visited Candy Footwear, which employs around 200 people in Geelong. That company has asked for a freeze on tariffs from the year 2000 to 2005 and a retention of the import credit scheme. Both of those elements are inherent in the plan that Labor has put before the Australian community on these industries. Candy Footwear made the very important point to me that further investments will depend on that tariff freeze, and
         <break page="7453" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          that is a point that must be understood by the government—a clear signal needs to be sent to these industries in pausing tariffs between the year 2000 and 2005.

Classweave Industries have restructured their operations in response to the 1986 plan and they believe they can compete head-on with imports if the right signals are sent to them about this tariff question and if the right economic climate is engineered by the government for them to operate in. The opportunity is here for the government to send a very clear signal to these companies in Geelong and elsewhere throughout Australia that they are wanted in Australia and that employment in those industries at this point in time will be sustained while they re-invest and seek out the niche markets that are very important to their long-term survival.

         A very effective promotions campaign has been waged by those companies from Geelong, and many members on the floor of this parliament have received a particular gift which really says it all about the opportunities that are in Geelong for the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. The particular firm that produced this garment is one which has sought out a niche market; it has invested and done what the previous Labor government asked it to do. It has grown from a couple of employees to 20 and is exporting throughout the world and exporting some of the finest garments that you would ever hope to see manufactured in the world.

          —Tonight I want talk about the CARE Credit and Debt Counselling Service which was started in the Australian Capital Territory in 1983. CARE's services include, among other things, legal advice on consumer credit and debt matters for low&amp;hyphen;income people. It has one full&amp;hyphen;time solicitor and financial counsellors—paralegal workers who are tertiary qualified counsellors.

         CARE Credit and Debt Counselling Service offers a holistic approach to its clients. The problems can include: inability to service debt due to illness or some misfortune; problems with credit firms; and a wide range of financially based concerns. Over the years, I have
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          referred many people to CARE—in fact, I did so only last Friday. The role of CARE is extremely important to the lower income sector of our community.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Last year, CARE saw some 2,047 clients. When we translate that to over 60 per cent of its clients being families, you can see the number of people who come under the care of CARE. Sometimes, the initial interview could take up to two hours. A lot of personal information and family detail is required to fully understand the extent of the problems facing the family concerned. In past times, but unfortunately not now, a local child&amp;hyphen;care centre was able to offer support by caring for the small children of those families during those initial interviews, in most cases free of charge. It was really like the community helping the community. But unfortunately things are different now. All this started to change with the Liberal government's budget of last year.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let me give you some background. The Commonwealth government provides a small funding program of, in this current year, $1.99 million for financial counsellors nationally. The program is administered by the small business and consumer affairs division of the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism. The ACT's share of this funding is paid to CARE.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The history of CARE's funding from the program is as follows: in 1991, $51,307 employed one full&amp;hyphen;time financial counsellor; in 1993&amp;hyphen;94 it was $52,892; in 1994&amp;hyphen;95 $54,837 employed one full&amp;hyphen;time worker—a 3.67 per cent increase, thus keeping pace with inflation; and in 1995&amp;hyphen;96 it was $55,676. On recommendations from the department and in direct response to unmet demand the program received a small increase and CARE received an additional $7,090 in March 1996. CARE took the funding on the understanding that if it increased hours the funding would not be short&amp;hyphen;term top&amp;hyphen;up funding. CARE increased hours to one full&amp;hyphen;time and one part&amp;hyphen;time worker. At the time, CARE had a waiting list time of some 13 weeks for a first appointment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In 1996&amp;hyphen;97, this government reneged on the commitment to maintain the modest increase
         <break page="7456" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          and CARE funds were reduced to $51,030—hardly sufficient to employ one full&amp;hyphen;time worker. This year, no provision was made for CPI increases. In the same period, the federal government also totally defunded the peak body, the Australian Financial Counselling and Credit Reform Association, that had provided so much support and guidance to agencies like CARE.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Conversely, Labor made significant increases to the program. In 1995, Labor provided the program with $6.4 million over four years in the Justice Statement. This was reneged on by this government. The cut in the current government's 1996 budget to the Commonwealth financial counselling program was approximately 11 per cent, however that cut amounted to around 25 per cent when taking into account the Justice Statement funding allocated under Labor.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This allocation was cut when the coalition gained government. The situation in my electorate of Namadgi and in the ACT generally is of huge concern. By sacrificing longer term case work, CARE absorbed a 38.6 per cent increase in the number of people seen. The choices they must make are heart&amp;hyphen;rending. The level of unmet demand continues and is growing. There can be no doubt that financial counselling returns a net benefit to government. CARE is already an efficient and effective service, with no excess or discretionary budget items that can be cut. The overall meanness of the reduction to this already inadequately funded program seems almost punitive rather than having any rational basis or analysis of the social cost.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government has targeted Canberra for massive cuts to its employment base. We are already seeing an increase in new clients presenting as a result of unemployment and underemployment. A 59.89 per cent increase in personal bankruptcies in the ACT for 1996&amp;hyphen;97 is a further indicator of financial failure for increasing numbers of Canberrans.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is incomprehensible that, at a time when its policies are hurting so many people, the government would reduce the safety net of programs like financial counselling. CARE's clients are increasingly drawn from those whom we would have considered as middle&amp;hyphen;
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          income earners three to four years ago. A very noticeable change in attitude has been reported by counsellors. Formerly, clients had hope. They would say, `When I get a job I will be able to manage and life will return to normal.' Now there is an overwhelming belief that their situation will not improve and that their future in Canberra looks grim.

         These people are increasingly cynical about the promised benefits that the current economic policy is supposed to deliver.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Overarching the growing sense of frustration and very real anxiety is a belief that, at the highest levels of government, this community is held in contempt and treated accordingly. It is no good the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) coming into this community, as he did last week, and parading himself and his government with some caring, compassionate `we really didn't mean to hurt you all, we really like Canberra' charade.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         While this government continues to make these disastrous decisions, all the hyperbole in the world will be just that—a distortion of the facts. The service of the CARE Credit and Debt Counselling Service must continue to be delivered. The government must reconsider the funding for the financial counselling program both here in the ACT and nationally.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I can only reiterate the instance of a lady coming into my office last week who was in dire financial circumstances, mostly not of her own making, and who desperately required the services of the CARE Credit and Debt Counselling Service, a service proven worthy since 1983. CARE cannot continue to hope to deliver the services to the community as required whilst facing the sorts of funding cuts that they are currently attempting to endure. The lady whom I referred to them did get phone counselling today and I am sure that she will eventually receive the benefit of the advice from the CARE Credit and Debt Counselling Service. But she and many others in Canberra who are awaiting that service are
         <break page="7457" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          going to have to wait an inordinate amount of time.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It seems to me quite unacceptable and pretty deplorable that, at the very time the government is putting pressure on the community which means more people require this sort of service than one would wish to see, we see a counterattack, and that is an attack on the services that can help to alleviate the difficulties faced in this financial climate. I cannot impress enough upon this House the distress that is being felt within my local community in a financial and social sense. The CARE Credit and Debt Counselling Service simply must be given the ability to carry out the service it is professionally qualified to do. I implore the government to reconsider its whole position in regard to the funding of CARE Credit and Debt Counselling Service and of similar services around the country.

           Report to governments on actions necessary for dugong conservation in the Great Barrier Reef and Harvey Bay Great Sandy Strait
          </emphasis>
          has resulted in bans on gillnet fishing and restricted gillnet fishing in areas of the Great Barrier Reef southern region. I have a number of concerns with the decision not least of which is the credibility of the aforesaid report. The report depends on unpublished papers for its baseline data, anecdotal evidence and unsubstantiated assumptions. It focuses entirely on gillnet fishing as the sole cause of the decline in dugong and focuses, too, on the banning of gillnet fishing as the sole solution to the decline in dugong.

         I would like to give the House some idea of the number of dugong that we are speaking about. The dugong is a unique marine mammal and, naturally, we want to see the numbers not only maintained but also increased. According to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, there have been 35 dugong mortalities in the southern Great Barrier Reef area of which 16 were directly due to gillnet fishing. While the report that I have men
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          tioned was very disparaging of the Queensland commercial fishing recommendations, it does state that those recommendations will reduce deaths by 50 per cent. So, if the recommendations of the report were to be implemented, we would be looking at eight deaths due to gillnet fishing.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         According to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the potential biological removal—that is, the number of creatures that can be accidentally killed and still maintain the species—is 3.3 dugong; so the number of dugong that we are speaking about is five. Certainly any loss of this unique marine mammal is very unsatisfactory, but we are talking about five dugong deaths in the Great Barrier Reef southern area—from Cooktown down to Hervey Bay—whereas, in my electorate alone, we are also speaking about the livelihood of 114 commercial fishermen.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Some six months ago the fishermen in the Mackay area brought in a voluntary code which incorporated features such as a partial closure to rocky foreshore nets and a total ban on off-shore nets in the dugong protection areas. A number of other recommendations were put in the local QCFO report. These have been implemented as a self-regulatory measure and, according to the fishermen in the area, we now see nil mortalities which is a very satisfactory outcome. Unfortunately, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has chosen to ignore this self-regulation and has imposed its own bans.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would now like to share with you the economic impact of the gillnet ban in my area. There are 114 gillnet fishermen in my electorate of Dawson: 45 in Mackay, 22 in Bowen, 15 in Proserpine and Midge Point and 32 in Ayr and Home Hill. The flow-on effects, particularly in the Burdekin, are going to be severe. I have here a petition that has been signed by over 2,000 residents of the Burdekin, which gives you some idea of the concern in our area about the impact of a ban based on what I would have to say is an unsatisfactory scientific report.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I would like to share with you an independent scientific assessment of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority's report. These are not my views—although I am
         <break page="7458" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          certainly very critical of the report—these are the views of an independent scientist with a doctorate in zoology. That scientist has the following to say:

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         From the data it is difficult, in fact it may even be impossible, to determine the level of mortality of dugong due to gillnetting. Within the qualifications on the conclusions of the report, it is not reasonable to say it is bad science. However, whether a decision that has such an effect on people's lives should be made from this report is questionable. The political decision should not be made on the evidence supplied.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The third point is what the report does demonstrate is that gillnetting is a significant cause. However, you cannot conclude from the report how significant gillnetting is.
        </para>
        <para>
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         The scientist goes on further to say:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The report is inconclusive on the other significant mortality factors: motorboat strikes, illegal fishing, indigenous fishing and other natural causes.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         Finally, they say that the dugong may have just migrated, bearing in mind that a single dugong can move from 50 kilometres up to 500 kilometres within a matter of days.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         My other concern with this report is the level of compensation. I had a fisherman come into the office recently—Mr McKenzie. Although the report says that he is not going to be affected by the dugong protection areas, in fact, his livelihood is going to be wiped out. He is not going to receive any compensation. His investment in his business, with his boat and his licence, is worth $92,000. His house repayment is $140 a week. Frankly, his livelihood is going to be ruined. I am very concerned that there is not going to be adequate compensation for those who are going to lose their livelihood as a result of this decision.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I firmly believe that what we need to be looking at to protect our dugong adequately and to ensure a livelihood for the fishermen in the Great Barrier Reef's southern area is an independent study of the dugong. We will be writing to Senator Hill soon, from the University of Central Queensland, asking for such a study. That study should look at remapping the seagrass beds. The existing maps are over 16 years old. Recent studies done by fishermen in the area show that, where there are
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          seagrass meadows on the maps, there is no seagrass.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In relation to an accurate aerial survey of dugong populations, as our independent scientist has said, transect aerial surveys are an extremely awkward way to measure dugong numbers. We need to do a study of the reproductive biology. We need to look at dugong eating habits. Not all seagrass is palatable to dugong. They are very particular about the types of seagrass that they choose to eat. We need an analysis of why seagrass beds are declining in some areas and regenerating in others.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Finally, there is the effect of environmental stress and fungal pathogens on seagrass. Labyrinthulia is a fungal pathogen well known to destroy seagrass. It is believed now to be established in Queensland, yet there has been no study of that. I believe there can be a win-win from the situation we face in Queensland, whereby dugong numbers can be maintained and the livelihood of commercial fishermen can be ensured.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is a number of other aspects of the report that were not examined. Dugong have very acute hearing, yet pingers and acoustic devises on nets have simply not been looked at at all. They are very effective for certain species of dolphin, and there is no reason why a particular acoustic device could not be adapted to help protect dugong.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is a number of other issues that have not been addressed in this report, and I think that it is a lose-lose situation to look at one cause of dugong decline—hence, one solution—when, plainly, there are complex intermeshing causes for dugong decline. I also think it is unsatisfactory to destroy the livelihood, certainly in my area, of 114 people without adequate compensation.

         We all know that the minister for transport has stubbornly refused to even consider Goulburn as a site for Sydney's second international airport—a site that when serviced by the very fast train offers a win&amp;hyphen;win situation to both the citizens of Sydney and the citizens of the Southern Highlands. We all know how prone our minister is to exhibitions of outlandish and impetuous behaviour. Now his most recent actions in relation to the draft EIS and those lobbying for an airport at Goulburn have added another chapter to this minister's record as one of the loosest cannons on the Howard government's front bench.

         Firstly, let us look at what he has done in relation to the draft EIS. We were told initially that the draft environmental impact study would be published in late July. It is now September.

         If this were a case of a delay caused by a minister who wanted to make sure that the report for which he was responsible was comprehensive or error&amp;hyphen;free, then I believe that would be acceptable. If it were a case of a delay because of unforeseen technical errors in the publishing process, then that, too, would be acceptable. What is not acceptable is that the delay has been caused by the minister's own outrageous case of megalomania. We have a minister for transport who has now taken his neuroses to such a level that he is currently forcing public servants to participate in bizarre rituals of secrecy, which could only have sprung from the minister's own paranoid imagination. It is the minister's own addiction to control which has now delayed the publication of the draft EIS for some two months while the rest of Sydney waits unnecessarily.

          example, the minister is allowing only one copy of the completed draft EIS to be seen by the auditors employed for the project by this government—the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation.

         All this adds up to millions of Sydney residents being left in the dark needlessly for two extra months while the minister plays his little power games.

         The people of Sydney were promised an open and honest EIS process. The people of Sydney were promised transparency, not closed doors and secrecy. The people of Sydney were promised that they would be involved in the draft EIS process, not locked out of it. They were promised information as soon as it came to hand, not unnecessary delays at the behest of a minister for transport who is out of control.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The transport minister's arrogance and contempt for the public has also strayed into his dealings with his own constituents; namely, the Goulburn City Council and hundreds of its supporters who are in favour of their district at least being considered as a site for Sydney's second airport in conjunction with the very fast train. Goulburn City Council has recently joined with members of its community, both business leaders and ordinary families, in a campaign to have their voices heard on this matter.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Goulburn City Council matched a public contribution of some $5,000 to the campaign with a donation of its own for the same amount. The money has been used to place advertisements in local papers on the benefits to the region of an international airport at Goulburn and to bolster the group's lobbying efforts—efforts which, I might add, despite the transport minister's attempts at destabilisation, are still going strong.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Following the news that the council had matched the public's contribution with its own donation, the minister for transport—and remember these people are his own constituents—took to the airwaves and rubbished their efforts and initiative. He said that the council was taking part in a cruel hoax of the community. I believe that is an outrageous accusation. It is the minister for transport and this government who are conducting a hoax on the citizens of Goulburn and, indeed, on the citizens of Sydney with their continual denigration and dismissal of Goulburn as a site for Sydney's second airport.

          The minister for transport and the members of the Howard government use the arguments of distance and weather to dismiss any proposal that Goulburn should at least be looked at as a site for Sydney's second airport. Only two weeks ago at a meeting of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce, the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) said that Goulburn should be ruled out because it was `too far and too foggy'. This is a complete and utter hoax, which also needs to be debunked.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Firstly, let us turn to distance. Linked by a very fast train, an airport at Goulburn would be only 45 minutes away from Sydney. As I have said countless times before, that is less time than it takes to travel from Heathrow to the centre of London on the Underground. The consortia bidding for the right to construct the very fast train between Sydney and Canberra have gone on the record about their willingness to build, at their cost, a station which services an airport at Goulburn. Just last week Andrew Mason, the spokesperson for Transrapid, which is proposing to build a magnetic levitation train, said:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          Goulburn is automatically included if we get the go ahead. That would place Goulburn 45 minutes from Sydney.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          A spokesperson for a competing consortia, Dale Budd from Speedrail, said his company would readily negotiate the construction of a station at Goulburn. Distance is plainly not an issue with the very fast train.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          And what about the argument in relation to weather? The proposition that Goulburn is an inappropriate site for an international airport because of heavy fog is completely fallacious. The minister for transport in answer to a question of mine on notice said his most recent advice from the Bureau of Meteorology indicated that in 1996 there were 32 days of fog at Goulburn.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I would like to take a look, for the interest of the parliament, at the international airport at Seattle&amp;hyphen;Tacoma in the United States. It is the 18th busiest in the United States. In 1994 it had over 10 million emplanements—people embarking and disembarking from planes—or 345,000 operations, which are take&amp;hyphen;offs and landings. Remember, under the coalition's plan, Sydney's second airport will eventually
          <break page="7461" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           have the capacity for 360,000 operations—a difference of only some 15,000 operations.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Interestingly, Seattle&amp;hyphen;Tacoma is one of the worst fog affected airports in the United States. The US government publication
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Weather Almanac
          </emphasis>
          , records Seattle&amp;hyphen;Tacoma as suffering `heavy fog' where visibility is `one&amp;hyphen;quarter of a mile or less' on an average of 47 days per year—that is 47 as opposed to 32 at Goulburn. Yet the government says it cannot build an airport there because of the fog. What an outright fabrication.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The minister is contemptuous of the draft EIS process; he is contemptuous of the people of Sydney who were promised an open and honest EIS process; and he is contemptuous of the aspirations and enterprise of hundreds of his own constituents. Compounding these facts he insists on spreading and perpetuating deliberate untruths about an airport at Goulburn.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          If the minister cares so little about the need for jobs and investment in his own electorate which would flow from an airport being built there, I find it difficult to imagine he is at all concerned about the rights of Sydneysiders to clean air, freedom from debilitating noise during sleeping hours and the violation of pristine wilderness, which are the certain by&amp;hyphen;products of building an international airport at either Badgerys Creek or Holsworthy.

          People are not going to sit down and be quiet about this. They are continuing to be annoyed. They are continuing to gather and express their outrage that either of these sites, despite the advances of modern technology and the advent of the very fast train, is still being contemplated by this government. As I said earlier when the second EIS was contemplated in Holsworthy, if it is good enough to have an EIS for Holsworthy, why not Goulburn?

           the former Labor government and also, in part, of this government. The debate over tariff reform in this country has in past years been a debate built as much around pure emotion as pure economics. The Industry Commission's assessment of the issue for the government's consideration has once again reignited that debate.

         The Industry Commission is not and has never been the policy mouthpiece for the Howard government. Indeed, nobody could say, after the pragmatic approach to the future tariff reform of the local car industry, that this government is in any way the mere wagging tail of the Industry Commission beast.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Yes, these industries have a future—a very real future in Australia—and, as a member of this government, I am determined to help facilitate that. That is why I endorse the direct thrust of the TCF industries' collective `pause for a cause' reform package, which specifically demands, in part, a  freeze on tariffs between the years 2000 and 2005. The reason for that is the need to balance the rational and the emotional—marrying job security with economics—has become more urgent than ever. A key component of that balance is the need for government to face the hard and fast economic reality that pushing on in the short term with further tariff cuts will have a significant impact on jobs directly linked to the TCF sector.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Getting the balance right—of the emotion of wanting to sustain jobs as part of a viable, ongoing local TCF sector—did not work in practice, even if it was half-heartedly attempted to be reflected in principle by the economics driven by the former Hawke and Keating Labor government for the industry. Getting the balance right certainly did not occur in the eyes of the people involved in the TCF game in the Hunter.

         Peter Rundle, former owner of the Hunter based Rundles clothing manufacturer, and whose company, whilst still operating, is now in the hands of the Westpac Bank and a receiver, portrays a damning indictment of some of the former government's actions towards the TCF industries. These actions—if you had been listening to members of the Labor Party around the country during the
         <break page="7462" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          winter parliamentary recess—apparently did not happen now that they have embarked on a sudden Paulian conversion on tariffs.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Peter Rundle just today went back over the past with me on issues that stick in his craw—and they certainly stick in mine—over the former government's poor performance on TCF policy. As a publicly proud wearer of the Rundles suit label, I was in Newcastle getting fitted for a suit back in 1994 when one Paul Keating made his famous remarks on the radio concerning Italian Zegna suits being his exclusive choice. The Rundles staff at the time were flabbergasted, to say the least. Whilst Paul Keating's choice of clothes is his prerogative, the manner and the way in which he portrayed his abandonment of the local product had a damning financial impact. Rundles assessed that his comments alone cost the group jobs. What made the issue even worse was that Rundles made an offer to the former Prime Minister to try a locally made Hunter suit on for size. He declined. Indeed, the company never heard back from him.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another damning issue was the direct impact of Labor's 1991 determination to escalate tariff reform in the TCF industries, despite the country being in the throes of the worst economic downturn since World War II. Peter Rundle expressed to me that this fresh reform stance by the then Labor government drove the Australian clothing trade from a position of 75 per cent Australian made domestic suit sales, spiralling downwards to 50 per cent in just a matter of a few short years. To add fuel to the fire, clothing manufacturers from New Zealand and Fiji are bringing in material and clothing with no duty. Those from China are coming in with a favourable tariff rate.

         On the day of the federal opposition's public call to arms during a rally in Sydney—attended by many TCF workers from the Hunter and all over the state—urging the Commonwealth to instil a tariff pause, I put my fellow Hunter Labor politicians on notice that they match their brave new policy world on the tariff debate by supporting Australian made clothing manufacturing in the clothes they wear. You may say that that is a moot
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          point, but when the cry went out in the community for people to support Rundles by purchasing garments to help an immediate cash flow problem, it was certainly not heard by a former recent member of this House from the Hunter area who felt justified in sending one of his suits to Asia with his wife to have another one made because it was perceived to be cheaper. That is not supporting our industry, is it?

         In the Commonwealth's ultimate response to the final report of the Industry Commission inquiry into the textiles, clothing and footwear industries that will be forthcoming in the days and weeks following the tabling of the report next Tuesday, 9 September, the emotion of sustaining or holding the line on TCF jobs with a new reform package will become paramount. As a member of that government, I am acutely conscious of that and I will be driving that emotional but also very rational view that holding the line on tariffs in the short term is a legitimate tool to sustaining textiles jobs in the Hunter and across the nation.

         Put simply, textile workers in my electorate of Paterson and, I assume, right across the country, do not particularly care who is or was in government at the time of such decisions. They simply care about their jobs, their families and their collective futures. That message was reinforced loud and clear on 21 August when I met, during their lunch hour, with the work force at the King Gee Workwear factory based at Rutherford. It was an interesting and, at times, most vocal meeting. Most of the workers present were angry and vocal—and I have to say justifiably so. They had felt aggrieved by government decisions of the past which disregarded their needs. As I told them and the local press, including the

         Not one person amongst them wants to be cast aside onto the unemployment queue. They all want to work. They believe in the quality of the product they are making—the King Gee workwear and fashion label, which

         As I am a proud and longstanding wearer of the Hunter suit label Rundles, so my choice of work or dress shirt for many years now has been Gloweave, because their patterns just happen to fit a person who is on the larger end of the size spectrum. Due to the difficulty of getting larger sizes, I purchase bulk numbers of the shirts at a single time. It used to be a simple case of walking into a department store and buying half a dozen Gloweave shirts, taking them home and peeling off the `Made in Australia' label.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, about four years ago on such a shopping crusade for shirts, I noticed on getting them home that four of the shirts were made in Indonesia and the other two in Australia, yet all were sold for the same retail price. On my latest expedition to buy more of those fine fitting Gloweave shirts—you guessed it—they were all made in Indonesia yet with no real effective change in the sale price. So what we have seen over the past decade is that jobs at the Australian production end for Gloweave have unquestionably shifted offshore, yet with little or no perceived benefit to the Australian worker or, more importantly, the Australian consumer.

         I agree that there had to be rationalisation in trade and tariff policy, but I stress the point that timing is everything. The New South Wales Farmers Association Chief Executive, Peter Comensoli, said in a press statement on 20 August:

        <para font-size="-=2">

         He went on to argue that Australians would soon pay as much as $1.2 billion a year more for their clothing, textiles and footwear than they need to because of the present tariff regime. Peter Comensoli is right to a great extent, but the government also needs to be

          —The Native Title Amendment (Tribunal Appointments) Bill 1997, which is now before the House, contains amendments to the Native Title Act 1993 that amend the qualifications for appointment of presidential members of the National Native Title Tribunal and provide for the temporary appointment of the registrar to the National Native Title Tribunal by the president. The explanatory memorandum says that currently only judges may be appointed as presidential members and only the Governor&amp;hyphen;General can appoint an acting registrar.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech also say that these amendments ensure that a more diverse field of suitably qualified candidates may be considered for presidential membership. They also ensure that the National Native Title Tribunal can act quickly and efficiently deal with a temporary vacancy in the position of registrar. That is contained in the explanatory memorandum. Again, the assertion that currently only judges may be appointed as presidential members is in the second reading speech.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The true situation when one goes to section 110 of the Native Title Act is that the president or deputy president can actually be a judge of the Federal Court or a former judge.
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          A former judge is defined in section 253 of the definitions section as `a person who has been a justice of the High Court or judge of another federal court or of the supreme court of a state or territory'. It is not current judges but former judges who can hold that position. The explanatory memorandum and second reading speech are technically not correct.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The amendment bill seeks to expand the qualification at the end of section 110 dealing with persons who may be appointed as presidential members by adding section (3) which states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         A person who is, and has been for at least 5 years, enrolled as a legal practitioner of the High Court, of another federal court or of the Supreme Court of a State or Territory.

         The opposition will be opposing that extension of the appointment of presidential members.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think it is important to outline the reason for that. It will come as a bit of a surprise to some members of the government because it is a change in the earlier position put by the former government in a position paper. We say that up&amp;hyphen;front. There is no hiding from that. We believe that, as a result of consultation and recent events, it is important that that particular provision not be changed. We believe that the current provision, as it is, and the experience over the last 18 months—particularly since the change of government and since there has been discussion over amendments to the Native Title Act—have shown that to have someone of the stature of Justice French in that position has, from the opposition's point of view, added to the tribunal and add to the acceptance of the tribunal by all stakeholders.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The position in relation to section 110 was put in the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's Department outline of proposed amendments document released in September 1995. It stated at page 15:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         This section will be amended to broaden the qualification for appointment as presidential members to include persons who have been legally qualified for five years.

        <para>
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         There was no further justification of that. But I think it is important to put the qualifier, the
         <break page="7465" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          purpose of the outline at page 2 of that paper of September 1995, on the record. It says:

        <para style="Para">
         It was not a final position of the former government. Indeed, further down in paragraph 7 on page 2 it says `Although the bill has yet to be drafted'. So that position was put out in the public domain. The current president of the tribunal, Justice French, has a particular view, and his view was put openly in a discussion paper of 14 March 1995 on proposed changes to the Native Title Act. Justice French says:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Under the proposed amendments the present organisational arrangements of the Tribunal would remain unchanged. The Registrar would continue to be the Chief Executive Officer of the Tribunal under the President and would maintain the Registers of Native Title Claims and Native Title Determinations.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         Then he goes on, and this is the relevant part:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Having regard to the desirability of distinguishing the role of the Tribunal from that of a court, it would be appropriate that no serving Judges be involved in its ongoing work. This would also have the advantage of limiting the diversion of resources from the Federal Court which will, on any view, have a significant role in the hearing and determination of native title cases or substantive issues arising out of them.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         That was Justice French's view. Indeed, in submission No. 63 in August 1996 on section 110, Justice French says:
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         This section as it presently stands sets out the categories of membership of the Tribunal and the qualifications for appointment to those categories. The amendment extends the qualifications of Presidential Members to include persons who have been legal practitioners for five years or more.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         The comment by Justice French is:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The amendment is supported. It will provide greater flexibility in the appointment of Members to the Tribunal.

         But there was an opposing view put by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Mick Dodson, in his report entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          The Native Title Report: July 1995&amp;hyphen;June 1996
         </emphasis>
         . That is in chapter 8 on page 188. In relation to the proposed amendment, the Social Justice Commissioner says:
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para font-size="-=2">
          Currently, only judges of the Federal Court or former judges can be presidential members of the NNTT. The proposed amendment provides for lawyers with five years of experience to be eligible for appointment as presidential members.
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          This proposal may undermine the standing of the NNTT. In the establishment and consolidation phase of a body with the significant and unusual functions of the NNTT, it is vital that it be perceived as credible and impartial. This perception would be undermined if the President and Deputy President of the NNTT were not required to have judicial experience. I therefore believe that the proposed amendment is inappropriate.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          That is a view that Mr Dodson put back then, and I believe that that view has been confirmed in recent months. I believe that having someone of the stature of Justice French as the presidential member has helped the debate. It has given stature to that position. It has also maintained a confidence in the tribunal that might otherwise be missing if it were not a Federal Court judge. I repeat that the second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum fail to point out that former judges can be appointed to this position. I think that in the current climate it is important that that position be maintained.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          That is why in the consideration in detail stage of the debate I will be moving an amendment. The opposition will be supporting the other amendments in the amendment bill. We have had the benefit of further amendments that are proposed to be moved by the government being circulated to us and we will be supporting those amendments as well.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I understand that there will be some disappointment on the government side, but there is a lot of misinformation about at the moment in relation to the tribunal, among other things, and there are a number substantial proposals that are certainly being considered as to whether the national body will be maintained in its present form or, indeed, whether we will have exclusive state bodies exercising a similar role. I have a particular view—it is not the concluded view of the Labor Party at this stage—that we are better off with the present structure. I believe in the uniformity of our system. I believe that what you need is a national overarch. I believe that the 1967 referendum says that the responsibility of this parliament is to protect indigen
          <break page="7466" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
           ous people and to legislate in their interests. I think a national overarching body which will have uniformity is preferable.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I want to see, with some amendments to make it work better, the tribunal remain as it is. I am not in favour—and I repeat that I am expressing a personal view here—of having eight different bodies under the auspices of particular state or territory governments. But that is another issue that will be debated at another time.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There has been a very hysterical debate. We have had members of the coalition, one in particular in the other place, launching quite inappropriate attacks on the tribunal—quite personal attacks on the current president of the tribunal—and misrepresenting the situation. I think that particular member has got a problem because he is obviously looking for votes. I think Justice French has done an exemplary job, and that is to the credit of this government. We applaud what they did in extending his term of office so that he can be there while the amendments to the Native Title Act are being considered, and that gives continuity to the process.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          On this side of the House, we now believe that this recent experience adds to the position that we are taking, and that is that the tribunal really should remain the same. I do not believe that the tribunal will have as much credibility from the stakeholders themselves or from the community if it is someone who merely has been for at least five years enrolled as a legal practitioner of the High Court, of another federal court or of the Supreme Court of a state or territory. I believe that the presidential member or the deputy president should be a judge of the Federal Court or a former judge.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          What can happen is that the Attorney-General and the government can appoint someone from the Supreme Court. I know that Justice Mathews, for instance, was a District Court judge at one stage and then a judge of the New South Wales Supreme Court and then became a judge of the Federal Court. We think that adds to the stature of the tribunal and the acceptance of that tribunal. We do not believe it is a natural consequence of the Brandy High Court decision that you
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           just have to take away or water down the current proposals.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I think there are a number of other arguments that can also be used to support why the status quo should be maintained. In short, having someone who has that stature I think does send a signal of impartiality, integrity, authority and status to the tribunal that is sadly needed at this point in time. One of the arguments we had in relation to another bill was that as a result of a High Court decision the government is now proposing amendments to do with telephone intercepts where those warrants that are fairly intrusive should be able to be issued by members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. We believe that sends the wrong message.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In the current climate it seems to me that longstanding principles are being changed. We do not believe this does take away from the resources of the Federal Court. We are not advocating that Justice French maintain his position in that office. The appointments are for five years. It is not just present judges; it is former judges. If there is a question about resources, you can get former justices of the High Court. I repeat the definition: a person who has been a justice of the High Court or a judge of another federal court or of the Supreme Court of a state or territory. So there is not that limitation.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This is about bringing and maintaining confidence in this system. I repeat—and I cannot repeat it enough—that it is the experience of the job Justice French has done in recent months that we believe confirms the view that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Mick Dodson, has expressed in his reservations. That is why we put on the table the earlier positions of the outline paper and Justice French's position. We believe that they are legitimately held, but if this provision is expanded and the government goes the other way then I think that is going to create problems. We think it should remain the same.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It also means that the person, even though it is not necessarily a judicial function, is possessed of relevant legal decision making skills. We have sought the advice of others. The preference, again as a result of recent
          <break page="7467" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           experience, is that the tribunal remain the same. There is a fear that this will be used in effect to run another agenda. There is no evidence of that—none whatsoever, I might say—but that is the view, that is the fear and that is the misconception. Sure, it might give flexibility, but we believe that the flexibility of having former judges there is enough for this government in the current climate.

          We believe those amendments improve on the present situation. They improve on the availability of persons to be appointed as Registrar and they send the right message.

It leaves the tribunal open for further attack and further undermining. I believe the senator who attacked Justice French and the tribunal did themselves damage—not only because of the way Justice French handled himself but also because of his status.

If there is a situation in relation to urgency on the registrar, we are happy if the government wants to sever the bill, because the amendment I will move is a very small amendment that takes away that part in relation to a presidential member. If the Attorney-General wants to expedite the bill in relation to the amendments on the registrar, we think that is stuff that can be expedited.

I think it would have been a lot worse if it had not been someone like Justice French with his position, his good sense, his integrity, his impartiality and his experience. Without all of that, the tribunal would have been in a worse situation in terms of the confidence of all the stakeholders.

          —I inform the member for Banks (Mr Melham) that I certainly will be conducting my comments on the Native Title Amendment (Tribunal Appointments) Bill 1997 in the same reasoned manner that he did. I would like to comment very briefly on some aspects of the bill and its administration. The Native Title Tribunal has its principal office in Western Australia, which is a very appropriate place in light of the significance of native title to our state.

        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would like to make a few preliminary comments before I get on to the nub of the comments that the member for Banks made. It is helpful that the tribunal is located very close to the people who are probably most affected by the operation of the act, given that approximately 80 per cent of Western Australia is currently under claim. I will talk later, though, about the significance of the act to the wider Australian community because I am very aware that this is not an issue just affecting my state.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I said, I want to make a few comments about the administration of the act and the tribunal which this bill addresses. The Native Title Amendment (Tribunal Appointments) Bill 1997 will remove the current stipulations of the Registrar of the Native Title Tribunal by relaxing the criteria by which the registrar can be appointed, and we know that. This will be opened up to attract a far wider selection of appropriately qualified people which the shadow minister, the member for Banks, has already said he agrees with.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This relaxation of the criteria is reflective, I believe, of several aspects of the Native Title Act. Firstly, the government's amendments to the Native Title Act are designed to simplify the act. It is important to note that we want to simplify it and make it clearer and more workable. The coalition's 10-point plan and the amendments to the act will bring long overdue changes, which we intend to introduce this Thursday. Secondly, and importantly, the role of the Native Title Tribunal will change with these amendments.

          Proposed amendments to the Native Title Act will significantly alter the role of the registrar as far as they will no longer have any role in deciding whether or not applications should be accepted.

          Proposed amendments will see an increased focus on the registration test and, in the context of the duties of the registrar, it is timely to allow the position to be held by someone with a very hands-on, administrative approach rather than an academic or legal approach. In the National Native Title Tribunal annual report 1993-94, the changing administrative objectives were acknowledged, and it said:

          Clearly, some aspects have taken longer than six months, but we are facilitating this process of change now with these amendments.

          One of the problems with the current legislation is that it does not necessarily attract people who are actually practising law; they only have to be able to be, not actually, practising law. So, in effect, it is precluding other people because of the wording of the requirements. I believe the intent of this aspect of the act is to have someone who is actually practising—not someone who is simply able to be practising and who, therefore, is not.

           The administration criteria for the presidential members of the Native Title Tribunal are also proposed to be relaxed, as we have already found out, under this amendment and in a similar manner to that of the registrar. Under existing legislation a presidential member—that is, the president or the vice-presidents of the tribunal—must have been a Federal Court judge, a High Court judge, a state or territory Supreme Court judge or, as the member opposite said, a former judge. This amendment proposes to expand the eligibility to anyone who has been admitted as a legal practitioner for five years or more in Australia.

           Naturally, by removing this requirement to be a judge or former judge, the amendment clearly introduces a far greater pool of suitably qualified candidates for this tribunal position. In fact, the aim of this amendment is to provide for the appointment of the best person for the job. There are fewer judges with extensive experience in native title matters than there are barristers and solicitors, whose numbers with experience in this area are continuing to increase.

He has also brought experience gained from his chairmanship of the Aboriginal Legal Service some years ago. But it is my understanding, unless somebody corrects me, that Justice French feels he has been politicised somewhat by this position, and that goes with the territory in this job.

            While acknowledging the significance of the Native Title Act in Western Australia, it has to be said that it is a national issue and one which all Australians have to come to grips with to properly develop ways to resolve conflicts caused by the issue. This is a sentiment reflected by the majority of Australians. Australians have to realise that they are affected by the Native Title Act.

            Having discussed the role of the registrar, I would like to acknowledge the contribution made by Ms Patricia Lane, the first permanent Registrar of the National Native Title Tribunal. Ms Patricia Lane brought considerable expertise to the tribunal. Before taking the position of registrar, Ms Lane—who holds a Master of Laws degree—was the Senior Deputy Registrar of the Federal Court of Australia in Sydney. She has also worked as an associate to judges of the court, as a researcher in the law courts library and as a lecturer and tutor at the University of Sydney—an eminently qualified person as the registrar.

            This amendment also seeks to amend a flaw in the existing legislation which currently prevents the president from appointing an acting registrar in the event of an untimely departure of the registrar. I am pleased that the member for Banks has no problem with that. Presently, the appointment of a registrar or acting registrar is the province of the Governor-General, but any vacancy of the registrar's position would impede the progress of the tribunal, which, it has to be said, cannot afford further delays due to the sensitive nature of native title claims.

            In conclusion, I must make a number of observations. Naturally, the registrar's criteria are relaxed and, when they are relaxed, the position is opened up and presents an opportunity for a wide range of suitably qualified people.

            I find it a little alarming that Mr Dodson, the Social Justice Commissioner, seems to be the one driving the policy from the Labor Party's point of view. In fact, as the member opposite has already said, the ALP did have an outline paper which was quite different to this, and the main reason the member seems to be advocating a change—and I know he will not agree with me—is that Mr Dodson has had a word to him. I do not think policies should be driven by Mick Dodson. I do not believe there would be a perception of a downgrading of the position. The framework is now in place and is running well, and there is a fair and wider field of applicants who could apply for this position because of its evolving nature.

            In reference to a point made by the member for Banks, I do not believe there is a wider agenda. I believe that most people who would view these appointments would say that time has moved on since their initial construction and it is about time this process was just as transparent as it was before. The perception would be that more people are being given an opportunity. The amendment addresses the issue of a conflict of interest as well as the provision for a president to appoint the acting registrar, which we have said addresses the problem of continuity.

            I believe that we have a number of points of agreement, but I must confirm again that I cannot agree with the fact that the status of the president is seen to be eroded for the wrong reasons or the wrong agendas.

         The proposed changes to the native title regime in the  Native Title Amendment Bill 1996 to be introduced into this House in the near future will alter the role of the registrar. Those amendments will provide, as foreshadowed in the 1995 bill of the previous government, that applications for native title or compensation will be made directly to the Federal Court. The registrar will therefore no longer have any role in deciding whether or not applications should be accepted, and it is appropriate that qualifications for appointment should therefore be changed.

         The member for Banks is arguing that the position of president of the tribunal will be downgraded and that the tribunal itself will be downgraded or `watered down'—to use another expression he used—if the amendment proposed in the original bill relating to the qualifications for the position of president is passed.

         The member for Banks was right to acknowledge that this is a change of an earlier position. He referred to a position paper put out by the Keating Labor government in 1995 and sought to highlight that this was only a proposal for public debate. What might have been added by the member for Banks was that the 1995 bill that was introduced by the previous government did follow up on that amendment and did propose exactly what the present government is proposing.

          The member for Banks made something of the views of Justice French. I have discussed this matter with Justice French on occasions over some considerable time. He explained that initially the very name of the tribunal—the National Native Title Tribunal—led to misapprehension, particularly on the part of native title claimants. They had a belief that native title could in effect be awarded by the tribunal. That was not what was contemplated under the initial act, and it certainly is not what is contemplated under the amendments the government has foreshadowed.

          As a result of the High Court's decision in the Brandy case, the previous government was obliged to amend the Native Title Act in order to ensure that there was no breach of the principles in that decision that the tribunal should not exercise judicial power.

         <para first-indent="16">
          That in itself would have significantly changed the role of the tribunal from being one where determinations were possible to one where its principal role was mediation. I think Justice French was right to highlight, as he did in his discussions with me, that the role of the tribunal is not necessarily reflected in the name, particularly post Brandy.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Equally, it might be added in this context that since the Brandy decision there have been other decisions of the High Court relevant in defining the role of the tribunal. The decision of the High Court in Wilson and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has focused attention on what judges of federal courts can and cannot do outside the work they actually do in their courts.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The High Court has laid down what is referred to as the `incompatibility condition', under which chapter III of the constitution requires that judges not be required to do things incompatible with their position of independence and, equally, that they do not have thrust upon them roles in relation to the court itself of which they are a member that are inconsistent with the impartial and objective fulfilment of the judicial role.

           Mediation is not a judicial function. On that basis, it is unnecessary that the president or a presidential member be a judge.

It is simply to add some status and give an appearance of independence. I do not think that is necessary.

          In our view, the fact that somebody has the title `Justice'—which they would not be exercising in acting in a presidential role in relation to the tribunal—is not enough of an argument to warrant using the scarce judicial resources of the federal court or whatever court is involved.

          The member for Banks has expressed his confidence in Justice French, as has the member for Swan. In my view, that confidence is very rightly placed. Justice French has done an excellent job as the inaugural president. He has, by dint of his skills rather than his status, achieved a lot for the tribunal. He has also presided over a tribunal whose role has significantly changed from that envisaged in 1993, and it has changed even while he has been the occupant of the office. It will significantly change again if and when the proposed changes under the forthcoming 1997 bill come into operation.

          The member for Banks applauded the government's extension of the term of office of Justice French.

           Justice French has laid the groundwork for his successor, but his successor does not have to be a judge or even a former judge; he has to be an appropriate person who has requisite managerial and administrative skills, decision making skills and the requisite legal knowledge. In the government's view, the sort of person who can properly perform the functions of the president in that context need not necessarily be a judge. That is not to say that the amendments are excluding judges from consideration. They are just adding a further category of potential member who can be appointed. The government will seek to appoint the right person for the job. I commend the bill, subject to government amendments, to the House.

         I will not go over all the points I made during the second reading debate. The purpose of the amendment is to leave the appointment of the presidential member in particular the same. We think it has worked well.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I want to make a couple of points arising out of what the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General (Mr Williams) said in closing the debate. It is pretty obvious from the comments the minister made that the reason this extra qualification is being added is that the government—this is more probable than not—is going to appoint someone who is not a judge of the Federal Court or not a former judge.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Attorney-General mentioned the High Court case of Wilson. This position is not incompatible with judicial office; Wilson does not say that in relation to this position. The government is maintaining that it can still appoint a judge or a former judge. By maintaining the current qualifications, I think we can dismiss the inference that this current position is not compatible with judicial office. It is, because the qualifications still remain that the government can appoint a judge or a former judge.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The fact is that the tribunal conducts mediation. We believe that mediation would be assisted by having a judge or a former judge in this position. I do not want to go over the old arguments. However, our reservation—that this is really a backdoor method of basically the next presidential member not being a judge or a former judge—has been confirmed by the comments made by the minister in closing the debate, and that is what we disagree with.

          I assure the member for Swan (Mr Randall) that I have not spoken to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner on this matter, but I do rely on the arguments that he put forward. We are not running his agenda. We have researched the different arguments. As I quite properly put, this is a change from our earlier position in the outline paper which, I acknowledge, the former government put in amendments. What we do say is that the current experience—the current performance—of Justice French, with those attacks on the tribunal and the current debate, has confirmed the view we are putting in this amendment: that is, it is in the interests of all stakeholders in terms of credibility and of assisting in the mediation process for the qualifications to remain the same.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There is not much more that I can add. The dividing lines are there. As a result of what the minister said in closing the debate, I suspect that if this amendment does go through and passes the Senate, then we will have someone other than a judge or a former judge being appointed. We just think that will be a mistake. I commend our amendment because it is not incompatible. That is why the government is maintaining the current qualifications. We think it is the proper way to go.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We are prepared to sever the bill in terms of the registrar because that case has been made out. As I offered in the second reading debate, we can have another look at this down the track, if you want, but at the moment we think we should keep it with the status quo. In all honesty, the reason is that we do not take the government on trust. We believe that this is a backdoor way of basically downgrading the position. We do not believe the government has any intention of appointing a judge or a former judge. I commend my amendment to the House.

It is hard enough to get the right people to act in what is a very difficult and skilled role, without finding them placed in positions where other people are quite appropriate and can do the job.

          is an omnibus bill and has a number of components. We are not proposing to oppose any of them, except the fifth component, which is the section relating to the sugar tariff. When discussion on this bill is completed, I intend to seek that the vote be taken on the first four components of it as a collective and that the sugar component of it be dealt with as a specific item.

         Having said that, let me outline the reason for taking this position. Prior to the winter break, we had quite some debate in this House about the government's move to remove the sugar tariffs without, we believe, appropriate consultation, in breach of an undertaking to the constituency and at great risk to the future of the sugar industry, particularly to producers in the sugar industry. We made it clear at all times that we believed there was no good reason for this.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We believed that the industry had a solid regime in place. It was consistent with the agreements that Australia had made internationally under the GATT arrangements and the Uruguay Round.

         During the winter break, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission approved a merger between CSR and Mackay refineries. I make it very clear that we are very comfortable with and are in support of that measure. It is something which we sought the approval of the commission for during our time in office. In the decision relating to the approval of that merger, the commission does make note of the fact that the sugar tariff was removed from 1 July. It has noted that as a change in the arrangements which operate in the Australian economy. It was one of the factors which it took into account.

Therefore, we do not accept the claim which will inevitably come from the other side that, by continuing to seek to overturn the decision to scrap the sugar tariff, we are in some way or other putting at risk the merger that has been approved.

There is no need to reduce the sugar tariff below $55 per tonne, which operated at 30 June. The removal of that tariff from 1 July simply amounts to a loss of income for producers in the industry. It was in breach of plans upon which investment in the industry have been made since the regime was put in place.

That is what is supposed to happen in theory, but we will all be watching to see.

         I suppose he will explain later that the industry review that was carried out recommended that the tariff be scrapped. That was recommended on the basis of a whole lot of assumptions, very few of which have since been carried through. There is a very deep sense of aggrievement now. For instance, those sugarcane farmers were promised that, if they went along with their tariff removal, they would be setting the example for the rapid restructure of the Australian economy, because the car tariffs were going to be removed.

         Of course, what is emerging now is that single desk meant Queensland operated single desk, and we are starting to find from some other components of the industry that that is not what they thought. It may well be that this industry will not even finish up operating under a single desk, as the minister knows very well. What is going to happen then? They will have lost both the tariff and the single desk.

         The industry was, in fact, misled into believing that it had to have one or the other—a tariff or a single desk. The industry was misled about the nature of the regime and the fact that the $55 tariff that was in place was perfectly acceptable to remain in place under our international obligations. We have had a range of members from the other side making all sorts of public pronouncements about what their position would be on this. Laurie Oakes did sum it up absolutely beautifully when he said that the industry did not want the tariff to go; it was mugged. For all those reasons I think I have probably reached the point of explaining why we are intending to seek that vote and I reiterate to the House that this particular component of the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997 will be opposed by this side of this House.

Concessional resident supplements would be paid under the new Bill for people unable to afford an accommodation bond or only a very small bond. The choice of income stream is the provider's.
