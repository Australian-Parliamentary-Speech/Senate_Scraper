        This motion implements the government's response to two old reports of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure: the 1992 report on standing orders governing disorder and strangers and the 1988 report on the publication of tabled papers.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The explanation for us dealing with these reports is that we asked the committee to go over all outstanding prior reports of the committee, update those reports and advise the House accordingly. The government has therefore responded. We have consulted with the opposition and other members on the proposed changes to the standing orders and we understand that the opposition is in agreement with the changes.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Very briefly, the changes in relation to the standing orders governing disorder and strangers are essentially housekeeping in nature and are in accordance with recommendations of the Procedure Committee report.

        The amendments will include a reference to sessional orders in part (d) of standing order 303 in relation to the naming of a member; transpose the wording of standing order 308 so that the less severe action of suspension of sitting is referred to first ahead of the reference to the more severe action of adjourning the House in the event of grave disorder in the House; enable a motion requiring a  mem

         ber to attend the house to be moved without notice under standing order 309; remove from standing orders 309 and 310 the references to taking a member or stranger into custody, as the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 and the Parliamentary Precincts Act 1988 now qualify such actions; remove from standing order 311 the reference to members or other persons being brought to the bar for disciplinary action as such action would be most unlikely given the provisions of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 and the Parliamentary Precincts Act 1988; require senators, when in the senators gallery, to observe instructions concerning order issued by the chair, standing order 312; and omit standing order 313, which nominally restricts the daily admission of visitors to the general galleries. The restriction was relevant in the old House where gallery space was limited but is no longer necessary on a day&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;day basis in this Parliament House.

        I now refer to the government response to the publication of tabled papers. Last but not least on the issue of tabled papers, we are proposing to remove the present anomalous situation of tabled documents being treated differently by the two houses of parliament. The Senate has for many years accorded absolute immunity in respect of all documents tabled in the Senate. In the House at present tabled papers attract absolute immunity only if a publication order is carried. It would be true to say that most members and the community at large would not be aware of its distinction or its implications and would assume that anything tabled in the parliament is a readily available public document. The amendment before the House in relation to standing order 320 will provide absolute immunity for all documents tabled in the House so that there is uniform treatment of papers tabled in the parliament. I thank the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) for his cooperation in these sensible reforms.

        All members would be aware that there is a level of concern in the community about the use sometimes made by members of the privilege of freedom of speech in the parliament. It is said to be misused on occasion. I am sure members on all sides are aware of these concerns. The matter was considered thoroughly by the Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege some years ago. It concluded that the privilege of freedom of speech was of fundamental importance and that it should not be circumscribed. It recommended, however, that a right of reply procedure should be introduced  in each House.

        In 1991, the Procedure Committee recommended that we introduce the procedure that is now before the House. The procedure will enhance the parliament's standing as, consistent with the rule of natural justice, citizens who feel genuinely aggrieved by adverse mentions in the House will have the ability to seek to reply to the comments made about them. It is my understanding that in the Senate the procedure was never exercised retrospectively when it was introduced in 1988, and now the government intends that any use of the procedure in the House will also be in relation to future proceedings after

         —The issue of parliamentary privilege has been a contentious one for some time. It has been practised in this place over many years, but the original concept was first adopted in the UK Bill of Rights as far back as 1688. The concept of privilege was conferred to ensure that elected representatives of the community could carry out their duties without fear of intimidation or punishment and without improper impediment.

        However, it is important for us, as members of the parliament, to recognise that, whilst we obtain the privilege in being elected here, it also imposes a responsibility on us to ensure that Australian citizens are not disadvantaged by our immunity. The right of reply, which is proposed here, allows them the opportunity to make their case to the Privileges Committee and, where appropriate, to ensure that the record accurately reflects events. It is just and fair that citizens have the right to ensure that they are able to represent themselves where they feel they have been aggrieved by adverse mention in this place. It is consistent with our system of natural justice and the Australian fundamental sense of fair play.

        The Senate was the first parliamentary chamber in the world to adopt this practice, and it has been in their chamber since 1988 and used very successfully. The Senate Privileges Committee has developed a number of practices in relation to applications for the right of reply. Such an example is the practice that citizens need to make an application within three months of being named in the chamber. While this is not necessarily a hard and fast rule, it does ensure that applications are genuine and in the spirit of the resolution.

         Members may recall that in March this year the House agreed to arrangements enabling the use of electronic communication devices by the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training for a trial period until the end of the last sittings. The arrangements were derived from the recommendations of a 1994 Procedure Committee report on the application of modern technology to committee proceedings. Members may also recall that the chairman of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), reported to the House at the end of the last sittings on the committee's very positive experience with the use of videoconferencing facilities during the trial and recommended strongly that the House extend the use of such facilities to all its committees in light of the efficiencies and cost savings that could be achieved in committee proceedings.

           Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997
          </xref>
          is one item of legislation that has been brought forward by this government which is almost unbelievable. This amendment is not designed to withdraw any legislation that was introduced by the previous Labor government and it is not designed to amend any legislation that was introduced by the previous Labor government, because the previous government's industrial relations legislation was withdrawn entirely by the Howard coalition government. What this amendment proposes to do is to amend this government's own legislation in relation to unfair dismissals.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are provisions in the government's Workplace Relations Act, as we know, to deal with the question of unfair dismissals. What this amending legislation proposes to do is to
         <break page="7025" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          withdraw the protection against unfair dismissals—using the government's own expression and term—from all of those employees who are employed in small businesses which are identified as businesses employing 15 or fewer employees. Not immediately but as soon as the amendment becomes operative, any people who become employed by a small business will have that protection withdrawn from them.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The protection was designed to ensure that employees right across all employment areas in Australia would not be subjected to harsh, unjust or unreasonable dismissal. In this amendment the only exception for those people employed by small business is apprentices. That is an interesting exception too, because it causes us to raise the question as to whether this proposal to withdraw that protection from employees in small businesses is fair, just and equitable, whether this government in introducing this amendment believes that the amendment has those qualities.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If the amendment has those qualities, why then exclude apprentices? Quite clearly the government is embarrassed about the application of these provisions to apprentices in small businesses, but it will apply to everyone else, including trainees. Any young employee not identified as an apprentice will have this unfair dismissal protection withdrawn from him or her. The government, to protect what shambles of a reputation it has left, has chosen to exclude apprentices because it is embarrassed and ashamed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is claiming that this legislation is designed to assist in its package of proposals to benefit small business. Small business is not concerned about this issue. As some of the other people speaking for the opposition have indicated, small business is concerned about economic growth, they are concerned about sales and they are concerned about the capacity of their own businesses to satisfy the growing demands of a buoyant, growing economy. If the government was so concerned about small business or about the economy generally, it would be ensuring that the economy was growing instead of applying the brakes to the extent that it has been.

        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          The bill proposes the removal of protection from a large and growing number of employees. It will apply only to those employees who are employed by small business from the moment they are employed after the amendment becomes effective—it will not apply to those current employees in small business—but obviously that will be a growing number and eventually it will overtake the lot. Since the government itself identifies the question of unfair dismissal in the terms that I have indicated—harsh, unjust or unreasonable—it is clear that the government is prepared to see employees in small business dismissed in a harsh, unjust or unreasonable way. There is no other explanation.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          While this is an amendment to the government's own legislation, we are not unmindful of the fact that the government is using this simply as another device to belt industrial protection which exists in Australia for Australian employees and which in a very real sense has developed a coherent structure of industrial protections since, I suppose, 1904, the original Arbitration and Conciliation Act, which incidentally, Mr Speaker, as you know and as all members should know, was introduced by a conservative government, a coalition government under Deakin. Deakin made the point when he was introducing it that it was designed, in effect, to civilise the industrial system and the industrial process. It is this government, the contemporary coalition conservative government, which puts all that asunder.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There will continue to be some forms of protection under the anti-discrimination law and the common law, particularly the common law in relation to contracts, but that obviously is not enough. If it had been enough, the government would not have made provision for questions of unfair dismissal in its legislation in the first place.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The shadow minister for the opposition, Bob McMullan, the member for Canberra, last night gave some good examples of unfair dismissals for which there will be no protection for employees in business with fewer than 15 employees when this exemption becomes fully operative. He included examples where males or females subjected to
          <break page="7026" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           sexual harassment in the workplace in a small business can be unfairly dismissed without any recourse to the court or to the system—harsh, unjust and unreasonable. He gave examples of employees who had refused to cook the books for their employers who wanted to rip off the taxation system and who had suffered unfair, unjust and unreasonable dismissal, with no protection. He gave examples where employees would refuse to carry out instructions which could have endangered them or their workmates and as a result of that could be dismissed without protection—unfair, unjust and unreasonable.

          What a shameful piece of legislation. This government should be ashamed of it. I will be interested to hear members of the government get up and try to defend it and attempt to justify it—people who I know have some conscience, people who have concern and people who have considerable experience in areas of this kind. Shame on them!

          Members are aware that this legislation is discriminatory. It discriminates, for example, between employees in large and small business. If you are in large business you are protected; if you are in small business you will be thrown to the wolves. It discriminates between those who were employed before and those who are employed after the proposed amendment begins to operate. If you were employed before it you are protected; if you are employed after it you are thrown to the wolves. It discriminates between apprentices, who will continue to be protected, and others, including trainees of the same age as the apprentices. If you are a kid in small business and you are a trainee and you are dismissed in an unfair, unreasonable or harsh way, you can be thrown to the wolves.

          I am not suggesting that all owners, all proprietors, all managers in small business are the wolves, but clearly some of them are. We know them. Don't let's pretend that they are not.

We know that there are some people who will take short-cuts on questions of safety. We know they are there and we on this side believe that their employ

          If the legislation that the government is introducing is fair and equitable and just and appropriate, why exclude the apprentices? Is it because the government is embarrassed that this legislation, which it is responsible for, will apply to apprentices, that apprentices will be seen to be sometimes dismissed as a result of harsh or unjust or unreasonable procedures by small business?

          I heard the member for La Trobe, Bob Charles, last night when he was attempting, obviously in an embarrassed way, to defend the government's proposal, make out a case against any unfair dismissal protection and the ways in which that might be implemented. What he did not do was to make out a clear case in favour of this discriminating legislation. I think we are going to see, in the pattern of the government supporters' approach to this legislation, criticism of unfair dismissal legislation and the need for proprietors, owners and managers to have some flexibility in their approach to management.

          In the process of their doing that, they will be in effect endorsing the type of comment which has been made by their own Prime Minister (Mr Howard). I want to give an example of that. On 7 July this year on the

          </emphasis>
          the Prime Minister was urging striking workers at Hunter Valley No. 1 mine, an area just near me, employing some of my constituents, to accept the pay offer that they had been made. The Prime Minister's comment in relation to that was almost unbelievable to me; it was incredible. He told the workers, `The pay deal you are being offered by the company is greatly in excess of what you now have and I think it is only fair and reasonable that'—and I emphasise these last words—`a company be able to run its mine.'

           fodder. The government believes you have the bosses and the workers; you have the masters and the servants. The point I want to make in connection with this is that that exists no longer.

          It is an offence as well for the Prime Minister to say to my constituents, `Listen, cop it. Here's a pay deal that you're being offered which is greatly in excess of what you now have. In effect, we'll buy your dignity, we'll buy your self-respect, we'll increase your pay packet and you can cop it.' My constituents at Hunter Valley No. 1 mine said, `Like hell we will!' and they were right. I endorse them, I support them and I applaud them. They will not sell their rights. They have fought hard enough and long enough in order to secure those rights and they will not sell them. I urge them and appeal to them to never sell their rights and to never accept a proposition that it is only the manager and the owners of a business who have any right to say how it operates.

          I conclude on this point: I repeat again, for the benefit of those people who do not know the changes that have taken place in the last 97 years in Australia, that production is now a social process. Production is undertaken by equals. Production is no longer a relationship of master and servant. We will not allow that to return, nor will the trade union movement, nor will the honest, dignified and honourable employees throughout Australia.

The particular proposed amendment does not affect employees' rights in relation to unlawful dismissal. Let me stress that. The previous speaker, the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), seemed most concerned that some

         The bill will not apply to existing employees, only to employees who are employed after the passage of this legislation. Some people may argue that all employees should be subject to the same work force regulation. I think the previous speaker was trying to say that. But, unfortunately, this ignores a fundamental reality. Small, often family businesses, those with fewer than 15 staff, typically do not have the resources to sustain a long, drawn-out legal battle with an employee who has been given a bit of an opportunity to make some extra money from the boss when they have been dismissed on the grounds of some activity which has endangered the rest of the work force, or has been illegal in itself, or it might be that the business can no longer afford to employ that person.

         Any activity requiring management time to be diverted from normal business activity could and in the past has created a serious threat to the viability of many small businesses, and therefore of course to the very jobs of the other people employed there. If the boss goes down, so do the other people's jobs. We do not believe that is in the interests of the Australian economy, and certainly the work force out there has had it in the neck for too long. They along with the employers in this day and age want a fair deal.

         A culture of fear was created by Labor's unfair dismissal laws. The reality of falling victim to a vexatious claimant became commonplace in the last years of the Labor government. Businesses knew that, no matter how justified their dismissal of an employee was, they could expect to see the charges of unfair dismissal laid. They knew that along with that went costly financial and emotional implications—the damage to their business's reputation and the loss of their good standing in the community, as stories were circulated about how they had treated that employee in
         <break page="7028" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         So commonplace were these vexatious unfair dismissal actions under Labor that small businesses—the small shops, offices, the little garages, the little manufacturers—began to think that it was in fact safer not to take a risk with the employment of a young, inexperienced new worker, perhaps someone new to the community, someone they had not known before, someone who did not have references that they could check out. They decided that it was better not to take the risk to take on that new person in fear of being taken to the cleaners through the unfair dismissal laws that gave a vexatious claimant a windfall final payment.

         Every member of this House will have files of horror stories in their electorate offices where small business people have recounted to them the usual cost—about $8,000 out of pocket—if someone decides to `go you' for unfair dismissal.

         Just how many businesses are going to be affected by this amendment?

You can imagine a dairy farmer and his wife taking on, for perhaps the first time in their lives, a young person to support them with their milking. They have an unfair dismissal claim brought against them. That $8,000 that should have been going into their own business support pays this person off. In the future, they do not employ another person. They work harder and longer hours in their dairy exercise, trying to make up for the employed staff that they have had to pay the $8,000 for. They are driven further and further, without holiday, without relief on the weekends, because the fear of taking on another person who might yet again take them to the cleaners is just too great.

         The government's small business package is critically important for the growth of regional economies and for Australia as a whole. Manufacturing in the region which I represent in northern Victoria is almost totally dependent on small, local primary industries—industries where the average employed unit is less than five—but, unlike most of the rest of Australia, we continue to have a predominance of local ownership of businesses. We have lots of cooperatives.

         We saw countries like New Zealand revolutionise their meat works sector with enterprise agreements which put ownership largely back into the hands of New Zealand nationals and put abattoirs back into a profit mode. Australia still limps along behind. In Victoria, an abattoir owner was driven out of Dandenong by relentless industrial unrest over years. The workers were pitted against the owner in such a manner that, eventually, he simply walked away. He has now opened up a greenfields site abattoir in my electorate. It is operated in a most highly efficient manner as a totally exporting abattoir with workers whose loyalties are absolutely to the business and who understand that their own futures and their own ability to continue to support their families is dependent on the viability of that business in the long term. They understand that they are in a partnership. It is that sort of worker&amp;hyphen;employer relationship that is the difference between survival and bankruptcy in all economies.

         Australia has a long and proud history of worker advocacy—a history peppered with world firsts: milestones like the eight&amp;hyphen;hour day and the secret ballot, which is called `the Australian ballot' in the US. What this simplified, more flexible system does is recognise the independence and individuality of Australian workers. It gives them a chance to speak for themselves and to work out arrangements that work for them and their employers as they try to deal with one another in a way that ensures that business is sustained and grows.

          —One can but wonder at the reasons for debating this Workplace Relations Amendment Bill in the House today. Are we debating this bill because the government honestly believes it will bring tangible benefits to the small business sector—the constituency it likes to call its own? Or does the necessity for this legislation arise from some base and cynical motive that puts the coalition's interests above those of hundreds of thousands of decent, hardworking Australians—an agenda perhaps driven by the H.R. Nicholls Society?

         All the evidence presented to date would indicate that the latter is the case. Please allow me to explain. There has been much hue and cry over the previous government's unfair dismissal legislation and regulations—in particular, its impact upon employers—ever since the Labor government first addressed this issue back in 1994.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The coalition made no bones during the last federal election campaign that one of the centrepieces of its industrial relations policy would be the rewriting of the unfair dismissal legislation. But the only serious review of the operation of Labor's unfair dismissal legislation showed that the conservatives' hyperbole was simply not supported by the facts. Amongst claims by opponents of the scheme were suggestions that, firstly, the legislation by its nature encouraged too many claims, many of which were not serious and were simply unjustifiable. These led to increased pressure on employers through increased legal costs and time commitments.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second claim that I would like to draw the House's attention to is the fact that Labor's scheme was costing jobs. We had claims like the one from the Executive Director of the Employers Federation of New South Wales, Gary Brack, that anecdotal evidence indicated that the unfair dismissal laws may have dissuaded Australia's small business sector from creating an extra 100,000 to 200,000 jobs. I cannot imagine where he could have pulled that one from.

         The Industrial Relations Court of Australia—unlike Mr Brack—has carried out a thorough investigation of the workings of the unfair dismissal legislation and has provided

         On the basis of the findings detailed in that report, Chief Justice Wilcox was able to claim, during the 1996 election campaign, that Labor's unfair dismissal laws were generally working well and that, rather than employees being to blame, the main problem was the bad conduct and poor human resource management practices of many of the employers who were involved in unfair dismissal cases.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Amongst the 1995&amp;hyphen;96 Industrial Relations Court annual report's findings were that the controversy over the unfair dismissal provisions was fuelled by a degree of deliberate misrepresentation. It found that the Labor government had not successfully explained and justified its laws; hence, public perceptions, according to the court, were able to be unfairly swayed. It also found that in 1994&amp;hyphen;95 only 12 per cent, and in the following year 15.8 per cent, of the finalised cases were resolved either at or after trial. In other words, most of those cases did not even come to trial; they were effectively settled out of court.

         From late 1995 onwards the total number of unfair dismissal applications represented approximately only two per cent of total involuntary terminations—far from the perception that employers actually had a good success rate under the old law.

         The court also found in its report that, contrary to some suggestions, people who win unfair dismissal claims represent a fairly normal cross&amp;hyphen;section of the work force. Finally, it found that, although according to ABS figures 91.7 per cent of employers have fewer than 20 employees, a survey of those employers involved in unfair dismissal showed that only 33 per cent of respondents were small businesses, proving that small businesses are indeed underrepresented in unfair dismissal actions.

         Nevertheless, the coalition had set its course and we saw the unfair dismissal laws undergo extensive amendment as part of the government's Workplace Relations Act. This of course came into effect on 1 January this year. The government has since been falling over itself in attempts to praise its own policies. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business and member for Flinders (Mr Reith) said of the legislation in parliament on 23 May last year:
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         The government is replacing Labor's arrangements with a new unfair dismissal scheme—a system which provides employees with access to a fair and simple process of appeal against dismissal, based on the principle of a fair go all round. It is a scheme that . . . ensures legalism is minimised, while discouraging frivolous and malicious claims . . .
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         Similar sentiments were uttered by the same minister on 21 November last year, when he said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         We have delivered a workable system for dealing with unfair dismissal on the basis of a fair go all round and, in doing so, we have expressed an overwhelming community consensus that the previous . . . system did nothing more than stifle employment growth and create division in the workplace. That was Labor's legacy, and the government has buried it.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         Despite demonstrating that many of the allegations levied against Labor's unfair dismissal regulations were fatuous and clearly without foundation, and despite the government singing the praises of its own recent reforms in this area, it now wishes to exempt small business from the operation of its own unfair dismissal laws because it says that this is necessary to boost employment growth.

        <para first-indent="16">
         If the government, in mounting this argument, is admitting that its Workplace Relations Act has added to the tide of unemployment, then I can see why it would want to exempt small business from it. The evidence to date suggests that changing the unfair dismissal laws has not led to an improvement in employment. Since January this year, when the new laws came into effect, national trend

         Compared to the government's lack of faith in its own legislation, I find myself in the somewhat novel position of counselling it to have a little faith and give its own scheme a chance to operate before it loses confidence in it.

         The government wants to amend the unfair dismissal provisions of the Workplace Relations Bill to make them less exacting on small business—those employing fewer than 15 people—because it thinks present provisions are an impediment to employment in the business sector.

         What this legislation undeniably does is create two classes of workers. We will have an estimated 1.6 million workers in small business who will lose their right to challenge for unfair dismissal and who, in the quite correct words of the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), will be thrown to the wolves. These workers will be compared to around 6.8 million of their colleagues in the non&amp;hyphen;small business sector who do have access to unfair dismissal provisions. The opposition, and in particular the shadow minister for industrial relations, the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan), who is at the table this morning, have clearly demonstrated many cases where dutiful and hardworking Australians would be denied basic justice under the government's proposals.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I can demonstrate many recent examples from the retail industry, for example, where employees in small business have needed to access unfair dismissal procedures. One such

          case involved a 23-year-old employee in a delicatessen section of a supermarket who had been employed for six weeks and was sacked simply because a newer employee had more experience. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said on the John Laws program in January last year:

         With regard to unfair dismissals, at no stage prior to the election did the coalition ever foreshadow that it would exempt small business from unfair dismissal laws.

         Briefly, as well as some of the points I have already detailed, the opposition believes the following key issues. We believe that the proposed exemption to unfair dismissal laws is inconsistent with the recommendations of the Bell report; that the proposal will also add to job insecurity; that the proposal does not distinguish between unfair dismissal claims on the basis of the merits of the case; that the proposal is fundamentally flawed and unfair to small business employees; that the proposal is fundamentally unfair to many decent employers; that the proposal may work as a disincentive to the growth of small businesses; and, finally, I contend that the proposal may encourage the use of artificial employment arrangements.

         It is abundantly clear that the government is not enacting these changes because it is heeding a call from the small business sector.

         Mr Deputy Speaker, allow me to conclude my comments by highlighting a source of pressure which I alluded to in my opening paragraph and which I think is driving the government's agenda on this issue. Michael Warby, the H.R. Nicholls Society board member, said as recently as last Thursday:

          The government's workplace relations reforms, encompassing the Workplace Relations Act and now the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill, were overwhelmingly supported by the people of Australia when this government was elected in March 1996.

This is a commonsense measure that recognises that

They do not have a personnel manager, they do not have a chief of staff or a human resource manager or a proprietor.

This person, who had a formerly successful real estate agency, is now busy and preoccupied with this protracted legal case.

Unfortunately, the environment that the member for Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith has left us with is that small businesses now view taking on staff more as a gamble which could have a costly side effect if it does not pay off. Instead, we should be encouraging small business owners to think, `Business is going well. I need more help to expand. Employing more staff is going to help me.

Work for the dole and now the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill both are examples of how the Labor Party has not learnt its lesson since March 1996.

          —The Workplace Relations Amendment Bill amends the Workplace Relations Act 1996, as has been pointed out, in order to exempt businesses employing no more than 15 workers from the unfair dismissal provisions of that act. These changes do not affect the rights of employees in relation to unlawful as opposed to unfair dismissal, and obviously that is as it should be.

          The former Labor government extended minimum protections to all workers and established that federal laws were dominant over state based systems in regard to the termination of employment. However, a series of regulations amended this cover to allow exemptions for fixed&amp;hyphen;term, casual and probationary employees, and, again, in 1994 further changes were made to exempt employees engaged to perform a specific task and probationary employees whose terms of probation were determined prior to hiring.

          There was nothing new in this. As an employer in the media industry, I had utilised such understandings for many years in the hiring of journalists, camera operators and editors in a highly competitive environment where excellence of product and no room for inefficiency were hallmarks of the news business. That flexibility and workplace arrangement gave me the freedom to review employment after three months, and I must say that only once in 20 years was it necessary to invoke the terms of the out clause in the agreement. That was in a workplace that involved about 15 to 20 workers. So it was a small employer although the company overall was fairly large.

          While the Keating government was trying to accommodate employers who regarded the Industrial Reform Act 1993 as too inflexible, there were other employers in the community going about their business with no difficulties in reaching probationary agreements with their employees. However, there were obvious difficulties for very small businesses which were unable to absorb the inefficiency of a poorly performing employee if that employee dug his or her heels in or where the reasons for termination were obvious but the employee was prepared to exploit every avenue of compensation.

The unfair dismissal laws are not the reason small business is not putting people on. It is those other slugs—indirect and direct taxes—that hit business at every turn. I spoke with a tax expert yesterday, and he said that most small businesses declare only about 50 per cent of their income to survive—not necessarily to avoid their public responsibilities but to survive. They simply cannot afford to put more people on.

It is all those other things that are impacting so heavily on small business that we should be legislating on and dealing with to get small business moving again.

           Let me recount the tale of one employer in a small smash repair business in my electorate. That business, which employs 30 people, was caught by the operation of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992. They paid their compulsory superannuation contribution late, but they paid—as they were asked to by the fund—directly to a fund and not through the voucher system, as required by the act. They thought that by paying the amount, which was about $13,000, late they had met their obligations.

          <para first-indent="16">
           However, they have since found out that the act does not recognise such payments, and they have been forced to pay the same amount to the tax office, as well as interest, a late payment fee and an administration charge. That was $21,000 all up, on top of their original obligation of $13,000. They have been forced to pay more than twice for one innocent oversight. I wrote to the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) seven weeks ago, detailing the plight of this small business, but so far I have received no response.

            What is needed is an amendment to the act so that a small business of this nature is not penalised in such a way. In all innocence these people paid the same superannuation contributions on demand to both the fund and the tax office. They paid twice and, so far, advice to me from the firm's accountants, the super fund and the tax office is that the double payments remain in force and are likely to do so. That is not a very happy group of operators of small business out there in terms of the sorts of promises that were made about helping small business to get back on its feet. How absurd that set of situations is for them. It is little wonder that my constituents are wondering what all the hype about a new deal for small business is.

But small business's frustration—that times are not improving and that both this government and the one before do not understand—is such that many are prepared to embrace a simplistic asking of the questions that bother them, thinking that they are also hearing the answer.

A lot of them have restructured their operations. I remember in particular a shop that sells a lot of stationery in the township of Rockhampton. They have restructured their floor plan. They had about four staff and the husband and wife worked in the place as well so there was a total of six.

Now we need to fix it up for small business to make it operational. This amending legislation is fundamental to the growth of small business and if ever there was an issue to go to the people then this is it.

I want to say to the House that this claim is nonsense and that it is just one more example of the Liberal government dressing up its ideological agenda in the guise of a cure for unemployment.

We were worse than Mexico! That is what the Labor Party gave us. They gave us falling investment levels for 13 years. They gave us falling average weekly earnings resulting in less disposable incomes, which was hurting small business. They gave us the unfair dismissal laws, which Mr Brereton, the member for Kingsford-Smith, introduced. They also gave us unfair levels of provisional tax uplift factor.

         The opposition have no idea of what operating a small business is like. They have a lot of ideas on how to manipulate the system, how to get the union movement into the parliament and they talk about all these great issues, but they have no answers for small business. By contrast, on our side we have a plethora of small business operators. I am one of them.

         I remember my first experience with a union operator. I was a manager of a company in Perth. Unfortunately we retrenched 15 people at that time because of poor economic circumstances in the mid-1980s. I had a union man, he was 65, come into my office, lean all over my desk, belt my desk and say, `You are going to pay, son; you are going to pay.' `Pay what,' I thought. I did not know what he was talking about, but this went on. This particular union operator did not reappear with these workers that were put off. I then negotiated with these workers and my own employers to re&amp;hyphen;employ these people into the company. We were successful enough to get them back in.

You cannot do that when you are in confrontation. You need the empowerment of employees—get them thinking and contributing. It is not this fine line between management and workers anymore; it is an inclusive arrangement. It has to be values driven. The work is quite different: hours are longer, training is much higher and employees are now considered as assets of an organisation or an enterprise, rather than just as the workers. Unfortunately the Labor Party still thinks in the past and still thinks about what used to be. There are new industries now—service industries, finance industries, information systems industries—all involved in this new empowerment of the workplace which the Labor Party still does not quite understand. We need new workplace relations; we need better ways of guiding managers and employees to work together.

They should talk to those who are in it, talk to those who are successful in it, and try to find out how it works and what they think about it. They do not necessarily think about employees all the time, because they are thinking about other things. But, if they had employees to help them, they would readily go out and employ.

           Relations Amendment Bill. The mask is off in this legislation. The Liberal and National parties are reverting to type.

         What this law does is exempt employers who employ under 15 employees from unfair dismissal legislation requirements. There are, in fact, one or two precedents for this. For example, the technological change and redundancy clause that is in most awards as a result of an ACTU case back in the mid-1980s has a similar exemption from requirements for redundancy pay for smaller businesses under 15 employees. There is, though, a substantial difference between the two. There is a difference between providing minimal redundancy pay entitlements which, under the TCR clause, are fairly minimal anyway, and basic human rights—the basic right to have your day in court; to have your situation judged by an independent umpire to determine whether you have been treated fairly, whether your life has been turned upside down and whether your livelihood has been removed unjustly by dismissal by an employer. There is a fundamental difference between the two things.

          opposed to employers who have fewer than 15 employees. What this distinction does is set up an incentive for employers to avoid the reach of the legislation by structuring their organisations in a way that means that they are separate business units, for example, with 12 employees here, 14 there, 10 there, and the like. It will happen, and the people on the other side of the fence will not care. They will not know about it. There will be a larger reach of this legislation than they pretend as a result of people exploiting those loopholes.

We were told that they had removed the negative features of Labor's unfair dismissal laws and that unfair dismissal protection was still available to all employees; there was still a court that people could go to, a forum where they could litigate, if they felt that they had been unjustly dismissed—but there was now a balance.

         I agree with the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) on at least one thing, and that is that not all employers are bad—there are good and bad, as there are in all walks of life—but the problem with issues of this nature is that inevitably the bad drag the good down. If the bad get a competitive advantage out of their behaviour, if they are able to squeeze their employees, mistreat them in various ways so that they can gain a competitive advantage, that puts the good employer on the horns of a dilemma. They have two choices: they can either sit back and watch their competitiveness erode and, ultimately, their livelihood put at stake or they can follow the example of the bad employer. There will always be a mix of responses to that; it is not a hard&amp;hyphen;and&amp;hyphen;fast, black&amp;hyphen;and&amp;hyphen;white situation. Nonetheless, it is a reality.

         This means that, in the final analysis, the number of employers who do behave badly will be a lot greater than the number of those who are intrinsically bad or intrinsically prone to mistreat their employees or dismiss them unfairly.

         One of the other claims that we heard ad nauseam in the debate on these issues in 1995 was that Labor's unfair dismissal laws were destroying jobs. If this were true, the country could thank its lucky stars that the government legislated, because you can imagine what unemployment would be like now if it had not. Look at what has happened to unemployment since the coalition has been in office. Since the coalition has been in office, unemployment has been steadily rising, in spite of the fact that they were handed an economy in fundamentally good shape.

         Consistently in surveys small businesses indicate that the unfair dismissal legislation—and industrial relations regulation generally—is a relatively limited issue.

The most recent Morgan and Banks job survey of over 3,500 businesses indicated that 16 per cent of those surveyed said that an exemption from unfair dismissal laws would be of benefit to them. So 84 per cent are in a sense saying, `We are quite comfortable with a law that provides our employees with a right to an independent umpire if they believe they have been dismissed unfairly.'

         This legislation indicates the real coalition position. As I said at the outset, the mask is off. Their real position is—and this goes back to the beginning of the 19th century—that a contract of employment is the same as a contract to buy a sack of spuds, that there is no difference between human labour and human participation in the process of production as to how it should be treated by the law and the law relating to the sale of a bag of jelly beans. It is a contract and that is it; and it should receive no separate or special status.

         Implicit in that view is that the status, strength and bargaining power of the two parties to a contract is fundamentally equal—the view that the worker's alternative to starve is a real alternative. It is equivalent to my decision today not to buy a packet of chewing gum because I do not feel like it. That is implicit in the conservative position on labour market regulation.

         The member for Cowan, who spoke before me, indicated that there have been fewer claims under the new legislation. I think the figure of 27 per cent fewer claims was quoted elsewhere. There is an obvious response to that. Does that mean that there are 27 per cent fewer instances of employers unfairly dismissing people or does it just mean that there are fewer people making claims? I would suggest to you that it is the latter, that there has been no change in behaviour in the workplace—there are still people being unfairly dismissed—and all that is happening is that a proportion of them are being discouraged or prevented from pursuing claims. That is a victory for employers who unfairly dismiss people. It is not a victory for justice and it is not progress. It is simply a situation of locking out the problem, sweeping it under the carpet and avoiding doing anything about it.

         The fallacy in the conservative position on all of this is the notion that if you make it cheaper and easier for employers to employ people they will. It is the notion of the benevolent employer who has got a bit of loose change. If you say to that employer, `You can employ somebody with that loose change,' they will. Employers do not employ people because they have got a bit of loose money lying around the place. They employ people because they have work for them to do that cannot be done under their existing arrangements. That is why employers employ people. Demand drives employment. Supply&amp;hyphen;side views are fundamentally flawed, and that is the view that drives this legislation—the notion that if you make it easier to employ all these benevolent employers will go out there and suddenly put a whole lot of people on. The predominant thing that drives employment is demand. Therefore, issues of growth and economic activity are fundamental to that.

          There are some very facile comparisons made between Europe and the United States. People say, `Unemployment in the United States is about five per cent whereas in Germany and France it is 11 or 12 per cent; therefore, because you have a less regulated labour market in the US, if you diminish labour market regulation and get rid of minimum wages and awards that will mean more employment.'
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Let us go through the reasons why that is a complete fallacy. Firstly, the experience in Europe is mixed. The Netherlands, for example, has an unemployment rate that is barely higher than that of the US; Denmark's is roughly the same. There are a number of other examples. Secondly, in the case of Britain, which is also highlighted as an example similar to the US, the figures are rorted. Under the conservative government a whole swathe of older men were pushed off unemployment benefits onto other benefits which do not give them an unemployed tag, such as the equivalent of the disability support pension which does not require them to be medically tested. Thirdly, roughly two per cent of the American unemployment problem is in gaol; there is nothing like that equivalent in Europe. Fourthly, illegal immigration complicates the equation, especially in the United States. You have an enormous black economy and an enormous degree of illegal immigration, particularly in certain parts of the US, which make it very hard to get accurate figures. Fifthly, there are other factors involved. One of the key factors contributing to unemployment in Europe,
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           particularly in France and Germany, is overvalued currencies and harsh monetary policy, which has its origins largely in the approach taken by the German government to the reunification issue. These factors tend to be ignored by the Judith Sloans of the world.

          One of the factors that they often run in debate about industry policy in Australia is the misallocation of resources that occurs as a result of intervention and not letting markets decide where investment and resources should go. If there is any merit in that criticism it certainly applies to Europe, with all of the agricultural protection in particular and the underdevelopment of the services industry as a result of a variety of government policies in places like Germany. If you actually take the arguments of the economic rationalists seriously then surely that makes a contribution to additional unemployment in places like Germany.

          The final, outrageous and obscene thing about the Judith Sloan line—the deregulate the lot line—is that even if it is correct that solving unemployment will be the outcome of deregulating the labour market, it still means that the people who will carry the burden and pay the price are the lowest paid, economically and industrially weakest members of our society. Even if it were true—and it is not true—the people who will pay the cost are the weakest, poorest members of the community. They are the ones who are at the bottom of the scale, who are earning the least and who would earn less as a result of her approach, the approach of those who support her and the approach that is harboured by members of the government.

          A point that the government has to come to grips with is that the role of labour in our society is not one&amp;hyphen;dimensional. Labour performs three functions in human activity and society. Obviously it is an input in the process of production, therefore the efficiency of that input is of great importance. That is not the only function of labour yet, according to the economic rationalists of the Judith Sloan school, that is all there is.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          But labour performs two other functions. The second is that it is still the primary means of the distribution of the proceeds of production, and we have an interest not only in it being an efficient input but also in it being a socially efficient and equitable means of distributing the proceeds so that we do not have masses of people with huge rewards and others starving. Its third role is essentially psychological. Most people define themselves by their role in the process of production. It still remains a dominant part of human self&amp;hyphen;esteem, participation in society, acceptance and recognition. All of these are critical factors in people's participation in society. When looking at regulation of labour we have to look at three imperatives, not one. This legislation is an outrage and a disgrace.

          is a consequence of a notice of motion of disallowance debate in the Senate on 26 June 1997 after the government introduced a regulation to give effect to an exclusion for new employees of small business until the employees have given 12 months continuous service. The Democrats and the ALP voted for the disallowance of the regulation made by the government, hence the requirement for this bill now which represents a purer expression of government policy for small business. The purpose of this act is to allow an employer the right not to go through the process of some court action where the employment numbers are below 15 in his or her business.

But even if he is right about the 16 per cent, if we consider the number of employers and businesses throughout Australia who may take on just one more person because they find it more amenable to do so, that would mean tens of thousands of jobs. I doubt, of course, whether his numbers are right.

Whether it is workers compensation, superannuation, occupational health and safety, training, whatever it might be, I would suggest that it is somewhat different from going into a shop and buying a bag of jelly beans, as the member for Melbourne was trying to have us believe.

         The measures that the government has brought into place to endeavour to encourage business—small business, particularly—are dealt with in the context of the financial position that we inherited; I think most Australians understand that. Nevertheless, the job has gone forward. We have the issues of the industrial relations bill that has been negotiated, particularly with the Democrats. We also have the issues of the Bell report. Many of those recommendations have been brought into effect and are continuing to be brought into effect, whether they relate to the fringe benefits tax, the capital gains tax, the rollover, the paperwork, the provisional tax uplift factor, et cetera. That does not mean there is not much to be done. There is still a lot to be done. But in the terms of this government's nearly 18 months in office, I think it is a commendable record.

         I want to turn back to the legislation and to the reasons the ALP brought forward the disallowance of regulations on 26 June 1997. It was said that the employees who have been treated unfairly would be left without any remedy. However, the previous government, the ALP government, which was recently voted out as of March 1996, also had a range of exclusions from its unfair dismissal provisions—casual employees, probationists, et cetera. Remember that you only have to go the first 12 months and after that you would be subject to the conditions of the legislation.

         Another point that the ALP brought forward in the Senate debate was that it is unfair to provide different rights for different classes of employees on the basis of the size of their employer.

Anything that a government can do to remove obstacles should be done. It is not about some theory of ours of sitting in this place having wonderful philosophical debates.

The obvious response is that this does not remove the burden of defence of a claim apart from any order made. You are still left with defending the claim. These things are practical matters. They take time, money and attention away from the job in hand of working a small business.

That is not objectionable, and indeed it is a worthy comment. But the incentive offered in this bill is the incentive of depriving workers of a `fair go all round'.

         The government is trying to restore to small business the ability to sack people by carrying out adjectival tyranny. The fact of the matter is that dismissal is a punitive weapon that strikes right at the heart of a worker's financial survival. It is not only a worker who is affected but also the worker's family. Put dismissal on one side of the equation and on the other the inconvenience that the former speaker mentioned of having to attend a conciliation conference. What a terrible thing! There is a worker and his family on one side, and on the other is the inconvenience of having to spend half an hour at a conciliation conference. There is no equation.

         ABS statistics show that federal unfair dismissal laws are going to affect at best seven per cent of small business employers.

Phillip Morris, Wheeler v. Phillip Morris and the Georgevski case, to name a few. They are legion in the United kingdom and in the United States. They are cases in which damages for breach of contract have been awarded because workers have been wrongfully dismissed.

          the right to impose penalties for breaches of awards, enterprise agreements or Australian workplace agreements. Because the jurisdiction has been referred back to the Federal Court, it has the power to grant injunctive relief, that is, to enjoin an employer from sacking someone unlawfully. So, again, a remedy is already there under section 178 of the act. It is a con to all concerned to say that this is going to quarantine small businesses from actions for wrongful dismissal. What it does is take a simple procedure out of the equation, one in which all parties are afforded a fair go all round.

They will then find out that a simple procedure which allows for conciliation, where the vast majority of claims are resolved, is far more preferable.

So we are talking about less than 16 per cent of seven per cent of employers, that is, small businesses under federal awards. How many jobs are going to be created because of dispelling this unfair dismissal claim anxiety? Not one job.

In the time of the previous government the concept of a fair go all round was something we never heard of, but we have heard a lot of talk about it here today from my friend and colleague the member for Barton (Mr McClelland).

         In the course of my address today I will address a couple of the reasons why there is so much passion on the Labor side of this chamber about this Workplace Relations Amendment Bill before us. It amends various
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          provisions of last year's Workplace Relations Act, essentially to finetune the arrangements that came through and, in a lot of other ways, to try to say to small business in Australia, `Yes, we know the bill mangled by the Senate is not what you want and need in order for you to get on with business and employ more people, so we as a government are responding, to try to make things better for you.'

         This bill also proves the pro&amp;hyphen;worker credentials of the Howard government yet again. We are not anti&amp;hyphen;union but we certainly are pro individual worker. We are about the return to Australian workers of freedom of choice and the right to choose. Let us face it, the original act—which we are amending today—did not go as far as many people in my electorate wanted. They certainly ended up with a compromise, watered down by the Senate alliance of the ALP and the Australian Democrats—the real left wing of Australian politics. Those two parties should stand condemned for the way they have let Australian workers down.

         Nevertheless, substantial progress has been made under the legislation passed last year. The states have certainly played their part with complementary legislation. There is greater flexibility and industrial relations have become more harmonious as a result of promoting the cause of workers ahead of the union movement. 0ver 1,600 new agreements have been ratified—47 directly—between employees and their employers. So we have bosses and workers talking with each other again, without the union bosses interfering. Over 500 Australian workplace agreements have been approved, and the safety net for workers—which people often talk about—is still strongly in place through the no&amp;hyphen;disadvantage test. So a fair go all round is being proved on a daily basis in this country.

         There is still much more to be done. A small business operator told me the other day at Sunnybank in my electorate about how he has workers who regard the concept of the warning letters as a badge of honour. Some of his more militant workers regard the whole system of industrial relations as a big joke; they can do anything they like and, because he is a fairly small business operator, he is

         This is very unfortunate, because I submit that most bosses are essentially very good people. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) made this concession before, as the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) noted, and the honourable member for Barton agreed. Most bosses in this country look at their work force as a responsibility. They need them to work very hard and to work in the comfort of knowing they will be rewarded amply for their efforts. A lot of bosses I have spoken to simply say, `If I have a dozen workers on my staff I have 13 mortgages to worry about.' They worry very much about the lot of their workers.

         This bill before us today is essentially summed up this way: it is a pro&amp;hyphen;small business, pro&amp;hyphen;worker and pro&amp;hyphen;jobs initiative. It discriminates in favour of small business employers with 15 or less workers. It allows greater freedom for managers in small businesses to exercise their prerogative without any great fear of expensive and tedious unfair dismissal proceedings.

         Bosses do not sack good staff. But when they want to exercise their managerial prerogative the system established by the previous government beats them up.

         The reason members opposite are so passionate about the argument they are putting is the bosses of the big unions in Australia do not like it. If this is the case, then of course the members of the Australian Labor Party in this place certainly do not like it, because they are attached like puppets on a string to their union masters. Union bosses and the ALP do not like it because it prevents the unions from getting as a right the subscriptions and therefore the memberships of Australian workers.

The rest of the magazines seem to promote the need to go out and headhunt new members for the union movement.

I guess it means the ACTU obviously has no faith in its own ability to prove on merit to workers in Australia it deserves the membership they would want of their unions. Rather, they want to ensure there are preference clauses existing in certified agreements to give union members an unfair advantage over non&amp;hyphen;union members or, worse still, to discriminate against those workers who rightly demand not to be part of the union.

         I am just left staggered as to how the union movement will respond to the various challenges they face in an environment where workers believe the union movement itself is out of touch. What has the union movement done so far? They have got more out of touch by a process of amalgamation, creating bigger unions and bringing union bosses and hierarchies further away from average workers. This super union concept has simply made matters worse and has confirmed in the minds of so many Australian workers why the union movement is not worth supporting through the form of membership.

         This pro&amp;hyphen;worker government has included in this bill provisions for disamalgamation and for secret ballots initiated by workers themselves through the Federal Court to bring the union back to them and out of the high rise towers and the 7&amp;hyphen;series BMWs like the

In fact, this policy approach by the government means that it will be possible for more unions to be established, not less. Better still, they will be unions responsive to workers needs, and this makes the union bosses even more beholden to the workers. The current approach seems to be the reverse. This bill tidies up matters relating to this disamalgamation process.

         I certainly do support workers' rights to associate, to group together, to form unions. The concept seems very reasonable to me, especially if it is a mechanism to truly protect the weak. However, the organised labour approach in this country has lost the support of most workers because it obviously is a case of the super unions instead manipulating the weak. We have heard scare campaigns conducted in the course of this debate here today. These sorts of scare campaigns are the way the organised labour movement in this country and their puppets in this place decide to promote the need to be in a union.

          —I am just about to conclude my remarks. I certainly am very concerned about matters relating to unfair dismissal, and I have talked about it in the course of my speech here today. The whole area of compulsory unionism, which is also a matter we are discussing and have been discussing in previous contributions today, seems to me to have at its heart, in areas like university campuses in my city of Brisbane, something that needs to be addressed. As far as voluntary student unionism is concerned, it would be a sign to the universities in Queensland that power is back in the hands of the students.

         It would have an effect on the financial base of student unions—it would stop their extensive support of Labor candidates in marginal seats—but, by the same token, I believe quite rightly the only good union is a

          voluntary union. If unions—at the student level, the workplace level and at the national level—are being responsive and doing the sorts of things that workers need them to do, they are going to get the membership they want and, they say, they deserve. That really is what we are talking about here today: freedom for workers, greater flexibility in the workplace, greater rights for small and medium enterprise employers and, hand in hand as a result, greater challenges for the union bosses who are so very much out of touch and who, in so many cases, are represented by people in this place. I commend the bill to the House.

         I have listened very carefully to the debate and to the contributions made by opposition members. The way they go on piously talking about the rights of the workers, about the legislation introduced by the former Labor government, as though somehow it was a paragon of virtue, is absolutely sickening. Madam Deputy Speaker Sullivan, they ought to remember, as you do, that when the Labor Party brought in its reform legislation in 1993 it shifted the pendulum away from the employers to employees resulting in employers, particularly small business proprietors, simply being too afraid to put on extra staff.

         The Labor Party is not known as the friend of small business, yet even it appreciated that the Brereton reforms went too far.

When those opposite come in here today to complain about what we are seeking to do, I believe they are displaying a very great degree of hypocrisy. The Labor Party in

         Members on this side of the House and I suspect members on that side of the House, if they were honest, would have to admit that since the 1993 legislation became law there has been a constant trail of constituents to the doors of members of parliament complaining over the draconian consequences of the Brereton unfair dismissal laws, about the fact that they were simply not prepared to put on extra staff because they were concerned about the consequences if they found an employee was simply unable to do the job. As colleagues on this side have indicated, often an employer does not know how good an employee is until the employee is on staff. Most of us could relate horrendous situations where people who had been on the payroll for a relatively short period have been sacked and there have been very substantial claims made against employers.

We are not seeking to turn the clock back to the last century and we are not trying to deprive workers of a fair go. We are planning to create a balance. We aim to redress the inequities introduced by the Labor Party which remained on the statute books right through until we sought to alleviate them by a regulation.

         The definition of a small business for the purpose of this bill will be an employer employing 15 or fewer employees. For the purpose of counting employees, a casual employee need not be counted unless he or she has been employed on a regular or systemic basis for at least 12 months. The bill does not take away employees' rights to take action against unlawful termination of employment, that is, dismissal for any discriminatory reason such as age or pregnancy or dismissal without minimum notice.

         Small business is the engine room of the Australian economy. It makes an enormous contribution to economic growth and job creation. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be interested to know that there are 927,000 enterprises making up the Australian economy and that 810,000 of those are private, non-agricultural businesses, and that of these 97 per cent are small business. Small business generates one&amp;hyphen;third of the gross domestic product and accounts for 50 per cent of total employment in Australia. It is responsible for almost half of business employment in Australia—that is, 3.6 million jobs. Over the past 10 years employment in the small business sector has been growing at the rate of 3.6 per cent a year, more than twice the national average.

I think it was the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) opposite who said in a media release that, rather than fixing up the unfair dismissals law, the government should be restoring the economy or something to that effect. Everyone knows that when we inherited office in March last year the nation's accounts were in desperate need of repair. We inherited an economy loaded with heavy debts, huge deficits and high levels of unemployment. Interest rates were far too high.

In headline terms, they include the recently passed workplace relations legislation, a successfully implemented budget strategy, inflation rates which compare favourably with our trading neighbours and five reductions in interest rates since our election.

         This is a bill which could ultimately prove destructive for thousands of Australian workers and their families. As the shadow minister for industrial relations, the honourable member for Canberra (Mr McMullan), pointed out in his speech in the second reading debate, the question of unfair dismissal has been surrounded by hysteria and myth making, driven in no small measure by the coalition when in opposition for its own political benefit.

         The coalition's complaints about the unfair dismissal laws were exposed as a load of hot air when it finally came to power. Its so-called new unfair dismissal arrangements bore many similarities to the old laws. As with Labor's laws, the coalition's unfair dismissal provisions contained in its Workplace Relations Act applied to all employers, irrespective of their size. As with Labor's laws, the coalition's unfair dismissal provisions excluded a number of classes of employees, such as those employees serving a probation period. But this did not stop the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) tripping over each other to inform the Australian people of just how many more would benefit now that Labor's unfair dismissal laws had been overthrown. Small business would boom, they said. Jobs would flow. The land of milk and honey was just around the corner:

         As the ABS statistics now show us, since January 1997, when the new unfair dismissal law came into effect, national trend employment growth has continued to fall. In Victoria, trend unemployment has even slipped into negative growth. The recently released Yellow Pages Index shows us that more than 80 per cent of small businesses believe that the economy overall is either in recession or at a standstill. Only eight per cent believe that lower interest rates have really done them any good.

         So out there in the real world the Howard government is not travelling too well. The electorate want jobs, and this government is not creating any.

         As a result, we have this bill which, if passed, will exempt all small businesses from the unfair dismissal provisions in relation to workers employed on or after the commencement of the bill. This means about two million—and I repeat, for the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) opposite, two million workers—now protected against being unfairly dismissed will ultimately lose that protection. Their employment will be far less secure. So two million workers could be placed at the mercy of some—and I say some, not all—shonky operators and dishonourable small business owners who could take advantage. I believe those shonky ones will take advantage of the new laws to exploit their staff.

Only 16 per cent of small business employers believed that they would benefit from the proposal to exempt them from the unfair dismissal laws—only 16 per cent—yet we have a bill like this before the parliament.

If the opinions of small business owners are not enough for the government members, perhaps the cold hard facts as to how many small businesses are actually subjected to unfair dismissal claims will help them realise the futility of their current quest.

          —`It is ridiculous. It is trivial. We do not want to have to be worrying about protecting ourselves from the law at every turn.'

         The decision by the Howard government to partially exempt small businesses with a staff numbering 15 or fewer from the unfair dismissal laws is an important one. It is one that will take Australia a step further down the road of labour market reform. But, if this move is to produce the sort of lasting productivity gains that the coalition claims it will, one has to wonder why it has not been extended across the whole business sector. It is reasonable to wonder, isn't it? After all, the principal act, the Workplace Relations Act, provides for such an extension.

         The explanatory memorandum accompanying the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill makes it clear that it will not have significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure. By the government's own admission, revenue protection is not an issue here. The coalition continually asserts—and rightly so—that small business is the engine room of the economy. In Western Australia, for example, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry has noted that this sector accounts for over 95 per cent of all the state's businesses and more than half of private sector employment.

         Soon after the introduction of the bill which led to the present principal act, the Assistant Director of the Business Council of Australia suggested that a more aggressive overhaul of Australia's labour market was in order. A spokeswoman for the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business has responded that the government was waiting for employees to `avail themselves of the flexibility offered by the current legislation' before seeing whether greater change was necessary. Small business has known about the coalition's commitment to this legislation since 24 March 1997. Despite this unemployment has continued to increase and small business proprietors remain reluctant to engage additional staff. So why not make it easier for the private sector to employ by including all businesses in this exemption?

         As I said at the outset, the government deserves credit for releasing an albeit small proportion of business operators from the onerous and outdated unfair dismissal statute.

         The principal workplace relations policy was supposed to be an `all or nothing' package, you will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker. Instead, the government agreed to a multitude of concessions in its negotiations with who else but the Australian Democrats to facilitate the passage of the legislation through the Senate. It became widely known, and still is, as the Reith-Kernot legislation, and I can understand why. For the minister to have come out of that meeting and present as some great achievement the concessions he made, his appeasement to Senator Kernot, without even having gone to his party room or even his cabinet, I suspect, for approval was one of the great public confidence tricks I have ever seen. But I have digressed.

           Townsville Chamber of Commerce President, Mal Missingham, was quoted in the local media recently as saying that the exemptions would encourage small business to hire new staff, which I think is the central point of the reforms being debated today. This is why I say that this bill is not about sacking people; this bill is about jobs.

           All small business operators from time to time have agonised over the process of taking on a new staff member at one time or another. Taking on a new employee is very much like taking a gamble—how do you really know if you have the right person until you give them a go? That is the dilemma. Small business people do not have the same personnel recruiting resources that bigger businesses have access to. They simply do not, and the ALP opposition and the unions

           Mr James O'Donnell, the North Queensland Secretary of the Federated Clerks Union of Australia, is certainly one person who needs a dose of reality in relation to life as a small business owner. He came up with the ridiculous claim recently that most problems small businesses face in relation to this issue are as a result of poor management, a statement which I think is reflective of the ALP's and the union movement's attitude to small business.

           I have heard many small business operators in Herbert say that they are putting off hiring new staff because they feared the person was not right for the job and they would be sued for unfair dismissal if they tried to replace that person.

          At the last election one of the underlying issues in the electorate in my view was a concern over constant change and a sense of insecurity. When the then Leader of the Opposition, now Prime Minister (Mr Howard), talked about making people comfortable and relaxed, he tapped into that sentiment. People actually want to be more comfortable and confident in their futures. This legislation does not deliver that. This is not an insignificant measure on behalf of the government. This affects over two million workers—a lot of people.

          The government are now saying that the legislation is not working and they like to give us a bit more of a dose. They want to blame it on the Labor government. The current legislation was brought down by the Liberal government, the coalition government. It was drafted by the then Minister for Industrial Relations, it got through the parliament and it was made into law. It was owned by the coalition. You made it, not the Labor Party. Now you say that it is not good enough. The question has to be asked about your confidence in your own competence.

          According to the Minister for Industrial Relations at the time, there would not be so much as a ripple of change to the legislation—no third wave—yet there has been.

It would be nigh on impossible to exercise rights afforded on paper because the employer would never have to answer questions like, `Why did you sack the person?' The employer would be able to

The provisions did, however, exclude a number of classes of employees, including employees serving a probationary period where that was notified and reasonable. The idea of having a notified and reasonable probationary period accords with what small business need and want in order to make their hiring and firing decisions. There could be no impediment to small business hiring and firing workers when they were able to institute a fair and just probationary period with new workers. That was the regime under the previous legislation.

          According to the ABS, the bill affects over two million workers. How does it affect them? We have talked a little about procedural fairness. The bill removes all semblance of procedural fairness for workers. The reason why procedural fairness is required is that workers who have had accusations made about them should have the opportunity of responding to them. It is a fairly commonly accepted and decent proposition, which is not unreasonable or outrageous, that if someone makes an accusation about you, you have the opportunity of responding to it before you lose your income. It does not mean much to members opposite, but for Australian workers—almost half of them—to be denied the opportunity of responding to allegations made about them over misunderstandings and so on that arise from time to time is outrageous.

          The bill removes unfair dismissal provisions but it boasts that it still retains sanctions against unlawful dismissal. That is misleading. It is quite clear that this is code for allowing unscrupulous employers to dismiss workers unfairly. An example is where an employer wants to sack a worker on the basis of their union membership. This would be technically unlawful. However, it would be almost impossible for the worker to bring an action against the employer in this instance.

There is no reasonable explanation outside of that scenario. There is no intellectual, rational or logical support for this legislation. This legislation will not stimulate jobs. It will not stimulate employment opportunities for young people—the last legislation did not. This is simply going to pour petrol on the fire of uncertainty in the population.

         The reason I stand to speak to this bill to amend the Workplace Relations Act is quite simple: it is what the business community in my electorate has demanded. The business organisations I represent are pretty typical of others throughout the nation. My Brisbane electorate is diverse, with many well&amp;hyphen;established suburbs and old, established businesses. There are large areas of new development, with modern shopping centres and small business operators who have joined in this residential growth area. My electorate also has a large area of residential acreage. Most of the people who have chosen this lifestyle have done so because they run a business from their small properties.

         The message I get from the full range of small business operators in my electorate is very loud and clear. They want changes to the Workplace Relations Act, changes that will give them the same rights as their employees, and that is a fair go. There is no chance that I am misreading this message. I have held public meetings, several of which were addressed by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), who regularly visits my electorate. I have attended chamber of commerce meetings and numerous dinners, lunches and breakfasts with all manner of business organisations.

         What must be made clear is that this amendment, while giving some small business operators freedom from the unfair dismissal provisions, does not remove the workers' rights or diminish the workers' powers of legal action if they are treated unfairly by an employer. But it does allow small business operators to run their businesses without being blackmailed. Anyone who says that this has not been happening has not been out and about in the marketplace. Small business operators who need only one or two extra staff members cannot afford to employ a stranger while there is a threat of unaffordable litigation hanging over their heads.

        <para first-indent="16">
         To put it in a nutshell: too many business people are taken to the cleaners by unscrupulous employees who know full well that the business operator has not the funds nor the resources for a legal battle. The small business community in my electorate is hurting and hurting badly. That is a 13&amp;hyphen;year legacy from the other side of this chamber. Business people have made it quite clear that they expected a change in the state of affairs with the change in government. The message I have been given is that, until we give employers some of the rights and freedoms enjoyed by their staff, hiring will continue to remain as difficult as firing.

         It is simplistic to say that there are two sides to every story. We all know there is. But here is one I have been able to observe from close quarters and know to be very true. The employer in question is a widow who has worked six days a week to maintain the business founded by her husband 20 years ago. Her fault as a businesswoman is that she is not ruthless enough. In fact, she is downright motherly. She raised seven children and has the ingrained habit of treating her staff as part of her extended family. She has assisted with loans, supplied company vehicles for private use, pays well over award wages and has always encouraged flexible hours to suit

        <para first-indent="16">
         Two years ago, faced with increasing competition, rising property values and other commercial factors, she was forced to scale down the business by more than 50 per cent. Scaling down this company did not happen overnight. In fact, it took more than a year. The building had to be sold and smaller premises founded. During the many months the building was up for sale, the staff were well aware that five of the eight permanent positions would go in the change. It was clearly understood. Everyone had time off, if needed, when looking for other work. The day came and the business moved to smaller premises with the hope that the change would mean commercial survival.

        <para first-indent="16">
         All this was stressful enough for the businesswoman in question, but nothing compared to what she was about to receive in perfectly legal harassment. The small businesswoman had underestimated the greed factor. In fact, she had not considered any of her staff could or would consider that they had been unfairly dismissed. The closing of the old business and the opening of the new but smaller venture had been a sad parting—the end of an era.

         I am aware of the announcement made by DuPont yesterday afternoon. My immediate reaction was that it was due to the mismanagement of the economy in the Labor Party's day due to your tariff rules and your particular deal. To make sure I was right I sought advice from the department as to exactly what did happen. My department advises me that DuPont took over Fibremakers in June 1990. At that time the Labor government approved a one&amp;hyphen;off taxable grant to DuPont of some $59 million. The grant represented the capitalisation of the company's future bounty reserves for the period to 30 June 1995. The bounty capitalisation agreement was clearly an important

          factor in DuPont's decision to buy Fibremakers.

         At the time, the acting minister for industry—you know who, just back from France; you never know where he is and I have not heard much of him—when he came back said on a national ABC radio program on 11 August `Our industry policy failed.' And no wonder it did. On this day he said, in announcing this decision:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         DuPont will make a considerable new investment yielding a much larger, more export orientated business which will operate in a zero&amp;hyphen;tariff, zero&amp;hyphen;bounty environment.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         You said that; they are your words. As part of the agreement, the company agreed to meet a number of commitments. While most of these have been honoured, some commitments entered into on a best endeavours basis were not—for example, to undertake capital investment of some $7 million by December 1996. In the event, expenditure did not reach that level. The agreement between the government and Fibremakers appears to have ended in 1996. However, in 1991 the Labor government announced that the yarn bounty would phase out in 1995 and would be replaced by a five per cent tariff. So not only did they get the benefit of the capitalisation of the bounty, the $59 million, at the time but later they picked up the five per cent tariff.

         I raise these questions because I noted that the chief executive of the company said that this was all because they were concerned about the outcome of the Productivity Commission and the report, and all these things. He has to understand that the report is not out yet; there is only an interim statement out. The government will respond to that report when it is out and, when they do, that is the government decision that we will stand by. In the meantime, they are acting under your rules—under Labor Party rules, no&amp;hyphen;one else's.

The fact of the matter is that Labor's taxation system was characterised by high taxes on a narrow base with complexity because of a multitude of rates. Under Labor's sales tax system, sales tax rates can apply at 0, 12, 22, 26, 32 and 45 per cent—a multiple rate with complexity for business as business engages in classification to try to determine whether the goods will be taxed at 0, 12, 22, 26, 32 or 45 per cent. This is the system that the Labor Party says should not be improved on. This is the system which the Labor Party refuses to deal with.

The Labor Party policy is this: `The sales tax system is a mess and we know it, but we will not do anything about it because we are going to try and play cheapjack politics in relation to this government's attempts to reform the tax system. But simultaneously with that we have a secret agenda. The secret agenda is yes for services taxes—introduced by the states—along with property and inheritance taxes, because by getting the states to raise the revenue you have an opportunity to cut your own spending in relation to your own budget problems.'

Does the Prime Minister agree that MBF's bid for a compulsory $50 per night co&amp;hyphen;payment for private hospital treatment will do exactly the opposite and force private patients back into public hospitals? Is the Prime Minister aware that the government's own fund, Medibank Private, has today announced that it is also considering introducing a similar fee for its 1.7 million members? As the health minister is very angry but unwilling to act, will you today show leadership and rule out any fund's attempt to introduce a compulsory private hospital co&amp;hyphen;payment, or are you happy for that to go down in history as John Howard's hospital bed tax?

There is little doubt that the gains that we get from trade liberalisation are felt by people who are different from those who are affected by tariff reductions. One of the difficulties is that people who lose their jobs when a factory like Berlei closes are not the people who are the immediate beneficiaries of the export markets that are being won for primary products in the Asia&amp;hyphen;Pacific region.

         In relation to the textile, clothing and footwear industry and the Productivity Commission report, can I simply assure the honourable member—and can I assure people in the industry—that, when the government receives the final report, it will take a speedy decision, as it did with the motor manufacturing industry. And in taking that decision, it will certainly pay very strong regard to the interests of employees in that industry. I regard the closure of factories like Berlei as being not only a tragedy for the employees, a tragedy for the City of Lithgow, but a tragedy for the region.

The findings of the Wood royal commission have indeed shocked this nation. Justice Wood is to be commended for his comprehensive and far-reaching report, which demonstrates the insidious nature of the crime of paedophilia in our community. Disgusting as this practice is, it is important as a nation that we do not lose sight of the fact that 30 per cent of the abuse is by strangers, while 70 per cent of the abuse is by people whom children know and trust—and this seems to me to be the ultimate betrayal of our nation's children.

         We have already commenced a wide range of programs which support parents and abused children, such as the good beginnings program, and that work will continue.

There is no doubt that there is no more important task we have as a nation than to ensure the safety and the protection of our children.

         But I would have to also say that there are still a lot of businesses out there doing things pretty tough. There are some businesses out there today who have done well merely to survive the recession in the early 1990s and interest rates of 24 per cent, 25 per cent and 26 per cent, which they had under Labor.

But we do, as I say, acknowledge that things are patchy for some. But, at the same time, I think we should also recognise this because it should give small business generally a sense of confidence about the possibilities in the future.

There are a number of so-called prime concerns defined by the survey for small business. They are mainly in the sales cash flow areas, although the biggest prime concern in that category was none—a view held by 27 per cent.

          The key point I want to make is that we have to engender confidence out there amongst consumers. I think that is happening; I think it is slowly improving. Many small businesses that I speak to see that and see the prospects for that. That is reported in this particular survey.

           What the Labor Party could do to boost small business is to support the government on a couple of key measures. They ought to be putting through the unfair dismissal provisions and they ought to be giving us a decent run in the Senate in respect of capital gains tax. Someone said to me the other day that that is a benefit you get only when you retire. But the truth of the matter is that successful small businesses are making gains to their business every day. Under Labor's policy, every day you have the capital gains tax sitting there to penalise them for their efforts. If you want to talk about small business, why don't you actually get up and do something for small business by supporting our policies?

          —I thank the honourable member for his question. I do have information on margins relating to bank lending. The recent bulletin of the Reserve Bank of Australia comments on recent cuts in official interest rates and recent cuts in home mortgage lending. It notes, of course, that home mortgage lending in Australia now is the lowest it has been since the 1960s. When this government was elected, the standard variable mortgage was 10.5 per cent. Now you can get one for 6.5 per cent. That is a saving to the average Australian home buyer of nearly $4,000 a year, which is after&amp;hyphen;tax money.

          Part of that has been a reduction in official interest rates, which have been cut five times during the period of this government's term. The Reserve Bank notes that, in addition, there have been competition induced cuts in mortgage lending—2.5 per cent in official rates but nearly four per cent in relation to the standard variable mortgage.

          The Reserve Bank notes in its bulletin that competition in the housing loan market in Australia has produced spreads against funding costs which are slim by historical standards and in line with those in other comparable countries. We have always had fat margins on the home lending rate in Australia. But, as a result of new entrants and new competition, those margins have been reduced to slim by historical standards and in line with those in other comparable countries.

          This has been one of the great successes of new competition in the finance industry. It is hand in glove with measures to open up the cheques system to credit unions and building societies. It is part of this government's effort to increase the competition for small business in relation to lending. It is part of this government's responsible fiscal policy which has given the benefits in relation to low interest rates.

In addition to that, there has been an extensive advertising campaign, in print and on television, inviting all Australians to reserve the public document.

They will receive one free share for every four that they purchase.

         Further, the public share offer is on track to occur this year. It is hoped that one&amp;hyphen;third of the Telstra shares will be available later in the year.

          —I thank the member for Groom for his question. The Australian government has taken immediate steps to engage the new Papua New Guinea government through my visit to Papua New Guinea on 24 and 25 August. This was the second visit I have made to Papua New Guinea this year and the third in my time as foreign minister. It was, of course, with the election
          <break page="7087" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           of a new government in Papua New Guinea, timely to develop a close working relationship with that government. During my visit I had extensive discussions with the new Prime Minister, Mr Skate, the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Haiveta, foreign minister Genia and a number of other senior ministers. We discussed a wide range of issues, including our development assistance program, the trade relationship between the two countries and the defence cooperation program.

         To get to the specifics of the honourable member's question, needless to say there were extensive discussions about the tragic and long running conflict on Bougainville. Ever since this government has been in office we have been determined to make a contribution to try to resolve that problem—as, to be fair, I think the previous government did, as well. It is our judgment that the end of the Sandline crisis has presented an important window of opportunity to promote the peace process. As a first step in the process, the Australian government funded talks between the Bougainville Revolutionary Army, the Bougainville Interim Government and the Bougainville Transitional Government in Honiara some weeks ago. Subsequent to those talks, discussions were held amongst all the Bougainville parties in Burnham, New Zealand. The New Zealand foreign minister, Don McKinnon, and I have been working very closely together to ensure that both our countries are able to contribute constructively to the Bougainville peace process. The cooperation between Australia and New Zealand on this issue is a very important component of how we are taking the issue forward.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Importantly, both Australia and New Zealand believe that it is not possible for us to promote a blueprint for the resolution of the Bougainville problem. The solution to this problem has to be worked out by Papua New Guineans themselves, including Bougainvilleans. What we can do is facilitate the process, and both our countries in a very coordinated way are usefully doing that. The next round of talks between the Bougainville parties and officials from the Papua New Guinea government, which will take place next month, will be in New Zealand. We will,
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          of course, help with the transport arrangements for the delegates to those talks. There will be a subsequent round of talks, I hope, in October and again we will be involved in the transportation of delegates to those talks. The important point for the House to understand is that it is not going to be constructive for the Australian government, or for that matter the New Zealand government, or both of us, to try to impose a blueprint on Bougainvilleans and more broadly the people of Papua New Guinea. That will be rejected. It is important that we facilitate the process.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let me conclude by saying that one of the truly most constructive things Australia can do is assist with the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Bougainville. The people of Bougainville need to understand that there is a peace dividend. If they choose the path of peace then their island will be assisted with reconstruction. The Australian government is going to provide over the next five years some $100 million to assist with the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Bougainville. I am very strongly of the view that that is a very valuable contribution Australia is making to the Bougainville peace process.

         I know that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is very familiar with this issue. He will know only too well that there have been moments when it has looked as though the Bougainville peace process was going to take off—in Cairns, in Arawa and on board the New Zealand warship the

         </emphasis>
         . Tragically these moments when it looked as though there was going to be a breakthrough foundered for one reason or another. There is no value in going back over the history of that. It is the Australian government's view that this now represents a real opportunity to take the peace process forward. We have been disappointed in the past. We can only hope that this time, on behalf of all the people of Bougainville and the countries of our region, this peace process can at last be truly successful.

In the bush, one of the things that they wanted cleaned up, in common with the rest of the country, when we won government was the nation's books, and we have made a lot of progress there. We have set about the task of restoring fiscal balance and, as the Treasurer has indicated even in this place today, we are on target for a surplus next year, which represents a massive turnaround in fiscal performance and one that I believe needs to be widely recognised across the Australian community.

         Of particular interest to me and, I am sure, to everyone in this House is that ABARE have done some work: they have studied the flow&amp;hyphen;on impact of the narrowing of the interest rate differential, which was so much a feature of Labor's economic management, between Australia and the major world economies. Reducing that impact, of course, reduces incentive for speculative short&amp;hyphen;term investment from overseas. ABARE have estimated that every one per cent cut to interest rates leads to a devaluation of the Australian dollar of about 1&amp;half; per cent in the first year, and the result of that—every one per cent drop in interest rates when combined with the related exchange rate effects—is estimated to potentially boost farm cash income by around $2,500.

          —by leave—The United Kingdom and the United States are, as honourable members are aware, two of Australia's strongest and most important political and economic partners. Our relationships with both countries are founded in our shared histories and traditions, our common values and aspirations and the strong personal links between our societies.

         One of the principal messages of my visit was that my government intended to build on this shared history and shared values in looking ahead and creating modern and dynamic partnerships which meet Australia's contemporary needs and interests. The United States is the largest investor in Australia and the United Kingdom the second largest. The United Kingdom invests more in manufacturing in Australia than any other foreign investor, and so is a very important source of employment in this country.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is not a one&amp;hyphen;way street either. Australia is rivalling France and Germany for third place amongst foreign investors in Britain. Australian investment in the United States is 40 per cent of the US's investment in Australia—a very large figure indeed when you consider the difference in the size of our economies.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have substantial trading relationships with both countries. Our alliance with the United States is vital to Australia's stability and the security of our region. We have close and valuable defence ties with the United Kingdom.

         It was therefore timely to visit the United Kingdom early in the life of the new government led by Mr Blair. He of course is no stranger to Australia, and I invited him to visit us again in his new capacity. It was also

         May I place on record how unapologetically proud I was to visit the Australian cricket team at the beginning of the second Test at Lords. I say without any apology or qualification that I think it is the solemn responsibility of any Australian Prime Minister overseas to give vocal, open and unreserved support to Australia's great national sporting teams. I think most Australians, whatever their political views, would strongly support that. In fact, our fortunes turned around after I arrived in the United Kingdom. I might say that I went to the eve of Test dinner in London and I was surrounded by all these gloating Englishmen in the wake of having won the one&amp;hyphen;day series and the first Test. I was very pleased to see that magnificent performance by Glenn McGrath and, all the sort of carping nonsense back here notwithstanding, I think most Australians support that kind of approach by their Prime Minister, whether he is Bob Hawke or John Howard.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I had a very valuable round of discussions with Mr Blair and leading members of his government, including the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Prescott, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Defence Secretary, the Foreign Secretary and the Home Secretary. I was pleased to find that they share my conviction of the growing strength and relevance of the relationship into the 21st century between Australia and the United Kingdom.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I was in fact struck by how much there is in common between my government and Mr Blair's on the challenges faced by our societies—especially the issues of unemployment and the role of welfare—and the need to address those challenges, not with ideological prescriptions but by looking for practical ways to achieve results. I was particularly interested to hear about the welfare to work proposals of the new government and Mr Blair's views on changing attitudes in modern societies towards welfare, and how they married with much of our thinking.

         Both with the United Kingdom government and in my meetings with leaders of the United Kingdom business community, I was able to set out first&amp;hyphen;hand the strength of the Austral

         During a visit to the Hawk aircraft assembly line in Warton in the north of England, I announced the then imminent signature of the contract for the lead&amp;hyphen;in fighter for the Royal Australian Air Force—a significant boost for the Newcastle area both in terms of the jobs and the leading edge technology it will bring.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I pointed out in my meetings that Australia's integration into the Asia&amp;hyphen;Pacific region and the United Kingdom's with Europe were making our bilateral links more relevant and valuable—rather than the reverse, as some might think. No two countries in their respective regions have closer relationships or a better understanding of each other than Australia and the United Kingdom. The benefits are becoming more evident in the number of British companies locating their regional headquarters in Australia and using Australian skills and expertise to expand their business in the Asia&amp;hyphen;Pacific region.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Australia and the United Kingdom hold different positions on climate change, which is not surprising given the differences in the structures of our economies. I made clear to the British Prime Minister and his government that Australia was prepared to play her part in tackling greenhouse gas emissions. But we will not be party to a legally binding uniform target which no&amp;hyphen;one honestly expects will be achieved, which is discriminatory in its economic consequences and which does not make an effective contribution to improving the world's environment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A continuing irritant in our bilateral relations is the UK government's refusal to index pensions for UK residents in Australia. Mr Blair and I agreed that as a first step officials would reach an understanding on the actual costs involved—lack of agreement on this has so far obstructed sensible discussion of the issue.

          My visit to the United States was an opportunity to build on the success of President Clinton's visit to Australia last year. I met a wide range of key figures in his administration, Congress and the business community in New York. My meetings left me in no doubt about the strength of the US alliance with Australia and the value that Australia and the United States place on it.

          Our shared strategic and economic interests in the Asia Pacific region meant that the future of our region was an important focus of my discussions in Washington and New York. The other was my message that under my government's reform program the Australian economy was creating new opportunities for US businesses to use Australia as a base for operations in Asia.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I emphasised the vital importance of continued US engagement in the region. The interests of Australia, the United States and the region are all served by the United States continuing to make a strong contribution to the stability and economic growth of the region.

          I was reassured by my discussions with President Clinton and others in his administration of the continuing commitment of the United States to exercising its leadership, economic power and strategic influence to help ensure the region's stability and prosperity into the next century.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is a tribute to the role Australia plays in the region that President Clinton and members of his administration and Congress want to know what Australia thinks of developments in the region and to discuss ways in which we can extend our cooperation there.

         <para first-indent="16">
          While sharing fundamental objectives, Australia's specific geography and interests means that she has a different perspective on the region from the United States—and that makes our views ever more useful.

           In a major speech to the Foreign Policy Association I set out Australia's views on the important changes taking place in the region and how we should respond to them. The opening up and modernising of economies and societies in the region are bringing immense benefits for the countries of the region and their peoples. It is in our interests to reinforce these trends and to encourage the integration of regional economies into the world economy rather than lecture them about their shortcomings.

           For example, it is in the interests of Australia, the United States and the region that we maintain broad and balanced relationships with Indonesia within which differences, for example on human rights, can be handled productively.

          <para first-indent="16">
           The government and the Clinton administration agree on the importance of integrating China into the region. We agree also on the importance of APEC's role in sustaining the growth of regional economies by freeing up trade and investment. We are keen to see APEC's momentum maintained under the Canadian chairmanship at Vancouver.

           An active and credible ANZUS alliance is an important part of the contribution we both make to the region. I was pleased to highlight that with an invitation to the Seventh Fleet to visit Australia in the year 2000.

          <para first-indent="16">
           The Australian and US positions on climate change are not the same—but we share a desire for a realistic and equitable outcome of the Kyoto meeting. President Clinton acknowledged the need for flexibility in order to achieve that and we agreed on the need to find a way of involving the developing countries effectively in the process.

           New York, as honourable members would know, is the place where perhaps the toughest bottom lines in the world are drawn about economic performance.

            —Hang on. Recently it has gone further. It has now dropped to 25 points, which is one tenth of the yield spread between United States and Australian treasury bonds. In other words, the hardest heads in the financial world have given a ringing endorsement to the financial policies of my government. It is a ringing endorsement of the extent to which in the past 17 months we have, despite the carping, negative obstructive criticism of the Australian Labor Party, been able to repair the fundamentals of the economy. That shrinkage means lower costs, higher living standards, more investment, more jobs and more opportunities for Australia. It is the bottom line of the hard-headed judgments of the rest of the world, and they are the sorts of experiences and achievements that really matter and make me immensely proud of what my government has achieved.

           I was interested to hear from the US administration and business their views on how the US economy's impressive rate of job creation has been achieved. While I heard a range of ideas, there was consensus on the importance of labour market flexibility. I came away convinced that sensible reforms of the kind we have undertaken—to achieve greater labour market flexibility, to remove the obstacles to job creation and to address welfare and taxation disincentives against work—are critical if we are to improve employment prospects in this country.

         The simple fact of the matter is that this performance was a total disaster. It is not that we object to you going to the cricket, Prime Minister; we have no problems with you going to the cricket. The problem is sustaining an entire trip around that; a trip which, as a result of that, was completely ill&amp;hyphen;timed and ill&amp;hyphen;placed. The Prime Minister left Australia when parliament was sitting; he had a ministerial crisis on his hands, with Geoff Prosser's conflict of interest; and he had a visit to Newcastle pending to discuss the BHP plant closure.

        <para first-indent="16">
         But the problem was not so much what he neglected here; it was what he neglected at the other end. This is what he missed as a result of the timing that he managed to put in place for his visit: the Prime Minister did not attend the Hong Kong handover and the Prime Minister visited Britain at a time when the new British Prime Minister could see him only for the briefest of time, 45 minutes. But he managed to visit Baroness Thatcher, coincidentally at the same time as the Earth Summit was convened in New York. With the views that he had expressed on the question of greenhouse gas emissions and its impact on Australia, and given that he was in the northern hemisphere, one Concorde flight away from New York—eight hours away—this was a test of the sincerity of his beliefs and the extent to which this is an issue of significance to Australia. He was not there.

         Indeed, what happened to the Prime Minister was that he went through the humiliation of receiving the British Foreign Secretary back in the United Kingdom after he had been there. In other words, the British Foreign Secretary straddled the Prime Minister's visit in the United Kingdom. And, just after the British Foreign Secretary had, to my mind, quite unjustifiably attacked the Australian government, the Prime Minister was in the humiliating position of giving him a cheerio as he came home.

          To give succour to the workers of Newcastle and to try to establish some point to this particular visit of his, the Prime Minister announced a matter in relation to Newcastle, a British Aerospace investment that had been announced previously—seven months earlier. And to add insult to the injury of the workers in Newcastle, he tried to maintain that this was something new. They were grating their teeth, Prime Minister. We could hear them from here, even if you could not hear them in the UK where you were when you went through that particular exercise.

          As it happens, I made much the same trip as the Prime Minister a little while later; not to the United States but I made it to the United Kingdom. I also went to Singapore and the Middle East after I had visited Newcastle on two or three occasions. The point of my visit was manyfold and many faceted but part of it was to sweep up; part of it was to clean up on the things that the Prime Minister had promised to do and did not do; and part of it was to actually sell a genuine impression of Australia's wares and correct any poor impressions that had been left by the Prime Minister in places as diverse as the Menzies Centre and the offices of the various British ministers that he had managed to see, with sections of the British media and, above all, with the British public generally when we got down to talking about some of the matters of concern to Australia.

They are out of your particular proposition.

           I also took the opportunity both there and in Singapore to do what the Prime Minister said he would do; undo the damage that has been created by false impressions, in his mind, of the government responses to the agenda of the Hanson One Nation party. He said here he would do it; he did not do it there. I was obliged to do it there. In Singapore, in particular, I took the time to go through Australia's great record on race and our great record on engagement with the regions. The fact that when we have had errors in our stance, be it in relation to the White Australia policy, be it in relation to the Aboriginal people, it has been Australians who have identified that and Australians who have dealt with the problem.

           I also pointed out to Singapore what Australia's contribution had been to the region since World War II—the enormous support given to the national aspirations of the Asian people by the post&amp;hyphen;war government in 1945, the generous support given by Australian governments through things like the Colombo Plan, our decision in 1967 to give the Asian people a part of Australia's future by changing the White Australia policy and bringing them in, and emphasising to them the fact that historical injustices to the Aboriginal people from 1967 on were being addressed by this nation.

           I also chose to sell other features of Australia's wares. But I tell you something that was most interesting to me in my lengthy conversations with a very large number of British cabinet ministers: the very great interest they expressed in the programs that we had put in place in the time that we were in government.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           There is no more inaccurate part of this tiny little report of the Prime Minister than his attempt to wrap himself in Tony Blair's welfare&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;work program. As they discussed the details of the implementation of our program with me, it was increasingly evident—as a new MP, Sir Lenox Hewitt's daughter, has revealed here in Australia—that it was modelled exactly, not marginally or tangentially, on the programs that we had put in place that were annihilated by the Liberal Party when they came into office. The difference was this: ours was welfare to work; yours is punishment for being out of work. There is a major material difference in the motivation that underpins those particular propositions. It is one thing when it is compulsion associated with punishment but it is another thing when it is compulsion related to reciprocal obligation.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           If anything, I would have to say that there was one difference. Tony Blair's program was not quite as hard on those who did not take up the opportunity as ours was. He was a little bit more generous to the unemployed in the United Kingdom—or he is about to be a little bit more generous—than we were in terms of whether or not they would actually be pushed off the dole if they did not take up the opportunity. So it was a slightly softer version—and I am not going to exaggerate this—of the Working Nation program reciprocal obligation that we had put in place. So we can dismiss completely the Prime Minister's notion that, in any practical terms, there is

           What the Prime Minister would have noticed, I am sure, while he was away—which is part of the reason why he decided when he talked about the American trip that he would refer to what he sees as the contemporary state of the Australian economy—is that there is now not a single commentator left in this country who believes that his budget strategy was right. The final surrender came last Monday, when Alan Wood—and he was the last one—finally came out and said that you have over&amp;hyphen;corrected. Any sense of depression in the community or any sense of a lack of confidence, frankly, Prime Minister, was not there when you came into office. It is there now, directly as a result of mistaken decisions by you in the way in which you have managed the economy. And there is not a single economic commentator left in this country who says anything different about it.

The last thing any of us want is another round of bureaucratic nonsense where the same old people swap the same old tired opinions about illegal drugs. That is one of the dangers of the Prime Minister's recently announced departmental task force. How many studies do we need to tell us that the system is broken and that it needs fixing?

That is why I have invited him, over and over again to come to Cabramatta and Fairfield with me. But to no avail.

         This is a problem of enormous complexity, a problem that goes back decades. It is a problem that no other nation in the world has managed to tackle and achieve some major success with. Also, it is a problem that is not going to go away. We are going to tackle this problem in a way that reflects the complexity of the issues that are involved. These issues include health, law enforcement, demand and supply, education, treatment, substance substitution, taxation issues, youth and ethnic issues, regional priorities—and, of course, there is the debate about how best to spend the funding available to achieve the greatest effect.

         Yes, throughout the federal government sphere, unfortunately, by necessity, there has been a reduction in government spending. The opposition in particular should know why we have had to cut back. It is because of their absolute mismanagement of the economy over some 13 years. As a result of that mismanagement, tragically, we cannot, and we could not, simply add more dollars to every different government department's finances.

         But to suggest that this government actually cut the Australian Federal Police budget by $37.6 million means either a deliberate intent to misinform or that the member does not have very good arithmetic. Let me give you the figures. In the Australian Federal Police budget, from 1996 to 1997, we have had a five per cent cut or reduction amounting to $8.583 million—a five per cent reduction. Now keep that figure in your head, the member for Prospect.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In 1996-97 the Australian Federal Police contributed savings equal to $6.191 million of the 1995-96 budget. That is a total cut of $14.77 million, not $37.6 million, as claimed by the member for Prospect. So I am just not sure what sort of creative accounting or arithmetic has gone on there.

          But the actual numbers are irrelevant. The significant thing is that this government understands that the dollars that are to be spent on the drug problem have to be spent in areas that are going to make a difference. So the government has in fact commissioned a review of the financial practices of the Australian Federal Police, which will provide a solid foundation for future resource considerations and it will assist in overcoming the problems associated with their financial management problems experienced this financial year. We are going to the core of the problem to assist them to better spend the dollars they have.

          The Attorney-General has consistently sought to encourage a more strategic and cooperative approach between the Australian Federal Police and its state and territory partners and also through the strategic alliance of the National Crime Authority. No one-off national drug summit will go near to addressing any of those sorts of issues, let me assure you. The effectiveness of the Australian law enforcement agencies is increasingly being enhanced by all agencies taking a cooperative approach and a more strategic focus in the use of law enforcement resources. We could talk about it for two days in Canberra, but that is no substitute for on the ground action.

More recently, in Victoria a joint operation of the Australian Customs Service resulted in federal agencies seizing that state's largest haul of 32 kilograms of heroin, thereby dismantling another major criminal enterprise.

          The second point that the member for Prospect raised was that we have failed to provide adequate customs services. Along with her total miscalculation on the Australian Federal Police budget cuts we have to report that the customs resources specifically devoted to anti-drug efforts have not been reduced during the time of general budget expenditure reductions. Of course, those reductions by other government departments, as I said before, were forced on us by a profligate opposition. The opposition's efforts when they were in government meant that we had to face cutbacks in so many of our departments.

          The reductions in expenditure that the honourable member for Prospect referred to were part of the government's overall budget strategy and have not and will not affect the capacity of customs to do its job.

We are training them and they are now able to do the job better.

         We have a national problem, and that highlights the lack of leadership we have in this country today. We have a Prime Minister who adopts the ostrich line of sticking his head in the sand and pretending everything is all right, only lifting his head for the ultra right&amp;hyphen;wing utterances of some members of the press and people involved in talkback radio in Sydney, advising him what to do on the drug issue—and, indeed, any issue.

         I agree with the member for Prospect that, to bring new thinking into the drug situation in this country, the holding of a summit is absolutely essential. I will refer back to Cabramatta because I only have 10 minutes to try to get my point across. I congratulated the New South Wales police force on the introduction of plain clothes police to assist in the detection of drugs in the Cabramatta area, but you do not need to be a Rhodes scholar to work out that you cannot use plain clothes police all the time. They have a very short lifespan as a result of being recognised, so you have to keep moving them all the time. When seven or eight of them have operated for a weekend in a place like Cabramatta, making arrests and doing a very good job, that is the end of the day. It gets around all the pimps in the Cabramatta area and all the many drug addicts. They memorise the faces of all the plain clothes police. Bingo! They move down the road to the next suburb. So they have to wait. The introduction of plain clothes police is only a stopgap in the detection of the drug dealers, who are the people we are after.

         I will wind up with the statement that I completely agree with the member for Prospect's matter of public importance that only a summit can work out which procedures should be put in place to solve this insidious practice which is affecting countless families. I disagree with the member for Murray, well meaning as she may well be. We have not said it is the answer, but unless we meet with all the national agencies of this country we will never know what other procedures we should be using.

Of course, we all have similar stories and we all have similar stories in our own constituencies. The community obviously was split on heroin trials. Carr, from your political persuasion, was against it; Kennett was for it. Even in the ACT Kate Carnell was obviously a great advocate of it, and she had legitimate reasons. But, even within her own party, the whip, Harold Hyde, was against it.

         Today we are talking about drugs, not just heroin, and noting that we have to break down the argument into legal and illicit drugs. I note that the illicit drug industry is about a $2 billion industry in this country. The total cost of Australian drug usage, including alcohol and tobacco, is around $23 billion. As was recently pointed out by Brendan Nelson, who addressed the John Stuart Mill Society recently, the real culprit is heroin, which robs people of life at such a young age.

        <para first-indent="16">
         As was pointed out by the member for Murray, there are a number of law enforcement agencies attacking this problem. It is rather opportunistic, of course, that the ALP have chosen Customs and the AFP here today. In 1992 over $500 million was spent on drug enforcement. This included expenditure on the NCA, the state police, our courts and our prisons. It is much higher today. I do believe you are politicising this issue.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The AFP, as I mentioned, is just one law enforcement agency. Much has been advocated today by the two opposition speakers about this figure of $37.6 million. Even the figure that Chris Eaton, the Secretary of the AFPA, quoted, which has been discredited, was $26 million. So it is substantially different even to your figure of $36 million. The fact is that the AFP has had a reduction of $7 million last year and $7 million this year, resulting in a five per cent reduction in its budget deficit. The AFP Commissioner, Mick Palmer, has said that a more strategic approach is needed to deploy resources and to set priorities. And enormous resources have been and should be
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          poured into detection, particularly on our coastlines, and into offshore intelligence, whether it be in Burma or the Golden Triangle.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         No&amp;hyphen;one disputes that we have a problem with policing drugs. But the very fact that we have over 37,000 kilometres of coastline is challenging. Customs and all policing authorities should be congratulated on their efforts. Indeed, Coastwatch has over 800 fixed&amp;hyphen;wing aircraft and a number of helicopters. Enormous resources are put in by the Royal Australian Navy, in both patrol boats and over 250 hours of Orion aircraft flying time. Matching this is our Customs fleet, which has six vessels. It is this government which is upgrading the fleet to include another eight Customs vessels, dovetailed with increased expenditure on technology of $26 million for closed&amp;hyphen;circuit TVs at ports and increased dog detection teams. In the last two years there have been over 3,000 seizures through the use of dogs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What is interesting, though, is that part of the defence of the opposition, who have brought on this MPI, is the assertion that the AFP is doing a lesser job this year than it was under the previous ALP government. Let us look at some of these figures. With heroin in particular there were 47 seizures in 1995&amp;hyphen;96 compared with 62 in 1996&amp;hyphen;97, after of course we inherited the ALP budget deficit and a number of expenditure reductions across all portfolios. So there were more seizures. What is even more interesting is that, by weight, in the year of the dying days of the ALP government, 64.3 kilograms of heroin were detected compared with 174 in the last year, 1996&amp;hyphen;97.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Even in this financial year, of which only two months have passed, over 81 kilograms have been detected and apprehended. So in two months of this financial year we have seized 30 per cent more heroin than two years ago. This highlights the myth the ALP is pushing. We have a lot further to go—no&amp;hyphen;one is disputing that—but let us not discredit the AFP, which they so conveniently use here today.

          no higher. Indeed, 100 per cent checks tend to produce worse results than a targeted approach and the increasing sophistication of concealment methods frequently requires destructive examination of imported goods. We have good links with Customs services, with the AFP and with the NCA. Obviously our key, though, is to get into the poppy growing fields of Burma, the largest source of the heroin that is smuggled into our country. Even Chris Eaton, who I have no doubt would be a supporter of the Australian Labor Party, said that if Australia were serious about this national problem we would get into that area of Burma to solve the drug problem in our own back garden.

That could have been solved by the events that happened two weeks subsequent happening earlier, but that is not the point. What we really want to get to is a full and frank discussion of the recommendations. As I read the picture, there are certain people on the front bench of the government who disagree with what the backbench is saying to them.

That will require that it does not become the fifth committee report on any agenda that is circulated for the Main Committee.

          was to be succinct, but I do not want to be uncharitable. I want to reassure him that the order in which these matters are being referred to the committee has no mischief about it at all; it is entirely chronological. There has been some negotiation both with the parliamentary liaison officer and with the opposition on this matter. Most of those matters preceding the concerns that he distinctly has are matters that will be dealt with very quickly. The only reason they appear in the list as they do is chronological, which would seem to me, short of being alphabetical, to be fundamentally fair.

          —As I was on my feet and speaking to the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill prior to question time, I would like to conclude my remarks. I had just completed giving an example to the House of a business in my electorate that had suffered badly because of the problems of the unfair dismissal laws of the previous government. As a result, the mood in the marketplace is a very sour one. There is no longer a feeling of mutual trust between employer and employee. The previous government legislated that trust out of existence. There will always be inequities in the system. Protecting the worker must be paramount, but so too must the protection of the small business operator from a system currently stacked against them. There is no denying that the unfair dismissal provisions allow those who blatantly choose not to work to remain holding a paid position in the full and comfortable knowledge that they cannot be fired. Therefore, small business operators cannot take the risk of employing strangers.

         The businesswoman I have just spoken about has vowed never to employ permanent staff again and is considering closing down her business altogether. This is not the only horror story that I have on my files. There is one which involves theft and fraud of more than $200,000 worth of stock. The culprits, realising investigations were under way, took stress leave, forcing their employer to pay them while they laid low and covered their tracks. Again, the cost of continued investigation, legal action and the expectant unfair dismissal case forced the small business operator to simply drop the matter. The crooked employees resigned, taking every dollar of their entitlements without batting an eyelid. I have a community of small business operators who feel helpless and are looking to this government to give them the right and
         <break page="7113" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          freedom to run their businesses without the fear of being sued into bankruptcy. This amendment will give both workers and employers the chance to enjoy long-term job creation and security.

        <para first-indent="16">
         What we must do is protect the honest employer, the one who is now too frighted to employ a person who walks in off the street or comes in from the CES. These job seekers come loaded with such lethal legal baggage that no small business operator can afford to take them on.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When I look at this bill and what it offers to the business community, I can only presume that the opposition, assisted by the Democrats, is opposing it purely for political reasons. Are the opposition and the Democrats motivated by the desire to see high unemployment figures so they can tell the public that we are not doing our job? If they truly believed in giving small business the incentive to employ people, they would welcome this bill with open arms. The move by the ALP and the Democrats to block this amendment in the Senate is blatantly politically motivated and they should be totally ashamed of their actions.

         The unions, of course, are against any change that might lessen their power over the thousands of workers who, whether they want to or not, are forced to abide by their rules. We have been going backwards in industrial relations for the past decade, but the union&amp;hyphen;driven Labor Party cannot be seen to change its spots and endorse anything that would give employers the right to hire and fire. This attitude is not only outdated and outmoded, it is unfair to both the employers and the employees. The unions have never been big fans of the principles of freedom of choice and freedom of association.

         We must remove the facility for those who have abused the system to the extent that the small business operators cannot afford to employ permanent staff. The message I am getting from my electorate is that this amendment is not enough. They want the entire unfair dismissal provision eliminated altogether. I do not believe that that is necessary. But there is no doubt in my mind that, without this change to give small business the free

         In the debate I have heard so far in this House on the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill, some reference has been made to the fact that a number of ex&amp;hyphen;union officials on this side of the House have been speaking on this piece of legislation. I have no problem at all in identifying myself as one of those ex&amp;hyphen;union officials and I think the question may well have been asked if I was not speaking: why wasn't I speaking on this very important piece of legislation?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The point that our friends on the other side of the House miss is that many of us are not only ex&amp;hyphen;union officials but also ex&amp;hyphen;union secretaries, and we had to run our union as a business. In my particular case, I was secretary of a branch of a union and had to run that branch at a profit. I had to report to a state executive which, you might say, was a board of directors. I had to employ staff. I had something like 12 or 13 clerical staff. I had the right to hire and fire. My branch of the union had an income of over $1 million a year. I think that, with that background, I have seen both sides of the story and am very well qualified to speak on this particular piece of legislation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The remarks relating to the unfair dismissal issue never cease to amaze me. Despite having a bill that was the subject of negotiations between the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, and the Democrats, the government persists in encouraging the fallacy that we, on this side of the House, are somehow to blame for its alleged failings. The previous speaker, the member for Griffith (Mr McDougall), was not talking about this piece of legislation—he was not justifying it at all—he was speaking about some views he had on the previous legislation.

         <para first-indent="16">
          There seems to be a view, from the government side, that an employee who is unjustifiably sacked by a small business should be treated differently from a person sacked by a large employer. The issue is surely one of equity. How can we so differentiate between employees by the size of a business? Under the government's legislation, if they work for a company with 15 employees, they are not protected; if they work for a company with 16 employees, they are protected. How ridiculous can you get! Employers who run small businesses should not be in any way permitted to be in a position to treat Australian workers in any different way regardless of whom they work for.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We cannot allow a system to be legislated for that in any way permits some Australians to be treated less fairly, simply by virtue of the size of the particular company. Australia has been described by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) this week as a very egalitarian society. To suggest treating workers differently, based on the size of a company, would consign that egalitarian society to the scrap heap.

          It is worth noting that the government made significant changes to the Workplace Relations Act in December of last year. Some of the changes were as follows: the jurisdiction of the federal tribunal to hear unfair dismissal claims has been reduced; the definition of fairness has been changed; separate streams exist for handling unfair and unlawful dismissals; the power of the AIRC to award costs against employees has been dramatically increased and has been coupled with a compulsory conciliation stage; and a $50 filing fee has been introduced.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The new act confines the operation of the federal statute to a narrow field. Hence, some federal employees are not covered by a federal award, and the five remaining state systems are not subject to the overriding operation of the federal law as was previously the case. Regulations were made in December which impose additional restrictions on the classes of employees protected from unfair dismissals. We were unable to have those regulations disallowed.

           Some of the additional exemptions are: the December registrations, it is claimed, revert to the pre&amp;hyphen;November 1994 position and exclude all employees hired for a specific period; the new registrations deny casual employees protection until they have been engaged as such for a period of 12 months; the December registrations deem any period of probation up to three months to be reasonable; and the restriction of terminating employees defined as `temporarily absent' from work due to illness or injury is also eroded. Employees are now subject to lawful dismissal where they are absent from work for a continuous period of three months or for more than three months in a period of 12 months except where they are in receipt of paid sick leave.

           We raise criticisms of these registrations on the basis that they not only detract from the rights of some workers but also do not fully conform with the terms of the relevant international treaty in that they make it simpler for employers to structure their employment relations so as to avoid their responsibilities under the law.

           But why would we be surprised at such an attitude encouraged by this government? The Prime Minister announced, in a statement on 24 March this year, new promises to make further amendments to cover employers with no more than 15 employees. The government tried to give effect to these statements by regulations, but I am pleased to say the Senate disallowed them. Hence, the bill is now proceeding.

           I referred to this issue earlier and I again note that the principal argument going to the fairness of the changes is that they leave significant sections of the work force without basic protections enjoyed by workers employed by medium to large businesses—including workers in compatible jobs. I agree with the claim that the proposed changes to the unfair dismissal laws will have only a marginal impact on the viability of small business.

           Other issues—such as insufficient capital, poor management, general inexperience and predatory conduct by competitors—are arguably more pressing problems for small business; and none more so than the current flat economy. Size is not a universal proxy for profitability or capacity to pay. The bill says that, in every instance where the employer is a small business, the business is less well placed than the worker to carry the costs of a breakdown in the employment relationship. Only in some instances would this be true. With continuing high levels of unemployment, the removal of access to unfair dismissal remedies further enhances the already considerable bargaining power of employers.

           Let me now briefly address the issue of the necessity or otherwise of this legislation. I certainly believe that it is very arguable that the changes already enacted by the present government—and even the previous government—have sufficiently redressed any imbalance that may have existed in the legislation against employers. Spurious actions are now less of a problem for all businesses, as there has been a marked decline in the number of claims in recent years.

           Whilst the cause of the shift may be argued, what seems clear is that the new laws have had a not insignificant impact on the number of allegations of unfair treatment being made against employers in the federal arena. I believe it is fair to argue that changes to the general law have not only reduced levels of litigation but also lowered the risk to employers of being subject to an adverse finding. These proposed changes are therefore unnecessary.

            The issue of protection for Australian workers always seems to raise the blood pressure of government members, for some reason. I recall many government speakers in the workplace relations legislation debate placing what I considered to be undue emphasis on the difficulties that unfair dismissal legislation was causing small business. In my view, if employees and employers are prepared to work through their respective organisations—such as the employer organisations and trade unions—in most cases a reasonable outcome is achieved.

            In a previous speech on the workplace reform legislation, I quoted an example where an employer informed me—and I speak to a number of small to medium size employers in my electorate—that one of his workers who was not a member of a trade union had legal representation in an unfair dismissal claim. The worker received a settlement of $1,600. The worker's legal representative asked the employer to make out two cheques: one for $1,000 for the solicitor—the legal representative—and $600 for the worker.

            Recently a constituent came into my office who had been dismissed from a small panel beating workshop. This worker was so well entrenched in the company that I actually thought he was the owner. After working at this company for several years, this person had a couple of days off sick. When he returned to work he was dismissed. When this worker inquired as to why he was being dismissed the employer said, `There are a couple of reasons I can give but the easiest one for me is to simply say there was insufficient work,' even though that worker had been working considerable overtime prior to his dismissal.

The settlement in the commission yesterday awarded him another two weeks pay, which was only his award entitlement.

The present proposal to exempt all small businesses in relation to new staff arguably punches too big a hole in article 2(1) of convention No. 158 of the ILO, which evinces the intention that the convention `applies to all branches of economic activity and to all employed persons'.

         This bill is also a further part of the underlying philosophy of what this government wants to do for small business—that is, simply to give it a fair go. The measures in this bill, emanating directly from the original Bell report, allow small businesses with 15 or fewer employees to be exempt from the unfair dismissals provision in respect of new employees, until they have been continuously employed—whether full time, part time or on a regular or casual basis—for a 12-month period.

If we want to restore full confidence in our economy, if we want our employees to feel confident, we need our employers to feel confident that they have control over their own affairs, without living with the constant threat of being taken to the cleaners.

Senator Murray and the member for Cunningham spoke with great verve and passion on this chilly evening in the Newcastle Town Hall to over 300 small business people.

A number of tragic cases came to the attention of my office. One involved a hard working young Woodville couple in my electorate who had just purchased a produce delivery business. Employing on a trial period a male employee—the son of the former owner—a drop-off in business and its failure to live up to the price of the goodwill paid for it required the couple to review the employment status of that worker.

The significant point here is the three months and the two weeks: it was over and above Laurie's provision in the law.

          —At the outset I want to clear up any confusion that may be in the minds of listeners of the previous speaker, the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin), and indeed various speakers on the other side about what the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill is actually doing. This bill is not amending Laurie Brereton's or the Labor government's unfair dismissal laws; it is amending this government's law and stripping away a right which this government said last year they were entitled to but has since changed its mind about.

         It is stripping away a right for people who are employed in small business, if dismissed in a harsh, unjust or unreasonable way, to seek redress: a fundamental right which this government last year and before the last election said they should have but has now changed its mind and said they should not have. Why has it changed its mind? Because it is desperate to create jobs. It will do almost

         This legislation is fundamentally flawed. It is flawed because this government assume that, by taking these sorts of measures, they will be able to create employment. There is no evidence of that whatever. They also assume that the previous government's legislation in relation to unfair dismissals destroyed jobs. We heard reference after reference in this debate and from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in question time on numerous occasions about Labor's job destroying  unfair dismissal laws.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is the mythology of this government. The facts say the opposite. The facts say that, when the Labor government's legislation was in place, there was very strong employment growth. Since this legislation has been taken away, we have not seen such strong employment growth. I am not saying that these are the only issues related to employment, but this government is saying that this is necessary to create employment. There is absolutely no factual basis for that whatever.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Let us look at what happened under Labor's period in office with the unfair dismissals law. It came into effect at the end of March 1994. From then until February 1996, a period of 23 months, what happened to employment with this job destroying unfair dismissals law? We had growth in employment of half a million—just over 500,000. So much for the job destroying law. There were 500,000 additional jobs created while this legislation was in place. Certainly it was not perfect and certainly we made some adjustments to it, some of which came into effect at the end of our period in office. But it was not job destroying. There is no evidence to show that it was job destroying. It did not stop half a million additional people getting jobs.

         In fact, in the period after we left office, for the rest of 1996, when this legislation remained in effect—although there was legislation around from May of last year to amend it, it did not come into effect until the end of December—there continued to be some employment growth under the Liberal govern

In the period since this legislation was chucked out and the new legislation was brought in on the basis that it would create employment, how many jobs have been created? Seventeen thousand jobs have been created in the seven months from December to July. Under the previous legislation, we were creating 17,000 jobs a month. We have had 17,000 in seven months with this legislation in place.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I said, this is not the only factor in determining employment growth. But, on the basis of that evidence, one certainly cannot say that the previous legislation was job destroying, and one certainly cannot say that the current legislation, through the Workplace Relations Bill, and the unfair dismissal changes have been job creating in the way they were claimed they would be. There simply is no evidence to show that.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If you look at the facts, which no-one on the government side wants to do, you will see the opposite to what the government believes to be the fact, that is, there was no job destroying legislation. The legislation gave rights—and certainly it may have been overdone in the first place. The evidence does not say it destroyed employment. We had half a million additional jobs, 17,000 a month on average. This government would give its right arm to create 17,000 a month at the present time. It simply cannot do that.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         From that employment evidence, it is quite clear that the basis of this legislation is false. The basis of this legislation is that you have to take away the rights of workers in relation to unfair dismissal to create employment. The past shows that that is not so. Of course, this government refuse to acknowledge that. I can understand that they do not want to look back or acknowledge anything that was done under the previous government. But they are basing legislation on that assumption. They are stripping away the rights of people on that assumption. They have no right to do that.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I draw attention to the fact that, in the first seven months of the Labor government's supposedly job destroying legislation, we created 186,500 additional jobs. In the first
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          seven months of the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill and the changes to the unfair dismissal laws, we have had 17,000 additional jobs. What a comparison.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Such startling differentials make it absolutely clear that there is no evidence whatever that Labor's unfair dismissal laws were job destroying or even that they inhibited the growth of employment. Certainly, they did not prevent very strong employment growth. There is no evidence whatever that the government's new and greatly restricted unfair dismissal regime has provided any boost to employment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the light of this, one might ask: why, then, do government members so fervently believe that the bill now before the House will lead to strong employment growth? The answer is that it is just ideology, just a belief, just something that they think must be right: if you take away some kind of employment right for workers that small business or business generally has found a bit objectionable, then that will create jobs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is much more complex than that. You have to do a hell of a lot of things to create employment. Certainly, this government is not doing them. This kind of measure, rather than creating employment, is just making our society less fair and less equitable by taking away fundamental rights from workers.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another reason we can be utterly sceptical about claims that this legislation will be a key to employment growth is that many small businesses are already completely exempt from the unfair dismissal laws. This government's Workplace Relations Amendment Bill, which came into effect at the end of last year and which changed the unfair dismissal laws, excluded lots of people in small business. They already are excluded.

        <para first-indent="16">
         That definition of groups excludes various small business people. Obviously it excludes the employees of sole traders and of partnerships. A myriad of small businesses outside Victoria and the territories are not covered because they are not corporations, or they may be corporations but they are not constitutional corporations. So there are lots of small businesses which already are not covered.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This legislation is just sweeping up the rest of them, making sure that those who were covered initially are now no longer covered. Many of them, probably the majority, have been excluded already by the legislation which was brought in earlier this year. So we are here just tidying up, making sure that no small business need be worried about unfair dismissal legislation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Despite this already large exemption of small business, there is no evidence that it has led to increased employment. In fact, employment growth has been pathetic since this exemption was made, as I have already shown. Furthermore, there is no evidence, apart from anecdotal evidence, that these laws were especially burdensome for small business.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Chief Justice Wilcox of the Industrial Relations Court of Australia noted in his annual report for 1995-96 that small business employers were underrepresented in unfair dismissal cases that came before the court. In talking about an independent survey of the court's unlawful termination litigants, he said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         There is no indication that the jurisdiction attracts particular classes of employees beyond their representation in the community. Respondents also are a cross-section of Australian employers, except that small business seems to be under&amp;hyphen;represented. Although ABS statistics show that 91.7% of employers have fewer than 20 employees, the survey showed that only 33% of respondents were in this category. It is interesting to speculate why this is so. Perhaps communication is better in small enterprises.
        </para>
        <para>
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         In other words, what he is saying is that small business is underrepresented in the cases before the court for unfair dismissal and that, therefore, things must be working better in
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          small business than in business generally. What this bill is about is exempting small business because there is supposed to be a special problem there. Mr Justice Wilcox is saying the opposite is true. He is saying that there is less of a problem with small business than with big business, in terms of the cases that come before the court. This government is addressing a problem at the wrong end, if there is a problem at all. Certainly, the government's actions do not fit with the words of Justice Wilcox.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In this report Chief Justice Wilcox also noted that by October 1995—that is, before the latest changes by the Labor government to the unfair dismissals law came into effect—the number of cases that came before the court was just under two per cent of all involuntary terminations in the Australian work force. So, as he said, a tiny proportion of all the people who were sacked pursued litigation against their employer and took a case to court. So much for this being an overwhelming problem.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In targeting an exemption for all small business, the government have claimed also that this is in accord with ILO convention No. 158, the termination of employment convention, which they say allows exclusions of this type, even though the convention states, in article 2, paragraph 1:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         This Convention applies to all branches of economic activity and to all employed persons.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         So the international convention on which the unfair dismissals law is based—and which we ratified—says that this should be applying to all branches of the economy and to all employed persons. It does go on to allow for some exemptions. Countries can have exemptions for some categories, such as:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . limited categories of employed persons in respect of which special problems of a substantial nature arise in the light of the particular conditions of employment of the workers concerned or the size or nature of the undertaking that employs them.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         It is those words which the government has seized on, to say, `We can use that exemption in the convention to put through this—based on the convention. We will be hunky&amp;hyphen;dory, in line with the convention.'
        </para>
        <break page="7123" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          However, the convention goes on to require that a country, in its first report on the convention to the ILO, shall set out any exemptions and the reasons for them and also:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          . . . shall state in subsequent reports the position of its law and practice regarding the categories excluded, and the extent to which effect has been given or is proposed to be given to the Convention in respect of such categories.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          So what it seems to me to be saying is that you must, in the first place, report on who you have excluded and why, and then in subsequent reports you must say how those exemptions are going and what effect is being given to the convention in respect of those categories. In other words, the impetus seems to be for going back towards the full coverage, which is the objective of the convention. But what this government is doing is going the other way. It is not paring back on the exemptions; it is going to more exemptions.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          What is also important is that these words have been interpreted by the committee of experts of the ILO to mean that, after you have put in your first report, there is then no right under the convention to have any further exclusions. As the member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield) said in his address a little while ago, the first report was put in by Australia in September 1995. According to the committee of experts, after you have put in your first report, that is it. You have no further right.

          Let me read from the ILO publication,
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

          , a 1995 report by the committee of experts. In paragraph 74, it says:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          Article 2(6) allows governments to take account of future developments towards a reduction of the exclusions referred to in the first report, but it does not allow them subsequently to introduce new exceptions that were not in force at the time of the first report. In addition to affording the appropriate flexibility, the purpose of exception clauses in ILO Conventions is for member States to endeavour to gradually achieve broader application—
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          in other words, to pare back on the exemptions, not to expand them.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Therefore, this government is going against this convention. What it is doing is a defiance and a breach of the convention. The committee of experts has said that it is not within the terms of the convention to do exactly what

           this government is doing. In terms of this convention, you have no right to further extend exemptions after the first report.

          In respect of employment there are lots of things the government could do to engender employment. A lot of those jobs that the member for Gellibrand talked about are, in fact, part&amp;hyphen;time jobs and jobs in the tourist industry. A lot of them are jobs in the quasi&amp;hyphen;government area. So I think the figures are being fudged anyway. But it would certainly assist small business enormously if governments were committed to paying their bills in 30 days. It would also assist small business, particularly in regional and rural areas, if governments were prepared to buy locally on occasions. But governments will not do this; they will not undertake these very sensible things. If governments would see that major government entities like the armed forces purchased Australia, then there would be many more jobs in the community. There are so many things that we could do to create jobs and this is what will give workers protection.

          If you have a situation where a worker has job opportunities, it is much harder to erode worker conditions. When you have high levels of unemployment there is nothing the unions can do in the long run to stop the erosion of wages and conditions. That is exactly what the opposition in many cases wants. They want this continual erosion. They think that this is somehow good for the economy when it is quite clear that it is not. I have said in this parliament many times that the only

          You have to accept the emotional context of these things. Small business has this perception. In many cases they are  right. In my own electorate I know of cases where a small business has been taken to the cleaners by workers with a little experience. Whole businesses have been threatened, in some cases ruined. Small business is giving up because of this unfair dismissal legislation. It is not good enough to say, as the member for Gellibrand said, that it is only two per cent. That two per cent is often very critical. While small business believes that it is being impeded, you have to take cognisance of that because small business is the only opportunity we are going to see for growth in the economy. We will not see it just with this legislation. I can assure you of that.

The good work of that committee will come to nought because it will put the government, if it implements it, in conflict with big business and, from my experience, big business wins.

It is far better to have the import replacement manufacturing that went with it. But, of course, it was not true. That took only the people employed directly in the car industry, not all the people who contribute to it. It is quite clear that it is the erosion of the manufacturing industry that has done enormous damage to this country. Until that is recognised, and it does not appear to be recognised by either party—certainly there was no greater architect of the demise of the manufacturing industry than Paul Keating—we are not going to get anywhere in terms of creating employment.

I put to this House that an area where a clear natural advantage exists is in chemical production from natural gas, of which we have an abundance. We should be supporting by every means possible the establishment of industries off the North West Shelf to utilise our natural gas. That support should be by capital grants from the government—not by dodgy taxation agreements—open and visible to the public. Governments would say, `We are putting this money into establishing this industry because, once this industry is established, it will be there for the life of the technology, usually about 30 years.' If we cannot make ourselves central to the world in terms of producing over that 30 years, we probably do not deserve to maintain the industry, but I am sure that, given the past record of the initiative of Australian people, we would be able to do that.

          —in reply—I thank the speakers who have made contributions to this debate. The parliament has had a good opportunity to canvass all the issues relating to the government's proposal to exclude certain businesses, namely, small businesses defined as 15 employees or fewer, from the unfair dismissal provisions of the Workplace Relations Act.
          <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
           We proposed that because we think that it is a fair measure to provide some encouragement to the small business community to give people jobs. This is an important area that provides so much potential for small business to create jobs into the future.

         If you take the 10 years to 1994&amp;hyphen;95, of the 1.2 million jobs created small businesses created 1.1 million of them, so the small business community has a track record of creating jobs and, in many cases, in difficult economic circumstances. It has still been able to provide the opportunities that otherwise would not have been provided.

         When the unfair dismissal laws were brought in by the previous government, they relied on the international treaty 158 on which to base the federal law. As time showed, that law in fact acted as a disincentive to job creation. Bob Carr, the Labor Premier of New South Wales, said a couple of years ago that too often small businesses were discouraged from giving somebody a job because they thought that the system was not fair to them. We as a government have attempted to bal
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          ance the interests of both employers and employees. We want a system that is genuinely fair to both sides and that does not act as a disincentive, which the old scheme did.

         We made a series of reforms which came into operation on 1 January this year. We introduced a filing fee of $50. I tell you, the filing fee of $50 has quite an impact on people's behaviour. We introduced a new regime where the commission could award costs against an employee who lodged a frivolous claim. The other day the commission actually awarded costs against an employee in favour of an employer. I tell you what, that is news to a lot of employers, and is perhaps evidence that the system is starting to get some balance back into it.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We also required the commission, under the law that came into effect on 1 January, to take into account the circumstances of small business. We think that is fair, because you can treat these matters as just a sort of charter of rights for employees, but if you do so to the exclusion of the employers they are going to say to themselves, `Well, if I have got a choice between putting on a new machine or giving someone a job, I think I will go for the machine every time because, if I have got problems with it, it will not slug me with an unfair dismissal application.'

        <para first-indent="16">
         We made all those changes and there has been a significant drop in the number of unfair dismissal claims in the federal jurisdiction; in fact, something of the order of 55 per cent. It is true that some people have now made applications in the state schemes that they otherwise would not have, but that actually was part of the design. The reason we designed it that way was that the state schemes have not been the problem that the federal scheme established by the member for Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton) under the Labor administration has been. Overall, there has been a 20 per cent drop or thereabouts in the number of unfair dismissal applications.

         Is it a reasonable thing to do by the standard or practice of others? Absolutely it is. At the international level, this is par for the course. We are not proposing anything especially difficult, especially odd, different, bizarre or otherwise compared with what happens at the international level. I will take some examples from Europe. In Austria, termination of employment legislation does not apply to employees in a business of less than five permanent employees. If it is good enough for the Austrians to have an exemption, why isn't it for us? In France, the amount of damages which can be awarded for unfair dismissal is lower for small businesses with less than 11 employees. So they have got a special deal for small business. In Germany, they have a situation where unfair dismissal
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          laws do not apply to firms employing less than 10 employees. Does anybody say that the Germans are somehow exploiting their employees? No, they don't.

         The member for Gellibrand is here and he made some claims about whether or not this was consistent with our international obligations. Let me respond to those in a minute. But, just before doing so, I point out that the fact is that if you look at the convention it says that you are entitled to so draft legislation as to allow for exclusions of this type. Article 2 of the ILO's Termination of Employment Convention 1982 plainly allows exclusion of employees where special problems of a serious nature arise because of the size of the enterprise.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The opposition say, however, that such an exclusion can only be done if it is done at the outset and acknowledged in Australia's first report to the ILO about its implementation of the convention. I am aware that the ILO's committee of experts has attributed this effect to a paragraph of the convention which requires successive reports to address any developments in the exclusion set out in the first report. But there is nothing in the debates or preparatory papers for this convention to support such an interpretation, which would frustrate the whole provision to deal with new problems as they arise. As a matter of commonsense, it clearly cannot be the interpretation which you put upon it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The opposition should acknowledge that they too expanded the exclusions under their laws as the effect of their laws became clearer. You say that we are in breach, and the example you give is an example you yourselves followed when you were in office. The fact is that it ill behoves the opposition to say that all exclusions should have been in place within the first year.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The opposition when in government ratified the convention in great haste before an election. They ratified the convention at a time when Australian law and practice did not meet the required standard, which is in breach of the normal approach to ratification of ILO

          conventions. They brought in their unfair dismissal laws little realising the impact that they would have, and small business is still trying to recover from the impact of the Brereton unfair dismissal laws because the previous government did not realise how much exclusions like the government's small business exclusion were in fact needed. That is the fact of it. This has been the greatest fiasco of industrial relations law in living memory.

It is quite incredible. I call on every small business person in the country to write to the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), with a copy to the member for Gellibrand, and just say that it is time that the Labor Party supported a fair deal for the small business community.

         Section 170CM prohibits dismissal without one to five weeks notice, depending on the employee's length of service and age, or pay in lieu except in cases of serious misconduct. The exemption in respect of this bill also does not affect the rights of apprentices in small businesses, who have a particular need for protection. The exemption, as I said earlier, applies only to businesses employing 15 or fewer employees.

         These were not facts readily admitted by many of the speakers on the other side. They are not readily admitted because as people understand what the government is proposing I think most people concede that it is fair and reasonable, consistent with good international practice and would provide a real boost to the small business community. It is a sad reflection on the Labor opposition that, when it comes to the small business community, so often it opposes sensible measures to provide them with a break. On the capital gains tax, in regard to the rollover relief for small businesses where they are selling one business and going into another business, you tried to pare back the value of that benefit. We need the small business community. We need them to be able to thrive and prosper. You should not have a policy which is aimed at cutting back benefits to the small business community at every opportunity.

         And then there was the fiasco that you gave us this week. The capital gains tax rollover relief went through the Senate in June and came into operation on 15 July. We followed it up with further legislation to provide capital gains tax rollover relief for those people in small business and retiring with the transfer of those funds into superannuation funds. You
         <break page="7130" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          gave us a different set of formula for calculating those who would qualify than we had for the rollover relief, which means that from opposition you are loading up the small business community with red tape. It is unbelievable.

         For 13 years no-one gave the small business community more red tape than the Labor Party. Even in opposition you are still doing it. We are trying to remove red tape, we are trying to remove unfair tax liabilities on the small business community, we are trying to put a bit of incentive back into the system, and from your political graveyard in opposition we get this flicker of muscular response from you in the Senate which imposes yet another burden on the small business community by requiring small business to calculate the value of their personal assets. So they have to get the valuers in on the family car and all their personal assets or whatever it might be simply to give you an opportunity to squeeze back a reasonable benefit which the government is attempting to provide in its reforms to the capital gains tax system.

         So by all measures this is a very fair and reasonable measure to the benefit of the small business community. We tried to get it in last year. We were unable to do so. We tried to get a compromise through the Senate by way of regulation. That was knocked back. We now introduce this bill. The Labor Party must be severely embarrassed by having the member for Kalgoorlie, a former Labor member, standing up and saying that it is about time that the small business community got some reasonable benefit.

         The member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), the shadow minister for small business, did say something about this bill or the regulation before it was knocked off in the Senate to the effect that it would not be good politics for the Labor Party to oppose this. He was quite right to give you that warning. It is a pity you did not take that warning because this sends a very clear message about your attitude to the small business community. You are not prepared to lift a finger for them.

         I say to you in all fairness and without too much political rhetoric that I honestly cannot understand why you are so opposed to this. I

          really can't. If vulnerable people were so dreadfully exposed, if it were such a bad deal for them, maybe I could understand what you are on about. But, given the other protections available to people and given that it falls within the bounds of conventional practice within the international community, then I for the life of me cannot understand why you cannot provide this benefit to the small business community.

         You need to at least recognise that you wrought a hell of a lot of damage on the small business community with the unfair dismissal law. You set up a culture where employees took the view that, regardless of what the circumstances were when they got the sack, they were entitled to go down and write a letter of demand to their employer, and they would reckon that they would in most cases get $5,000 or $6,000 regardless of the circumstances because the employer would turn up to the local solicitor and the local solicitor would say: `The average costs are $8,000. They have got you over a barrel. You could go before the commission but, given some of the decisions coming out of the process, the chances are that you are going to go down. You would be better, therefore, just to settle.' It was really a form of blackmail.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The message under the Brereton unfair dismissal scheme to small business was: `Do not employ somebody because, if you do, you could be badly treated, unfairly treated, and just to add insult to injury you will have to spend a couple of days down there in the commission or tribunal fighting for the survival of your business and have to close the doors of your business while you do so.'

        <para first-indent="16">
         This is a very fair, reasonable and balanced measure. Sure, it provides some greater benefit to the small business community—we think it should do so—but it does so in a way which is also fair to employees. For that reason, I commend the bill to the House. I am disappointed at the partisan political approach taken by the opposition to it. I think they will rue the day politically, but I look forward to the bill's passage through the House.

         My concern relates to the fact that the bill makes explicit exclusion, from the exclusion, of apprentices. I welcome that. If there is going to be a provision, better that it excludes apprentices than not; though I wish it did not exist at all. It is not that I query that; I just want to raise two things about it. If I heard the member for Murray correctly, she said that apprentices could be excluded because the existing provisions in the legislation did not apply to them because they were employed under a fixed term of employment. While, technically, I could imagine that might be an interpretation you could make, the case law, as I understand it, does not confirm that; and I think that is not correct.

          What I would like the minister to consider is: if that is not the correct explanation of the exclusion—and I assume it is not—what is the rationale for distinguishing between apprentices, trainees and other young people who might all be employed by the same employer on the same day and be subject to the same dismissal processes and, yet, one has protection and the other two do not because of their different categories of employment? Their age may be identical, their period of employment may be identical, their relationship to the employer may be identical, their behaviour and the employer's response may be identical, but one young person would have a right of appeal by virtue of their status as an apprentice.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We welcome their having that right of appeal. We think they should have that right of appeal. The assurance that the minister gave before the election, that you would have a right of appeal if you were unfairly dismissed, should be implemented for all employees, not just for apprentices in these circumstances. What is the rationale for that distinction? Why is it that there is one group of young Australians to whom these provisions will continue to apply and, yet, will not apply to all those others? I would very much appreciate the minister's explanation of that. On the face of it, it seems like an anomaly.

          The member for Murray was quite ingenious in thinking of that explanation, but I do not think she is correct, if my understanding of the law—not this particular act, but the law as it relates to apprentices and that subclause of the act concerning fixed terms which was in the previous legislation as well—is correct. If that is not the explanation, why has that distinction been made between apprentices and other young people? It seems to me, on the face of it, simply to be acknowledging our argument that people should have a right to appeal against harsh, unreasonable and unjust dismissals but recognising it only with regard to one particular and small subgroup of young Australians rather than all Australians who ought to have the same benefits. I would be very interested in the minister's response to the member for Murray's ingenious interpretation of the provision and, if she is not correct,

The reason I say that is that there is a diversity of contractual arrangements that apprentices around Australia enter into, and you need to look at the specificity of each and every one of those arrangements to see the worth of her comment. But, in a simple response to your remarks, the fact of the matter is that we do not believe that she is right. I think that is the quick answer.

         In respect of apprenticeships, I think they are reasonably treated as different, which is what we do in this legislation. Apprentices take on apprenticeships with the purpose of acquiring certain skills over a period of time, and to have that arrangement upset midway by the actions of the employers we do not think is reasonable. Therefore, we thought the exclusion was a fair thing. I suppose you could argue the logic of this until the cows come home, but we thought it was a reasonable thing to do and we made that provision as a result.

         When we look at the number of small businesses, we see that there were some 785,800 small businesses on the register at the end of 1994&amp;hyphen;95, of which 427,600 did not employ anybody. They are not employers. A further 315,300 employed between one and nine employees and 37,700 employed between 10 and 19 people. In the manufacturing sector—where any business employing fewer than 100 people is classed as small business—there were 5,200 small businesses.

        <para first-indent="16">
         When you look at those figures, you need to first look at the analysis of small business and the trades and what businesses those people are in. It is fascinating to look at the areas of retail and accommodation. In retail, there were 134,700 businesses at the end of 1994&amp;hyphen;95 and in accommodation, cafes and restaurants there were 25,400. If you relate that back and say, `Where are the problems in small business?', small business's biggest problem is a flattened economy—a lack of growth. They want demand; that is where the jobs are going to come from. And they are seeing tens of thousands of federal employees being sacked.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The great problem for small business is a total lack of security. There is a massive feeling of insecurity right across small business, and that is why they want to see a fair go and they want to see the fair trading report recommendations implemented.

        <para first-indent="16">
         When you look at the composition of small business and relate that back to where the problems are, you see that in the year 1996&amp;hyphen;97 there were 504,567 award inquiries. That is 2,018 award inquiries—people ringing up and seeking information about their award entitlements—every working day of the year. That number is a 64 per cent increase on the previous year, and all of the year 1996&amp;hyphen;97 was within the span of this government. Since

         When you look at award breaches, you see the industries in which these award breaches are occurring.

The top of the hit parade in Queensland were the same two industries, the top of the hit parade in the Northern Territory was the retail industry and the top of the hit parade in Tasmania were the hospitality industry and the motor vehicle industry. In Victoria and South Australia it is again the motor vehicle industry. So the breaches are being detected in the same areas where the mass of complaints are occurring.

         It makes a complete mockery of what the government is talking about and trying to pursue in this legislation. They labour under the myth that people in small business are not employing more people because of the existence of this employee protection legislation. If we look at the rate of unfair dismissal applications, in the first five months of 1997 they were down by an average of 122—less than half what they were in the comparable period of the previous year.

         That is not the problem. The problem is lack of demand, lack of confidence and policies from this government that are utterly depressing business and undermining confidence. The legislation that exists is there to protect employees from harsh, unfair and unjust treatment. That is why the mass of small business out there that employs people is not concerned with this legislation.

          There is recognition in this government's own legislation that some people can be dismissed as a result of harsh, unreasonable or unjust arrangements. As far as small business is concerned, they say that if you are an apprentice, you will be protected against harsh, unreasonable or unjust dismissal. They recognise that it exists and yet they say: `It applies to all other employees.' But to those of small business, they say, `Not to you.' Let us make no mistake about it. That is what they are saying to all of those people who become employed in small business, which is defined as any business with fewer than 15 employees, and there are probably about a million of them in Australia. The member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) indicates that there are about two million employees in businesses in Australia which employ 15 or fewer employees. So we are not talking about something which is peripheral; we are talking about the biggest single complement of businesses that operate in Australia.

Members on the government side got up and criticised the unfair dismissal arrangements which we had. People got up and criticised the general arrangements that might be in place for employees to appeal against the circumstances in which they were dismissed. But not one person made out a case for why employees in small business should not be afforded this protection. There is a discriminating immorality involved in these provisions.

           harsh, unreasonable or unjust way. But they have said this will encourage employment in small business. When the employee number in a small business is approaching 15, after which they will no longer be covered by this amended provision, the question is whether or not those small businesses will continue to employee additional employees. The answer, quite clearly, is no.

          The point has also been made that the number of unfair dismissal appeals has fallen dramatically. So, in terms of the incidence of these appeals, this amendment is not necessary. In terms of the morality of this situation, this amendment is not necessary. People employed by small businesses are just as entitled to the protection of the law, to the protection of their dignity, to the security of their employment and to protection against harsh, unreasonable and unjust dismissal as any other employee.

          —I think everyone realises that the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) and many members on the other side are engaging in absolute obfuscation in trying to suggest that, by removing the right to protection against harsh, unjust or unreasonable dismissal, workers in small businesses with fewer than 15 employees will be adequately covered. We all know that the situations in which they will be covered are extremely limited, related to areas like discrimination and notice, and that in many situations related to harsh, unjust or unreasonable dismissal they will have no protection at all. That is the reality; the minister knows it. Let us stop mucking around and pretending that there is no change in their situation.

         As far as the minister's comments go about standard practice at the international level, I do not think it is standard practice at the international level to have exemptions of the degree of fewer than 15 employees. There are a number of countries, as he said, which have some exemptions. The ones for which details are available to me include Germany, Austria and the Republic of Korea, which has exemptions for fewer than four employees, and Sri Lanka.

         The minister also says that his actions are consistent with our international obligations. As I said in my speech at the second reading stage—and I do not have time to repeat the details here—that is simply not true. He said it at the Press Club; he has been saying it all over the place. It is not true. The committee of experts, whom he dismisses as a bunch of nincompoops who do not know what they are talking about, presumably do know a little about this subject. They are the international experts on the convention. They did a report on the protection against unjustified dismissal in 1995. What they said in that report was, in paragraph 73:

But that is what this government is doing with this legislation. It is totally against the international convention. In fact, so was the Workplace Relations Act which came in at the end of last year. The exclusions that are in that are against the convention as well. You have no entitlement under the convention to do either. You must know that. Your department must know that.

          —I am just telling the member for Banks that the words he mentioned were not in my second reading speech. I have the second reading speech. As to the answer to your rather pathetic question, the numbers may be different for a disallowance motion as compared to a bill. So why did we reintroduce the bill? The reason is simple: we think this is a good measure. You knocked off what was basically from my point of view a compromise. We put that up because I honestly thought that you would support it or maybe the Democrats would support it.

         You were not involved in the negotiations, but my assessment was that, if we put up a regulation with a 12-month probation period, we would have a reasonably good chance of getting it through. A 12-month probation
         <break page="7138" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          period is not an unreasonable proposition. One of the improvements of the legislation is that we set three months as a probation period. If you take somebody on and you say, `This is subject to probation during your first three months,' then you are excluded or exempted from the unfair dismissal law. That is better than the old system because it was not clear what the probation period would be under the old system. So we have improved that and made it more practical for business. In the regulation that we introduced, basically we went for a compromise. The amazing thing was that you knocked off the compromise.

         It is still our view that there should be an exemption for small business. Obviously when you knocked off the disallowance, we would produce the bill. It was just the timing of when the speech was given to what happened in the Senate that affected whether or not I used those words. Apparently the thing was lodged and something happened in the Senate or the timing changed in the House of Representatives and we changed it before I actually gave the speech. That is why I have told you that it is not actually right.

You would have believed that there was a suppressed enthusiasm to employ just waiting to burst forth as soon as the unfair dismissal laws were removed. Yet the evidence is to the contrary.

         That is only appropriate. The bill itself refers to the famous case of Lotty and Holloway, which has become well known in unfair dismissal cases. It seems to me that you would remove the concept of a fair go all round only in very exceptional circumstances. It is a fundamental right that, before anyone receives a penalty or is disadvantaged, they should be given the right to present their case in their own defence. By removing the concept of a fair go all round, the employer will not be required to give reasons, nor will he be required to hear the worker in their own defence. As I have said, you would remove that fundamental right only in exceptional circumstances.

           —Yes, certainly. Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask the minister: why are the subsection 170CC provisions inadequate to overcome this unfair dismissal anxiety? The minister has referred to the probationary period. One alternative for a small business proprietor who has this unfair dismissal anxiety is to put someone on on a casual basis. The other option, which is very simple and which any half&amp;hyphen;decent lawyer would do, is to say, `We will put the person on for a 12&amp;hyphen;month fixed&amp;hyphen;term period.' Those safeguards already are there to dispel this unfair dismissal anxiety. So, having quelled the reason for anxiety, there is absolutely no need to take away this fundamental human right.

         </talk.start>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The other issue which is a real problem is that, in taking away this fundamental human right to a fair go all round, the remaining provisions of the act—which are not intended to be removed—are made unworkable. Those are the unlawful termination provisions. Those provisions apply if, for instance, someone has been sacked because they are of a particular racial background or because they have a disadvantage or for those sorts of reasons.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          How will those provisions be enforceable on the part of a worker, if the employer does not have to give the worker any reason for dismissing him? If the worker suspects he is being sacked unlawfully, all the employer has to say in a case is, `I did not sack you unlawfully; I sacked you unfairly. And, because I sacked you unfairly and you are in your first 12 months, you do not have a remedy.'
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          That necessarily has to be the case if the employer is not required to give reasons for
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           dismissal nor to give the worker an opportunity to have an input into the reasons why he is being dismissed. It has to be the case that the workers are effectively going to be shut out of not only the unfair dismissal remedy but also the unlawful dismissal remedy, merely because of the fact that the employer is not going to be required to give reasons.

         The honourable member said that people's concerns could be allayed by putting people on fixed term contracts. That is true. In some cases, employers will do that. But it will not suit employers in every case to have such arrangements—for commercial reasons or because of their workload arrangements or whatever.

        <para first-indent="16">
         He also said that you could put people on as casuals. That is true as well. That has happened. There has been a lot of employment characterised as casual employment. In fact we have seen a great growth in casual employment, and the reason people have been put on as casuals—as opposed to being employed on a permanent part&amp;hyphen;time basis—is that permanent part&amp;hyphen;timers have access to the unfair dismissal laws and casuals do not.

        <para first-indent="16">
         For some people, it suits them to be employed on a casual basis. I am neutral: if you want to be a casual and it suits you, that is fine and, if you want to be a permanent part&amp;hyphen;time employee, that is fine as well. It is a matter of your choice. But the problem we have had is that a lot of businesses have forced people into casual employment, only
         <break page="7141" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          offered casual employment, because they were absolutely frightened out of their wits about the prospect of an unreasonable unfair dismissal claim being lodged against them. I will tell you who has suffered as a result of that: mainly women who wanted less than full&amp;hyphen;time employment so that they could balance their work and family responsibilities.

         It is a classic thing for you to say, `You can fix this problem by hiring people as casuals.' That denies a huge number of people in the work force the opportunity to have permanent part&amp;hyphen;time work. And permanent part&amp;hyphen;time work is important because that way you can have regular hours. If you have to pick up the kids from school, it is no good being a casual worker, because you do not know whether you are going to be working or not. The chances are you might be required to work. I thank you for saying this, because it exposes exactly what has been the problem. You have forced a whole lot of people out of the option of permanent part&amp;hyphen;time work, which gives them regularity and the chance to better balance their work and family responsibilities.

        <para first-indent="16">
         You people have been saying, `We should have a system where people can better balance their work and family responsibilities', but condemned out of your own mouth is your own cure—forcing people to be casual—to the problem you created. That cure is very unfair mainly to women at the moment but in future it is also going to be very unfair to men. They are going to have more responsibilities for looking after families and are going to want to work less than full&amp;hyphen;time. They should have those opportunities available to them.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The other thing about part&amp;hyphen;time work is that it allows you to get pro rata conditions. People with work and family responsibilities might want annual leave and whatever carer's leave is available on a pro rata basis, because they need to look after their dependent children.

        <para first-indent="16">
         What you say totally highlights what you did in government: that is, by the inadequacies and total unfairness of your unfair dismissal law, you forced a lot of people into casual employment. That denied them a solution to one of the great social needs of

          —I reassure the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) that I am not about to make another speech about unfair dismissals, or industrial relations for that matter. On Saturday, 23 August here in Canberra a very important forum was held to develop strategies against racism. It was organised by the Council for Civil Liberties of the ACT, the Ethnic Communities Council of the ACT, Community Aid Abroad and Racial Respect. Those four organisations did an outstanding job for Canberra and for their community by setting an example which I know is being replicated around the country.

         It was a forum attended by more than 200 people here in Canberra. I was delighted when I arrived in the hall of the Canberra Workers' Club to see so many people on a cold Canberra Saturday attending this forum. They represented more than 60 community organisations. All of us here who are active in public life know that you tend to turn up to forums and you know everybody—they were the people who were at the last protest about something else. This was one of those wonderful occasions when there was a range of people who did not usually turn out to public forums. They were there because they were profoundly concerned about what is happening in their country and in their society and they saw this correctly as an opportunity to start to build a comprehensive framework of response to the emerging signs of intolerance, disrespect and racism in our community.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The aims of the forum were to develop strategies to fight racism and promote racial harmony, to share resources and information among community groups, to strengthen the  capacity of community groups to fight racism, to promote non-discrimination as central to Australian society and to affirm Australia's commitment to international human rights.

          The people came together and did a very solid and important job. One of the interesting and important speeches that was made was the opening address by Sir William Keys. Sir William made a very important contribution about the importance of seeing the opposition to racism in a broader context of civil liberties in Australia. We were addressed by a former member of this House, the former Attorney&amp;hyphen;General Michael Lavarch, and by a number of distinguished representatives from community groups and the media. Lobbyists gave advice. The representatives attending that forum then divided into a series of workshops and developed important strategies and proposals that will be considered by their various organisations.

Recognising that, I put to that forum and I want to put to this House, and through it the people of Canberra, that this would be an excellent first time, first example, for everybody contesting this election to say, `We recommend that you put the One Nation Party last.' Everybody should do it.

         Thuringowa was created as a local authority back in October 1879, at a time when the north was being opened up by pastoralists and miners. Ports were needed to service this growing interest in the north and in 1864 the small port settlement of Townsville was established at the mouth of the Ross River. The area immediately surrounding Townsville began attracting graziers and farmers with an eye to the future potential of the region.

         In 1879 the Queensland government passed an `Act to provide for a local government outside the boundaries of municipalities', and on 2 October of that year the Thuringowa divisional board was created. The first board members were elected at a public meeting in January 1880, and nine members were presented with the task of catering to the needs of a sparse and widespread population occupying 7,612 square kilometres.

         Thuringowa, despite being seen by some as merely a rural authority, was prominent in the establishment of a railway link to the gold mining centre of Charters Towers and also played a key role in the construction of a railway line to the sugar town of Ayr. Thuringowa, incidentally, also had the first airport for Townsville. Thuringowa is also the source of water for the adjacent city of Townsville, and in 1897 the Thuringowa water board was established.

         Five years later in 1902 Thuringowa became a shire and remained so until 1 January 1986, when it was raised to city status. The

          push for city status began in 1985, when Thuringowa was in the throes of a major building boom, and the population more than doubled over a five&amp;hyphen;year period. The council of the day believed much could be achieved in its dealings with government departments and private enterprise if it could speak with the authority of a city.

         Since 1986 Thuringowa has undergone a major transformation, more than doubling in population in 10 years, and attracting a wide cross&amp;hyphen;section of business and industry. l believe Thuringowa's growth since 1986 would be the envy of many more established cities. For instance, since 1986 the Thuringowa City Council has dealt with more than 31,000 building applications, including 8,262 for homes and 325 commercial applications, with a total value of nearly a billion dollars. It is worthy of notice that a significant number of homes built in recent years have been for the benefit of defence personnel posted north to serve in Australia's largest army barracks, 3rd Brigade's at Lavarack.

That centre was officially opened in late 1995 and yet now, only 20 months later, the council has added a second stage and has called tenders for the construction of a third stage. The enterprise centre was established to give small businesses—those in homes and backyards—an opportunity to embrace better business practices with the assistance of experienced centre managers, and to expand their operations to a stage where they can ultimately relocate to premises of their own.

          —The owners and operators of private nursing homes and hostels for the aged frequently have to put up with a great deal of nonsense in their dealings with standards monitoring team personnel. It seems that sometimes, but nevertheless all too often, individuals from the teams have to justify the time spent looking into the operations of a nursing home or hostel by finding fault where none really exists. We have become almost inured to Australian Taxation Office audit inspectors behaving in this way, but the thinking seems to have permeated at least some of those in the Department of Health and Family Services.

         Take one case related to me recently. A new patient was admitted to a private nursing home and, on admission from a general hospital, was found to have scabies. We can only guess why her condition was not picked up and treatment for the condition commenced while she was still in hospital. As it turned out, the admitting nurse did not know about the scabies, and it was discovered immediately as a consequence of the home's
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          routine procedures when any new resident is committed to its care.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         After discussion with the new resident, treatment for scabies was administered, as might reasonably have been expected—a matter of course, we might think. But it is not. There is no way that trained nursing staff can just go ahead and treat a case of highly infectious scabies before it spreads to other residents or staff. There are bureaucratic procedures that must be observed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         All this comes to light as a result of a standards monitoring team having been told that the case of scabies had been found in the nursing home concerned. An anonymous tip-off, no less, had brought it to the department's attention. Telephone contact with the nursing home ensued and a visit by an inspector arranged. Part of the interview by the inspector with the senior nursing sister in the presence of the proprietor was concerned with the infected resident's right to freely choose treatment for the disease—`Was the resident cum patient consulted?' Yes, apparently she was.  Sister told the inspector that, after discussion, the patient was—in the vernacular—`talked into it'.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It seems that the antennae of the inspector activated automatically. To be talked into something must have involved denial of the resident's right to freely choose to have or not have treatment. On it being explained that, in every day conversation, `to be talked into' something more often than not means to be persuaded by sweet reason to accept good advice, the inspector was still relatively unmoved.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Remember that this episode did not arise because of any complaint before or after treatment by the resident or her family. There had been a tip-off to the department by a person or persons unknown to the nursing home management. The potential for idle mischief&amp;hyphen;making should be apparent. But more important is that the nursing home nevertheless received a black mark on its record, plus all the time&amp;hyphen; and cost-consuming inconvenience, because of some bureaucratically perceived violation of an infected person's right to choose not to be treated.

          It seems the rights of other residents and staff to remain uninfected were of only secondary importance. Least important from this example is a need for commonsense. Let it also be understood that, only a couple of months earlier, the nursing home had been audited by a standards monitoring team and been scored 31 out of a possible 31 for its entire operations—a rare mark indeed.

          —It pleases me to be able to speak tonight about a matter which is very close to my heart. For many years now I have been campaigning for tougher penalties to be imposed on paedophiles. The damage that these criminals do to young children cannot be overestimated. I have seen and heard of many terrible stories about children who are left scarred for life as a result of being preyed upon by a paedophile.

         The federal government recognises the importance of this issue and has announced that it will step up the fight against paedophilia through a new national strategy. On behalf of my constituents of Makin, I wish to thank the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) for her announcement of the soon to be established National Council for the Prevention of Child Abuse. The minister has shown great understanding of this issue in making such an announcement. I have long argued for the establishment of a national approach to combat paedophilia, and I am pleased that this will finally come about, thanks to Minister Moylan and the Howard government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As a sure sign that this government is to get tough on paedophiles, the minister has already announced that the federal government will be closing any loopholes through which paedophiles may escape or continue to prey upon children. The government will introduce legislation to ensure that a protective order issued in one state will have effect in other states. This will provide greater safety for a child should he or she be moved to another state. A register of convicted paedophiles will also be established to assist police and the community in the fight against this horrendous crime.

          It is my understanding that the first task of the National Council for the Prevention of Child Abuse will be to examine the recommendations of the Wood report into paedophilia in New South Wales. Justice James Wood has recently released this report after extensive investigation of the issue during Australia's first royal commission into paedophilia. The report highlights the need for national action, as does the recently released report by the Queensland Commissioner for Children.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The Wood report identified the actions of paedophile groups that abused children and used the Internet to communicate. The community has a right to expect action to be taken to stop the insidious actions of paedophile networks, and this government is committed to providing that action, in conjunction with the states and territories.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          One recommendation in the Wood report that does concern me is in relation to the lowering of the age of consent for homosexual sex. If adopted, this would allow homosexual sex with young people as young as 16 years of age. This raises the question as to whether a paedophile could claim consenting homosexual sex with a 14&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old and use the defence that he or she thought the young person was really 16 years of age. I am deeply concerned by this recommendation and call for its outright rejection by all members of this House and the general public. I believe that it is wrong to be recommending a reduction in the age of consent for homosexual sex, which would provide an avenue for paedophiles to avoid justice, in a report which is highlighting the tragedy suffered by the victims of paedophiles and their families. Our aim must be directed towards the identification and prosecution of paedophiles, not providing them with potential avenues for avoiding justice.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As a society, we cannot continue to turn the other cheek and ignore this national problem. It requires, and as from today it will receive, national attention. I commend the announcement by the Minister for Family Services and look forward to the prosecution and conviction of child sexual abusers. Our community will be safer when the paedophiles have

          —I rise tonight to draw the federal parliament's attention to the fine work of a local group in my electorate of Isaacs. The persons I speak of are both past and present members of the committee and staff of the Lyrebird Community Centre who have assisted in creating community infrastructure where it never existed before. This tireless and unpaid work is unrecognised by many others in the local community, and tonight I wish to redress that by offering thanks for their fine efforts.

         The Lyrebird Community Centre had its beginnings in 1989. The budget of the centre at that time was a paltry $7,000. Today the income for the centre is over $240,000, funding being split between state and local governments and cost recovery activities undertaken by the centre. To date the centre has not secured any federal funding, although I expect this to change in the future, and indeed hope it will change.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The centre's main focus for the provision of services is the Carrum Downs area. Like other outer regions, Carrum Downs began life as a rural hamlet. Since 1978 the population has grown substantially but, sadly, many government provided services have been one step behind. The absence of government was in many ways the germinating seed for these local activists to get together and start this centre. Today the activities provided by this centre mirror those of the TAFE sector and many provided by local, state and federal governments in other parts of the metropolitan area, although of course at a very reduced cost to the public purse.

         My recent discussions with coordinators Cathie Valentine and Marie Blakey and key committee of management member Peter Hart left me with feelings of both joy and disappointment. The happy feelings related to the extensive range of services provided, which include literacy classes for migrants, moderately costed child care, immunisation for children, cancer support groups and extremely popular computer study courses. Presently the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The centre enjoys patronage of 2,000 persons per week, which highlights the demand for its services. As well, this patronage reflects the careful way in which each new service is assessed to ensure that it suits the demographics of the community.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I mentioned moments ago, I had some sad feelings as I left this centre recently. The centre has a severe capital and recurrent funding shortage which limits its ability to expand service provision. The main hall it operates from is very small, accommodating some 80 persons. This means that changeovers from one activity to another during the day curtail the time the centre is actually delivering services.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Numerous approaches for further funding to local and state governments have borne no fruit. The inappropriately named Victorian Government Community Development Fund is awash with money but very little appears to be directed to such worthwhile community facilities as the Lyrebird Community Centre.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         More disturbing than the paucity of capital being made available for local infrastructure is the growing trend for federal and state governments to completely abandon some areas of social service. Recently the centre has begun to receive people who have been referred from local DES offices. It has reached the stage whereby some people are so desperate they are asking for food vouchers, something the centre has never experienced previously, and something I expect to continue, sadly.

          —I am, as honourable members know, keenly interested in the health of Australian people in all its aspects.

         When investigating the scale of deafness and hearing impairment which besets this country I was surprised at how many Australians are affected. The Deafness Forum, the peak body on deafness in Australia, advises that between one million and three million Australians have an acquired hearing impairment. That is 10 per cent of the population. In addition, approximately 150,000 people are born deaf.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Much of the deafness acquired by people is regarded as having been preventable. This is not good news, but statistics for indigenous communities are far worse. In this section of our population, 60 per cent suffer from hearing loss and associated problems. Indigenous communities lack awareness about hearing problems. At any given time up to 80 per cent of children in indigenous communities in the Gulf, the Cape York Peninsula and Torres Strait island communities are afflicted by chronic ear infections, perforated ear drums and discharging ears. The Menzies School of Health has advised the North Australia Aboriginal Legal Service that it should work on the basis that every client has a hearing loss unless otherwise informed. Also, two out of every 1,000 babies are born deaf due to their mothers being infected with rubella, or German measles. There are between 15,000 and 20,000 deaf people in Australia who use the Australian Sign Language as their primary method of communication.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The mission of the Deafness Forum is to improve the quality of life of Australians who are deaf or who have a hearing impairment or a chronic disorder of the ear. Hearing Awareness Week provides an opportunity to raise community awareness of hearing impairment
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          and ways of protecting people's hearing. To make the country more aware of the problems of the deaf, the Deafness Forum has organised and will be coordinating Hearing Awareness Week, and this year the theme will be `Immunisation to protect hearing'.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This year the aim is to increase community awareness of the implications of hearing impairment as a result of rubella. Immunisation against rubella can not only prevent a mild childhood disease but also prevent serious abnormalities in babies born to mothers who contract the disease within the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. These babies are at risk of being born deaf, blind, with heart defects or even with intellectual disabilities.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Hearing Awareness Week also provides an opportunity for the 10 per cent of Australians who have a hearing impairment to share their experience and knowledge and help create a greater understanding of their needs and aspirations. Some of the activities for this year by member organisations of the Deafness Forum are: information stalls at local shopping centres, distribution of information about hearing impairment, communication options, techniques as well as information on available support networks, displays of helpful hearing devices, the provision of information on hearing assessment, the conducting of free hearing tests and of lip reading competitions. As you can see, Mr Speaker, there is a lot of activity and assistance being provided for deaf people.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The government is funding aid to the deaf substantially and will outlay a total of $87.5 million this financial year. Of this sum, $67.8 million will be allocated to private sector agencies or to the government run Australian Hearing Service so that patients can purchase hearing services, be these hearing implements or medical treatments. Funds are provided for services carried out directly by the Australian Hearing Service on children and other groups with special needs. This includes funds for services such as replacing speech processor units for children who have cochlear implants.

          —This bill adjusts for cost supplementation a range of grants payable under schedule 2 of the Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act. It also removes the requirement that at least 10 per cent of students at an educational institution be indigenous for the institution to then be eligible for per capita payments under supplementary recurrent assistance.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Supplementary assistance is part of the Commonwealth's indigenous education strategic initiatives program. This has become output rather than input focused, a direction set by the previous government when it announced additional funding for this and other indigenous education programs in response to the 1994 review of Aboriginal education.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That announcement by the Labor government in September 1995 also flagged the change to per capita recurrent funding, which was put in place last year. In doing so, however, the coalition government restricted access to such funding by requiring non&amp;hyphen;government schools, preschools and vocational education institutions to have indigenous students make up at least 10 per cent of their total enrolments and also to have a minimum number of indigenous students enrolled. For schools and vocational education institutions, the minimum requirement is 20 indigenous students. For preschools, it is five students.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In his speech on last year's bill, which introduced the recurrent arrangements, Dr Kemp said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The per capita element of the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program will provide an entitlement&amp;hyphen;based, equitable recurrent funding arrangement.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         Yet this program has not operated with any great degree of equity. This bill, by removing the 10 per cent requirement, goes some way towards making supplementary recurrent assistance more equitable, but it will not be truly equitable until it does not discriminate between one indigenous student and another. With a year 12 retention rate of 33 per cent and three times the rate of primary school literacy problems as other students, indigenous children face massive problems. Yet under the government's proposal, some 1,100 indigenous students will still be denied access to recurrent assistance under this program. There are children in non&amp;hyphen;systemic schools with fewer than 20 indigenous students enrolled, and these are the students who will be missing out, according to the provisions of this legislation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What reason does the government advance for such arbitrary discrimination? They claim administrative difficulties. We are told that in order for the funds to reach these children, some 260 additional agreements would need to be negotiated between the government and the education providers. We are also told that a critical mass of indigenous students is needed for the funds to be effective. Yet the guidelines show that these funds can be spent on any activity aimed at helping indigenous students meet agreed educational targets.
        </para>
        <break page="7152" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          Every non&amp;hyphen;systemic school in receipt of Commonwealth funding is required to sign an agreement. Surely, it would not be too difficult to add to that standard agreement, a section which deals with indigenous students and access to supplementary recurrent assistance funding. If the agreements are in place, surely it is not too hard to add a provision that provides access to this program's recurrent funding for the additional 1,100 indigenous students. There can be no sound reason for denying those 1,100 access to this program, when all other indigenous students, in all other parts of the education sector, are eligible for funding.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Surely, DEETYA could work with any schools having difficulties using the funds effectively, or put such schools in touch with others which have developed appropriate programs. I find it frustrating, when we are talking about the supreme and extreme educational disadvantage that indigenous Australians face through the school sector, that a so&amp;hyphen;called administrative obstacle has been found for denying access to important program funding for 1,100 Aboriginal students.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I intend to move an amendment which will remove the minimum enrolment requirements, along with the 10 per cent rule. This is the only way to avoid anomalies in the distribution and use of these funds and to ensure an equitable treatment under this program for all indigenous students.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I would also like to take this opportunity to say that the government's commitment to improved educational outcomes for indigenous young people looks rather shaky in light of the recent cuts to Abstudy that were announced in the budget just past. Some $38.7 million has been cut away from a program which costs around only $123 million annually to run. I have received correspondence from the Australian Vice&amp;hyphen;Chancellors Committee, the Uniting Church and academics all expressing their outrage and concern at the government's attack on Abstudy and the reduced access to education for indigenous students which is likely to result.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The Abstudy cuts can be arbitrarily imposed without parliamentary scrutiny. That is what the government is doing. The bill before the House, however, can be changed to produce greater equity and fairness in the management of this program, ensuring that every single indigenous student in Australia is eligible for its funding and benefits.
         </para>

          I urge the government to support the amendment that I will be moving in the committee stage. I notice that a range of government members have gathered—two, in particular. They are the member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) and the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) who would have a substantial number of the 1,100 students excluded under this particular bill before the Main Committee. If they are serious about supporting fair and even access for all Aboriginal students to this program, including all the Aboriginal schools and students in their electorates, they will support the Labor Party amendment. They will support the amendment which basically says, `Indigenous students, as a group, should not be discriminated against.'

         <para first-indent="16">
          There should not be one set of rules for those who are being made eligible under this bill and another for those 1,100 other students who would be excluded solely because of an alleged administrative obstacle. I maintain it is an obstacle that can be cleared. There is no sound reason why DEETYA cannot provide access to this program to every single indigenous student throughout the schooling sector in Australia. This is a program that should not be available just for some Aboriginal students. It is a program which should be available for all. I urge the government, in addressing the second reading and, ultimately, my amendment, to support the Labor Party in that regard.

           Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1997
          </xref>
          . The Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989 was aimed at redressing a real difficulty that many educators of indigenous Australians have due to language and cultural barriers. One such educator in my electorate has informed me that, when many of the Torres Strait Islander students start at his college, they test three to four years behind their peers.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         With this goal in mind of getting indigenous Australians off to an equal start in life, the federal government introduced changes to the act in 1997 to improve ways in which funds were to be directed to institutions where they have maximum impact on improving educational outcomes for indigenous students. This involved setting up a minimum percentage of indigenous enrolments at 10 per cent of the school's total, plus setting a minimum number of 20 indigenous students, or five indigenous pre&amp;hyphen;schoolers, enrolled in a school for it to be eligible for assistance.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These two measures were to ensure that schools with significant indigenous enrolments would be assisted as it is these schools that are likely to focus on their indigenous students through special programs. It became clear, however, that one of these changes—the setting of a 10 per cent minimum indigenous representation—in some cases is severely disadvantaging some of the very students whom the government is striving to help.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The 10 per cent requirement has the unforeseen and undesired effect of denying supplementary financial assistance from the Commonwealth to educational institutions with significant indigenous enrolments. The non&amp;hyphen;government school census showed that, out of a total of 10,853 indigenous students enrolled in non&amp;hyphen;government schools, 1,428—or 13 per cent—of those students attend non&amp;hyphen;systemic schools in which the indigenous enrolments are less than 10 per cent of the total enrolment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Experience has shown that the 10 per cent requirement has excluded some of the very deserving institutions from receiving supplementary funding with respect to their indigenous students. A number of schools in my electorate of Leichhardt were adversely affected by the indigenous education strategic initiative program's 10 per cent requirement. While the number of students and educational workers is not numerically great, the impact of those affected would be profound, especially at St Augustine's College and St Monica's College in Cairns.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         St Augustine's perhaps gives the best example of the need for this amendment bill. So I will focus my remarks on this institution. For 25 years, St Augustine's College in Cairns has actively encouraged indigenous students to enrol and has become Queensland's largest non&amp;hyphen;government provider of education of boys coming from Torres Strait Island communities. In 1997, nearly 10 per cent of all indigenous male students in the non&amp;hyphen;government sector in Queensland attended St Augustine's College.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         During these two decades of service to the far northern indigenous community, the college has recorded some notable achievements, especially among Torres Strait Islander students who form the vast majority of their indigenous enrolment. The following are all firsts, certainly state wide and probably nationally for St Augustine's. They had the first Torres Strait Islander in Australia to obtain a medical degree; the first Torres Strait Islander to obtain a commercial pilot's licence; the first Torres Strait Islander to obtain a diplomatic posting overseas; the first Torres Strait Islander to study architecture; and the first Torres Strait Islander to become a national athletics champion.
        </para>
        <break page="7154" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          They are certainly great achievements because of the way in which they are able to deal with the special needs of these students. While many of these firsts are impressive, far more so are the many hundreds of past indigenous students who have become teachers, psychologists, social workers, artists, tradespersons, community leaders and other productive members of our society. All of these have come from St Augustine's.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Last year, St Augustine's College enrolled between 70 and 85 indigenous students, thus easily meeting the minimum 20 indigenous student enrolment criteria. Because it is such a large school, the percentage of indigenous representation falls below 10 per cent of the college's students. This injustice and inequity, which this amendment will resolve, is highlighted by the fact that another school less than an hour's drive from St Augustine's College with an enrolment of 30 could receive indigenous education strategic initiatives program funding when St Augustine's, with twice the enrolment, is ineligible for any assistance.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Since writing to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) on behalf of St Monica's and St Augustine's on 17 February this year, I have been greatly pleased with the degree of consultation that has occurred leading up to this practical amendment. This amendment bill will remove the requirement for at least 10 per cent of enrolled students to be indigenous before a non&amp;hyphen;government, non&amp;hyphen;systemic preschool, school or vocational education and training institution can be funded under the indigenous education strategic initiatives program. This will enable institutions where there are significant numbers of indigenous students but where these students represent less than 10 per cent of their total enrolments to qualify for funding under the act, as is the case with St Augustine's in Cairns.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Given that the requirement of the act that a school must have a set number of indigenous students—five for preschools and 20 for other institutions—by retaining these minimum thresholds, the government avoids the situation where its money is spread too far and where a great number of schools receive a very small amount which has no real benefit.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Having analysed the implications of removing the minimum enrolment requirement against the cost&amp;hyphen;effectiveness of delivery, the argument against removing the minimum enrolment requirement remained strong. Thus, the amendment leaves in place the requirement for there to be a minimum of 20 students in a non&amp;hyphen;government, non&amp;hyphen;systemic vocational education and training institution and for there to be a minimum of five students in a non&amp;hyphen;government, non&amp;hyphen;systemic preschool. These limits will avoid the administrative expenses of providing small amounts of money to small numbers of scattered students. It will also provide a situation where there will be little or no benefit for individual students from the provision of small grants.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I take note of what the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) said with regard to his intention for the amendment. Initially, I was very much of the same view and argued quite strongly about that. I spoke to a lot of the schools in my area about the possibility of reducing those numbers. While there are some schools with one or two students, they had problems with the small amount of money that we are talking about here on an individual basis. It was impossible for them to set up any specific program that would give a maximum benefit to the students. At least with that limit of 20, there is sufficient funding to get an indigenous specific program in place and to get a very positive outcome.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I am quite happy to talk to you further on that. It was something that I felt was appropriate at the time. But after speaking with the schools, the educators and some of the indigenous communities themselves, they felt that it was probably better that they ensure that the kids
          <break page="7155" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           go to a school where there is that minimum of 20 children so that they have that greater involvement rather than having one or two children in a school where they are not going to get any benefit from these indigenous specific programs. I am certainly happy to talk to you about that later.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The second amendment will permit the adjustment of grants under the indigenous education strategic initiatives program in line with cost increases for the period up to 30 June 2000. The appropriations for these years are in subsections 13B(4), (5), (6) and (7) of the principal act. Inclusion of a cost supplementation provision in the principal act will bring the program into line with other educational programs. I commend the bill to the House.

The background of the amendment relates to amending the Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989. In May 1996, I spoke in this chamber in support of the legislation as introduced by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), through our Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott). We must remember that at that time the government had inherited a very large deficit—a $10 billion deficit. My comment at the time of rising to support that legislation was that it would certainly benefit the people and indigenous students of the Northern Territory.

         This amendment is further good news for the Northern Territory. It is further good news for northern Australia, and it is good news for especially St Phillip's College in central Australia, which will be able to take on an additional 35 indigenous students in the education system. This amendment to the original legislation will provide funding for indigenous students who were previously excluded from funding sources. I am very pleased that Senator Amanda Vanstone has taken up the challenge to provide additional funding for those disadvantaged students. It is very important. The government really must take stock of the documentation that is available in regard to numeracy and literacy in remote parts of Australia. Without a reasonable education, there is certainly no future for any of those children in the remote parts of Australia.

           Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill
          </xref>
          and to sum up on behalf of the government. As speakers have made clear, this bill has essentially two purposes. The first is to remove the requirement that a non&amp;hyphen;government, non&amp;hyphen;systemic school must have 10 per cent of its students as indigenous before it is eligible for funding under this scheme. The second is to provide for supplementary funding in line with increases in the educational price index. It is envisaged that, over the next four years, over $5 million could be provided in addition to the already allocated funding to indigenous education in this way. I think we would all agree that the objectives of the bill are benign and to be applauded.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has raised the very interesting proposition that in fact there should be no restrictions on the number of indigenous students at any non&amp;hyphen;government, non&amp;hyphen;systemic school for money to be paid. I have to say that it is an interesting suggestion and on leaving this place, I will ask the department to look into it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am advised that at this point in time, it is administratively very difficult and the reason for that is that the program in question is very much a performance based program. It is unlike most other programs in the department in that it is very heavily monitored. I am advised that indigenous education supplementary assistance program agreements require rigorous monitoring to show progress against performance targets. Every school that receives funding under this program is required to establish a performance baseline and it is visited at least twice a year by departmental officers in conjunction with Aboriginal consultants to ensure that those performance targets are being met.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am advised that general Commonwealth agreements do not contain these outcome-focussed approaches. Previously under the former government, systemic schools were given a lump sum and they could choose to provide funds to non&amp;hyphen;systemic schools and I am pleased to point out to this chamber that they can still do this. They can still do this under these new legislative proposals.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Each recipient of funds must have an indigenous education agreement. These require monitoring to ensure targets are met. The administrative costs of supporting these extra 260&amp;hyphen;odd agreements is, as I said, unsustainable, as I am advised at the present point in time.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The member for Werriwa has made some interesting comments in his contribution to this bill. I am very happy to ask the department to look again at this issue to explore the possibility of extending these schemes and I will do so.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would point out in conclusion that my understanding is that under this scheme as it operated under the former government, direct grants to non&amp;hyphen;systemic, non&amp;hyphen;government schools were not possible at all and so these government amendments are in fact an extension of the scheme. They are a step in the right direction; they are a step in the direction that the member for Werriwa is seeking so I hope, on that basis, he will support the bill. I hope on the basis that we will have a look at the proposal that he is putting up that the opposition will support the bill.

         Just to pick up the points made by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), I do concede that this bill represents progress. It represents progress to do away with the 10 per cent rule. What I am suggesting is that further progress can be achieved by doing away with the 20&amp;hyphen;student rule. To pick up further the points made by the members for Robertson (Mr Lloyd) and Leichhardt (Mr Entsch), we need to understand, as a parliament, the anomalies that arise from the 20&amp;hyphen;student rule. It now means that a school with 21 indigenous students will be eligible for funding, but a like school with 19 indigenous students will not be eligible for funding.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Surely, there cannot be too much difference in running a successful program between a school with 21 students and one with 19. There cannot be a substantial difference in the management and effectiveness of the program on that scale of student numbers.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Further, I acknowledge the point made by the member for Warringah that systemic schools with students less than 20 could still possibly be eligible under the legal advice that has been received by the department for this program funding.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That again raises a further anomaly. Why should a systemic school with 15 indigenous students be eligible for funding, but a non&amp;hyphen;systemic school in exactly the same circumstances, facing exactly the same schooling needs, not be eligible for program funding? There are anomalies in this that inevitably arise from bureaucrats and politicians in Canberra setting a cut&amp;hyphen;in and a cut&amp;hyphen;out point, an arbitrary number that is determined in the national capital for
         <break page="7160" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          the sorts of judgments and programs that will be run in every single remote school around Australia with a certain number of indigenous students. This is the inevitable problem of cut&amp;hyphen;in and cut&amp;hyphen;out points being determined in Canberra.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What is wrong with making every single school eligible for this program? Then leave it to the school teachers and administration to work out whether or not they want to take up that eligibility; whether or not they want to apply for this particular source of funding. If it is true, as the members for Robertson and Leichhardt have suggested, that it is just not practical for a school with one or two indigenous students to use this funding effectively, let that be the judgment of the school. Let the school decide that, because of those impracticalities, they do not want to take up the funding for one or two students. But for goodness sake, let the school with 18 or 19 students, where something can be gained, make that judgment for themselves and apply for the funding.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The member for Robertson was saying we are talking about a few dollars. I do not think he could possibly have understood the size of the program. We are talking about funds of up to $3,300 at a remote senior secondary school. That, in anyone's language and understanding of the schooling process, is a substantial amount of money. Particularly when you are talking about remote schooling, $3,300 can make a substantial difference.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We are talking about a substantial program. We are talking about anomalies that have been raised in the system. As for this suggestion of the cost of administration, what is this thing in the bureaucracy that always leads us back to a cost argument? How difficult can it be to notify every single school around Australia that there is a program for schools with indigenous students and, if those schools wish and they deem it practical, they can apply for the funding? They can apply for the funding and then Canberra further down the track can call for a report on the output&amp;hyphen;based performance measures and deem whether or not the funding is to be continued. What is this thing that hypnotises parliamentary secretaries and other members of the government based on the judgment of the bureaucracy about cost?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         How hard can it be to send a letter to every school to let them know that the program exists; to allow the school to make the judgment as to whether or not in practical terms they wish to apply for funding; to then allow the school to run the program, seek a report about the performance and then decide whether or not the program should continue at that school? That, to me, does not seem to be an overly complex process of public administration. It seems to me to adopt a principle that it is better to have devolution, and better to have the  people running schools make the judgment about what is best for the school, instead of having this arbitrary cut&amp;hyphen;in and cut&amp;hyphen;out point determined by bureaucrats in Canberra.

         Whatever we might say across the chamber—Labor versus Liberal—I can tell the honourable members opposite one thing. I am a devolver first and foremost.

         The simple truth is that we always have to draw lines and sometimes those lines are somewhat arbitrary. If you earn less than $5,000, you do not pay tax. If you earn more than $5,000—or whatever it is—you do start paying tax. If you earn more than $35,000 a year more or less, you lose or start to lose Austudy.

         The member for Werriwa himself has, I believe, suggested that we should not fund new schools if they do not have more than 50 students. So the member for Werriwa obviously concedes that there are very important circumstances in which we are entitled to make judgments about the viability of programs and institutions. While I accept the, if you like, emotional force of the argument that he has put to us today, I think, when subjected to rigorous scrutiny, the argument looks much less persuasive.

         The thing to remember about assistance under this program is that we are not just writing out a cheque and posting it off to the school and forgetting about it. This is a program which is designed to ensure much better monitoring of performance on the ground. This is a program with performance incentives and performance monitoring built in, at every step of the way. It is not just a matter of posting a cheque and forgetting about it or of slipping a cheque under the door and forgetting about it.

         We are sending people out to all of these schools to ensure that the Commonwealth money, the taxpayers' money, is actually getting the best possible outcome for the people who need it most—namely, the indigenous students of Australia. It is not just a bucketful of money to be distributed in the same way that the old age pension or block grants to the states, or something like that, is distributed. It is performance oriented and precisely targeted.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If we were to take the member for Werriwa's suggestion to its logical conclusion and have no restrictions whatsoever, we would have every school with any indigenous student applying for this money. As the member for Werriwa has pointed out, there are large amounts of money involved, ranging from $300 to $3,300 for individual students. The problem, if we were to go too far down this track, is that the money would essentially become just another cheque in the mail, and that is not the way to go.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We have had too much of the cheque&amp;hyphen;in&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;mail approach in the dealings of the Commonwealth government with our Aboriginal Australians. We need to get away from that. We need to get much more focused on ensuring that the Commonwealth's funding does have a beneficial outcome.

         Having said all that, I do think there is something in what the member for Werriwa says. As I have indicated before, I will happily take it up with the department to see whether it might not be possible to be a little bit more extensive than we are at the moment. As I said, I think what we are doing is reasonable. I think the member himself has conceded that it is an important step in the right direction. For that reason, I trust that, once we have debated these amendments, which is important, the bill can then pass through this committee.

The approach that he is advocating is the one that has failed indigenous Australians for decades, where the non&amp;hyphen;indigenous bureaucrat jumps out of the helicopter to visit the remote school, clipboard in hand, with a checklist of what he or she thinks needs to be done, without regard to the unique circumstances of that school. I find it one of the most unusual things, in my time as shadow minister for education, visiting universities with layers of administration, listening to parliamentary secretaries saying that we cannot trust teachers and school administrators to run their schools effectively without some non&amp;hyphen;indigenous bureaucrat popping out of the helicopter from time to time.

         Surely educators in Australia need to be regarded as some of our best educated people, most articulate, most self&amp;hyphen;confident, most able to get on with the job; most able to get on with the job if they have the trust of government and if they have the trust of public policy. I could not think of a group of Australians who need less checking, less supervision, less monitoring through the process of delivering a vital, social and public good than our educators at universities, at remote schools—right across the education sector. Surely, if government cannot trust educators to get on with the job of effective education in Australia, our whole system of government is broken. That, to me, is the lasting symptom of what we are doing whenever we devise a new cut&amp;hyphen;in or cut&amp;hyphen;out point. We are basically admitting that the processes of governance have broken down to the point that these judgments can only be made in a centralised fashion.

The anomalies that have arisen in Victoria where a government school with 50 students closes one week and the next week, a non&amp;hyphen;government school with 20 students opens up on exactly the same site with exactly the same buildings, do indicate that at least in the establishment of new schools, we need an element of planning. But beyond the establishment of schools, once they are up and running, surely we can then trust our educators to get on with the job. That seems to be a suitable division of responsibility, if you like, in the running of public administration, and I am advocating that.

He has now been corrected by the parliamentary secretary. He was saying that it is wasteful to allocate those funds for schools with just a couple of indigenous students. Let the school make that judgment rather than a member from the Central Coast of New South Wales, or the south&amp;hyphen;western suburbs of Sydney, or anyone else in this chamber, or anyone else running DEETYA here in Canberra.

         I am encouraged that the parliamentary secretary sounds sympathetic. He has taken on board my views and says that he will get back to the department. We have been getting back to the department since Adam was a boy and not a lot of progress has been made for indigenous schooling. I suggest that the parliamentary secretary and his colleagues take control of policy, use commonsense in the public interest and make a judgment that these amendments before the parliament are worth supporting, not because we need to get back to the department for

          the standard advice, but because we have got the commonsense as legislators to recognise their practical application and the sound principles of good governance to devolve away and let the school make the judgment. If they do not want to apply for funds, that is their judgment. If they have got 19 indigenous students and they want to apply for the funding, let them do that and let them get on with the job as well as the school with 21 indigenous students would get on with this particular task.

          —I think that the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) is prepared to trust the teachers but, on the basis of the contribution this morning, he is not so prepared to trust the public servants. We, on this side of the House, are happy to trust to the professional judgment of all the various professionals that we are blessed with in this country, whether they be professional administrators, or professional teachers.

         This government trusts the teachers. I personally have an enormous respect for teachers. Apart from the Maker and my parents, my Jesuitical teachers are responsible for whatever I am. So, I have enormous respect for school teachers. A teacher is a combination of psychologist, sports master, academic and, at times, parole officer and parent. It is a remarkable combination of qualities that good teachers have and we in Australia are lucky that we have so many good teachers.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the earnests of our trust for the teaching profession is the fact that we are prepared to allow new schools to flourish in this country. I think that it would be easier to take the member for Werriwa as seriously as he wants us to take him—and I do take him seriously—if at the same time he was prepared to say that the ALP would not be arbitrary and set this figure of 50 enrolments when it comes to new schools.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To get to the specifics: if we are to go all the way down the path that the member for Werriwa is suggesting, this particular program would simply become extra block funding for Aboriginal students. It would lose its unique quality. The unique quality, the special value&amp;hyphen;adding quality of this program, is that it involves intensive performance monitoring. To have that intensive program monitoring, we have got to have regular visitations from the department with Aboriginal consultants to ensure that the indigenous students at that particular school are getting the improved performance and improved educational outcomes that the taxpayer is entitled to expect for the investment of the dollar. If we were to go down the path advocated by the member for Werriwa inevitably that would be lost. It would be impossible to put that kind of monitoring into schools if they only have one, two or three Aboriginal students.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The fact is that to have a proper indigenous educational program in a school there has to be a certain number of indigenous students. Without that basic number of indigenous students there cannot really be an indigenous&amp;hyphen;specific program, so you will lose the ability to actually target your program specifically to the disadvantages that indigenous students face. It is important to retain some kind of core requirement for providing money to schools under this program.

         But, as I have said several times now, there is something in what the member for Werriwa says, and I will ask the department to look at it. He was understandably somewhat sceptical about parliamentary secretaries saying that they will look into things. I know we all get the reputation of being mirrors around here, Mr Deputy Speaker, because we are always looking into things. He suggested that people have been doing it since Adam was a boy. Yes, perhaps we have, but yet look at all of the marvellous improvements that the world has experienced

          —The opposition supports this legislation which does several things. Firstly, it increases the size of the board of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority from three to four. The opposition is quite comfortable with that proposition, which incidentally is in line with our acceptance of the increase in the size of the CASA board, for which legislation finally went through the parliament not so long ago. The bill also clarifies the matter of the appointment of departmental officials to the board, making it an option—but not necessarily mandatory—for the minister to appoint a departmental official to the board of AMSA.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Secondly, and most importantly, the bill provides for the merger of the two search and rescue authorities that currently operate within Australia—AMSA and Airservices Australia. This merger was announced some time ago by the minister. The opposition at the time indicated agreement in principle with the proposition, although there are some queries—I will get to them shortly—with respect to some of the things that have gone on in the search and rescue area in recent times. But certainly the logic of a single search and rescue organisation is one that the opposition agrees with. Hopefully, the merger will proceed in as worthwhile a way as possible, with the general efficiency and efficacy of search and rescue operations in Australia enhanced as a result.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Finally, the bill amends the Civil Aviation Act in order to ensure that CASA retains full responsibility for the monitoring and setting of safety standards with respect to particular aspects of search and rescue operations. Again, the opposition has no concerns about that amendment.

         I want to make a few brief observations with respect to search and rescue generally. As I indicated in my introductory comments, the opposition has some concerns about recent activities within the search and rescue area that are worth mentioning in the context of this bill, even though, as I have indicated, we support the bill.

         sank off the west coast of Tasmania and one fisherman, Mr Mark Whelan, actually died as a result.

The death of Mr Whelan was the subject of a coronial inquiry which reported, from memory, in November of last year or thereabouts.

          It was alleged by persons unknown within Airservices that original minutes of the meeting which I think was on 22 December between Airservices and AMSA, and which had been approved by AMSA, were then changed in order to soften implicit criticism of AMSA's role in the search and rescue effort with respect to the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

          This issue, in the view of the opposition, remains unresolved. The coroner chose not to directly deal with the matter. It certainly does place some question mark over the operations between the two organisations. It does, of course, indicate that the existence of two separate search and rescue organisations may in fact be seen as a possible cause of this friction or this difficulty. Certainly, if there has been a change in the minutes which is not justified, in order to soften criticism in one of the organisations, that is something that the opposition does have some concern about. As I have indicated, that matter in my view still retains a question mark over it.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          To the best of my knowledge the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) has not followed through the issue to an outright conclusion. I am not sure who will close the debate, whether it will be the minister or the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Ronaldson), but I would be interested to hear an update. If the minister's adviser can take that on board, I would be interested to hear whether the minister has taken any further action or reached any conclusive outcome on that question. I do not want to make too much of the issue, but it is of some concern and it is worth pointing to in this debate.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The second issue which has had a far greater public airing in the search and rescue area is the incredible fiasco surrounding the purchase of the PADS equipment which had some significant debate in the parliament earlier this year. I will not labour too much over the detail of that fiasco but it is worth recalling some of the basic detail. Mr Laurence Gruzman, from Search and Rescue Pty Ltd, came and visited the minister early in his term of office—I think it was in April last year—and demonstrated his search and rescue equipment—

         <para first-indent="16">
          What the program did not mention was that the previous testing of PADS by the RAAF and, indeed, by AMSA had found that even though it was substantially more accurate than the conventional means of dropping life rafts and associated equipment to people stranded at sea,
          <break page="7166" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           it was not safe for those people dropping it—remembering that this occurs from planes flying as low as 100 feet above what is likely to be fairly turbulent seas.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It was a very, very biased report in that program and it contributed to the climate of opinion that the minister was swept along with. He then gave the go&amp;hyphen;ahead to his hand&amp;hyphen;picked appointee, the Chairman of Airservices, Mr John Forsyth, to get moving and give PADS a go. What then happened was that at his very first board meeting, without the matter being on the agenda, the chairman of Airservices obtained approval for up to $1 million to be spent acquiring the PADS equipment, subject to a fly&amp;hyphen;off test between the PADS equipment and the conventional equipment, which subsequently proceeded and which found that PADS was more accurate. The safety concerns that had previously been found did not surface in this particular fly&amp;hyphen;off or were not noticed or not recorded. In any event, Airservices went ahead with the purchase of 104 PADS units.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Incidentally, Airservices went to a training contract with Navair, with a Mr Frank Young, who had been chairman of the evaluation panel in the fly&amp;hyphen;off, to train the Airservices personnel in the use of PADS, but without any tender process and with a figure of $4,000 a week involved in the contract. There were numerous rather murky things associated with this whole deal.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In November last year, during the course of training, it was discovered again that for several reasons PADS was unsafe for those using it and therefore training was suspended. Since that time, Airservices have been working away with varying degrees of cooperation from the proponent of PADS, Mr Gruzman, trying to fix the product.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I am advised that in Senate estimates the other day it was indicated that the total cost to the taxpayer, or to the aviation industry through aviation levies which is probably more accurate, of this fiasco is now approaching $1.7 million, and that does not include an estimate for executive time spent in dealing with the issue. That figure includes the purchase of the units themselves, the cost of training, the cost of evaluations, the cost of warehousing and various other things that are occurring.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          One of the questions that does not appear to have been addressed is: if the units are finally fixed and they are finally made safe and capable of being used, who ultimately is going to bear the cost of fixing the product? In normal circumstances it would be the supplier, the manufacturer. If you are provided with a defective product then normally you have legal rights to ensure that the manufacturer or the supplier bears the cost of fixing these defects.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          So far it does not appear that Airservices have managed to persuade Mr Gruzman that should occur in this case. Clearly, from any rational public policy position, that is precisely what should occur. Legally, Mr Gruzman should be obliged to ensure that the product which he has provided is serviceable or useable for the purpose for which it was presented. It is an old legal concept, a standard legal concept, which still prevails to the best of my knowledge, and it is certainly pertinent in this particular case.

          In summary, it is really a cautionary tale for young ministers as to how not to get carried away by exaggerated media hype that presents one side of the story.

          A minister should assess issues rationally, look back at the history and say, `If the RAAF has tested this thing and has found it to be unsafe, that at least suggests that I had better have a closer look at it before I get too carried away with it. If AMSA has tested it under a former
          <break page="7167" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           Labor minister and said, "No, don't touch it, it is unsafe for those people using it", then, yes, maybe I had better have another close look at it.' Rather that than say to the chairman of Airservices, `Beauty, let's get in a plane. Let's get the flying cap on and get out there and get the enemy and do some double backflips and loop the loops', which is essentially the approach the minister has taken in this and in a variety of other issues.

          Hopefully, he will learn from this fiasco. When he has got some excitable individuals promoting all sorts of interesting things and telling him about the great glories of free enterprise and how the bureaucrats are blocking them and there are all sorts of wonderful opportunities here and it is all a Labor plot, hopefully he will be a little bit more sceptical in the future. Hopefully, he will look closely at what has been going on and what the situation actually is and form a calm judgment about what is in the interests of the Australian aviation industry or the Australian taxpayer and the Australian public in general.

         <para first-indent="16">
          In conclusion, and with those reservations on matters related to the conduct of search and rescue issues by the current minister, in the view of the opposition the bill itself is unexceptional. We would hope that the merger can be completed with the minimum disruption. Mergers of this nature are always problematic for a lot of legitimate reasons, but hopefully this merger can be completed without serious disruption to the very important task of pursuing the search and rescue protection for Australians and ensuring that, for those people who are lost at sea, there is every possibility that they will be saved and looked after and in the quickest possible time.

          is sensible legislation that has allowed the civil maritime and aviation search and rescue coordination functions to be brought together into one national centre. In fact, I attended the opening of the new facility in Canberra recently. The facility, called AusSAR, the Australian Search and Rescue Organisation, was opened by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp). At the opening, the attitude of staff to their coming together into one operation was very positive. The fact that they could talk with the people—with whom they were used to talking on phones, via faxes, and those sorts of things—within the one operation was a great step forward as far as they were concerned. It makes a lot of sense to bring together the two arms of our rescue coordination.

         Having 47 million square kilometres to look after—about one&amp;hyphen;ninth of the earth's surface—is a huge responsibility for Australia. Most of that area is ocean. So search and rescue in the ocean will undoubtedly normally involve both sea and air functions. Bringing these together is going to make life a lot easier for people coordinating future search and rescue operations. Good coordination in any rescue operation is absolutely paramount. If the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing, trouble will ultimately eventuate.

         Although AusSAR did not have direct involvement in the recent Thredbo tragedy, the rescue operation that took place was an excellent example of the good coordination I just spoke of. Honourable members will remember that I spoke in the House earlier this week about the Thredbo tragedy. I would like to take the opportunity, in speaking to this legislation, to expand on some of those things in relation to the actual rescue operation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I said on Monday, there were many rescue services involved in this operation—ambulance services, state emergency services, police, fire brigade, bushfire brigade, plus many more. With so many different services involved, and members of those organisations coming
         <break page="7168" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          from all over New South Wales and the ACT, as well as other states, it was crucial that the coordination be finetuned, and it was.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I made the comment on Monday that watching them work was inspiring, and I did not say that lightly. The excellent coordination was enhanced by the fact that the rescue workers worked in teams made up of people from each of the main rescue services. Instead of having ambulance people working in one place and emergency service people working in another place, there was a multiservice, multiskilled team working together.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I understand that the services had been training along these lines for some time and the Thredbo tragedy was one of the first situations where this technique could be put in place. It proved to be very successful. Once again, I highlight the contribution made by the police commander in charge of the overall coordination, Charlie Sanderson. It worked quite superbly.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are two other aspects of the rescue that I also want to highlight—firstly, the quality and competency of the personnel involved and, secondly, the technical aspects. I will deal first with the personnel. I spent a fair bit of time just getting around the site talking to the various people—the ambulance people, the police people, the SES people—and the quality of their work, their experience, the way in which they really put their minds to the job was excellent.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think we can be very proud of the competency of those people when you consider the harsh conditions that they were actually working in. Probably most members saw plenty of the footage on TV, but it is almost impossible to describe to you just how difficult it was on that site. It seems, in Australia, whether we are talking about search and rescue in the oceans of the Antarctic or a rescue like this, we really can come against some extraordinary circumstances and some extraordinary sites.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Certainly, the Thredbo site was one of those—the steepness of it, the fragility of it. As one of the rescue workers described to me very early on, it was like working on an unset jelly which was at an angle of something like about 60 degrees—and almost 90 degrees vertical in parts. When you think of trying to move your way around that sort of site with enormous slabs of concrete in a virtual card&amp;hyphen;deck pattern down that slope, you can get some sort of feel for how difficult it was. If you then throw into that equation, particularly at night, temperatures of minus nine and minus 10, you can appreciate the difficulties of working in those conditions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Many of the people worked long hours, depending on the role that they were playing in the particular rescue. It may have been only a couple of hours. In certain cases, you just could not have somebody in a position like that for more than a couple of hours at a time. Other people were there for eight, 10 or 12 hours at a time. It was quite amazing.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If I could use one individual as an example of the competency and confidence that was there, it would be an ambulance worker, Paul Featherstone, whose name many would have seen mentioned. He was the ambulance man that was down under the site with Stuart Diver for about 12 hours straight. I met him on the Sunday after they had gotten Stuart Diver out and I did not realise that he was the person who had been down there. My wife and I were talking to him for some time. He was very mild&amp;hyphen;mannered and just oozed confidence and competence. It was quite extraordinary. I would not have thought he was the person who had been there because it was the Sunday morning after, and, after what he had been through the day before, I would have thought that he would be taking a couple of days rest but he was back there on the site. It was not until the next day—on the Monday—when I picked up one of the newspapers, which carried a photo of him and mentioned that he was the person, that I realised
         <break page="7169" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          that he was there. But that is the quality of people we had in that rescue that Australia should be very proud of.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other aspect I want to raise is the technology involved. We had all sorts of monitoring equipment such as listening devices and heat&amp;hyphen;sensing equipment. The member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), who might be following me, comes from a mining area on the south coast. I think there were people probably from his electorate as well—experts in mining operations—down there giving advice. That technical aspect was very important.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I spent a bit of time with some old colleagues of mine, surveyors who were on the site, watching what they were doing as far as monitoring the site. There were surveyors who came from private firms in Cooma and the coast as well as from Canberra, plus government surveyors, working around the clock, continually watching for any slight movement in any part of the site. If that had occurred, they could have pulled people off because we always had the propensity to lose even more people. The last thing we wanted was rescue workers being among the victims. The use of that technology was quite incredible.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the other technology aspects that proved to be very successful was the use of helium filled balloons. These were suspended over the site with halogen lights inside. As soon as it started to get dark, these came on and gave the most superb lighting over the site. It was almost like daylight—very few shadows are created by these lights. Once again, it was technology developed in Australia and probably used for the first time in that type of operation. For future search and rescue it will be a valuable resource.

         Many people will remember the miraculous rescue of the British lone sailor Tony Bullimore from his overturned yacht in Antarctic waters. Many people will also recall the rescue of a French woman in similar circumstances some years ago. Most of these rescues cause an enormous amount of controversy, mainly over the huge cost which is involved. But just as we would expect other nations to come to the aid of Australian nationals in distress—and, indeed, under international maritime law it is required—it is also an obligation that we carry to come to the aid of others who find themselves in distress within our area.

         If there is one criticism that I agree with in regard to organisation of around&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;world yacht races, it is that, instead of having people sail so close to the South Pole, they should sail closer to the Australian coastline. After all, it is Australia that is in the end responsible for the rescue should anything unfortunate come about. More can be done by locals themselves to ensure their safety at sea by making sure that their craft is fully equipped with radio, flares and life jackets. Despite the requirements of this today, many people go out to sea without this important equipment.

         It is also important that people understand and respect the elements. I am particularly aware of this, as my electorate has a large coastline, and many people travel to my electorate from western suburbs of Sydney at weekends and holiday periods to put to sea. When they leave western Sydney the weather could be fine, but in a matter of a few hours of travelling time, the seas off Shellharbour and Port Kembla can be whipped up and dangerous. All too often, because these people have travelled so far, they are determined to put to sea, often with disastrous and tragic consequences.

         I well remember a few years back it happened that during a search and rescue operation it took several days to locate the boat.

The boat was overcrowded and should never have been put to sea.

         Australia has accepted responsibility for search and rescue for an area of 47 million square kilometres. This represents approximately 11 per cent of the earth's surface. On anyone's reckoning this is a huge expanse for any search and rescue organisation to monitor.

         Until 1 July 1997, the coordination of civil maritime search and rescue services was undertaken by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. AMSA was obliged to perform this function in a manner consistent with Australia's international convention obligations under the Convention for Safety of Life at Sea (1974) and the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue (1979).
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Until the same time, the coordination of civil aviation search and rescue services was undertaken by Airservices Australia. AA had obligations to perform this function consistent with obligations under the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation. AMSA performed its coordinating functions from Canberra, while AA operated its functions from Melbourne and Brisbane. A series of amendments to existing legislation in the maritime and aviation areas has already been made to merge civil aviation and maritime search and rescue into one organisation, now to be known as AusSAR within AMSA. This bill puts the merged arrangements operating since June onto a clear legislative footing. The creation of a single search and rescue organisation is a logical and sensible step.

          I know that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) announced this in a media release on 15 January 1997.

Like another consultant's report highlighted last week in the

We have had no disasters such as they have occasionally had in Europe with the cross&amp;hyphen;Channel ferries.

          being debated here today is about two decades late. That we have managed to pull off some notable search and rescue ventures has been due to the tenacity and the dedication of professionals in the field rather than by good management. This is not to deride the teamwork that has been carried out in Australia by our air and seaborne search and rescue operators; quite the contrary. They do a remarkable job considering the lack of communication between the two separate organisations which make up our national search and rescue unit.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have also had the bizarre situation where our search and rescue operations are split into three different headquarters in three different states. This bill enables the government to finally
         <break page="7173" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          create one national search and rescue body, one organisation that can harness the facilities and expertise which are now shared between Airservices Australia and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. It will also improve the degree of communication between each of these organisations.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A classic example of the lack of coordination and the difficulty under which our men and women in the field have had to work is the fact that our aircraft and our ships at sea do not use the same radio frequency. A classic example of this was in January 1995 when the world watched with bated breath as we searched for lone French sailor Isabelle Autissier. With her yacht dismasted, she was drifting in rough seas between Australia and the Antarctic. To make it even more difficult, the battery on her emergency locating beacon went flat. Miss Autissier was the only woman in that round the world race and that attracted further attention. A Royal Australian Air Force Orion circled above her but could not communicate directly with the ships that were in the area.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That high profile, internationally publicised search and rescue revealed to the world the ridiculous lack of coordination between our air and sea rescue teams. Fortunately, it was successful, but at great cost and risk to those men and women who were out there braving horrendous conditions. The amalgamation of Airservices, run from Melbourne and Brisbane, with the Maritime Safety Authority, run from Canberra, will improve the degree of communication, speed up rescue response times and save more lives.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That our national search and rescue system has been severely hampered by lack of communication has not gone unnoticed by organisations such as Sydney's Cruising Yacht Club. As organiser of the internationally acclaimed blue water classic the Sydney to Hobart yacht race, the club chose to establish its own search and rescue system. They simply installed marine frequency radios in all the helicopters covering the race. As a result, the race organisation has established the best safety net possible and yachts at sea are covered at all times by some form of communication watch. The lack of radio communication is just one classic example of how fragmented our national search and rescue system has been. Often it has been the case of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing because they belong to different bodies.

         In my lifetime I have seen aircraft control at major airports go from red and green flares—quite literally a puff of smoke—to navigation systems which can guide a pilot from London onto the ground and right to the gate at the Sydney airport. Modern electronic and satellite communication systems quite literally mean that there is no hiding place left in the world. Such a device led the efficient Maritime Safety Authority rescue operators to yachtsman Tony Bullimore eating chocolate bars as he crouched in the dark in his upturned yacht in the Southern Ocean. But radios, mobile telephones, satellite homing devices, lights, whistles and bells are of little value if no&amp;hyphen;one can hear them. The situation becomes more tragic when, even if these devices do send out an SOS, there is an argument over which organisation has the job of mounting the rescue operation.

         I do not wish to go into a litany of mismanaged search and rescue operations, as too many people have suffered and still suffer because we failed.

Yet both within parliament and the public arena, we have seen years of brawling within our air and sea rescue organisations.

          —I am pleased to see this legislation before the committee. One should not underestimate the difficulties in amalgamating two organisations that have come together to form AusSAR. It is something that could have happened many years ago but for some of the professional rivalries that existed between the air service sectors and the marine coordination sector. The one thing that must not happen is that those differences that do exist to some extent at the moment not be overcome. They can be overcome. They must be overcome in the interests of marine and aviation search and rescue. The really important people are the people for whom we search and the people who depend upon this unit to provide that search and rescue service.

         When one looks through the Australian Maritime Safety Authority annual report for last year at the area that has been covered by Australia, we are responsible under international conventions for 1/9th of the world's surface. That stretches from a point in the north&amp;hyphen;west right out towards Cocos Islands—we have carried out rescues beyond Cocos Islands of yachtspersons—and in the north&amp;hyphen;east out beyond Fiji, and in the south&amp;hyphen;east to a point which, when I look at the map, I cannot even determine a landmass to identify it with because it is so far. The area is 47,000 square kilometres. With a nation like Australia and the resources we have, we have an enormous task in global terms. The rest of the world depends upon us to come to their rescue in the time of crisis.

         Now that the satellite systems, Cospas&amp;hyphen;Sarsat, are in place and in operation, the area that the satellite passes is the range of Australia just west of Albany to some distance east of Wellington, New Zealand. There is a one&amp;hyphen;hour catchment period. In other words, if an EPIRB or an emergency position indicating radio beacon or an emergency location transmitter on an aircraft is triggered, it will be a maximum of one hour before that signal is picked up by a passing satellite. As you go further out, east or west, in all directions from the compass, the time limits go out from one hour to two hours. If it is triggered in Fiji and it is picked up here, it could be up to a maximum of two hours—it does not have to, it will depend on where the satellite is in its transit around the globe—before that signal would be picked up by the passing satellite.

         The area goes out at the furthest point, as I mentioned, to beyond the Cocos Islands or to the far south&amp;hyphen;east of Australia where the maximum period before the signal would be picked up by the passing satellites would be six hours.

         We also need to understand that there is a clear division of responsibilities. Media make great moment of crisis, of sensationalism, and of search and rescue particularly. There is an expectation, built up because of the success of Australian search and rescue services over the years, that if you are missing, you must be found; not that if you are missing, you may be found. The expectation that has built up in the minds of many people, certainly in the minds of many of the media, is that if somebody is missing, they must be found, otherwise the service is deficient. It does not necessarily follow that if you are missing, you are going to be found. Australia, through its professionalism and the range of assets and equipment available, will do its absolute best to ensure that you are found and successfully rescued.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But the key to all of this, the starting point, is the preparedness of the persons themselves. If people go down to the sea in small boats that are overloaded, underfuelled and not carrying radios, not having submitted a plan or told somebody where they are going and when they expect to return and not having checked on the weather conditions to ensure that the journey they want to undertake can be undertaken safely in those weather conditions, then they are going to have a problem and their loved ones will have a problem. When they go missing it will not be the fault of the searchers or the rescuers, it will be the fault of a lack of preparedness. Preparedness on the part of the voyager is priority one. Then we come in with the professionalism of Australia's services.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We need to remember always, in all of the sensationalism that attaches to some of these magnificent rescues and searches, that the searchers and rescuers put their own lives on the line almost all of the time. Their lives are at risk. In the search to locate the missing person, we have to bear in mind the dangers that are imposed upon the people carrying out the actual search and later the rescue.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We should also remember that the area of jurisdiction is very clear. Territorial seas and inland waters are the responsibility of the state authority. Beyond the territorial sea limit, it is the responsibility of the federal government. We pick up that responsibility as a nation through the international maritime conventions to which we subscribe. I referred to that earlier. If we look at what is shore based, in respect of hikers, land vehicles, all pleasure craft and fishing vessels at sea, responsibility begins with the police. At any point in an area of state jurisdiction, the state authority can turn to the federal authority—now AusSAR—and ask them to accept responsibility for the further conduct of the search and of the rescue. That happens quite frequently.

         In respect of defence aircraft, it is the responsibility of the RAAF. In respect of vessels other than those for which police and defence forces are responsible, it is the responsibility of AMSA. In respect of Royal Australian Navy ships and submarines and all Australian Defence Force shipborne naval aircraft, it is the responsibility, in the primary instance, of the Royal Australian Navy. But there is a tremendous amount of teamwork that goes on across those agencies. The system could not function without that teamwork.

         I had the pleasure a couple of years ago in Newcastle of meeting the French yachtswoman that we rescued in 1994. That was a successful search and rescue and it was pilloried in some quarters because of the expense. But people who make those kinds of comments, particularly journalists, have very short memories. We are party to international conventions, we accept those responsibilities, and we expect, as Australians, that other parties to those international conventions will similarly come to the assistance of Australians when they are in distress.

         —the yacht off the north&amp;hyphen;east of Australia in which four Australians perished. Those people came from just south of Newcastle, south of Lake Macquarie. There was a great deal of publicity about it and a great deal of criticism about weather conditions and what kinds of rafts could have been dropped, but it does not help anybody to rake over those memories other than to express our deepest sympathy for the families of the four persons who were lost.

         What was conveniently forgotten was that, at that time, the French navy sent a frigate from Noumea right out almost to the boundary of their area of responsibility. There were French aircraft involved in the search for and location of those people. Where the tragedy occurred was in the weather conditions and in the dropping of equipment to those people. It is a two&amp;hyphen;way process. It is all very well to make comments about what Australia expends. I would ask people who make those comments to think about the ignominy and the abuse that would have been heaped upon Australia internationally had we followed the advice of some people back in January who said, `Bad luck, it is a private yacht race. They are on their Pat Malone. We are not going to spend taxpayers' dollars in doing anything about their rescue.' That did not happen. What happened is that young Australians from the Marine Rescue Coordination Centre—as it was known then and now AusSAR—the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force achieved a level of performance which is unsurpassed in rescue and search at sea.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Their performance demonstrated to the rest of the world in a way that it could not otherwise be demonstrated that Australian trained aviators and Australian trained mariners are of world class—we are absolutely world class. That is why they are in demand as airline pilots around the world; that is why our officers are in demand on ships around the world. If it is a difficult task you call for an Australian; if it is a complex task you call for an Australian. In those rescues we proved not only our support for those conventions that we subscribe to but we showed the rest of the world just how well Australians are able to perform as individuals—their professionalism, their competence—and how well we are able to perform as a team.

         As I said earlier, not every search results in locating the missing person and not every rescue attempt is successful. The prime factor is the preparedness of those who want to go to sea or those who fly. It was very clear in this case that the preparedness of the yachtspeople themselves was a major factor in their survival. Had they not had the gear that they were wearing and had they not had the radio and equipment to help locate them, then they would

         Let me contrast the other side of it for you, Mr Deputy Speaker. If one of those RAAF Neptune aircraft had gone in with its crew of 10, then the much lauded success in rescuing Tony Bullimore—to which I have been referring in the last instance—would have become blazing headlines. It would have been referred to as an unmitigated disaster and unmitigated incompetence in even attempting the rescue.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In this area of search and rescue, looking at the annual report of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, I note that, whilst the growing usage of distress beacons shows an improvement in the success rate in search and rescue techniques, there has also been an increase in false distress alerts or in undetermined causes of beacon alerts. In fact, in 1995&amp;hyphen;96, 96.4 per cent of distress alerts were undetermined or false. In some cases, particularly on small boats, the EPIRBs go off by somebody bumping them or flicking them on to see whether they work. That triggers off the whole process in Canberra and sets in operation the AusSAR centre. An enormous expense is generated because of that.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In 1995&amp;hyphen;96, there were some 6,608 search and rescue incidents, of which 79 led to search activity. That was an increase of 21.5 per cent over 1994&amp;hyphen;95. They resulted in the rescue of 108 people, and that was a decrease of 25 per cent on the previous year. The best year would be when no search was necessary. That would mean proper preparedness: if people took proper account of weather and maintained proper communication, they would not have the unfortunate problem of finding themselves in crisis.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Looking through the search and rescue performance statistics, we can see the changes that have taken place in performance and effectiveness. Looking at the dollar amounts, the number of persons rescued and the effectiveness of the rescue in a reporting period, in 1991&amp;hyphen;92, the amount is $119 rising, in 1996&amp;hyphen;97, to $138. If we look under EPIRB usage, the total number of searches resulting from EPIRB alerts fell from 70 per cent to 66 per cent between 1991&amp;hyphen;92 and 1996&amp;hyphen;97. The total number of searches resolved was 97.65 per cent. Switching to the next column, the total search duration cost for aircraft under EPIRBs is $350.72. This is analysed in all those documents in the performance figures of the organisation and the effectiveness of the search. As I said, the best search is when no search is necessary.

         I am very pleased that this legislation is before us. I am pleased that the two organisations have been brought together. In the past, the aviation rescue coordination centres in Brisbane and Melbourne have always been involved. The actual coordination of all the elements was done by what was then the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre, but now AusSAR. They determine the search area. They work out the grid. They take account of sea currents, weather conditions and times—all of the factors involved. If members have not had a chance, they ought to look at that centre and its databases in operation. They are absolutely world class.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         They take account of all that information. They determine the grid areas to be searched. They then use it to task the aviation rescue coordination centres to arrange the aircraft. It is passed over to the aviation rescue coordination centre. They task the aircraft, be they civil or defence, on the grids and the frequency to be searched. In this operation, all the officers are together in one room—some people are at one end; some are at the other end. This will produce a much better quality search and rescue service for people who need help in times of crisis. It is going to save money but, most importantly, we will have a better service.

          Supplementing that is a network of civil search and rescue units. There are in excess of 30 of those; I have one in my own electorate, Aeropelican at Belmont. At each of those units there are civilians trained in aerial search and rescue and drops, and stores of equipment are maintained there. There are rafts and beacons, all the equipment that is necessary. All that equipment is located at the airport. The people are trained regularly and they attend refresher courses.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          When a crisis occurs, when now AusSAR calls on a search to be carried out, at those 30&amp;hyphen;plus centres around Australia the stocks of equipment are ready, there are people with the right skills ready to participate in the search, and all that will now be controlled out of one room. It makes good sense. It is going to be a more efficient service, but most of all it is going to improve further the capacity of the centre to carry out a successful search and rescue operation. To those who depend upon this service, they will know that these searchers can give their very best and take the greatest risks that are reasonable.

         <para first-indent="16">
          However, at the end of the day the most important factor is the preparedness of the person who goes to sea or hops on an aircraft that may or may not be airworthy, or that may or may not have sufficient fuel on board. Those people who generate the problem in the first instance, those people who effectively are putting their lives and the lives of their passengers at risk, should spare a thought for the dangers that are then created for the searchers and the rescuers. I am pleased to support the bill.

         This bill emanates from a review that was initiated by this government last year to look at the costs and benefits that might arise from a rationalisation of the Commonwealth's civil maritime and aviation search and rescue functions into one national coordination centre. The current coordination functions are split between state and territory police services, industry and volunteers. Someone earlier on indicated that that worked very well in the recent disaster in Thredbo as far as the coordination of emergency services went in that specific location and that sort of emergency, but search and rescue at sea, and particularly in the region that is being covered, requires better coordination than that.

         There are clearly defined benefits which will accrue from the amalgamation of these services. It will facilitate the development of a national strategic overview of civil search and rescue.

         A great deal of research has gone on prior to the drafting of this bill to establish this new service. I know that the previous speaker alluded to the rescue that took place in the Southern Ocean of the yachtsmen involved in that round the world race. There was a great deal of public comment across Australia as to what Australia's responsibilities are, what they should be and should we be spending a lot of taxpayers' dollars with regard to search and rescue involving foreign nationals.

         It is important to note that, as a nation, we are signatories to a number of international conventions that require our involvement in these operations. Certainly, the responsibility fell on Australia at the time to conduct the search and rescue operation for those people. I am sure they appreciated it. I think I saw in the media recently that the Englishman, Tony Bullimore, is back at sea in another single&amp;hyphen;handed race at the moment. As the previous speaker did indicate, those people in that race certainly took all precautions as far as the seaworthiness of their craft and the safety equipment that they had on board were concerned, because those precautions kept them alive until the Australian search and rescue organisations could complete the task.

         We are bound under international conventions and have an obligation to provide search and rescue services for seafarers in an area that covers about 11 per cent of the world's surface. I suppose that is just a result of where we are located in the Southern Hemisphere, as a very large island continent in the Southern Ocean. As I mentioned, it is interesting that we are responsible for maintaining search and rescue operations over 11 per cent of the world's surface.

         I also made mention of the responsibility of surveillance authorities and what should be done to ensure that ships and ocean&amp;hyphen;going vessels are seaworthy and that aircraft are airworthy. It is interesting to note what the government is doing with regard to substandard shipping. It has been the government's policy to ensure that the highest standards of safety are maintained in shipping in Australian ports and waters. To reduce the use of substandard shipping in Australian waters, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority undertakes rigorous port state control inspections of foreign ships visiting Australian ports. AMSA's inspection rates have steadily increased. In 1996 nearly 60 per cent of eligible ships—that is, those not inspected by AMSA during the previous six months, or three months for passenger ships—were inspected compared with 55 per cent in 1995. Port state control is proving to be an effective means of combating the use of substandard shipping. In 1996, the average detention rate of vessels fell to 8.5 per cent from 9.6 per cent in 1995.

         This bill will do a number of things. Firstly, it will allow backdated accreditation approvals for pathology operators, thereby avoiding problems with Medicare benefits eligibility due to administrative delays.

         Secondly, it will increase the penalty for pathology collection centres that do not display the accreditation notice.

Fourthly, it will allow the Health Insurance Commission to impose penalties for minor infringements.

         The bill builds on last year's reform package in which the government and the Australian pathology profession struck a deal to control costs. Last year's deal itself built on the former Labor government's initiatives to control pathology expenditure, and that deal has our support. The fact that another agreement has been reached and another deal done to ensure that inappropriate practices are stamped out, also has the support of the opposition.

          In many ways, this bill highlights the difference though between constructive reforms to Medicare, which I am delighted to see in this bill, and the sort of negative attacks on Medicare which unfortunately have been made far more common under this government. We have seen a freeze on Medicare rebates in 1996; a 10 per cent cut for certain high cost procedures, including eye and knee surgery; a 10 per cent cut to families who need to use IVF services, and a 50 per cent cut to certain psychiatry rebates. We have seen the closure of 43 Medicare offices throughout the country, making it harder for people to claim their Medicare rebates.

          Finally, we saw the government seeking a massive $700 million cutback in last year's budget and an effort to introduce a system of therapeutic group premiums in a manner that bypassed the parliament by way of regulation which was not disallowable in the Senate.

          The opposition is also pleased to see that the measures that are contained in the bill have been agreed with the pathology profession.

           Health Insurance (Pathology Services) Amendment Bill 1997
          </xref>
          has been prompted by the successful negotiation of a three&amp;hyphen;year agreement between the Commonwealth government and the pathology industry. The essence of the agreement, which commenced on 1 July 1996, is to cap expenditure for pathology on the Medicare benefits scheme and keep it to predetermined amounts over the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 and 1998&amp;hyphen;99 periods.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The cap for expenditure was set at six per cent; and last year, for the first time, pathology was able to keep Medicare benefits growth below six per cent. As a consequence, pathology providers were able to gain another six per cent rise in Medicare benefits. The industry has become self&amp;hyphen;regulatory, and because of the agreement the government now knows what growth will be. Growth in costs in 1996&amp;hyphen;97 was significantly lower than under the previous government. The industry is using innovative solutions which introduce new procedures, and they in turn save on costs. The savings thus made will release funds for other programs, such as our immunisation and mental health programs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The profession is also working with the Health Insurance Commission to look at ways to target inappropriate practices. The bill seeks to strengthen the power of the Health Insurance Commission to enforce the provisions of the act relating to pathology. It strengthens a provision relating to the licensing scheme for pathology specimen collection centres to ensure
         <break page="7182" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          that a notice establishing that the centre is licensed is clearly visible, thus deterring the operation of unlicensed centres. Licensed centres now have to display their licence number, so pathology laboratory providers know that their competitors are operating licensed premises.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Giving the Commonwealth, through the Health Insurance Commission, the power to prescribe penalties for minor pathology offences in regulations will assist enforcement of regulations. The Australian Association of Pathology Practitioners thinks that is a great idea. At present, the Health Insurance Commission has to go through the court system under criminal law, and it is almost impossible to collect evidence suitable for a criminal court. Infringements will now be dealt with as civil actions, and the Health Insurance Commission will be able to impose penalties.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The pathology industry in Australia on the whole is very well regarded throughout the world. We have a national accreditation scheme, a good level of quality and very uniform standards across the nation. Because of these high standards it is necessary to make sure that the few people who do not comply with the regulations are brought to accountability.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill also seeks to strengthen the provisions of the act to clearly prevent an approved pathology practitioner entering into arrangements whereby inducements or kickbacks are provided to a medical practitioner or entrepreneur. It removes any ambiguity in a current provision relating to the occupation by a pathology company of premises owned by a medical practitioner or entrepreneur.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         An example of an arrangement which the bill seeks to deter is one where an approved pathology practitioner enters into an arrangement with a medical practitioner or entrepreneur for the use or occupation of premises, but merely oversees the use of premises through agents or employees and provides kickbacks to the medical practitioner or entrepreneur by way of rent.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, the exercise is not to make it harder for patients to access a collection centre. In many ways this will provide more service centres, better services and reduced costs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The amendment to allow for the payment of Medicare benefits in some circumstances for services provided by a pathology provider who is out of date was agreed upon by the Australian Association of Pathology Practitioners. Pathology has very regulated laboratories and the laboratories have to register every 12 months. Sometimes the paperwork does not reach its destination in the right time frame. This will also protect against the Health Insurance Commission and the health department which may on occasions miss processing an application. This amendment allows for these possibilities.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The laboratories will have up to one month to gain application approval. However, the minister must be satisfied that it is in the public interest to backdate that approval. For example, bills from one pathology laboratory were signed off by a resident pathologist. However, it was realised that he, being new to the position, had not yet been recognised by the Health Insurance Commission. This could have had a dramatic effect on the pathology company, who would not have been eligible for Medicare benefits, and for the patients, who would not have received their rebate. The problem was quickly rectified, however. But, under this amendment, these hiccups can be dealt with comfortably.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Australian Association of Pathology Practitioners is very supportive of the amendment. It has been discussed at length by the Pathology Consultative Committee. Many challenges within the industry are being identified and the cooperative efforts of the concerned committees are shown in this bill. I commend the bill to the House.

          —In this bill, we address a number of challenges which the Medicare and health systems have faced in Australia for some time. The challenges include issues such as medical fraud and overservicing and questions of how we contain the costs of the Medicare system and, indeed, the health bill of the nation as a whole.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These are issues that are very serious. They have been around for many years. They require us to think about ways and means in which we as a nation can bring the health bill under control but provide the services which the people of the nation need for good health.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We need to begin with the premise that good health is a fundamental right that people have in a democratic and civilised society. We also need to accept the fact that in Australia we have finally come to a bipartisan position that we believe in universal health care.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Given those two principles—the right to basic health and a belief in universal health care—we then have to look at ways and means of delivering that universal health care while containing the costs to a reasonable level. That is not easy. In a whole range of areas, we have had problems. This bill deals with some of the most complex issues that we have had.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For example, on the one hand you want to be able to provide the services to everyone who needs them. On the other hand, you have the problem of the pressure for overservicing and even for fraudulent practice. Some people feel that the medical professions should not only be a guarantee of a good living, but should be a guarantee of an exorbitant living. In that situation you can easily get to the point where services are very costly. There is overservicing and there can be a situation of connivance and collusion between certain practitioners and the providers of subsidiary services, such as pathology.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is in that context that we have this bill. In general, we support the thrust of the bill. But I want to make the observation that these matters are not going to be dealt with just simply by legislation, just simply by saying, `Here are some rules, here are some regulations. We are going to give the HIC significantly increased powers,' as this bill does, `to be able to check things, to be able to ban certain activities, to be able to put into place measures to deal with excesses on the part of providers of pathology services.' All of those things are there, and they are welcome.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But I do not believe that we will really get to the heart of the problem until we start to focus again the attention of the nation on what the real meaning of medical practice is and what the real meaning of the provision of these services is. These services are there for those people who need them. They are not there for people to exploit them to make money unnecessarily. Unfortunately, there are people in the community who keep doing this with the medical profession and with these subsidiary services, and we do need to deal with that problem.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When I was first elected to parliament years ago—sometimes too many years ago—I recall that I was on the Public Accounts Committee. Its major inquiry at that time was an inquiry into medical fraud and overservicing—a massive inquiry, a huge issue and big reports. Finally the government did something about it—this was in the last term of the Fraser government—and when we came into government later we also took it up and we put into place a number of measures. But it appears that the more measures you put into place, the more you find that, a bit like the taxation system, there are ways and means of getting around the measures. For example, this bill refers to certain activities by some pathologists where there is a form of kick&amp;hyphen;backs to practitioners by having shared offices or other shared facilities and privileges, therefore getting around what might be called the `blunt' bribe but actually having an indirect impact in terms of an incentive for particular services to be proceeded with.
        </para>
        <break page="7184" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          I said there needs to be a change in our culture. There are certain elements that are required for that. The first is that we need a lot more public appreciation of the great work which the bulk of medical practitioners do, especially those involved in very difficult work in the hospitals, public and  private, where a lot of hard decisions have to be made about operations and about the right way to go ahead in a difficult case. I do not think we sufficiently appreciate the dilemmas which doctors have and the hard decisions that they have to make, especially in these situations. So it is very important that the public starts to appreciate medical practitioners more than we have in recent times.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There was a time when to be a doctor was probably the highest occupation in the land. That is no longer the case. That is partly to do with some of these bad doctors, but it is also partly to do with a general cynicism in the society about public service, about service to the community, where the only sign of status and respect in the community increasingly becomes how many dollars you have rather than what contribution you are making to the community. If the medical profession falls for that situation, where individual doctors and specialists seek to gain status not on the basis of their contribution to the community, but on the basis of their income and of keeping up with the Joneses on very high incomes, then we are going to get into an incredible problem in this country in terms of medical practice and the costs of health. So the government and the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), who I know is always well&amp;hyphen;meaning, should be looking at a program of greater recognition of the good work of doctors and specialists.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          With respect to those carrying out the specialised services, I noticed that there has been some problem about those who are licensed and those who are not licensed. Perhaps the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) can explain it to me. I do not understand why unlicensed people should be in this area at all. Why don't we have a more competitive system of licensing and have everybody licensed? If you are not licensed, you just do not do it. I would like to know what the answer is to that question from the minister and perhaps it could be taken on board to do something about that.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Even with the licensed and approved pathology authorities, we obviously need a situation in which we control the cost of this. Of course, there are difficult questions. You cannot say to a doctor, `Only these tests are necessary and those ones are not.' But there is no doubt that there has been some conniving in this area, where people have had unnecessary tests and where, unfortunately, in some cases, individual doctors have received inducements and incentives to have those tests. I believe we have to do something more to tackle that issue.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This is not to say that I do not agree with the provisions of the bill. I think the bill goes some way towards achieving that. But, as I said, you do not just tackle it by law enforcement. You also tackle it by creating a different atmosphere and a different spirit in terms of the socio&amp;hyphen;cultural rewards for people in the medical professions, including pathologists, in relation to what they are doing. If the community can get a greater cognisance of that and if the government can encourage that, then I think we will have less propensity for these actions to occur.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Maybe I am being a bit idealistic here, but I do think that we can try and encourage in our society, not only in this area of medicine but in other areas, a greater sense of community and public contribution. We need society to recognise that a lot more than they have done to this point.

          —Before I speak specifically to the Health Insurance (Pathology Services) Amendment Bill 1997, I would like to pick up on a couple of the remarks that were made by the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous). I was very pleased to hear him quite rightly speak of the very good and very capable work done by the vast majority of medical practitioners. Within any group of individuals within society, whether it be medical practitioners or members of parliament, there will be a section who will bring only shame to themselves and the profession within which they work.

         He also spoke about the regard in which doctors had previously been held and asked why it had declined. It is certainly one of the questions that I have grappled with myself in recent years. I feel that obviously our society has changed in many enormous ways. Many Australians—and I would suggest many who support the views of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), for example—do not quite understand these changes. They are grieving about changes that they have seen in their country and their world. They are also angry about quite a few of them.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Whether it be people in science, in higher education, in medicine, the law or other professions, we all stand accused of changes that have been brought upon society over which many people feel they have no control. Of course, George Bernard Shaw in the 19th century was bemoaning the medical profession. I do not think a lot has changed in that regard, but many Australians assign blame to professional, scientific, engineering and other people for the kinds of things that they have seen happen in their country.
        </para>

In fact, in terms of addressing the phenomenon of the member for Oxley and her supporters, I feel it is important to remind ourselves that what we need most in this age of economic and technological uncertainty is the resource of our personal relationships; what we need most is to build a sense of community; what we need most is one another.

         Some of the behaviour which this bill seeks to address is but a symptom of a society that is failing. Historically, if you look at societies that get into trouble they are ones that develop a preoccupation with death, whether it is in the form of suicide—Australia, of course, has the highest youth suicide rate in the OECD—or death in the form of euthanasia. We have gambling elevated to the status of religion in some parts of Australia. We also are a country that is dividing along racial lines. We have a preponderance of drug use which has reached epidemic proportions. We are not alone in this regard. But, historically, societies like that are the ones that get into trouble.

         The  Health Insurance (Pathology Services) Amendment Bill 1997  gives effect to a number of government initiatives which relate to Medicare benefits for pathology services. It will allow the Governor&amp;hyphen;General in Council to make regulations to give the Health Insurance Commission the power to impose penalties for less serious infringements that relate to pathology. What we are really looking at is a series of infringement notices or penalty notices, a bit like traffic infringement notices, or expiation notices, for example, in the ACT for cannabis users, and so on. Where an approved pathology service has failed to inform the public that a pathology laboratory is no longer approved and that services it is providing are not attracting a Medicare benefit, under these provisions it will be possible for the commission to simply issue a fine to that pathology provider.

         The member for Calwell asked a question in passing about licensing centres, asking himself why there would be people who are out there providing services who are unlicensed. Why do people do anything that contravenes the law? Why do they speed in cars? Why do they drink and drive? Why do they not wear seatbelts? In fact it was the previous government, to its credit, that through negotiations with the Australian Association of Pathology Practices, the AMA and the Royal College of Pathologists of Australia developed a licensing system to control the number of outlets to which patients could go to have their blood and other samples taken. The reason for doing that was that we had had a profligate expansion of the number of places to which people could go and get pathology.

        <para first-indent="16">
         You often find in medicine—and pathology is certainly no exception to this—that demand is often determined by supply. The more doctors you can provide in a particular area or the more pathology services you can provide, the more the number of services will be demanded and will be consumed. So that was a genuine attempt to try and limit the number of outlets that were providing pathology services.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It was also intended to improve the quality of some of these outlets and also to have some regard to geographic distribution and the convenience of patients. However, we ended up having, at one stage, more pathology collection centres than we had Chinese restaurants in some parts of Australia.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill makes an amendment also to the licensing scheme for the collection of pathology specimens and it introduces a requirement that the owner of a licensed collection centre needs, all the time, to display a sign which is visible, is factual, from the outside of the building to let the public know that this centre is licensed, because if you go to an unlicensed centre and you have a specimen taken, those services will not attract a Medicare benefit.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill increases the maximum penalty for infringement from $100 to $1,000. The intention is to provide a deterrent to the operation of unlicensed collection centres and protect consumer interests. I became aware of a case recently involving a Sydney pathology company that had had a licensed collection centre which had then become delicensed. Patients had continued to attend this particular centre, had had their specimens taken and then, much to their horror they discovered that there was no Medicare benefit being paid for the services that they had consumed.

         In my previous life I certainly became aware of instances where general practitioners, for example, would be referring all of their pathology to a certain pathology provider. They would then, for some inexplicable reason, switch to another pathology provider and the amount of pathology that they were providing increased fivefold. However, once they had received a visit from the Health Insurance Commission they then, for some equally inexplicable reason, would reduce their pathology ordering by fivefold.

         In other words, there have been arrangements, and I believe to this day there continue to be arrangements, where certain pathology providers have paid a very, very generous rent for what is basically a broom cupboard, or in some cases the bottom draw of a desk. The general practitioner, usually a GP, has a very powerful financial incentive to ensure that the patients are ordered pathology only from this particular pathology provider, and indeed a lot of it.

I have found, whether it has been in pathology or whether it has been in other areas of medical practice, that it is very unusual for a person to have services provided to them which are not necessary if they are paying something for that service.

         The measures that we are introducing in the bill are important also to the maintenance of the pathology agreement that was introduced in the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 budget and which limits pathology expenditure under Medicare to predetermined levels. The arrangements that were made last year in relation to the pathology agreement are really unprecedented in the history of relations between the medical profession and the Commonwealth government. This 1996&amp;hyphen;97 budget measure heralded a new era, not only for pathology, but perhaps also for other sections of the medical profession. To a limited extent, in last year's budget, radiology providers also entered into such arrangements.

         For the first time in the history of the Medicare benefits schedule, a negotiation was concluded with the Australian Association of Pathology Practices, the Royal College of Pathologists of Australia and the Commonwealth to cap, or limit, the total expenditure for pathology to predetermined amounts for a three&amp;hyphen;year period. If expenditure, over the three years, is below the six per cent agreed annual growth in outlays, then there is an increase in the Medicare benefits schedule fee for pathology the following year and if expenditure is above the six per cent growth, then there is going to be a commensurate reduction the following year.

All I can say is I had to start sleeping on my side with the one or two knives I had in between my shoulder blades. I take my hat off to the pathologists for concluding these sorts of negotiations.

         Coming back to the remarks of the member for Calwell, it has annoyed me over the years that people have usually been quite happy to pay the surgeon's fee, a little less happy to pay the anaesthetist's fee—even though there is no greater faith you can have in somebody than to have a general anaesthetic—but they always whinge about paying the pathologist's bill. They always whinge about it.

         Again, I would like to pay tribute to the Australian Association of Pathology Practices for the support that they have given to the bill. I know they have played a role in putting the bill together. They also make the point that one of the stupid aspects of the current legislation is that the Health Insurance Commission only has the power to go into licensed collection centres. It does not have the power to go into unlicensed collection centres. It is a bit like saying to the police, `You can raid a licensed brothel, but you can't raid one which is not.' I realise that is probably an unfortunate analogy, but it is the kind of stupidity with which we have been trying to deal. The commission has got, as I say, no power to enter unlicensed premises.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The display of a licence number or advice concerning a licence on the outside of the premises would at least let the commission know what sort of collection facility they are dealing with. The pathology providers themselves are only too happy to do anything they can to try to deal with those within their discipline who are bringing a bad name to the profession and the industry itself.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In its recent report on medifraud and inappropriate practice, the Australian National Audit Office noted attempts by some pathologists and a few radiologists to enter into kickback arrangements and indicated its concern that unnecessary services may be ordered by GPs in return for benefits from service providers or pathologists. This bill is much more likely to ensure that, where premises are occupied by an approved pathology provider, the provider must personally use them to render those professional services.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In conclusion, it will never be possible to devise a system which will not be the subject of exploitation by some providers or indeed some consumers. The medical profession, by definition, is a group of people who are reasonably intelligent and hardworking. Unfortunately, if they go off the rails and decide to misdirect their energies, they can be extremely good at getting around any kind of system.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I also make the point—and I realise that I am lengthening my period of service on the backbench every time I speak—that, eventually Australia will have to reach the point where we realise that we are running a system which lends itself to abuse. No matter how hard we try to improve the legislation—and this legislation will be an improvement—the system will continue to be open to abuse by all kinds of people. Perhaps, in a decade or so from now, people will look back on what I and others have said in this regard and say, `Just maybe they were right'.

         One of the intended consequences of the bill is a bolstering of the powers of the authority of the Health Insurance Commission, the HIC, in its battle against overservicing. The Health Insurance Commission's 1995&amp;hyphen;96 annual report makes it clear that one of its key functions is to detect, investigate and prevent inappropriate practice by service providers. This includes the services provided by pathologists.

         The government has expressed concern at the unlawful or unethical arrangements between some medical practitioners and pathologists that encourage the commission of pathology services where they are not really required. It has good reason to be concerned, Mr Deputy Speaker, because the practice of overservicing could become a major problem for the Medicare scheme. The government is anticipating that the measures contained in this legislation will cap the growth outlays on pathology services at six per cent a year, coincidentally the same as the provisional tax uplift factor—just an unhappy coincidence.

         Official figures show that the HIC had recovered—or was in the process of recovering—more than $1 million of Medicare benefits which had been paid incorrectly to service providers and patients in the year 1995&amp;hyphen;96.

Even more alarming than this figure was the comment by the ANAO that:

          It must be acknowledged that it is difficult to quantify overservicing in pathology services in the figures I have mentioned. However, it is clear that the government must take decisive action if it is to combat Medicare fraud of any persuasion. As I mentioned, the government aims to cap growth in outlays on pathology at six per cent per annum.

A quick crunching of figures indicates that this equates to the provision of around nine medical services to every Australian man, woman and child in a year. That is getting well on the way to one visit to a medical practitioner a month, statistically. Of course, the reality is that most people do not visit a medical practitioner anywhere near this often.

Indeed, the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 Auditor&amp;hyphen;General's performance audit of the Health Insurance Commission found that most fraud detected by the HIC came from `complaints by the public or by members of the medical and pharmaceutical professions' who refused to condone what they saw as improper behaviour. Those pathologists who do practice ethically should not be concerned with the government's move to ensure that a notice identifying them as licensed pathologists is to remain visible on their premises. The Australian National Audit Office identified prevention of inappropriate practice as a key role of the HIC. By ensuring that licences identifying registered pathology centres are more visible, the Health Insurance Commission should become more pro&amp;hyphen;active in preventing overservicing.

          In a buyer beware market, new subsection 23DNK(1) of the act will offer a greater level of protection to the consumer. Patients can still opt to have tests done at non&amp;hyphen;licensed pathology centres, but they will not be eligible for a Medicare rebate on those services. That is entirely reasonable.

          The current penalty for non&amp;hyphen;compliance by a pathology centre is a mere $100 fine. This amendment seeks to increase the penalty to $1,000. In the scheme of things, this figure represents a mild penalty, considering that an individual's health may be put at risk if tests are conducted in an environment that fails to meet good Australian pathology standards. However, a $1,000 fine will certainly be a greater deterrent to opportunistic practitioners than the current $100.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Item 13 of the bill amends section 133 of the principal act and will allow the HIC to prescribe certain penalties for minor offences. As with the changes to licensing, that will not detrimentally affect reputable pathologists. Rather, the government claims it will allow for more rapid and less expensive disciplining of minor pathology violations.

          Evidence suggests that speedy action on the part of the HIC can lead to a reduction in inappropriate practice. For example, the Health Insurance Commission recently produced a report that suggested that where they had acted to caution practitioners suspected of inappropriate practice, they made savings of $40,000 of Medicare expenditure per intervention in the first year of counselling. The HIC extrapolated this figure to calculate that they may currently be achieving `savings of up to $19 million per year through counselling, through reduced expenditure which would have otherwise occurred.' If that figure is accurate, it represents—

           It was further noted that the 1995&amp;hyphen;96 portfolio budget statement for Human Services and Health contained scant information on the cost to the community of inappropriate practice. This is also the case with the two subsequent budgets that were handed down by the present government. Surely if this information is at hand, it should be published widely to communicate the very real, and maybe ever growing, problems that plague Medicare.

          <para first-indent="16">
           The government is right to tighten up the provisions relating to `act of grace' payments where pathology organisations fail to have their licence renewed. The explanatory memorandum notes that there may be occasions where pathology centres fail to submit the necessary application and fee for the renewal of their licence because of circumstances beyond their control. This may be the case, but in the interests of maintaining uniform standards in pathology services this should be the exception and not the norm.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Just as every other business is required to meet compliance cost obligations or face the consequences, so too should those in the field of pathology. Pathologists are aware of the onus to renew their licence on an annual basis and should therefore include a little forward planning in their calendars to prepare for that eventuality. Further, the Health Insurance Commission already alerts applicants whose licences are about to expire that they need to renew them immediately. The amendments in this bill will still allow for act of grace payments to be made to pathologists in certain circumstances, but it will now be the responsibility of the minister to authorise such payments. It is to be hoped that this will see a reduction in the costly and burdensome process involved with the backdating of Medicare benefits to the service provider.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Importantly, this bill also contains a provision that will protect the rights of pathologists who are not granted act of grace payments by the minister. Item 11 in the bill stipulates that any person who unsuccessfully appeals to the minister for a review of a decision to not backdate an approval may put their case to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

          <para first-indent="16">
           It is important that this bill be passed in order to maintain the integrity of our Medicare system. As I have outlined in earlier debates, overservicing is not common to the majority of medical practitioners. Only a fraction of professionals have come under the scrutiny of the Professional Service Review Scheme in the past. One would hope that by upping the penalties this figure will decline even further and any future growth will be headed off.

          <para first-indent="16">
           It is also crucial that the Health Insurance Commission utilises the additional powers it will gain once this legislation is proclaimed. Professional bodies, including the Australian Association of Pathology Practices and the Royal College of Pathologists, reportedly share concern that the professional review division of the HIC is not as active in pursuing Medicare fraud as it should be. It is incumbent on the Health Insurance Commission to allay these fears by actively and indiscriminately identifying offenders.

        There are major disadvantages with Goulburn and other remote locations. The distance from Sydney has major adverse implications for travel times, convenience, cost and connection with Sydney's existing airport. As a consequence, there would be a strong likelihood that passengers and airlines would be unwilling to use the second airport thereby further increasing the pressures on Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. The increased costs of providing suitable road and rail access and linkages to other support services (such as a fuel line) would also be significant. For these reasons the Government is not considering possible sites outside the Sydney Basin for the second major Sydney airport.

         —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (1) On 22 April 1997, United Energy announced the introduction of its United Energy Surge Plan, which aims to provide residential consumers with `no&amp;hyphen;cost' protection against damage caused by power surges. Two other Victorian electricity distribution companies offer `no cost' surge cover for residential customers.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        The ACCC has informed me that United Energy's announcement followed discussions the Commission held with the Electricity Supply Association of Australia, several Victorian electricity distribution companies, the Victorian Regulator&amp;hyphen;General and the Electricity Industry Ombudsman on the question of who bears liability for damage caused by poor quality of supply of electricity. Poor quality supply includes power surges and `brownouts'.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        The ACCC initiated these discussions following its investigations into a number of Victorian electricity distribution companies' offers of insurance products to consumers. These products were expressed to cover damage caused by poor quality supply of electricity where it was not the fault of the electricity company itself. The ACCC was concerned that information provided to consumers should not lead to any misunderstandings by them as to the full extent of their statutory rights under the Trade Practices Act. (See below.)
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (2) The ACCC has informed me that at no time did it express a view that United Energy was in breach of the Trade Practices Act. Rather the Commission expressed the view that, while it does not object to the provision of insurance schemes or
        <break page="7202" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         related products in themselves, it has concerns that the information provided by electricity companies about such products should not lead to misunderstandings by consumers, either by express or implied representation, as to the full extent of their statutory rights under Part V Division 2 of the Act. In the Commission's view, these rights include an entitlement by consumers to be compensated for damage caused by unmerchantable quality electricity irrespective of whether the supplier is negligent or not.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        As a consequence, the ACCC informed the electricity distribution companies that they might have to fully refund fees paid by consumers for protection plans which did no more than offer consumers what was already a statutory right. United Energy advised the ACCC that it would fully refund payments made by its customers for the previous PowerGuard Plan.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (3) The ACCC has written to electricity companies and regulators across Australia concerning the promotion of insurance schemes and the implied rights of consumers under Part V Division 2 of the Trade Practices Act. Such insurance schemes must be conveyed as additional to, and not in place of, all other statutory rights.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (4) The ACCC is an independent statutory authority with responsibility, among other things, for administering the Trade Practices Act. The Government supports the efforts of the Commission in seeking to ensure that market conduct across the economy is consistent with the provisions of the Act and that consumers are safeguarded in their dealings with producers and sellers. The Government is also mindful that protection of the rights of consumers needs to be balanced against the costs this may impose on producers.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (1) As I stated in my response to Question No. 1820, the Victorian Government has decided against relocating the Coode Island chemical storage facility to Point Lillias. Consequently there are now only two proposed facilities that are in the vicinity of the Port Phillip Bay (Western Shoreline) Ramsar site (i.e. Point Wilson, and the proposed CSR dump). The Western Treatment Plant, managed by Melbourne Water, discharges waste under strict environmental licence conditions. The Victorian Environment Protection Authority has advised that discharge of toxic waste is not permitted under any circumstances and that wastewater plumes will be closely monitored for environmental impact, including any impact on the nearby Ramsar site.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (2) Yes. It is proposed that the CSR dump will be located approximately 600 metres from, and outside the Ramsar site boundary, 3.5 kilometres from a site identified as a significant component of the East Asian—Australasian Shorebird Flyway. That site is contained within the Port Phillip Bay Ramsar site.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (3) In general, the management of Ramsar sites is the responsibility of State and Territory Governments, and at this stage, I do not consider it appropriate to intervene. The CSR dump proposal

         is currently undergoing review through the Victorian Environmental Effects Statement (EES) process. The Commonwealth Environment Portfolio will review this document and advise me accordingly. If the EES process reveals any potential for the proposal to adversely impact on the ecological character of the Ramsar site, I will decide whether to seek further advice from the Victorian Government.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (1) I am aware of the winding up of Sydney Appliance Centre Pty Ltd (trading as the `Sydney Appliance Centre'). I am advised that the Australian Securities Commission was notified on 25 June 1997 of the resolution to voluntarily wind up the company.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (2) The appointed liquidator, Jirsch Sutherland &amp; Co, estimates there may be around 310 consumers affected by the company's insolvency, mostly in New South Wales and Victoria.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        The task of winding up a company is generally a complicated and prolonged affair. The liquidator advises that it is too early at this stage to ascertain exactly how many consumers will be affected, and  the extent of any losses incurred. I am also advised that a number of the major trade suppliers have contacted customers to make alternative arrangements for the supply of goods for which pre&amp;hyphen;payments have been made.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Under the winding up process, the assets of the company will be realised, the creditors paid, any surplus distributed among shareholders, and the company dissolved. If there are insufficient funds to pay out all creditors, the liquidator will pay the creditors in order of priority as established by the Corporations Law. Unfortunately, many of the creditors involved will be ordinary unsecured creditors, and may therefore need to wait until preferred debts are paid.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (3)(a) The Government is not in a position to intervene on behalf of consumers, as this is a matter for the liquidator at this stage. If contraventions of any laws are identified by the liquidator, these will be addressed in the liquidator's report to the Australian Securities Commission.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        I can reassure all consumers that the liquidation of a company is a strictly controlled process in which the interests of all creditors will be protected in accordance with the law.

        (3) (b) (i) The Government is committed to ensuring that consumers have the information they need to participate effectively in the marketplace. In line with the Government's pre&amp;hyphen;election commitment, the Government recently approved a three year program to address the consumer education needs of rural and remote Australians; those with limited English; and Australians on low incomes.

        (1) Yes. Airservices Australia advises that when the RAAF is not operating at Pearce, aircraft are tracked through the deactivated Pearce airspace to minimise aircraft noise exposure. When the RAAF is operating at Pearce, aircraft inbound to Perth Airport are tracked as far to the north of the Perth Air Traffic Control Zone as possible to limit low level overflight of suburbs in the vicinity of the airport.
