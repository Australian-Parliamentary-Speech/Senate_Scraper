          I should say to the parliament briefly that the committee announced over the weekend a comprehensive national public inquiry into the NCA—in fact, a complete evaluation of the National Crime Authority. The committee is looking forward to receiving submissions. That also will demonstrate this committee's commitment to its statutory task of ensuring that the NCA is up to the very important task that it has been given of ensuring that there is an effective fight against organised criminal activity in Australia.

          The committee was privileged to meet with Mr Raymond Kendall, the Secretary General of Interpol. Interpol is a very important organisation to Australia. The internationalisation of major criminal activity is a fact of life and, therefore, Australia has to have a strong and vital involvement with other international crime fighting authorities, and Interpol is a very important one of those.

           —The tabling of this report by the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), the Chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the NCA, is an appropriate occasion for the parliament to take note that, in the context of the globalisation of so many spheres of life that we as members of parliament become increasingly aware of, the observation about globalisation is equally true of criminal activity and the environment in which Australian law enforcement organisations need to operate.

          In that context, the visit to Australia of Mr Kendall, the head of Interpol, and the very helpful briefing that he gave to the committee towards the end of last year were a very important step. The chairman of the committee, Mr Bradford, has already referred to the very helpful suggestions that were made to that meeting about the need for Australia to have more direct and active involvement in international police matters, both on a world scale and in our own region. I think they are matters the government ought to take very much to heart.

           In the context of this debate I think it is worth referring to some of the words Mr Kendall used in his evidence. The transcript said:

           is as serious as I think it is, then your response must be the right level of response. I cannot see . . . how at a political level, you can decide on a priority to deal with organised crime, drug trafficking and terrorism but then start cutting budgets all over the place.
          </para>
          <para style="Para">
           Those remarks are very appropriate to the performance of this government in relation to the National Crime Authority because the budget has been devastated since the government has been in office. It has been devastated particularly in regional centres of Australia, such as Adelaide and Perth, but across the country important areas such as surveillance activity have been very dramatically curtailed.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           I believe this government would be particularly well advised to take account of the words that Mr Kendall used, which reinforce the words that President Clinton used a few weeks before that in this chamber when he indicated the international importance of coordinated action between governments on these matters. It is simply not possible for this government to mouth the rhetoric, but then to slash budgets.

           —One issue I would like to raise which does impact on the Olympics in the year 2000 is the question of mutual assistance in our criminal matters. I would like to point out to the House that Mr Kendall, in response to a question I put to him about how the new amendments that were passed through this parliament recently in 1996 would affect the opportunity for better cooperation in criminal matters, observed that it is the principle of maximum exchange of information between law enforcement agencies that assists in detecting and being able to prevent serious criminal offences.

          I point out that we have the silly situation in Australia where, if there were an Oklahoma bombing in the United States again, the Australian Attorney-General as a result of
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           legislation which passed through this House would be unable to exchange information were the offender apprehended and were the United States refusing to give an undertaking that it would not carry out the death penalty in relation to this particular offence. We would have the ridiculous situation where Australia would have to refuse to provide information that may lead to further investigation of these particular offences. This impacts on our relationship with our regional neighbours, who of course are our partners in trying to fight against organised drug trafficking throughout our region.

          Anybody who thinks that Australia's drug problem is a serious problem—and I think most people should—should understand that we have, in fact, legislated in this place to impede our ability to fight against drug trafficking. That was legislation that passed through this House last year as a result of a bill presented by the Attorney-General (Mr Williams), which I then attempted to amend—unfortunately, unsuccessfully. All I can say is that when you consider Australia's role in the international law enforcement scene, particularly with the Olympics coming up in the year 2000, this type of legislation impedes Australia's participation in international law enforcement.

          I would like to congratulate Mr Kendall on an excellent presentation to our committee. He is a very distinguished police officer. He is the distinguished Secretary General of the Interpol organisation—the premier international criminal law enforcement and intelligence organisation in the world. It is an organisation that has an outstanding reputation, which has been rebuilt since its problems prior to and during the Second World War. It is in no small way down to the performance of Mr Kendall, as Secretary General, that the organisation now enjoys such an outstanding international reputation. It is a reputation that endures notwithstanding some of the peculiarities of some of its member nations—some of whom have enjoyed a rogue nation status in recent times—but it is something that the Interpol organisation has been able to overcome.

I, too, would like to encourage Australia to support the candidacy of the Commissioner of the Federal Police as a member of the international executive of Interpol. It is an important step as far as Australia's role in our regional area is concerned. I can only urge the Attorney-General and the government to support wholeheartedly whatever overtures are necessary to ensure that the Commissioner of the Federal Police becomes a member of the international executive of Interpol.

Last week Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) visited Papua New Guinea. Immediately on his departure it became apparent that they are apparently involved in what seemed nothing less than an extraordinary venture—more pertinent to a Frederick Forsyth novel,
           <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
            I suspect, than reality. There is involvement of a group called Executive Outcomes under their subsidiary Sandline International, with some 140-plus mercenaries.

          It had been my hope to perhaps move a motion at this time addressing the problems that I think beset both Australia and Papua New Guinea. I trust that the government of Sir Julius Chan takes note of what, I have little doubt, is a widespread concern within Australia at the character of this action. I hope Sir Julius and his ministers understand that, while we recognise their total independence as a sovereign state, affairs that occur in Papua New Guinea do impact on us here. There is a great concern about events of this sort that introduce into this region some of the worst aspects of African solutions which, tragically, have failed in every one of the countries they have been pursued there.

          I would like to specifically say to Sir Julius, whom I know and respect, that I am very disappointed in the nature of this action. I trust that the reports can at least be eased by his deciding not to proceed with the employment of these covert mercenaries in the way that is reported.

           Bougainville: a specific solution
          </emphasis>
          was tabled. This seminar was an update essentially of the former. In particular, I would like to thank the Papua New Guinea High Commissioner, Brigadier General Kenneth Noga, and Vice Admiral David Leach, President of the Australia Papua New Guinea Friendship Association, for their participation. I would also say to the other 100 persons who are involved with them—under the able chairmanship of my colleague, the chair of the foreign affairs subcommittee, the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor)—that they are involved in a very worthwhile discussion on events not just on Bougainville but right across the whole field of PNG.

           It needs to be remembered again by the government of PNG that the more action that takes place on Bougainville the less regard is taken of the very real problem that extends right across the whole of the PNG economy. In fact, the seminar dealt with political and economic security and social and health issues. I have no time to go into the details, but the report itself does identify and produce 14 recommendations. In particular, there is one recommendation that I think the House needs to take note of. Recommendation No. 14 states:
          </para>

           the Australian Government recognise the significance of Papua New Guinea in its foreign policy priorities and acknowledge through the maintenance of the AusAID and Defence Cooperation Programs the unique challenges that PNG faces . . . in developing its infrastructure.

          <para first-indent="16">
           There is no prospect of a military solution to Bougainville and the government of PNG needs to recognise that. That conclusion was reached not just from the seminar but also from our earlier report on a peaceful solution in Bougainville. I spoke about the tragic assassination of Premier Theodore Miriung of the Bougainville transitional government only a fortnight ago. I identified the fact that attention has to be taken of the views of women and there has to be recognition of the recommendations of that peace conference in Arawa last year. I would like to see the timetable that we outlined in our report on a peaceful solution for Bougainville identified and pursued by the government of PNG and asserted by the government of Australia.

          It was only three days after that, on 13 February, that Foreign Minister Downer applauded the PNG government's support for a negotiated settlement on Bougainville by extending the mandate of the Bougainville transitional government, saying that he would use the opportunity of his forthcoming visit to PNG to pass on congratulations to Prime Minister Chan and other PNG ministers. On 19 February, the foreign minister followed up with a $4 million announcement of overseas aid funds to buy and distribute essential goods and medical supplies to the people of mainland Bougainville.

          These were very encouraging developments and the foreign minister's visit to Port Moresby should have marked a significant step forward. But what we now have to hand, of course, are these very disturbing reports that the PNG government is gearing up for another military offensive on Bougainville and this time bringing in foreign mercenaries—that is, professional freelance killers—to assassinate the very people the PNG government must talk to if there is to be a lasting peace settlement of the conflict.

           I know all members of this House would agree that this development casts a very grim pall over hopes for a peaceful settlement of this tragic conflict. As I said yesterday, all Australia is appalled by the gross abuses of human rights carried out by the PNG defence force troops on Bougainville. The employment of foreign troops in what amounts to a brutally conceived assassination plot will only exacerbate the conflict. It will deal a devastating blow to any prospect of peace. It will also set a very disturbing precedent for the use of foreign military forces in the South Pacific. Even if the planned operation does not proceed, great damage has already been done—the credibility of the PNG government is in tatters, as I fear is the peace process itself.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The foreign minister and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) have reportedly warned PNG against further military action on Bougainville. They must do so again in the strongest terms. Prime Minister Chan must be told directly and bluntly that the employment of foreign mercenaries will result in the immediate suspension of our bilateral defence cooperation program and a review of our aid program to PNG. Members will be aware that our overseas aid to PNG is the subject of a bilateral treaty and our defence cooperation is governed by a number of understandings and agreements. But if the PNG government decides to proceed with this crazy plan, then we should not hesitate in putting the fundamentals of the bilateral relationship right on the line.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           This murderous conspiracy that appears to have been floated is one quite beyond the pale and all Australian people will demand that we have no connection, however indirect, with it. Australia requires from the foreign minister a guarantee that not one dollar of Australia's bilateral aid to PNG is going directly or indirectly to the hiring of this crew of Rambo&amp;hyphen;like assassins.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Finally, the report of the joint committee tabled today reaffirms the view that there can be no military solution to the conflict on Bougainville. It recommends that the Australian government encourage the PNG government to invite international observers, something we heartily endorse. I add that the
           <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
            Australian government should also press PNG to allow the international media access to Bougainville for, perhaps more than ever, the international spotlight must be shot on this appalling conflict. For too long the war on Bougainville has remained in the shadows. One positive thing that might emerge from this latest publicity is that the spotlight will be well and truly turned upon them.

           —The report I table today is a very important one, both domestically and internationally. It deals with two of the protocols of the inhumane weapons convention: protocol IV seeking to ban the use of blinding laser weapons and the amended protocol II dealing with antipersonnel land

         <para first-indent="16">
          Protocol IV to the convention seeks to prohibit the use of laser weapons, the purpose of which is to cause permanent blindness to unenhanced vision. These weapons are still being developed. During our inquiry, we were told that this is the first occasion since 1868 that there has been an attempt to ban a weapon before it has been used on the battlefield. The committee is pleased to be at the vanguard of such initiatives.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Our attention was drawn also to some weaknesses in the protocol. We have therefore recommended that Australia take every opportunity to ensure that these are corrected to make the document, and indeed the prevention of the use of such weapons, more effective. The amended protocol II relates to the use on land of mines, booby traps and other devices. While landmines are a defensive weapon used by armies, demonstrably they can kill and maim innocent people, particularly children, long after a conflict has ended.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The Australian government has been prominent in the international move towards a total global ban on the manufacture, use and transfer of these inhumane weapons. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) spoke at the disarmament conference in Geneva last month about the practical measures that the government supports to tackle the humanitarian disaster landmines cause. We have a proud record in undertaking humanitarian clearance operations via the Australian Defence Force and in looking after the victims of these weapons via our international aid agency.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Stemming from a joint statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) last April, Australia has suspended the operational use of its landmines. That statement indicated that our stockpile of landmines would be retained `in case of a substantial deterioration in our strategic circumstances'.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We received persuasive evidence that to seek a total global ban on these awful weapons but, at the same time, retain the stockpile in its entirety could be hypocritical. The committee's view is that there is some
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           substance in this argument. We have recommended therefore that Australia destroy its stockpile, except for a modest residual stock to ensure that the ADF retains a defensive capability to use landmines and including its important international humanitarian clearance operations. Two of our senatorial colleagues do not agree on this point and have submitted a dissenting report.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We recommend also that Australia prepares a proposal when it attends the Ottawa conference later this year for creation of an agreed international timetable for the destruction of the landmines of all nations. Australia's international credibility will be enhanced as a result.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Other recommendations deal with encouraging nations in our region to sign the inhumane weapons convention and all its protocols, the Department of Defence assuming responsibility for all aspects of humanitarian mine clearing operation, the Department of Defence encouraging designers of mine detection equipment and continued efforts by the government towards a total global ban on landmines.

          Unfortunately, in the limited time available, neither the honourable member for Barton (Mr McClelland) nor I will be able to deal with all of the issues in this report, but we hope that it will be referred to the Main Committee where I am sure many honourable members inside and outside the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties will want to express their views.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I am sure I speak for all committee members when I say that we hope that this report will assist towards the goal of a total global ban on landmines. We hope that our recommendations will make a further contribution to that end—in particular, a will to show the world that we have a genuine and leading role to play as a responsible, compassionate international player when it comes to the continuing tragedy of antipersonnel landmines right around the globe. I commend the report to the House.

            for his leadership in this matter. I endorse wholeheartedly his comments. In terms of protocol IV and the use of laser blinding weapons, the Christian Blind Mission International Australia described the new technology as a `new, indescribable, inexorable horror'. It certainly is that and this really is a historic opportunity, as the member for Groom has said, to be part of a move to ban the technology before it even hits the battlefield.

          Perhaps the more significant of the aspects covered in the report, however, is in respect of banning landmines. By the time this House adjourns today, there will be 30 people killed and 60 horribly maimed in the world as a result of landmines. Regrettably, they will more than likely be children. On pages 16 and 17 of the report, two very disturbing photographs are appropriately included to show the devastation that these mines cause to children.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          While the mines are designed to maim soldiers on the battlefield by, for example, amputating a leg, quite clearly the damage they do to children is far more severe. The photos reveal that those children are malnourished children living in Third World countries and, more than likely, would have entered the minefield to try to retrieve firewood or to assist their parents in agricultural ventures on the property. The mines themselves throw up debris and dirt and so forth and secondary infections are probably going to occur as a result of this dirt being embedded in the wounds. Quite simply, they cause horrific damage.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Australia can be really proud of taking the lead in that we are recommending in the most significant of our recommendations that Australia destroy its stockpile except for essential training supplies. Australia already has a very proud record in the area. We have contributed about $24&amp;half; million since 1991. Last year the minister announced an additional $12 million would be committed to programs in Cambodia over three years. Australia, it must be said, is leading the world in the technological development to locate and destroy landmines through the cooperation of the Defence, Science and Technology Organisation, CSIRO and private industry. But the reality is that, despite that sophistication, we
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           still cannot locate those mines without metal being present.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Again, Australia's initiative is shown in the respect that we are using not only this sophisticated metal detecting technology and radar but also a great Australian inhabitant and resource, namely, our dogs. Sniffer dogs are being used to locate mines. Australia is really leading the world in terms of its capacity to search and remove landmines. However, the task is horrendous. The United Nations estimates that it will take about 1,100 years and about $33 billion to remove landmines throughout the world. We can but make a start, but we can make a very substantial start in our own region. That is what this report is about. It is about Australia setting an example to the world. I sincerely trust that the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) will give it very careful consideration and adopt our recommendations.

         At the outset, I want to thank delegation members for their strong contribution to debate during the meeting and for their participation in activities of the Executive Committee and the Drafting Committee. As with earlier meetings of the APPF, the Australian delegation strongly supported the APPF process, providing four discussion papers and draft resolutions in advance of the meeting and participating in a wide range of plenary debates during the meeting itself.

         It is now more than five years since a preliminary meeting of parliamentarians from the Asia Pacific region was held here in Canberra in December 1991 to consider a concept proposed by the Hon. Yasuhiro Nakasone, a former and distinguished Prime Minister of Japan. Mr Nakasone's vision was to provide a loosely structured and non-exclusive forum for regional parliamentarians to meet on a regular basis to increase opportunities for dialogue and to add a further dimension to the existing framework of regional cooperation. The APPF was formally inaugurated in Tokyo in January 1993, with subsequent annual meetings being held in the Philippines, Mexico, Thailand and, most recently, Vancouver. I must acknowledge here the key roles played by my predecessors, the honourable members for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) and Cunningham (Mr Martin), in the establishment and development of the APPF in its early years.

         The fifth annual meeting of the APPF consolidated the significant advances made at the fourth annual meeting held in Thailand in January 1996. The APPF is now an increasingly important regional association with a strong corporate entity and an established set of sound procedures and practices. The growing importance of the APPF and its loose association with the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation grouping of economies indicate a continuing role of some significance for the APPF. This is reflected in the breadth and depth of the regional vision statement adopted by the fifth annual meeting, the Vancouver

The delegation was particularly impressed by the thoroughness of the administrative arrangements made by the Canadian conference secretariat and by the very skilful approach to chairing the meeting by the Canadian Chairman, Senator the Hon. Dan Hays. The delegation also records its appreciation to the Parliament of Canada for the warmth of the hospitality extended.

         Australia, a foundation member of the APPF Executive Committee, remains a member of that committee until the next annual meeting of the APPF, scheduled to be held in Pusan, the Republic of Korea, in January 1998.

          —Mr Speaker, you may recall that at the press conference of which you were a part at the conclusion of the proceedings there was a particularly searching question by one of the reporters involved in the press conference. He said, `You've been talking for four days. What have you achieved?' I was interested to see the responses of the various delegation leaders, and it took only a few milliseconds for a response. The point is that at the conclusion of a conference of 24 countries, the Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum, none of the representatives of the countries that participated were in a situation of conflict. They were there talking about the issues that affected their regions and talking in a way that progressed them towards more cooperative and open arrangements within the region.

         The conference took place against the background scenario of the siege in Peru. The Peruvian delegation felt very strongly that they had to register an important point against the threat of international terrorism. The Peruvian delegation's contribution was a significant one. There was at that conference a strong and resolute stance taken in relation to the hostage taking, which continues, and the crisis that had at that stage arisen very rapidly at the Japanese embassy in Lima.

         At the conference I took a special interest in the question of illicit drugs, money laundering and international trafficking in illicit drugs. As a person with an interest in that particular area, I was interested in seeing how the conference would deal with an approach to international cooperation in the region. It was interesting to see that there was a common purpose in relation to drug trafficking that transcended political differences and, in some instances, quite strongly competing economic interests. This was because of the nature of the threat of international trafficking

         This is a threat not only in terms of human costs—in relation to the social effects of drug trafficking and consumption by people in particular countries in our region—but also in terms of the economic effect. Drug trafficking, the ancillary corruption of officials and the enormous amount of illicit funds generated by the drug trafficking industry skew economic activity. It provides some very important challenges to all the countries in the region—challenges that may well reflect on an individual nation's particular direction or determination to in fact arrest the growth of international drug trafficking.

         I make an observation that I made earlier this afternoon in relation to Australia's own position—a position that is, in my view, exacerbated by the passing of legislation in 1996 which effectively prevents Australia from fully participating in cooperative efforts in relation to criminal law enforcement, particularly in drug trafficking. It turns out that Australia's own legislation, passed in this place last year, provides for the Attorney-General to be required to refuse to exchange information with a country that has arrested or apprehended a suspect in relation to an offence that carries the death penalty. Australia is obliged to refuse to provide information that may be held by Australian authorities unless that country gives an undertaking that the penalty would not be carried out.

          —I was pleased to participate in this important conference in Canada. As other speakers have mentioned, the conference was held against the background of the unfortunate situation at the Japanese embassy in Lima, Peru. All the delegates were very aware of this as were, of course, the delegates from Peru. Indeed, one of the Peruvian delegates had been at the embassy earlier that evening and had just left. Had he not left when he did, he could well still be in that building. That was a very salient reminder to us—with the Peruvian delegation there and with the resolution being passed about terrorism. But it really did bring it home to us all very much.

          I particularly congratulate the leader of the delegation, the Speaker of the parliament. I thought he very ably led the delegation. We did not have a lot of time to prepare for it because it was announced just before the House rose. We missed out on some of the briefings and meetings usually held before overseas delegations. That was more than amply made up for by the extensive briefing papers from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I also congratulate the delegation secretary, Peter Gibson, and indeed the Clerk of the House, who also assisted. All these people made a very valuable contribution, as did all members of the delegation.

         My role in moving this motion today is not in any sense to polarise the parliament. I would hope that the members for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) and Lyons (Mr Adams) resist any temptation they might be feeling to polarise the parliament in this debate, for this is not a debate about apportioning blame. I would remind the members for Hunter and Lyons, relatively new members that they are, that the Liberal and National parties in opposition supported the government when it was doing for the citrus industry precisely what the now government is doing for the citrus industry. A similar approach from them as was exercised by us in opposition would be very constructive in dealing with the problems of the citrus industry in respect of tariff debates and of trade generally.

          Notice Paper
         </emphasis>
         in my name—reflects what has been a recurring problem for this industry over the past two decades, more pronounced over the past five years. It would be quite wrong for any speaker in this debate to generalise about the citrus industry and imply that the citrus industry in Australia was in trouble when it is not. I would hope that everyone in this chamber is familiar, as the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) and I am, with the simple fact that, if you are a citrus grower growing navel oranges in Australia in 1997, you have a product currently in such demand in export markets that there are people offering valencias as part of a navel
         <break page="1043" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          orange contract in order to soak up the valen cia part of the industry. The navel industry is running reasonably well; the mandarin industry is running reasonably well. The lemon industry has all sorts of new trade opportunities in Japan, thanks to the arrangements we have under the World Trade Organisation. The grapefruit industry has long had difficulties because of varietal problems.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But the focus of this motion is on the valencia section of the citrus industry. The difficulty for every valencia grower—and valencias, after all, make up a large portion of the Australian crop—is that valencias are a premium juice fruit. In the production of juice Australian growers are beaten by Brazilians every time. It is not because we are not as good as they are but because we live in a very dry country and we choose, particularly in the electorates of Riverina and Wakefield, to take a scarce resource called water, divert it by irrigation onto carefully tended groves and produce an article that looks delectable, and it is madness to then run that article through a machine so that nobody sees it. The Brazilians, on the other hand, grow their juice fruit in jungle&amp;hyphen;like situations because, while it does not look good, all they want is the internal material for juice.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The focus for the valencia industry, once a juice focus, now has to be an export product focus. The focus for the valencia industry has to be like the focus for the navel industry—taking whole fruit that has been grown in an ideal human generated environment with irrigation, placing it in cartons and making it available as whole fruit around the globe. The parliament recognised that problem and last time the Brazilian price fell the parliament and the government of the day—then the ALP—responded by refusing all of the industry requests for tariff protection and for sales tax changes and instead offering $9 million as a citrus market development package to open up export markets for whole fruit.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          We in government have picked up precisely the same challenge and continue precisely the same program. And this has been successful. Wherever you look across the valencia producing sectors of Australia, the proportion of whole fruit going into cartons and being
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           exported as if it were apples or pears has increased. Growers have responded by improving fruit quality. But since November last year there has been a collapse in the Brazilian juice price and the relatively high proportion of Australian valencia material still being sold as juice has meant that valencia growers are finding it hard to make ends meet in the face of a collapsed Brazilian price.

         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are solutions being proposed by the industry. The industry has come to the government calling for what they have called a varietal rework program—the removal of some valencia trees, allowing them to be replaced by navels, by mandarins or by other emerging varieties of citrus fruit. That could well be an appropriate direction for the government to take. In fact, the only concern that the government and the industry have right now is that there has been an automatic removal of valencia trees, particularly in the electorates of the member for Riverina, the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) and in my electorate. Many of those valencia groves have been removed and wine grapes have taken their place. We have a concern that the level of valencia production in Australia may be falling to the point at which it is no longer as viable for us to have a juice industry.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I have to say in defence of most of the citrus growers—unfortunately, perhaps inevitably; not all of them—that there has not been a troglodyte&amp;hyphen;like call for a return to higher levels of tariff protection. Most growers recognise that the tariff course we have taken is, firstly, irreversible and has been taken by the parliament, not by the government or the opposition; and, secondly, our adherence to the obligations that we have under the WTO has given all sorts of market opportunities and market access that would otherwise have been denied us. The capacity, for example, of navel growers within the citrus industry to sell citrus fruit into the United States market, now the most lucrative market available to our navel growers, would not exist if it were not for our adherence to the WTO rules.

          Or, as the industry insisted on me adding, `not from concentrate product'—pure juice product.' This is an issue that I was pursuing jointly with former parliamentary secretary, Senator Nick Sherry. Both government and opposition have run into the same difficulty of determining precisely what is a food product. The difficulty we face is that while orange juice is distinctly the same as white milk—in other words, a pure product, and white milk has no sales tax on it and 100 per cent orange juice has a 10 per cent sales tax on it—the reality is that most white milk is not consumed as a beverage but consumed as a cooking item. It is used in custard, porridge, cereals or whatever whereas orange juice of similar food value tends to be consumed as a beverage. This differential has posed a problem for the parliament. It is a challenge that the government faces to look again at the way in which sales tax is applied and to revamp the entire taxation system. Finally, I have moved that this House:

          Or, as the industry prefers to say, `not from concentrate orange juice'. I understand the industry's enthusiasm for a relaxation of the sales tax rules on what we will call pure fruit juice as compared with concentrate. Their challenge may well be WTO legal. After all, we are not preventing anybody from bringing pure product into Australia; we are merely seeking a differential sales tax on imported

          I think it is a reasonable request. Having raised it with the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer), I have to concede that, when the Japanese sought to have a differential sales tax applied on Canadian whiskey, as opposed to their local sushi, they ran into problems under the like trade arrangements. I would, however, ask the Minister for Trade to look again at this request since the industry is calling for the sales tax on pure fruit juice product to be differential from the sales tax on concentrated fruit juice product, regardless of the origin. In that sense, it is seeking not to be seen as a trade disincentive because, regardless of the origin, the two products will be treated at a differential rate.

          If such a decision were possible—I am asking for assessment of it—it need not cost the Treasurer or the government anything in sales tax revenue because additional sales tax could be derived from a higher tax on a concentrated product and this could be used to open up the desperately needed export markets.

He outlined quite well the history that had been encountered by the citrus industry during the previous government's time in office in trying to get more of a focus on the export side of things as opposed to a heavily protected industry through a tariff on concentrate type juice in particular.

         I have some sympathy for the honourable member's motion calling for an assessment of the imposition of a sales tax on orange juice.

          Australia, presently receiving sales tax of 10 per cent, as opposed to a concentrated pow der, which is brought into our country and then manufactured into a drink and sold in competition with other drinks as compared with a freshly produced pure orange juice being sold in the local market. I think there should be a differential there. I would support something along the same lines with apple juice. The apple juice industry could also benefit from some sort of recognition in that area. It is certainly something that we should investigate.

         I am very pleased about what the member said in relation to the export side of this business. It is now taking off and we are exporting a lot more high quality oranges and trying to compete against South America with concentrate. I understand it is very difficult—when we produce and grow oranges we use a lot of irrigated water, which is costly and labour intensive—to compete against people like the Brazilians who grow oranges in a climate of great warmth and a lot of rain. Their oranges can grow in a very primitive state, if I can use that term, and they do not have to use the amount of irrigated water that we would use in Australia.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Trying to compete against the natural advantages of Brazil, we in Australia are better able to compete on getting that orange which we grow very well—it is a high grade product—into an export market situation and gain added value from that. We are doing that with bananas. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I am sure you would be well up on what is happening in the banana industry. I passed through your electorate some weeks ago. I am sure that you are on the same bandwagon of getting high quality export bananas from Australia into the export world.

        <para first-indent="16">
         When we are looking at these sorts of issues and, as this motion has touched on, the experience of AQIS in fresh foods entering Australia, we should consider the pressure put on us by imported products that could and do pose a threat of disease to our own local product. We have been involved in several of those in recent times, one being the salmon industry and now the apple and pear industry, which is very fearful of the fire blight disease,
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          and rightfully so, coming into Australia. Open access of that sort of product into Australia could prove very costly to us as a country and could also prove very costly to regional areas in our country. A lot of these issues go to—and the member for Wakefield is well aware of this—regional Australia because that is where we manufacture these products, that is where we grow these products and employment opportunities in regional Australia come from these products. We need to give a lot of emphasis to that.

         We also need to get decision makers to recognise that the Australian regional centres are about these industries and the added value of them. They are certainly affected in a great way by the reduction of tariffs and we need to be mindful of that. I have seen people around the country starting to take issue with the continued pace of tariff reduction. I think we should be waiting until our competitors are on a more even keel with us before we actually continue to race down that hill and pull tariffs back down.

I think people in regional Australia are starting to show their basic concern that, as we continue to race down the hill of pulling down tariffs without tying them to the reduction of our competitors, regional Australia is going to be damaged even more than it has been damaged in recent years.

          —In rising to support the motion introduced by the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), I acknowledge the experience he has had as a citrus grower in the Riverland district, which, along with Sunraysia and the Riverina, is one of Australia's major producers of citrus. The member for Wakefield has already touched on the problems Australian citrus growers are facing as a result of imports of low priced, mainly Brazilian, frozen concentrated orange juice, which is driving the costs of local citrus down to a level that puts the livelihood of many citrus growers at risk.

         I am sorry that I have only a short time to support the member for Wakefield and that my colleague the member for Mallee, Mr John Forrest, who is a strong advocate for the citrus industry, is unable to speak on this issue today. Because of the reasons raised by the member for Wakefield, the typical example of the situation facing growers in the

          Riverina is being experienced by my friend John. Recently, he had 2.56 tonnes of oranges picked, for which his gross earnings were $179.20. These oranges cost $128 to harvest and levies cost $21.76. This left a total profit of $29.44, or $11.50 a tonne. This $11.50 a tonne is to pay all the associated costs of farming, including water, power, fertiliser and a myriad of other costs. So the precarious situation being faced by John and many of his citrus growing colleagues can be seen.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Given the advantage of the Brazilian citrus producers, particularly in relation to vast plantations, cheap labour costs and climatic advantage, while ever frozen concentrated orange juice is imported into Australia and we continue to comply with our commitments to the World Trade Organisation obligations as a trading nation, the situation for citrus growers in the short term is going to be difficult. However, in recent times the industry has moved towards increased exports of fresh oranges and the production of freshly squeezed orange juice. Great strides have been made in those areas by an industry that has been disadvantaged by the GATT round.

         As you could imagine, Mr Deputy Speaker, those federal parliamentarians representing citrus growing areas have continued to bring the message to Canberra and have worked with industry and government to find a way to ensure the industry's viability. In their turn, representatives of the citrus industry have been very strong in their advocacy. The President of the Australian Citrus Growers, Michael Crook, believes the citrus industry has been under attack from Canberra for something like 10 years, while governments prematurely reduce tariffs and fiddle with sales tax and labelling regulations in an apparent vendetta aimed at killing off the industry and making it almost impossible for consumers to identify Australian product.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Ron Calibria, the President of the Griffith and District Citrus Growers, has reminded the government that returns to growers have dropped to as low as $30 per tonne. He has blamed Canberra's unrealistic speedy push for free trade and minimum protection levels which he believes have crippled a large sector of the vibrant citrus industry.

          While the government's hands appeared to be tied in a number of areas because of our  obligations under the World Trade Organisation, one suggestion mooted for some time is to have freshly squeezed orange—that is, not from concentrate juice—rightly reclassified as a food, which will then make it tax free and more competitive on the supermarket shelf. The present tax regime appears to be unfair, given that items like milk, coffee and tea are not taxed and are classified as foods.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The sales tax on freshly squeezed orange juice—that is, not from concentrate—is not consistent with the many thousands of tonnes of fresh oranges being squeezed with in-store juicing machines in retail stores for which consumers pay no tax. I do not believe they should pay tax, but neither should there be a tax on any not from concentrate freshly squeezed orange juice, whether processed in a retail shop or in a large commercial operation.

          Over recent years and under strong local and national leadership, the citrus industry has read the signals and is moving to readjust the industry. Plans like Kick&amp;hyphen;start Sunraysia, which could be a blueprint for other citrus growing regions, can be a good initiative. The rebudding of trees to more suitable varieties will be of limited help because of the complexity of the seasonable markets and the supply and demand situation for the two main varieties of oranges.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The growth of an export fresh fruit market is developing, as is the growth of the freshly squeezed orange juice market, and this is the main light at the end of the tunnel. However, the industry needs time for these adjustments to have effect. It is believed within the industry that the best way to assist at this time is to remove altogether the tax on fresh frozen orange juice—that is, not from concentrate orange juice.

What he is saying is that there are legitimate mechanisms under the World Trade Organisation rules which allow us to provide for the citrus industry special consideration and special benefits.

This show is a direct link between the agricultural past of the district and the modern urban residential area it is today.

If Telstra keeps up these tactics, I am sure that Mrs Vaby, the residents of Berkshire Park and the rest of us in the electorate of Lindsay will turn to Optus, Vodafone or some other carrier to provide us with the services that Telstra has hitherto been providing. Obviously it is a case of bringing consumer power to bear. I seek to have Telstra reconsider their siting of the tower and look at some less visually obtrusive and less habitated areas of the electorate to site this really unsightly tower.

What was brought to the particular attention of the commission members was the change that occurs in evaporation basins when they are properly monitored, and the relatively low outflow of drainage water that results from the rehabilitation of irrigation areas. Five of the government irrigation areas in South Australia have been rehabilitated, and drainage from them has ceased to be a problem. In

         He displayed a remarkable instinct for survival in a political system which tested that quality to the utmost. Along with his family and many of his colleagues, Deng suffered for his views during the Cultural Revolution. He combined political skill with vision and commonsense.

         Deng did not seek to build a personality cult around himself, as had many communist leaders before him. His economic pragmatism was reflected in his famous statement that it does not matter whether a cat is black or white as long as it catches mice. The same pragmatism was evident in his international dealings and in his active support for strengthening relationships with the United States, Japan and other Western and Asian countries. This same pragmatism was reflect

         Deng Xiaoping was instrumental after the death of Mao Zedong and the Cultural Revolution in lifting the political terror that had earlier gripped China. His rise to power saw the freeing of thousands of political prisoners. He encouraged cultural and social liberalisation and reduced the intrusiveness of the state into the private lives of its citizens. It became easier for Chinese to get passports, to travel abroad and to marry foreigners. His reforms have transformed the way ordinary Chinese live.

         His political philosophy, however, was in its essence alien to our own standards and values. He remained committed to tight political control by the Communist Party. This contrasted with the economic change he successfully led and the place that China was seeking to create for itself in the world. These contradictions came to a tragic crisis at the time of the terrible suppression of the Tiananmen Square demonstrations in 1989. As many commentators have said, this is an issue for the next generation of China's leaders. We hope that they can harness the forces for change in a positive way that will consolidate China's stability and prosperity and the benefits of that for the Asia-Pacific region and the wider world.

         Deng Xiaoping's life is very much a history of China in the 20th century. When you contemplate the fact that he was born six years before the collapse of the last dynasty in China and leaves just before the conclusion of this century—a century of the most profound and dramatic political change in China with him in a leading position for about 60 or 70 years of it—it really is an extraordinary life.

         He studied for five years in France in the 1920s and joined the Socialist Youth League there. He was active in the communist underground in China when he returned in 1927.

        <para first-indent="16">
         That is an extraordinary history—one which intersects with ours at several points. As we review the history of this century, several things will start to emerge as we view its developments more objectively. I think one development that Australians probably do not contemplate sufficiently is the impact that that army—of which he was the commissar—and other Chinese forces, both nationalist and communist, played on the survival of this nation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is a simple fact of statistics that during World War II something like seven or eight times the number of Japanese forces were being held down in China than that number used by the Japanese in their invasion south to Australia. Probably the most significant role that the British played during the Second World War, from our point of view, was their activities in Burma, primarily designed not to defend the British Empire in India but basically to keep routes open to the Chinese forces in China that were resisting the Japanese and tying down very substantial numbers there. So as an active member of the military at that time, he was playing a substantial role indirectly in the defence of this nation.
        </para>

         He reviewed his political survival capabilities with a very high level of humour and, obviously, very high pragmatism and forbearance. He said once, `If there were an Olympic medal for people who repeatedly rise from their political plunges, I would be well qualified for that honour.' Risen though your Prime Minister has from time to time, Alexander, I do not think the stakes have ever been as high for him as they were for Deng Xiaoping.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The three great leaders of China in this period were Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping. It remains to be seen which of them was most influential on the direction
         <break page="1054" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          of Chinese policy in the next century, but you would have to say at this point of time that well ahead of the other two is, in fact, Deng Xiaoping. He has been, as the Prime Minister correctly outlined, responsible for a substantial opening of the Chinese economy, a series of experiments—the conclusion of which has not yet been reached—and the slogan that he developed for the development of his country; that is, two systems, one country. At least that was directed towards Hong Kong, but you might well say that of his attitude towards the Chinese economy.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have been, too, the beneficiary of this. Before Deng Xiaoping became the paramount leader in China, the two-way Chinese-Australian trade was some $300 million per annum. That is now $8 billion. That reflects the opportunity that arose from many countries, not just Australia, at the point of time when China decided it would be outward looking economically. The consequences are profound, of course, not only for the Australian economy but for the international economy. Most economists as they view the Pacific region assume that, provided the openness of the Chinese economy continues, access to it, and the development of it, will be the principal economic issue, the principal driving point, of the international economy during the next century.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Some people introduce reforms for one purpose and may produce others. The purpose for the reforms that Deng Xiaoping announced were for the benefit of the Chinese people, for the growth of the Chinese economy, for the spread of wealth to all the Chinese people. Whether that remains the only consequences of those reforms, we shall see. Those tragic events at Tiananmen Square were correctly referred to by the Prime Minister, but whether that is the last word on the issue of democracy in China is another matter altogether.

         I think many of us in this place would argue that once you have opened your economy—particularly where economies these days prosper by the extent to which they can usefully exploit access to information technology and the economic opportunities that arise out of that—whether you can sustain the level
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          of political central control in those circumstances is very highly problematic. If that proves to be the case in China over the course of the next century then, having ushered in one economic revolution for China, Deng Xiaoping may well become the person who in practical terms—no matter what the outcome of those tragic events back in 1989—may well have ushered in an entirely different political system as well.

         Whether or not that happens is no longer in Deng Xiaoping's hands. It is in the hands of his successors. I think it is probably true to say that we will not see again in China people with the level of dominance that those three individuals, including Deng Xiaoping, enjoyed. That level of dominance may not be enjoyed by anybody else in the Chinese leadership. Deng Xiaoping's strength, in part, was drawn from that history that I referred to—his ability to straddle all sides in Chinese politics, particularly that which is associated with the Chinese military. It is virtually impossible for any other person to assume that position himself.

         Suffice it to say that the President, whom the Prime Minister will be meeting shortly, has indicated an intention to maintain vigorously the reforms that were instituted by Deng Xiaoping. He has also indicated that the approach that was to be adopted towards Hong Kong will be persevered by the government, without Deng Xiaoping's overriding presence. That is to be very much hoped by all on this side of the House.

         In conclusion, and to reiterate, we see the passing of one of the truly great figures of the 20th century in Deng Xiaoping. When such a figure passes, neither the world nor his country can be completely unchanged as a result. Our hope for that country, for the relationship between our two countries and for the position of China's role in the international economy is that the world will be very much the better for his presence upon it.

         Australia is China's tenth largest trading partner and a major destination for China's foreign investment.

As we look to the next millennium, to the next century, to the next phase in the development of China and as we celebrate the 25th anniversary year of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Australia and China, we need to weigh very carefully the role that China is going to play in the modern world and especially the economic role it will take forward.

The government is taking steps to address Labor's legacy of unemployment. In the election campaign last year, we said that we wanted to expand quality training opportunities for young people through apprenticeships and traineeships. We wanted to give young people the sort of opportunities they were not getting through the short&amp;hyphen;term training programs offered to them by the Labor Party and by the member for Hotham in particular.

         Of course, you ran down the apprenticeship system. In 1995 the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships were the lowest proportion of the work force that they had been for three decades. I am very pleased today to inform the House that I have announced a network of 18 one&amp;hyphen;stop apprenticeship shops to open across Australia next month, in March, and this will be another key step in the establishment of a new national apprenticeship system to give quality training opportunities to young Australians. There will be four such shops in New South Wales, four in Victoria, three in Queensland, two in Western Australia, two in South Australia, two in Tasmania and one in the Australian Capital Territory.

         The Commonwealth government is providing $5.2 million towards the establishment of these one&amp;hyphen;stop apprenticeship shops and the state and territory governments are providing $3.1 million. This is an historic cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states to

        <para first-indent="16">
         These one&amp;hyphen;stop shops will greatly simplify access to apprenticeships and traineeships for businesses and young people. The shops will reduce the approval time for new apprenticeships in new industries from up to a year, which they took under the previous government, to as little as one week in some cases. That is a massive cutting through of the red tape which the previous government did nothing to change over its 13 years in government.

         It will now be much easier for young people to start apprenticeships and traineeships, particularly in regional Australia.

That shows the commitment of the coalition to the regions neglected by the Labor Party.

         Another important feature of these pilot one&amp;hyphen;stop shops will be that many of them will be managed by industry. Email will operate the one&amp;hyphen;stop shop in Orange. Multiplex will be running the shop at Homebush Bay. Indeed, this will be an important way of encouraging young people into training to help build the Olympic facilities. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry for Western Australia will be managing the Perth projects because, unlike the previous government, we realise that the interest in quality training is particularly in the small business sector and the large businesses. We believe that business enterprises in this country can offer these services in an efficient way that cannot be offered by bureaucracy alone.

Any use of mercenaries would be absolutely and completely unacceptable and would do great damage to PNG not only in the eyes of Australians but in the eyes of people PNG need as their friends for years into the future.

Can I take the opportunity of saying that I believe that the present system of selecting High Court judges is entirely appropriate. It is a court which is established under the Australian constitution. The processes put in place by the Fraser government in 1976—I think they were initiated by the then Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, Bob Ellicott—involved consultation with the states before High Court judges were appointed. I think that is a very good procedure. It is a procedure that, in the event of there being any vacancies while we are in office, will be honoured not only in the letter but also in the spirit. The role of the High Court is to interpret the law, the role of the parliament is to make the law, and the laws governing Australians ought to be determined by the Australian parliament and by nobody else.

          It is nonetheless the case that many small businesses have yet to see the benefits of many of those changes and improvements flowing through. In particular, it is worth reminding those in the small business community who remain anxious about the future and concerned that the pace of change perhaps has not been as great as they would have liked and are perhaps understandably prone to be a little critical about the pace of change that many of the benefits have only just begun to flow through. For example, the beneficial effects of the changes in industrial relations only began to come into effect on 1 January.

Indeed, not only did they not have a proper process but there was evidence that Mr Kilin, to whom this reference had been made, had been able to circumvent those standards that were already in place.

This matter goes to a meeting that I had at the request of Mr Gruzman last year in which he had sought to demonstrate to me the virtues of his precision aerial dropping system, which is described as PADS. He demonstrated to me in the ministerial entrance foyer last year the way the equipment could work. I referred Mr Gruzman's request to Airservices Australia to see whether they felt it was appropriate to test the equipment in a proper situation.

          I discovered, following that, that Airservices Australia did choose to test the equipment that Mr Gruzman had available. They also tested it against their existing equipment, which had been the subject of considerable controversy over the years. Those who have followed this issue with any interest would realise that there has been some controversy over the quality of the Airservices' equipment that is being used for search and rescue. A trial was run and it was found that the equipment provided by Mr Gruzman, PADS, hit the target eight times out of nine, whereas the Airservices' equipment hit the target only three times out of nine. So, from Airservices' own trialling of this equipment, it became apparent to Airservices, so I discovered, that the PADS equipment was far more useful, far more accurate and far more likely to save the lives of those people who have been lost at sea.

           bourne raised, which was in the 1995 RAAF report that he referred to. It goes back to 1990 when the former Minister for Transport, Senator Bob Collins—and I was briefed on this issue by Airservices Australia last year—instructed, according to their words, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority to buy the very same PADS equipment and to have that equipment purchased and installed as part of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's own equipment for search and rescue.

I find it somewhat strange that those in the opposition today can find that the process that Senator Bob Collins, the then Minister for Transport, engaged in, which did not involve a product trial, which did not involve a tendering process and which involved an instruction to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, is somehow right and that the process that I engaged in, which was to refer this matter to Airservices Australia for testing, is somehow wrong. I think there is a double standard here which highlights the silly little political game that these people are engaged in.

All introductions and releases of biological control agents—whether by CSIRO or anyone else—have to satisfy the requirements of the Quarantine Act and the Wildlife Protection Act, and obtain permits and authorisations. These are given only after consideration of a proposal by 21 different agencies—federal and state—covering agricultural and conservation interests. So I can conclude only that those who make these wild claims have not investigated the issue of rabbit calicivirus disease as thoroughly as Australia has.

A very important point, and one worth noting from the House's point of view, is that the PADS equipment, when trialled against the existing equipment, hit the target eight times out of nine. Airservices' equipment hit the target eight times out of nine.

The government has been working to restore the balance in the migration program to ensure that we obtain an economic benefit as well as a social benefit from the immigration outcome. One of the areas in which we have been able to provide additional places has been the business skills program, which brings in entrepreneurs, those with business acumen and those who are prepared to invest in Australia and its future.

          In the first half of this financial year, business migrants invested $187 million in state government securities, which is one of the requirements under that leg of the program. The funds are obviously working for Australia. The state governments use those funds for part of the government securities in infrastructure and public works.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In addition, migrants across the business migration categories are expected to bring in $850 million in 1996-97. On average, each family transfers something of the order of $795,000 within two years of arrival, and half of that is invested in their business activities. We monitor this part of the program very closely, as we want to ensure that people make those investments. What we have established is an excellent record in performance.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Within two years of arrival, 75 per cent are in business—mostly small business. They are creating jobs because, on average, they employ 5.6 people. Sixty&amp;hyphen;three per cent are involved in exports, and 25 per cent have an annual turnover of one million or more. This is a very important reason why we ought to be ensuring that there is growth in this part of the program and to be redressing the balance  that we have seen in recent years get very much out of line.

        Repatriation Benefits

       </para>

        The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        There are two forms of benefits for ex&amp;hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&amp;hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&amp;hyphen;

         members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.

        It is claimed that:

        (a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&amp;hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&amp;hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Your petitioners therefore request the House to remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act thereby restoring justice and recognition of honourable `active service' with the Royal Australian Navy in direct support of British and Malayan forces during the Malayan Emergency between 1955 and 1960.

        The Petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that under the Quarantine (Animals) Regulations of the Quarantine Act 1908, approval is given for the importation of free ranging exotic animals such as lions, tigers, bears, elephants and non&amp;hyphen;human primates to be used for entertainment purposes in circuses and mobile displays. The issue of circuses using animals is very complex and includes: Transportation of animals, where the animals are kept in tiny cages, often travelling in extremes of temperature over long periods; stressful training techniques, often based on fear, deprivation and brutality and often inhumane living conditions, which do not allow any display of instinctual behaviours. We also believe that inappropriate messages are put forward by forcing wild animals to perform circus tricks. It is certainly not consistent with the focus  on environmental awareness for people, especially children to learn that it is acceptable to exploit wild animals for human entertainment. We therefore humbly ask that the House prohibit the importation of all animals including those listed under CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) for use in both international and Australian circuses. We ask this based upon the inhumane

        <para style="Para">
         It is true to say that the Middle East has been a powder keg for some time, but we have recently witnessed moves to establish peace there. A great irony is that two of the leading protagonists, President Yasser Arafat and the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, established their reputations as peacemakers. In 1994, both were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, quite justly, for their efforts.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But the smooth progress of peace in the Middle East was severely interrupted with the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and, of course, the House passed a resolution of condolence on his assassination. Shimon Peres, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, took over as Prime Minister for an interim period, but I think it is true to say that he did not enjoy the same stature in the negotiations as his predecessor and the situation was a little bit more unstable after the assassination.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We then had the Israeli elections and, although they were very close and hard fought, Shimon Peres lost the election. We now have Prime Minister Netanyahu. He was originally elected on an anti-peace program—certainly not one of giving land for peace. That is the background to this motion which I moved and which, I am pleased to say, will
         <break page="1079" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          be seconded by my good friend and colleague the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson).
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Since that motion was placed on the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Notice Paper
         </emphasis>
         , I am pleased to report to the House that, once again, the pace of Middle East peace negotiations has picked up. We have seen, with the election of President Arafat, democracy installed in the Palestinian authority. We have also seen the difficult issue of Hebron negotiated between the parties and the occupying Israeli forces withdrawn.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is no doubt that there are even more difficult hurdles to negotiate between the two leaders. I think this House can only wish them both well and trust that there will be further successful negotiations and a greater embedding of peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, this motion also deals with Lebanon. It is sad to report to the House that, notwithstanding the Taif accord signed in Saudi Arabia at Tarif in September 1989, Lebanon is still an occupied country. I suppose there are three groups of forces there. Firstly, the Israelis occupy southern Lebanon. Secondly, we have the Syrians there with a sizeable army of something like 30,000. Thirdly, the Hezbollah, which are backed by Iran and Syria, are also in Lebanon. The Taif accord was the peace plan that got a cease&amp;hyphen;fire between the warring parties, the Christians and the Muslims, and restored some semblance of order and government back to Lebanon, where they had suffered some 30 years of warfare.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Whilst we refer to the government of Lebanon, it is true that it is hostage to the Syrians. The purpose of the motion is to suggest that all foreign forces should withdraw from Lebanon. You will not be able to successfully negotiate a peace plan between Jordan—as has already been done—Palestine, Syria and Egypt and leave Lebanon as it is. In fact, Lebanon more than anything else seems to be the forgotten country in the peace process. I hope that situation will change.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would like to give the history of Lebanon. It is a country with a long and, more recently,  sad history. Its history is interwoven with our own, because we have not only 100,000 people born in Australia but a further 400,000
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          people who can trace their ancestry to Lebanon. Once the homeland of the ancient Phoenician traders, Lebanon became part of the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century. After World War I, the Greater Lebanese state was created and administered by France under a League of Nations mandate from 1920 until its independence was declared on 26 November 1941.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A republic was established in 1943, and full autonomy granted in 1944. Lebanon is characterised by religious and cultural diversity. At the time of independence, the Christian communities had a slight majority, the largest of these being the Maronite Christians—nearly 30 per cent of the total. I know in the electorate of the member for Reid—and certainly in my own—there is a significant Maronite Christian population.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The relative size of the communities provided the basis of the unwritten `national pact' of 1943, which tried to strike a balance of power between the Christian and Muslim groups, by giving equal representation along religious rather than ideological grounds. The two groups were able to live together in relative peace and harmony for the next 30 years. This balance was thrown out by the later influx of Palestinian refugees created from the new state of Israel—and subsequent Arab&amp;hyphen;Israeli wars—and the unrest in the Muslim groups who believed that the government no longer reflected the true `balance' of the population.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         By the 1970s, it was generally accepted that the Christians no longer formed the majority, but the government was seen to favour them. At the same time—1968 onwards—Palestinian freedom fighters based in southern Lebanon not only clashed with the Israeli forces but with the Lebanese Christians groups—despite Lebanese Muslim sympathy for the Palestinian cause.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Unable to control the violence between the Phalangists and the Palestinian groups, the Lebanese government of President Sulaiman Franjiyia resigned in April 1975. The conflict soon escalated into a full scale civil war between the Lebanese National Movement and conservative Christian groups. The main cause of the violence changed focus from the
         <break page="1080" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          treatment of the Palestinians to changing the constitutional order of the Lebanese state—seen to favour the Christian minority.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         After at least 50 failed cease&amp;hyphen;fire agreements, a more durable cease&amp;hyphen;fire was secured at the Arab summit meetings in October 1976. This was a result of Syrian intervention in the conflict in mid&amp;hyphen;1976 in order to prevent an outright Lebanese National Movement victory. After this cease&amp;hyphen;fire, a 30,000 strong Arab Deterrent Force, mainly Syrian, entered Lebanon and halted hostilities for a short time. Despite this, the civil war has left the militias in control of most of the country. In September 1976, the Maronite militias united, becoming the Lebanese Forces, and gradually took control of East Beirut and much of northern Lebanon.

          —No conflict since the end of the Second World War has been so constant, so continuously in the minds of people of the Western world, so ready to erupt onto the front pages of our papers or onto our evening television bulletins than the conflict in the Middle East. Neither the tragedy that is Northern Ireland nor the troubles closer to home in East Timor or in Bougainville have attracted the world attention of the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.

         For decades we, in this country, have watched from afar as the conflict is played out in a series of wars, peace accords, transgressions and political rhetoric. At times there seemed great hope for peace; at times, considerable despair that the aspirations of different peoples would be reduced to armed struggle.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         All of this is background to the events of the past few years in which the coexistence of the Israeli and Arab people has been at the forefront of regional and global attention. In October 1991, leaders of the Arab and Israeli peoples gathered in Madrid, the first of a series of meetings over the years that have edged forward the peace process.

         In September 1993, Israeli and Palestinian leaders declared a number of principles in

          Oslo which established the basis for the resolution of ongoing disputes between both groups. The Oslo agreement was then followed by an agreement in Cairo in 1994. These agreements resulted in the redeployment of the Israeli defence forces from all major Palestinian cities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with the exception of Hebron, and the election of a Palestinian Council with Yasser Arafat as chairman.

         Following the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin and the subsequent election of Benjamin Netanyahu to the prime ministership of Israel, many commentators doubted that the new leader would implement the Oslo agreement. Given Mr Netanyahu's public comments doubting the agreement on occasions, there was some justification for these misgivings. But, in the end, the election promises were honoured and the Hebron agreement signed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That such an agreement was entered into by Benjamin Netanyahu illustrates a changing assessment of the Israeli&amp;hyphen;Palestinian question. It was the first time that a Likud government has negotiated and signed an agreement with the Palestinian Liberation Organisation. As the Israeli commmentator Ze'ev Chafets wrote recently in the

        <para font-size="-=2">
         To say yes to Hebron, Mr Netanyahu had to jettison 50 years of revisionist orthodoxy about the indivisibility of the land of Israel. He had to renounce his own previous writings and speeches, to break ideologically with the father he venerates, to alienate the West Bank settlers who helped elect him and to infuriate many in his Likud Party. He is also risking his life.

         But the agreement should not be mistaken. Behind it is an unshakeable commitment to the security of Israel. Unless that is recognised, hopes of peaceful resolution will be lessened. In this context, Australia has supported the right of Palestinians to self&amp;hyphen;determination. To this end, there are a number of pledges by the PLO that remain unfulfilled, including the promise to revise its charter to

         The interim agreement on 28 September 1995 states that Israel and the Palestinian Authority shall seek to foster mutual understanding and tolerance and shall accordingly abstain from incitement, including hostile propaganda against each other. Given the subsequent Hebron agreement, we can only hope that such reciprocal actions follow soon.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The situation of southern Lebanon is another instance of the need for real reciprocity in action. The conflict, as the honourable member before me pointed out, is now some 20 years old. It commenced with Israeli efforts to drive Palestinian forces from the state's northern border. As we know, Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982, withdrawing in 1985 and subsequently creating a 14&amp;hyphen;kilometre wide security zone between the two nations. As we speak, debate continues in Israel about withdrawal from the zone.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Australian government has supported United Nations Security Council resolution 425 which calls for the explicit withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon and `calls upon Israel immediately to cease its military action against Lebanese territorial integrity and withdraw forthwith its forces from all Lebanese territory'. In my opinion, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the region is less likely in the absence of a commitment from the Hezbollah forces that they will be controlled by the Lebanese army and not respond in turn by attacking northern Israel.

         Then there is the position of Syria which has shown itself intransigent to date. It is unrealistic, for example, to expect Israel to hand back the strategic Golan Heights in the absence of any guarantee against shellings of the like of those which were undertaken prior to 1967.

         One matter should be clear from the events of the past months, years and decades: that is, peaceful coexistence in the Middle East will only be possible if all the parties recognise the absolute, unshakeable commitment of the Jewish people to the maintenance of the state  of Israel.

         What we are seeing is a culmination of the reality of the collapse of the Cold War. The United States taxpayer is less inclined now to spend $2 billion to $3 billion a year financing the Israeli state. More particularly, there is a greater questioning in United States politics of the advisability of the extension of housing into occupied parts of Palestine. That is the fundamental reality that the Israeli state does have to face, regardless of whether it is led by a Netanyahu, a Peres or a Rabin.
        </para>

         When we talk about balance, it is worth noting that Netanyahu is being courageous in going against some of the indications he gave earlier. I do not think for one moment that we should ignore the difficulties that Arafat faces internally in his organisation as to how far he has had to carry the PLO. They might have had a restriction imposed on them by the reality of the closing off of Arab finance after their support for Iraq against Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Internally, it is a very difficult process for him just as much as it is for Netanyahu.

         On the question of Palestine, I for one, whilst a very long&amp;hyphen;term supporter of the Palestinian cause, would at this stage voice some concerns over the question of human rights within the Palestinian ruled area and the deaths of people in custody. There are real questions regarding the proper training of Palestinian police and their ability to adhere to human rights requirements. A significant number of people have already died in custody. That is one thing that we should bear in mind.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In a similar vein, on the other hand the Western world has to appreciate the difficulties that the Palestinian state does face. The World Bank has estimated that $2.4 billion will be required over a five&amp;hyphen;year period to essentially establish the state. The World Bank, of course, is not a propaganda organisation in the service of the PLO so that is probably a fair estimate of things. I appreciate that the Australian government has given $15 million over a three&amp;hyphen;year period. We have been in there and we are playing a real role in training and some other areas.

But we should not run away from the reality that some people in Lebanese politics, who cooperated in massacres like Sabra and Shatilla, at one stage wanted foreign interference because they themselves were on the back foot. We have to be consistent and say that  we do want the withdrawal of all foreign forces. We do not want the interference of

However, by far the greatest hindrance to Lebanon's return to genuine freedom and self-determination is the political and military interference by Syria.

The reality is that because so many of these creatures have an in-built anti-freeze compound and because so many of these creatures have in-built sunscreens, the potential for humanity from research in Antarctica is absolutely enormous.

Before I leave the subject, I want to talk about some of its research programs because the connection between surface and deep waters of the world is vitally important. The oceans control the movement of heat and that affects climate change. The CRC is doing an enormous
          <break page="1085" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           amount of work on climate, on the movement of the oceans and on the ice sheet mass balance.

          We should realise that if all the ice in Antarctica were to melt, the oceans of the world would rise by 60 metres. That does not bear thinking about. It is also interesting that, whereas there is so much talk about global climate change and warming, the reality is that it is expected that the sea level around the world will fall by 10 centimetres or more by the year 2050.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is interesting, too, that with that ice sheet, because water expands when it is warmer, the sea level rises. Warmer weather, more evaporation. More evaporation, more snow on Antarctica and more water on the ice sheet. So you have got this connection. In summer there are about four million square kilometres of sea ice around the landmass. In winter that gets to 19 million or perhaps even 22 million square kilometres of ice.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The final point I need to make is that water becomes heavier as it freezes into pack ice. The salt drops out. It drives a massive ocean circulation further than the equator. Of the Antarctic bottom water, 10 million cubic metres per second pass north from the Weddell and Ross seas alone, plus several million cubic metres from Adelie Land. The Antarctic research programs conducted by ANARE and the CRC are of vital importance to Australia, they are of great significance to the world and they deserve the support of this House.

This view, held deplorably but in a bipartisan way during the past 15 years in Australia, asserted that all values had a dollar equivalent and that the worth of scientific endeavour ought to depend on support from industry.

          Antarctic research is difficult, dangerous, exciting and costly. As you know, Antarctica is the driest, coldest, windiest but also the highest continent on Earth. But we can never predict the value of research in advance. In 1995 the Nobel Prize for chemistry was awarded for explanations of the ozone hole phenomenon, first detected by British observers at the Halley Base. It was shared by Paul Crutzen, Mario Molina and Sherry Rowland—not to be confused with Dick Morris's former associate. This is a classic example of vitally important work which was regarded for many years as being of no value.

          I should declare an interest. I had ministerial responsibility for Antarctica from March 1983 to July 1987. My only visit to Antarctica, courtesy of the US Air Force, was in December 1983 when I was able to inspect McMurdo, South Pole, Bull Pass and the `dry valleys', the New Zealand Scott Base and Lake Vanda. I confess never to have visited an Australian base, unlike the honourable member for Cowper, and can only claim that in walking around the south poles—both the geographic pole and the photographic pole—I went through every meridian of longitude in the two Australian sectors.

          It is true that Australia has been involved in Antarctic research for a very long time. Sir Douglas Mawson was there first in 1909 with Sir Edgeworth David in a British scientific expedition. Mawson then first found the south magnetic pole, which, as you know, migrates

In the first, the great geologist Sir Edgeworth David made pioneering discoveries, the implications of which we are only now coming to grips with. After a very long gap, Antarctic research began again in December 1947.

This was incorporated in the Madrid protocol of 1991, which prohibited mineral and oil exploration and preserved Antarctica as a unique laboratory for climatology and oceanography.

The Cooperative Research Centre for the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Environment, to give it its full name, is a joint venture between the Australian Antarctic Division, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the Australian Geological Survey Organisation, CSIRO and the University of Tasmania. They are making very major contributions to our understanding of the great phenomena down there.

           Mention has already been made of the work being done on the ice sheet mass balance. There was some speculation that if we were going through the phenomenon of global warming—which we certainly appear to be in Melbourne—then there was likely to be, it was assumed, increased calving of the great ice mass down in Antarctica, which would then lead to a melt down and therefore a catastrophic rise in sea levels.

           However, this appears simply not to be the case, according to the work being done by the Antarctic CRC. This is a discovery of tremendous significance. Nevertheless, as recent photographs in the newspapers and on television indicate, some extraordinary things are going on in central Antarctica. Great fissures are arising, quite unprecedented in their size and extent. There are still very many mysterious problems that we do not quite understand the reasons for.

           It is also still an open question as to whether the overall mass balance of all the other drainage systems of Antarctica is positive or negative, and therefore whether the balance of the complete Antarctic ice sheet is close to equilibrium.

           This is an area of very great significance. I was looking at the annual report of the Department of the Environment and the costing of the scientific work being done. I came across some odd figures suggesting that the total amount of expenditure on Antarctic research for the last four or five years adds up to approximately the cost of running the constitutional convention in November of this year. Arguably, one might think that the total value of Antarctic research over that period will be considerably more than the constitutional convention. Still, we shall see.

           The average snowfall in Antarctica is equivalent to only about 15 centimetres of water per year, confirming that it is by far the driest continent on earth. Over thousands of years the snowfall has built an ice sheet covering the continent with an average thickness of about two kilometres. It is often forgotten just how huge that icecap is.

           Extraordinary work is being done on bacteria. The Antarctic CRC has discovered a readily cultivatable bacteria which may reduce the considerable cost of enriching the diet of farmed fish. The new bacteria, which come off the sea ice from Antarctica, may be readily grown in existing equipment on fish farms to provide a much cheaper source of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids to young fish. Again, this is something that was undreamt of a few years ago but which may well have a quite fundamental impact on the viability of the Australian fishing industry. It is another classic example of how some of the most important contributions to society in the economy come from scientific research.

As this ice sheet holds 90 per cent of the world's ice, we are also looking at 70 per cent of the world's fresh water supply. Because of its remoteness, this ice is very pure, but small traces of impurities are detectable by today's sophisticated equipment. As a result, we have an instant environmental record stretching back over 200,000 years.

Australia, as you have heard, Mr Deputy Speaker, is a member of the Antarctic treaty, with some 12 nations originally signing that treaty. Since then another 29 nations have been included. The treaty stipulates, amongst other things, that the Antarctic should forever be used exclusively for peaceful purposes. It also prohibits any measures of a military nature. The treaty also guarantees freedom of scientific research throughout Antarctica and promotes the exchange of information. The scientific aspect has been most successful. Currently, Australian scientists are working with other treaty members on an international research program on global change.

         I, like all Australians, realise that we are faced with a spiralling bill for the provision of health services and that no government has yet discovered the magic solution to provide adequate health care for all Australians, irrespective of where they live and the level of medical expertise they require, at less cost than last year's expenditure.

         Today I would like to cite one example of how the system has gone so terribly wrong as to have a devastating impact on one particular family in my electorate; how cuts to the Royal Hobart Hospital have resulted in less than acceptable services being provided for patients resulting, in some cases, in premature death and suicide and unbelievable stress on the families who care for their terminally ill relatives.

         You are, of course, well aware that I spoke on T.V. and to the press in regard to the conditions at Royal Hobart Hospital. My family have experienced some of those conditions first hand. The struggle we had to get Ben, my husband, admitted because at the time he was not on the waiting list defies description . . . I appeal for help to bring all this to your attention in the hope that you would see sense and do something to ease the situations at the R.H.H. and all other departments of health care.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The R.H.H. has a dedicated team of surgeons all of whom have trained, studied and worked for years to specialise in their field, all of whom took an oath to "heal the sick". They work long hours under stressful conditions due to your cutting of funds to the hospital.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The night my husband was admitted, a surgeon came to see us and had to inform us that he had just come from attending a meeting in regard to surgery for Ben "he was sorry," he said but they could not operate on Ben because "there isn't the finance". The surgeon was distressed at having to tell us that.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Ben finally got his operation four days later by a surgeon who took time and cared enough to phone me personally to tell me Ben had only a matter of a few weeks to live. I wish I could name him. We have accepted this. We didn't go on `air' to condemn nor to complain about the treatment Ben received. I had already told the surgeons and hospital staff that I was, somehow, going to try to make you aware of what the Government Funding Cuts to the R.H.H was doing.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The R.H.H cannot open extra theatres nor call in a surgical team when it is necessary, i.e when emergencies are admitted and require immediate surgery. This entails in&amp;hyphen;patients awaiting surgery, some already prepped for theatre having to have their surgery cancelled. All due to lack of funds.

         You made the remark that "the Jacksons received palliative care, a weekly visit which is free." Yes, we do, we have never denied this. The palliative care team are on call to give us medical advice and a fortnightly or, when necessary, a weekly visit. They too are a dedicated team under Dr. Dunn, who is himself one of the most compassionate of men I have met and palliative care patients are lucky to have him and his team of nurses to help us. However, again, due to lack of funds the care

         This then brings in the Community Care Nursing Assoc. Due to shortage of palliative care nurses etc the community nurses have to carry out daily visits to palliative care patients plus all homecare patients. A daunting task made worse by once again a lack of funds. Now, on top of trying to carry out their nursing duties they are also having to be `clerical assistants' too due to all the form filling they have to do for each patient in regard to the home care charges the Health System has now been brought in. Now you are hitting out at the aged, the sick and the disabled by bringing in charges for home care. You say charges will be waived if home care patients can't afford to pay. Why charge them in the first place? You must be aware that almost all home care patients are aged pensioners or invalid pensioners who already are struggling to cope on very low incomes.

         I phoned your office on two occasions a few days after Ben had his surgery begging you to do something to help surgeons and staff of R.H.H. in fact I was quite rude. I suggested you took a bag into Parliament House and ask all the politicians to put their $3000 `Holiday perk' into it and donate it to the R.H.H. I also asked that you return my call when you were available and wondered whether you were given my message or not; I don't know. So I will ask you again Mr McKay, help the R.H.H., release the funds they need, help the community care nursing, help palliative care, by doing so you will help the people of Tasmania, the sick, those who are waiting for operations who are in pain and can't lead normal lives until they can have medical attention.

We didn't go `open' to make a sob story nor to get pity as some may think. Ben and I handle our tragedy as many more families in the same situation as we are are having to do. All we ask is that you do your duty towards the health system of Tasmania and help the sick of Tasmania. I thanked the surgeons staff of R.H.H. for all they have done to try to help us.

          —It is almost exactly 12 months since this government was elected to office and since I became the member for Parramatta. I think it is an appropriate time to have a quick review or report card, if you like, of the achievements over the past 12 months of both this government and its alternative, the Australian Labor Party in opposition, especially as those achievements affect western Sydney. I note that the people of western Sydney went into the last election with a number of principal concerns. They were concerned about jobs and job security, their families and their capacity to make ends meet. They were concerned about the degradation of the environment and about small business.

         Just to give a quick summary, I am delighted to say that, for me, one of the highlights of the past year has been the launch of the family tax initiative at Wentworthville in my electorate—$1 billion paid in full, as promised, to help Australian families make ends meet, those who are investing in the next generation of young Australians. Under the leadership of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith), we have substantially reformed and amended the unfair dismissal legislation, which presented such an obstacle to the employment of young people. The cabinet committee on employment, instigated by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), has now returned with an innovative and very well received proposal involving work for the dole for those many unemployed young people who want to acquire the skills necessary to get into employment.

         We are reducing red tape for small business. We have provided rollover relief from capital gains tax. We are undertaking a most effective and much needed reform to the health care system under the leadership of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge). That reform is directed towards keeping the public health system viable—a system which has been allowed to so deleteriously run down over the past decade or so. We now look certain to be able to introduce the most generous and expansive environ

         There is still much to be done. But, in terms of the things that the people of western Sydney had in their hearts and minds when going into the last election, we have honoured our fundamental undertakings and taken those first steps forward to address some of those issues which had been left in desuetude for so many years.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If by contrast we ask, `Well, what have the ALP offered to western Sydney; what has been their practice; what has been in their hearts and minds over the past 12 months?' the initial indications might provide some encouragement. We saw in a single month, the month of December, across New South Wales an increase in membership of the ALP by 10 per cent involving over 2,000 new members. One might have thought that had been prompted by a very carefully managed education campaign in which the high ideals of the Australian Labor Party were communicated to people around the nation, in which the memory of Ben Chifley and perhaps of Gough Whitlam and commitment to social justice and the needs of the poor were all clearly articulated in a persuasive exercise which caused this flood of entry into the Australian Labor Party.

         I have to admit that many people may have been somewhat surprised at the press release, although—and I do not want to make myself a media adviser to the ALP in this parliament—I think some may have missed it.

         So this is the great vision of leadership which the Australian Labor Party holds out to the people of western Sydney! This is not the opinion of the member for Parramatta; this is an ALP press release from 11 members of this parliament. They say:

         As funding disappears, the Legal Aid Commission will inevitably be forced to make some tough decisions—tougher than the ones it has already had to make. I have been informed that the commission is now looking closely at removing itself from dealing with domestic violence matters, a decision which will have a dramatic effect on a great number of women and children in my area who are victims of domestic abuse year in and year out. It will not be able to provide legal representation for the prosecution of apprehended violence orders. It will not be able to provide legal representation in cases of suspected child abuse, sexual or otherwise.

         Another area which is likely to be affected by these cuts is legal aid's ability to assist in civil law matters, particularly via the very successful system of civil litigation advocates introduced by the previous government. Three civil litigation specialists were attached to existing legal centres, including Fairfield, as part of the Labor government's access to justice reforms.

         These specialists assist primarily in three fields: consumer credit, contracts for review and matters concerning the fair trading act. In layman's terms, their representation includes assisting a non-English speaking client tricked into signing a long-term credit agreement by a business person who has taken advantage of their poor English skills. It means protecting people on low incomes from unscrupulous traders or businesses—rip-off merchants, if you like—who seem to prey on the uninformed, the uneducated, the elderly, the migrants in my community or people on limited incomes.

         The people being helped by these civil solicitors are the so-called battlers which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) purports to represent.

They are the people whose civil and legal rights the Prime Minister will dramatically undermine by taking away this money from legal aid. Take away Commonwealth funding and this service disappears. There is no money with which to replace it. Yet before the last election the coalition promised in its pre-election policy to `match and extend Labor's commitment to access to justice measures', measures including this system of civil litigation advocates—you were not making the distinction between Commonwealth and state responsibilities then.

I say to Mr Doherty that, while it is all very well for you to express your opposition to the cutbacks when asked by the local paper, I would suggest your concerns would carry far greater weight if you and your group took a more pro&amp;hyphen;active approach, similar to one you took with me a couple of years ago.

Why have I received close to 15 letters from various local, state and national organisations requesting I make representations on their behalf to the federal government over legal aid, yet not received one from their society?

What he failed to tell his backbenchers is that it is there until 30 June, the end of this financial year. What he also failed to tell his people on that side that we on this side know full well was that, when you take on a legal case, no matter how quickly you can get it into the courts, you will not get a listing for anything up to six months.

Yet they are being told by this government that, as of 30 June, the money is not going to be there.

Less often such poor treatment emanates from major accounting firms. Today I want to tell the House of a scandalous treatment by both a bank and a multinational accounting firm affecting a fair sized business which serves as an example of what I have often heard happens to people in small business, the farming sector and others who are least able to fight the banks when the receivership axe is wielded.

         Recently Gordon Bartlett came to see me about what he has been through. The Bartlett family have been involved in hospitality since they started with a Gold Coast motel back in the 1970s, growing to a chain of five motels in the 1990s, including the Tower Mill motel located in Brisbane. Bartlett's became the biggest independent group of moteliers in Queensland.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In 1990 the Bartlett group entered into a financial arrangement with the then Challenge Bank at the market interest rate of 15.35 per cent. In 1992, the loan was refinanced with conditions, including the sale of the Tower Mill motel, payment of an unwind fee of almost $1 million and a bank establishment fee of $90,000. At the time the group had a tax bill of $400,000, which was later repaid. However, group tax penalties of $26,000 remained outstanding, and the Deputy Com

         The Bartlett group had assets to sell and income to trade out of their difficulties if the banks had only given them the chance to stay in the game. As you would remember, back then in 1992&amp;hyphen;93 the tourism industry was in very tough times, yet Bartlett's Burke and Wills chain accommodated some 100,000 guests, at occupancy rates of between 50 and 85 per cent. Turnover was approximately $10 million.

        <para first-indent="16">
         On 30 April 1993, the highest bid Mr Bartlett had received for his Tower Mill motel—a Brisbane landmark—was $2.5 million. This was $400,000 less than he had paid for the motel in 1985. He had further substantially enhanced the property by spending another $2.9 million in renovations.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In late May 1993, Mr Bartlett met the Challenge Bank executives to discuss the Tower Mill situation, among other things. He told me he left the meeting convinced no action would be taken to fire sale the Tower Mill, yet within days Challenge Bank had served notices of default on him. On 11 June 1993, a receiver/manager was appointed to the Bartlett group. Mr Bartlett was warned off the premises the following week and has not been able to return since.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Now, more than 3&amp;half; years later, the receiver/manager, the multinational, Arthur Andersen chartered accountants, is still running the three remaining Bartlett properties. It is believed Arthur Andersen has taken in excess of $1 million in fees during this time. Mr Bartlett says he does not know exactly how much has been paid to the receiver, as all of his legitimate requests for information about the receivership have either been ignored or declined. Mr Bartlett says he has not even been officially advised of the sale price of both the Tower Mill and the Kingaroy motel, nor of how the sale proceeds were applied to actually reduce his outstanding loan commitments.

        <para first-indent="16">
         When Arthur Andersen took over in June 1993, the Bartlett group had a $4.5 million mortgage on the Tower Mill, yet Mr Bartlett maintains the receiver had valued the near&amp;hyphen;

          CBD property in Brisbane at just $3 million. During July and August 1993, Bartlett says a number of potential buyers contacted both the bank and the receiver/manager. He claims, though, they were told the property was not for sale.

         Mr Bartlett told me he became aware of plans in August 1993 by a company to buy and strata title the property. When no formal offer had been made by early October on the Tower Mill, Mr Bartlett himself proposed to Challenge Bank the Tower Mill be strata titled and sold at a conservative valuation of $7.5 million. But there was no response from the bank.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Two potential buyers of the Tower Mill emerged—each offering $4.5 million. One of those offers was conditional on the Brisbane City Council approving the strata titling of the 80-room motel. Bartlett says the Brisbane office of valuers Herron Todd White provided Challenge Bank with the strata titled valuation of the Tower Mill at $8.89 million.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Tower Mill, of course, was never publicly advertised for sale. Mr Bartlett believes the value of the Tower Mill rose by about $4.5 million, effectively doubling its value almost overnight as a result of the strata title decision, which was sealed by the Brisbane City Council on 15 February 1994. Settlement of the sale took place on 31 March 1994.

         The Tower Mill motel property was then placed on the market at its full value of $8.89 million and subsequently sold at a considerable profit.

         Gordon Bartlett tells me he was kept totally in the dark for more than three years by Challenge Bank, which was taken over by Westpac in December 1995. He also tells me he has been kept ignorant of the events by the receiver/manager. Numerous attempts have been made by Mr Bartlett's legal advisers to arrange meetings involving all parties but, for most of the last 3&amp;half; years of the receivership, these have been either ignored or rebuffed.

          It was only when Mr Bartlett's situation was drawn to the attention of others a meeting was, in fact, arranged in February of last year with Westpac/Challenge Bank representatives. Mr Bartlett presented a statement of intent to the bank outlining proposals for a suitable exit from the receivership arrangements for both Westpac/Challenge and the Bartlett group. He wanted the chance to prove he could trade his way out, repay debts and maintain what he and his family had worked for, but the bank rejected the proposal as not acceptable. Bartlett wrote back seeking updated figures on the receivership to enable him to seek alternative finance or an investment partner. Bartlett says Challenge replied he had no entitlement to information in relation to his own receivership.

          In August last year, after considerable agitation, Bartlett's solicitor was able to arrange a without prejudice meeting involving all parties in an attempt to end the receivership—the first meeting with all parties since the receivership began in June 1993. At this meeting it was agreed by the bank his valuers would be allowed to access the properties and he be given 28 days to obtain valuations of the group's remaining properties.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Three days later, Mr Bartlett learned the bank itself had arranged for a valuation of the properties to be done and called tenders for the sale of the three remaining properties. After sale proceeds of around $6 million for the Tower Mill and the Kingaroy motel, Bartlett, now 3.5 years in receivership, seems to owe more than the original debt—a situation which bewilders me and which of course bewilders Mr Bartlett. He believes the remaining three properties, based on the 1992-93 results, should be generating some substantial profits. However, he maintains they would not be receiving the profitability they could be outside the control of the receiver/manager.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Further, on a number of occasions during the period 1993 to 1996, Westpac/Challenge has confirmed in writing to both Mr Bartlett and his advisers the properties were trading profitably. Mr Bartlett believes, had the group not been forced into receivership, all five properties would now be trading successfully.

           All of this happened as a result of $26,000 owed to the Australian Taxation Office in unpaid penalties. I raise this matter here today because I think Mr Bartlett's treatment over the past 3&amp;half; years shows the way receivership can be maintained with no end in sight in this country. He has been stripped of assets and income, yet the properties concerned are still returning a profit, otherwise they would have been disposed of years ago to avoid further bank loss.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           It is clear Mr Bartlett is a victim of a system which has encouraged ongoing receivership without a definite sunset to the procedure, thereby enabling accountancy firms, as receivers and managers, to reap enormous profits and banks to continue charging interest at default rates.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Mr Bartlett says he has made all possible endeavours to negotiate and liaise with Westpac/Challenge Bank. He has come to the conclusion the bank has no interest in assisting him to arrange an exit strategy from receivership, nor does the bank appear to be interested in maintaining a viable business independent of the receiver, Arthur Andersen. Both Challenge and the receiver have refused to furnish Mr Bartlett with current financial statements, debtors/creditors lists or any other figures of any other kind to help him in attaining refinance.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Mr Bartlett has been treated appallingly by both the receiver and the bank. They may well have been operating within the letter of the law but, if that is the case, then both the state and federal governments must take a long, hard look at the receivership provisions to ensure both accountability and fairness.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The receiver and the bank denied Gordon Bartlett the opportunity to trade five successful businesses out of debt and to pay off smaller creditors in full. There is no chance of that happening now under the current arrangement. While the bank and the receiver are laughing all the way to the bank, it is small business which suffers again. Instead of choosing the course of letting Mr Bartlett trade his way out, instead of losing on the deal, the receiver could have terminated that fire sale contract years ago at $4.5 million when the Tower Mill was valued at almost

           If that fire sale had been held off, the Bartlett Group could have traded out within its own rights following the sale of the Tower Mill with all debts paid. This certainly serves as an example of the way the deregulated banking environment has been abused by banks in this country. It certainly serves as an example of the way in which small and medium businesses are copping it pretty hard in the current environment, especially when these sorts of laws exist.

         The attempts by Minister Birrell and state Liberal MPs to paint the community rally as a political point scoring exercise really just trivialises this important issue to Geelong and is demeaning to those who organised it and those who participated in it. The key point to understand is that local political representatives were invited to listen to community concerns and argument. They were not invited to speak. There was no platform given to any politician to take advantage of the rally on the day and to use the platform for party political purposes. I note with more than a passing degree of interest that the Victorian Premier and his industry minister are now opposing further tariff cuts to these very significant industries in the Geelong community.

The sad fact of the matter is that in 1993 they opposed the Labor

The Howard government ought to take immediate action in the budget to stimulate demand, as Labor governments have done, by offering sales tax cuts for cars. They ought to take action at the national level to reduce the age of the Australian car park and they ought to restore the research and development incentives to prevent the research and development effort of these industries going offshore and immediately restore labour market programs and export incentives.

         While the South Pacific has a secure place in our hearts, the region is not always to the forefront of our minds. We cannot take the region for granted. We live in a time and within a region of rapidly changing strategic imperatives, economic circumstances, environmental pressures and cultural concerns. These conditions combine to require us and those who share our interests to more frequently review our policy and approach towards the South Pacific.

This cooperative and collaborative review would refocus attention on the fortunes of the South Pacific nations and lead to a reinvigorated and renewed Pacific partnership.

          The South Pacific enjoys the support of so-called metropolitan powers such as Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, France and the United States.

          The OECD's 1997 report on the geographical distribution of financial flows shows that these nations continued to be the major providers of financial assistance within the South Pacific area between 1991 and 1995. The recent years have seen a continuation of Australia's commitment to the region, increasing assistance from New Zealand and France, major fluctuations in Japan's large annual development assistance programs and significant reductions in development aid from the United Kingdom and in the still respectable United States program. The OECD report highlights intra&amp;hyphen;region fluctuations and the concentration of some aid programs on particular island nations.

          These changes in the aid profile reflect the changing nature of relationships within the region. We are at the end of the Cold War. There is a revision of the attitude and approach of the ANZUS partners. There is an increasing focus on civil concerns involving the containment of criminal activity, money laundering and trafficking narcotics. The change in the nature of interests in the area are also evidenced by the changing aid profile within the South Pacific. I would suggest that the South Pacific remains important to all the metropolitan powers and that future relationships within the region need to have a complexion well beyond the continuing security significance.

          After participating in the South Pacific Forum last October, the Prime Minister reported on a generally held view that `relatively high levels of aid had not brought about the desired increases in economic growth and living and social standards'. Aid alone is not the formula for improving the future prospects of South Pacific nations. Nor can it be the sole focus of Australia's contribution and assistance to the region.

           Australia and the other metropolitan powers can play an increasingly relevant role in the area of trade.

There is also a need to pursue policies which facilitate the development of the private sector and reduce public sector costs, as was reported in the Prime Minister's statement. Australia and the other metropolitan powers are well placed to share with our South Pacific neighbours the learning and insights from our own experiences in seeking to stimulate economic activity and implement public sector reform.

Our regional forest agreement process, the native resource access and pricing mechanisms applied in the United States and the New Zealand plantations experience can all provide examples of best practice that the region could draw from.

I am reliably advised that when testing was going on at Mururoa Atoll the tourism industry in Japan turned away from our region—a region that it values and seeks to visit because of the pristine environment that it offers. Any compromising of that perception of a pristine environment has quite a profound economic effect within the region.

The routing of international telecommunications traffic through these islands with admirable systems capacity is generating much needed revenue. Our own experience in developing a regulatory and competition framework to manage this sort of telecommunications business might be something of interest to these nations seeking to avoid exploitation.

           In closing, I feel there is a lot we can do to assist the nations of the South Pacific.

          —I rise in this grievance debate to express outrage at the regrettable failure of the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) to give a direction to Telstra, pursuant to section 9 of the Telstra Corporation Act, to immediately cease constructing a cellular mobile radio base tower on the corner of Alice Street and Rocky Point Road at Sans Souci in my electorate. That site is significant because it is immediately adjacent to the St George Christian School. My brief research into this topic indicates that radiation from these towers peaks not five or 10 metres from the tower but, because it travels down to hit the ground, at about 100 to 150 metres from the tower, which places it right in the middle of the school playground.
         </para>

        <para first-indent="16">
         I read a paper by Dr Bruce Hocking, a former medical officer with Telstra, published in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Medical Journal of Australia
         </emphasis>
         towards the end of last year. Dr Hocking investigated in particular radiation from television towers and detected a considerably higher incidence of cancer, leukaemia and indeed mortality among children living in the vicinity of these television towers. Dr Hocking extrapolated his research and concluded that there is at least a risk that similar consequences could flow from the location of these telephone towers. In light of that recent research, which has been confirmed and supported by a recent report obtained by the Woollahra Municipal Council, Telstra is reckless in the extreme to
         <break page="1103" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          even contemplate building such a tower in the vicinity of infants and primary school children.

        <para first-indent="16">
         There is no question that Telstra, if they were here, would stand up and say, `But we are complying with, and indeed our readings are less than, Australian standards.' But those Australian standards are clearly outdated. They are based on thermal radiation; that is, radiation which is of such intensity that it actually increases the temperature of body cells. CSIRO research also undertaken last year has indicated that those standards are inadequate and have to be revised because of the evidence pointing towards the link between even low level radiation, such as that emitted from telephone towers, and quite horrible, insidious diseases including cancers, degenerative damage to the retina, the cornea and iris, as well as impaired learning and memory function—quite clearly, issues of vital concern to parents of pupils at the St George Christian School.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The CSIRO report said that not only was this heating element from thermal radiation something to guard against but also there was evidence that electromagnetic radiation alters enzyme synthesis in ways similar to known cancer promoters. In other words, there is unquestionably a risk. Earlier last year a New Zealand medical practitioner examining this issue said—this is worth quoting because it displays unquestioned logic:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         To place this site (that is a telephone tower) immediately adjacent of a school, with young children and pregnant women spending large portions of their week bathed in low level but potentially and probably harmful microwave emissions from the site, at levels which have been associated with childhood Leukaemia death risk rise, and a host of other adverse effects, is foolish, irresponsible and a dereliction of the duty of care to protect children from avoidable risk of serious potential harm.
        </para>
        <para style="Para">
         That is unquestioned logic. Telstra and the minister are clearly on notice of these risks. Despite that, they are continuing with their proposals to build this tower in particular. That New Zealand doctor referred to former reports submitted to the New York City Council. The New York City Council indicated that protective measures had to be taken to
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          protect children from exposure to this radiation. Indeed, as early as 1992 the European Parliament expressed similar  concern. So we have here unquestioned knowledge of risk. We have here evidence pointing to insidious, horrible and, indeed, fatal disease.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When you have the means to avoid the risk and you fail to address that risk and you refrain from action, with the possibility of death arising, you are looking at the ingredients of a manslaughter charge. If I were a parent and my child succumbed to a fatal disease as a result of exposure to this radiation, at any coronial inquest I would have absolutely no hesitation in pressing the coroner for manslaughter charges. The question is: how far up the chain does that responsibility go? Most certainly it would go to the officers of Telstra immediately responsible for the decision making, but in light of section 9 of the Telstra Corporation Act, under which the minister has the power to intervene—because it is Telstra—one wonders whether the minister himself would have to face the music.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I recall seeing a western movie where, after a series of atrocities, one fellow alleged that he simply went along with the bunch. But the court rightly concluded in that case that he had the means at his disposal to intervene and try to prevent the carnage but neglected to do so. Hence, he swung with the other criminals. Quite frankly, the minister is in a position not much different. He has the power at his disposal, he has the knowledge of the risk, and he is sitting on his hands. He has his head well and truly in the sand and that, quite frankly, is unacceptable. He is a minister of the crown. A minister of the crown has tremendous responsibility, but none more so than his responsibility to children.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I have made representations directly to the minister but, unfortunately, I have yet to receive his reply. If there was ever a case of a minister getting directly involved in a project, this was one—more so because there are alternatives. The school itself has made inquiries; they were not made by Telstra. They were made by the school, which has ascertained that there is already a Vodafone telephone tower in an industrial area very
         <break page="1104" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         So we have a risk of injury known to Telstra and the minister, we have a failure to address that risk and we have alternatives whereby the risk could be avoided. As I have said, the failure of the minister to act and the failure of Telstra to heed the warnings amounts to reckless indifference to the safety and health of these children of such extreme irresponsibility that someone could well face manslaughter charges over this. It is about time the minister acted. He should act immediately to give the direction to Telstra to cease this stupid and irresponsible plan to build a telephone tower right beside a school.

For instance, he does not reassure consumers that all of the cost benefits that are supposedly going to flow from the application of national competition policy to the sugar industry via the soft drink makers and other industrial users of sugar will in fact benefit consumers.

I notice that Mr Gentile does not give the consumers of Australia a guarantee that they will benefit from these changes.

          I refer to Australian Bureau of Statistics figures on the average price of chocolate across six states from 1989 to the present day. During this time, there were many changes to the regulatory arrangements within the sugar industry. The embargo was lifted in 1989. In 1991 the tariff was reduced to $76 per tonne and in 1992 the tariff was reduced to $55 per tonne—all actions of the previous Labor government. All of these reductions in tariff were initiatives of the previous Labor government and during that time one would have expected benefits for consumers. In fact, over that time the price of chocolate increased by 52 per cent. There was not one year in which the price of chocolate declined.

          I put this question to Mr Gentile during the verbal submissions to the industry review and his response was that there were other factors at work. Other factors indeed!

          In 1992, when the tariff was reduced again, the prices were similar. The price went up by 7.5 per cent in March, by 4.6 per cent in June, by 5.4 per cent in September and by 4.8 per cent in December. Over the entire period from the March quarter of 1989 to the December quarter of 1996, the prices of soft drinks and cordials rose 34.7 per cent while the increase in the consumer price index was 29.5 per cent. If there are benefits to be gained from deregulation of the sugar industry, they are not going to go to consumers. One can only assume that somebody has benefited from those tens of millions of dollars, and the natural reaction is to assume that the commercial users of sugar have pocketed that benefit. If they have done it in the past, there is every reason to believe that they will do it again.

          is the state of the sugar industry. It is the most consistent producer of exports. Consumers in Australia enjoy the lowest priced sugar in the OECD. When you put some sugar in your cup of tea in the morning, it is of the best quality and the lowest price in the OECD. But Mr Gentile did not tell us about the comparison between our tariff and those operating in other countries. In Australia the $55 per tonne equates to a 13 per cent equivalent tariff. The equivalent tariff operating in Thailand is 104 per cent, in the United States it is 100 per cent and in the European Union it is 170 per cent. That is quite a substantial difference from the situation in Australia. As a result of the review, it is quite plain that many of the industry organisations are in support of the removal of the tariff. However, a new question has arisen. What will happen in the car industry and the textile, clothing and footwear industry?

Yet the sugar industry had a zero tariff in 1996. We were told in the recent Industry Commission report that in 1996-97 car tariffs were to be 22.5 per cent, dropping to 15 per cent in the year 2000.

          There must be equity between our industries, particularly those industries in northern Queensland that predominantly export. Ninety-five per cent of Australia's sugar is exported. It is totally inequitable to see other industries given a special case consideration when, plainly, the sugar industry is to be singled out to have its tariff reduced to zero. I believe that there should be accommodation for the sugar industry and that there should be a compensatory mechanism to ensure an equitable outcome for the sugar industry in comparison with our other industries. That is certainly something that I intend to take up.

          —Deng Xiaoping was second only to Mao Zedong in importance as a Chinese ruler in the 20th century. However, the verdict of history is likely to be far more favourable to Deng than Mao. After Mao's forces won the revolution in 1949 there was a comparatively progressive period which lasted until the `Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom' experiment of 1956-57. This was followed by the institutionalised madness of `The Great Leap Forward' and `The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution'. Deaths, through avoidable famine and systematic persecution, amounted to more than 35 million. When Mao died in 1976, after 26 years of rule, the negatives
          <break page="1106" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         Born 11 years after Mao, six years after Zhou Enlai, Deng worked in French factories for four years, joined the Communist Party in 1925 and studied in Moscow. He was one of the last survivors of `The Long March' of 1934-36 and certainly the last to hold real power. He had suffered humiliation and persecution within the Communist Party three times and his return and rehabilitation were unique in the history of the Chinese party. Deng was, in effect, `paramount leader' for 20 years, from 1977, although he held no official position after 1989. Due to his great age and enfeeblement, he had an essentially symbolic role for most of the last decade. Nevertheless, the policy direction and, with some exceptions, the leadership teams, were his.

         , and suggested that she should meet me. I was flattered, of course. It may not have been literally true but it demonstrated that in Deng's apparat there was concern about the long view, the role of technology, the future of work and an openness to new ideas wherever they came from.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Deng and his followers opened China up. They essentially dismantled the Maoist economic model, the centralised command economy, while retaining monopoly of political power in the hands of the party. He succeeded where Mikhail Gorbachev in the former Soviet Union had failed. The most striking contrast was in agriculture. Russia, with a far smaller population than  China and far richer soils, had a chaotic transition from a command to a market economy. The agricultural sector largely collapsed and food had to be imported. China, with a population of 1.2 billion and inferior soils, except along the great rivers, is now close to self-sufficiency in food. The transition from communal to private ownership was relatively painless. It was far better managed.

          Deng's record will probably be judged as an inversion of Mao's, perhaps four to one on the favourable side. The quality of life, prosperity and exposure to diverse values is undoubtedly higher now than at any time in Chinese history. But he was no civil libertarian. The death penalty was harshly imposed, dissent was suppressed, although not on Mao's scale, and he bears primary responsibility for the Tiananmen massacre in 1989. The last was no accident. He was teaching the harsh lesson that major change in some areas—economic and cultural—did not necessarily apply to all areas, including the political. Tibetans and other minorities are harshly treated and subject to Han cultural domination.

          Democracy remains a factor in the People's Republic of China, even if suppressed; and so does the PLA, the People's Liberation Army, even if, for the time being, it is standing back. However, the hardline Maoist position seems unlikely to regain power. Capitalism is alive and well in the People's Republic of China and shows no notable sensitivity about human rights. But Deng leaves his nation in far better shape than it was in 1977. However, the prospects for world peace with China as a major player will depend essentially on how far his plans survive him.

          —I also want to add a few words in this condolence motion for Deng Xiaoping. Obviously, Deng Xiaoping, as the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) has said, will go down in history as one of the great Chinese leaders of all time—certainly in this century. The approach that he took will also be very significant for the future of China. I agree with the member for Lalor that, for all of Mao Zedong's idealism at the beginning and for all of the ideals of the Long March and of his socialist experiment in China, in the end we had some terrible results, especially during the period of the Cultural Revolution, that ended in the enormous suffering of millions of people.

         I think it is true to say that at the beginning, when Deng Xiaoping took control of the People's Republic of China, there was a view that these things would change. Indeed, there
         <break page="1107" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          were significant changes at one level. But I think it is important to contrast, as the member for Lalor has done, the difference between the Russian approach and the Chinese approach. From the beginning, Deng Xiaoping took the view that economic reform was going to be a necessary feature and a precondition of any political reform. In that sense, he was very different from Gorbachev.

        <para first-indent="16">
         What happened in Russia was that, essentially, political freedoms came, then democratic reforms came and then, simultaneous with that, came some changes to the economy. But the Chinese, under Deng Xiaoping, had the view that this was a mistaken approach. This was made clear in his statements about what Gorbachev was doing. What became clear was that in the transition from the command economies—whether it was the Soviet economy or the Chinese economy—there was a very big difference of view. This difference of view, I think, will be seen in future years as having been of tremendous historical importance.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What happened was that the Chinese economy opened up. But it was done under the control of the party. It was an interesting experiment because he was able to open up the economy to more and more market forces—to more and more capitalist control, if you like—and he was able to allow more and more Chinese people to participate in that process, to become rich, and he was able to increase the standards of living of the majority.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But, in this process of increasingly participating in the market, there was no attempt at all to give any leeway to political democracy. On the contrary, what happened was that there was a situation in which he felt that the only way in which he could manage the transition from the central economy to the market economy was by very tough political control. A lot of us disagreed with that. I was one of those who disagreed with that. In the Soviet system there was a dramatic change in the political area with a very fast democratisation, there was total confusion in the economic transition and there was a lot more economic pain than there was in China.

          I was in China in 1986, and that was the first time I had been there. At that time there was a very exciting debate going on within the Deng Xiaoping government about what to do about the next stage of political liberalisation. In fact, there was a great deal of optimism that after the economic reforms would come, as a matter of course, the democratic reforms and the political liberalisation.

I was shocked, very disappointed and upset by that, as were all my colleagues and the majority of members in this parliament. We believed that

On the other hand, we had the crushing of the democracy movement. The member for Lalor said that he believes Deng Xiaoping was centrally responsible for that, and I think you have to say that is true. However, we will never know whether it was intended that there be a further phase of greater democratic liberalisation or not, because Deng Xiaoping has been so ill for so many years that others have been in control of the agenda.

I have heard that President Jiang Zemin hopes to increase the pace of reform. I hope that will include political reform. I hope it will not be just an attempt to continue with the market economic reforms without political reform, without greater human rights and without the ability of political parties to be formed in China to participate in the genuine democratic process.

          I think Australia has an enormous interest in all these events, but there is no doubt that the role of Deng Xiaoping has been significant—both positively and negatively. He will be remembered for his enormous contribution to the modernisation of China; a modernisation with which we all agree. Let us hope that his successors will now take on the very big challenge—which, as I say, I believe was part of the original intention—to move the nation towards much greater democracy and much greater respect for human rights.

         Deng's motivation was not to develop a healthy democratic and capitalist state in China. His policy was one of survival for the communist regime. The Chinese leaders have a deep sense of history. At the turn of the century, China was a weak, divided absolute monarchy which was being dictated to by the Western powers which forced markets open with gunboat diplomacy. The Soviet Union's inability to modernise its economy and compete with the West ultimately led to its collapse, and the member for Calwell mentioned that. These lessons were not lost on Deng.

         With every opening of a market, there can be no doubt that measures were taken by the party to maintain its grip on Chinese society. Opening up markets had two main objectives. Firstly, it modernised China's economy, strengthening its gradual move to a position as an economic and, in consequence, political giant. Secondly, it linked China's prosperity to the prosperity of key Western nations, limiting the level of opposition to the method used to maintain the regime's grip on power. I find it amazing that China has managed to retain the coveted holy grail of most favoured nation status with the United States in recent years.

         Human rights abuse—and I know that the member for Calwell on many occasions in this place has been a strong advocate for human rights—remains endemic in China. It is enshrined in the legislative system and political philosophy of the Chinese Communist Party. This has increased in sophistication and reach under Deng Xiaoping. According to the American based Asia Watch and to Amnesty—and I note that there are two members of Amnesty presently sitting at the table—China still maintains a system of slave labour camps, religious persecution, murder, disappearances and summary executions.

         Let us turn to Tibet. Religious persecution in Tibet has been a stereotype of how to destroy a culture and subjugate absolutely an entire ethnic minority. Over the years priests have been tortured and murdered, nuns raped and leaders kidnapped or exiled. Religious centres have been the sites of desecration and unprovoked massacres. The final solution for Tibet is a massive transplanting of Han Chinese into Tibet, with a view to swamping the ethnic Tibetan society and ending debate over ownership of the nation once and for all. Interestingly enough—and the member for Calwell might be interested in this—no trade liberalisation initiatives for Tibet seem to have been part of Deng's master plan.

         Then there is the Tiananmen Square massacre. In June 1989 Deng Xiaoping exercised personal authority to brutally suppress calls for a share of political freedom to complement the growth in what was seen as economic freedom. The results were a stark and dramatic statement that the power of the party was absolute, that any economic loosening of the reins would not flow on in political freedoms and that human rights in China under Deng were as expendable as the lives of thousands of people who were killed or persecuted. I would hope that we here do not forget Deng's personal hand in the Tiananmen Square massacre.

How could the leader of a Communist insurgent band have achieved so much destruction in such little time? Pol Pot drew his support exclusively from China in his long struggle to power. The leadership there promoted his cause, helped train and educate his followers and supplied him with the means to maintain his struggle and then his regime against all international opposition. Deng Xiaoping's contribution in the massacre of over a million Cambodians through his unswerving support of Pol Pot should neither be forgotten nor forgiven by the international community just because he has passed on.

          I turn to the Taiwan missile crisis. China's approach in the region whilst Deng was leader was not always tinged with subtlety. Its recent test firing of missiles and naval manoeuvres were designed to intimidate Taiwan during its national elections. This was a barefaced attempt to bludgeon the people in Taiwan into accepting China's role as ruler-in-waiting. Naval intervention by the United States may have been the only reason for restraint by Deng's regime. This is not the action of a regime headed by a man to be commended as a consummate negotiator who has led his nation towards openness.

          Deng Xiaoping was responsible, directly and indirectly, for the perpetuation of a system of intolerable repression that has affected and, in many cases, killed many millions of people. His passing should not be seen as a sad moment in China's history. He was no Gorbachev who has seen that there is a better way for the people of his nation. We can only be thankful that this chapter in China's history is now partly over and hope that life in the future is better for the Chinese people than it has been under Deng Xiaoping.

           —Inevitably on an occasion when this parliament looks to review the life of somebody of the nature of Deng, we will discover both the good and the evil that resides in great social change and upheaval. Deng's life actually, I think, can be seen not as that of a person who simply comes forward at a time of some tranquillity and makes choices, but rather as that of a person who found himself at a very young age engaged in the overthrow of a social order which had been deeply and long established. He was committed to an ideology which was designed really out of utopianism—a belief that, through collective action and the operation of a group of people coming together, they could actually transform a feudal society into a communist state which would transcend poverty and share the benefits of the land with all those who lived in it.

          But these were not pacifists, as the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) has said. These were violent revolutionaries who, firstly, contested the forces of Chiang Kai&amp;hyphen;shek and, secondly, the Japanese. They consolidated their first tenuous power in small regions of China. Then they were defeated and sent on the Long March, in which Deng was a participant. They were brought down by attrition to a few thousand. They later controlled a small area in the north&amp;hyphen;west of China and later  expanded from that base to be the leaders of the most populous nation on earth. In that process, Deng was as ruthless and as violent as any of those who took part. But this was not a time in which pacifism was much rewarded. It was a time in which the Japanese

It was a time in which the nationalist government executed and purged society of anyone holding views other than its own, and killed many thousands. The Shanghai massacres of communists occurred under the nationalist government.

          These were violent and utopian times when people were forced into positions which many of us look back on and say were quite extreme and extraordinary. Of course, these events were not occurring in China alone. The great revolution was occurring in the Soviet Union, and the European theatre was engulfed and transformed by the rise of Nazism and the bloody horrors that occurred as a result of the rise of Fascism in Europe and in Japan.

          To get some appreciation of the man and the times, I think you have to start from a point a little earlier than saying, `Deng opened up China to market forces.' Deng played a significant role in what was believed by those who were revolutionaries to be a remarkable transforming event. He himself was a victim of it. He was purged as part of the Cultural Revolution. There were many people—not least in our own society in Australia—who felt optimistic and enthusiastic about the prospects of Chinese renewal with the Cultural Revolution. But we know now that it was again a period of great hunger and despair, murder and unrest in China. Deng, of course, was a victim of that. His own personal survival was at stake when he and Liu Shaoqi were branded as numbers one and two persons taking the capitalist road. He survived that period with self&amp;hyphen;criticism. He described himself as an `unreformed, petty bourgeois intellectual accustomed to lording it over others and becoming something special.' He said, `What I need to do is reflect on my past actions. I have gone astray on the road of politics. With the radiance of Mao Zedong's thought lighting my forward path, I should have the fortitude to pick myself up and go on.' There was a man who was actually confronted by the forces of totalitarianism. He had to bend to those forces, and yet he was able, when he himself came back into favour, to find some flexibility in his own mind.

           This is an interesting social circumstance. Whatever we say of him, he has left China a united country, one where hunger has been largely removed. But at the same time many of us would say it is a society which lacks the sorts of cultural norms that we, as members of Amnesty International and people committed to democratic processes, expect and desire; its cultural norms are still far from what we would wish to emulate. I understand other speakers wish to make some comments before the dinner break. I will try to give them an opportunity.

          —I will continue the  remarks I was making about 11 days ago. I was talking about the dissenting report by Professor Ergas, a telecommunications economist. One wonders why the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) has taken to heart the concerns of one telecommunications economist over the nine people with a more, I think, genuine understanding of the industry and the needs of the Australian consumer. As an interested bystander, I looked for a possible reason.

         I happened to come across an article entitled `Telecommunications law: Australian perspectives' published by Media Arm Pty Ltd in 1990. In this document one Richard Alston has an article published entitled `Time for some real competition: is Telecom's universal service obligation still relevant?' I believe that this very large article was part of the minister's thesis when he was at university and, believe it or not, the lecturer at the time was one Henry Ergas. The gentleman even features twice in the minister's thesis.

          Whilst this might once have been a laudable and indeed necessary objective when the household penetration rate was 53 per cent in 1970, now that 94 per cent of Australian households have telephones its continued justification must be questioned; especially when households account for over 70 per cent of main lines although providing only 45 per cent of revenue.

          A basic `lifeline' or no frills type of service should guarantee the end user the ability to access emergency numbers and to receive incoming calls.

          To many of those who use the term, `universal service' simply means `the more, the better'. But with household penetration rates around 94 per cent there is good reason to conclude that universal service has now been achieved. Whilst there may be some households which are not connected to the service for economic reasons it does not follow that financial assistance is necessarily appropriate. Some individuals may be nearly as accessible through a close neighbour's phone, a pay phone down the hall, a phone at work or even the postal service.

          As I stated earlier in my speech, I am deeply concerned that this government through this legislation is failing to take into account the rapid convergence of technologies which is currently taking place and the increasing demand for services such as rapid fax transmissions, e-mail, the Internet, electronic commerce, telemedicine and educational applications.

          This error, if allowed to go uncorrected, has potentially disastrous consequences for regional Australia in particular because the provision of advanced telecommunications services to much of rural and remote Australia and Tasmania is uneconomic. Unless such services are specified as part of the universal service obligation, no carrier will provide them in the foreseeable future.

          —I am very pleased to speak in this debate in support of the telecommunications bills, which will govern telecommunications after 1 July 1997. The government's legislative package contains real benefits for people in rural and remote Australia. The government recognises the key role telecommunications plays in rural and remote Australia, and the legislation is supportive of this role.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To ensure that rural and remote areas and the rest of the nation can derive the maximum possible benefit from telecommunications, it is vital that regulatory arrangements foster the development of a robust, competitive and efficient industry and ensure that industry meets the expectations of the Australian community. Already there have been some benefits from the introduction of limited competition in 1991, although, particularly from the perspective of rural communities, they may not have been as great or as widely shared as some may have hoped.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The task for the future is to build on the gains that have been made and to ensure that even greater benefits occur in the future. The electorate that I represent is well placed to benefit from the expansion of the telecommunications area, and this has already occurred in a number of different ways.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Since the movement to the adoption of a more open market for telecommunications, there have been a number of private providers offering a whole range of telecommunications services—private firms have taken the initiative and set up businesses; some of them may

          well have been Telstra employees in the past—such as telephones, faxes, et cetera, and providing an excellent service. All of those firms are growing and employing quite a number of people in this very expanding field. With the introduction of further competition from 1 July 1997, with the advent of further involvement from Optus and Vodafone, there is likely to be an even greater expansion of telecommunications services throughout rural and remote areas of Australia.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There has also been quite a strong development of Internet providers through the Bendigo electorate. They are doing an excellent job in providing access to that service for many telephone subscribers, and many people are becoming involved in the Internet and the World Wide Web. Also, the infrastructure that is currently in place with Telstra in the Bendigo region lends the opportunity to provide more telecentres for a whole range of public and private sector operations. Already the prominent Bendigo Bank, which operates a telecentre, which is very vigorous in that area, is providing an excellent service to its new and intending customers.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government's three&amp;hyphen;pronged strategy of partially privatising Telstra, introducing open competition and enhancing consumer safeguards will mean that greater benefits will occur in the future. Open competition is likely to serve rural and remote areas better than the limited competition we have had to date.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Under the open regime, specialised or regional service providers will be able to enter small markets and target the needs of rural and remote users. This is already happening in one area of my electorate—a place called Heathcote. Because of the threat of future competition, Telstra have now agreed to install a mobile phone tower in that area and to improve the mobile phone communications. Up until recently, they were resisting that installation, but it just shows what a little bit of competition can do. They are now going to provide an improved service to that Heathcote area.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are some things under the open regime that will help rural and remote users. For example, licensing requirements and costs are minimal. There are few restrictions on
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          technology. At the same time, while protecting the community's interests, community service obligations are not onerous and are consistent with those applying to telecommunications companies in other advanced economies. Such operations will be facilitated by the proposed access regime, which will provide interconnection and access on fair and reasonable terms. There will be no barriers to satellite operators, including the proposed low earth orbiting satellite operators, offering service in rural and remote areas.

         The government's regional telecommunications infrastructure fund, which was recently announced, will be used to encourage the use of telecommunications services and the development of communications facilities in regional areas. I want to highlight some of the things that need to be done in an area such as Bendigo, and I am sure that other areas in Victoria, such as Ballarat, would be similar. There is still a need for the upgrading of some of the small rural exchanges, there is a need for further optic cable to be put in the ground, and there is a need for consumers in the area to have access to all of the latest services that are available to them.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         At the moment, a lot of the small rural exchanges are unable to provide even an itemised billing account. If you wish to operate a business in a small rural community, you have all of the other facilities at your disposal but, if you do not have the telecommunications network and you do not have an itemised billing account, it is very difficult to run a business under those circumstances.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I welcome the government's commitment to the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund. I understand that fund will bring substantial benefits to rural areas, and I look forward to addressing some of the disadvantages that rural and regional telecommunications users face compared with their metropolitan counterparts in terms of access to, and cost of, the advanced communications that are available worldwide. We would hope that all of those best international practices would be available throughout Australia in a very short time.

         Telstra and the government obviously have an ongoing interest in the development of improved telecommunication services. Since the new government has come into office, Telstra has been cooperative in looking at some of the services in rural and remote areas of Australia.

         Optus is also spending tens of millions of dollars upgrading its satellite system to digital technology, improving access to pay television and high speed data services for non&amp;hyphen;metropolitan Australians. The difficult part in telecommunications is to anticipate how a lot of the services will be provided in the future. For many providers, this must be a real unknown quantity because it is difficult to know whether they will be receiving their telephone communication services via a cable, via a satellite, via the existing structure or by some new technology which is currently being developed.

The government is fully committed to the concept of universal service in telecommunications under which the standard telephone service and payphone and, after 1997, other prescribed services are reasonably accessible to all people in Australia wherever they reside or carry on business.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The universal service arrangements will ensure that all people, regardless of whether they live in urban, rural or remote areas, have access at a minimum cost to a standard package of telecommunications services. The price at which such services are supplied can be regulated by price control under the Telstra Corporation Act or under the Telecommunications Bill 1996.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government illustrated this commitment in the reaffirmation of the universal service obligation in the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Act and in the enhancements it has made to the universal service arrangements under the Telecommunications Bill 1996.

         The universal service regime ensures that services that might otherwise be loss making and uncommercial are provided by ensuring the universal service provider is compensated for any such losses by the industry as a whole.

          —The Telecommunications Bill 1996 and cognate bills are a fulfilment of the coalition's telecommunications commitments made at the last election. They represent a genuine effort to undo the mess left behind by the previous Labor government, and indicate the clear visions of this government for the telecommunications industry into the next century. I will specifically address the overhead cable debacle, which is of great concern to my constituents in Adelaide, but, first, I would like to talk about the many positive aspects of this bill.

         First and foremost, this bill will produce a higher level of telecommunications services to consumers through greater competition and tougher industry codes. The bill also reinforces the protection and confidentiality of information, boosts the powers of the industry watchdogs, such as the Australian Telecommunications Authority, Austel, and the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. These reforms signal a legitimate attempt on behalf of the government to tackle the difficult task of keeping up with the fast pace set by advances in technology and consumer demand in the telecommunications sector.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Apart from boosting traditional phone services and modernising mobile phone services, this bill will also improve consumer access to new information technologies and financial services. The bill also requires that better planning strategies between carriers, such as the sharing of infrastructure, be implemented.

         Members will remember Labor's scare campaign in the lead-up to the last election which saw materials circulating stating that a coalition government would increase the cost of local calls and that some communities would not receive the same standard of service as others. We see today with this legislation, however, that this government is actually improving services to all consumers and creating a competitive environment conducive to lower consumer costs in the future.

          This government's reforms will continue price controls under the Telstra Corporation Act and the ceiling of 25c on local calls will remain. The customer service guarantee is also an entirely new consumer safeguard designed to promote higher levels of service and provide a streamlined means of compensation where these levels are not achieved.

          It is the issue of the telecommunications code as it relates to overhead cables and mobile phone towers which remains the critical concern for the people of Adelaide. I first became involved in this debate within a year of being elected. On 26 July 1994, I contacted the then Minister for Communications and the Arts, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), expressing my deep concern about the way the telecommunications carriers were ignoring the concerns of local communities. When the minister finally responded nine months later, he stated that the existing code was an `appropriate balance' between the `need to facilitate carrier network roll&amp;hyphen;out' and `the protection of Australia's national environment'.

          I personally, and many of my constituents, have since seen how unbalanced that code was. Legislation before the House today will strengthen the code. Labor's inability to do so first created the situation whereby overhead cables would become a feature of the urban landscape to add to the ugliness already created by stobie poles and electricity cables.

          In the following months, I placed two questions on notice to the Labor minister asking what steps the government was taking to strengthen the code, arranged community meetings in Adelaide with the then shadow communications minister, Senator Alston, and made speeches in the parliament. Late in 1995, in this House I said:

But this attitude has not always been reciprocated by Optus and Telstra. In at least one instance, the local council in question was told about the preparation work for the roll&amp;hyphen;out of the cables on the same day that the contractors appeared in the local streets and commenced work. This situation has resulted from the previous Labor government's decision to permit the installation of overhead cables with only minimal requirements for the carriers to consult with local councils and the local community.

          I do not think that it is any secret that these new tougher measures have resulted from considerable backbench pressure being applied to the Minister for Communications and the Arts, including my own ongoing representations to the minister on behalf of the people of Adelaide.

           tied the hands of the current government on existing overhead cable. I might add that, in opposition, the coalition parties attempted to disallow the current code in 1994 because it was not strict enough and because it was obvious it would lead to the type of community concern for the urban environment which has since unfolded. At the time we could not gain the support from the Democrats in the Senate.

          Of specific concern to the people of Adelaide has been the extension, by three months, for carriers to complete their overhead roll&amp;hyphen;out after the 1 July deadline. This transition period is longer than I and many other people in Adelaide would have liked. However, the transition period for all other measures contained in this bill apart from the cable roll&amp;hyphen;out is six months. The government has been given little room to manoeuvre due to the undertakings given, especially to Optus, by the previous Labor government. The legal advice received by the minister is to the effect that if this transition period is not granted the Commonwealth runs the risk of being in breach of undertaking.

          These changes to the national code seek to strike a balance between the need for greater competition and access to consumer services. However, I believe that the environmental and aesthetic concerns of my constituents in Adelaide over overhead cabling remain justified. Apart from the direct visual impact of the cables, trees planted in the streets are under threat from lopping and from damage to the root system if care is not taken when, hopefully, putting cables underground.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Technology and information advances are important, but so too are local environmental considerations. Underground cabling solves only one problem. Due to the poor planning in the past, ugly stobie poles and electrical cables will remain, whatever the outcome. Our long-term goal as a community should be to place all cables out of site and underground. I hope better planning and cooperation in the future will make this possible.

Even if South Australia could say no to overhead cables and do without the technological advances currently enjoyed by eastern seaboard states, we would still have ugly stobie poles. This would be a situation where everybody loses. The horse has already bolted under Labor, but if we can work together as a community towards the undergrounding of all cables and the removal of poles from the urban landscape then everyone benefits.

          I have received information today from the city of Unley of the initial costing and research of locating all services underground. The cost is estimated to be between $2,500 and $3,500 per household. The council's idea would be that costs should be shared four ways between ETSA, Optus, Telstra and the council. Unley council's research, to be presented to council tonight, shows that when faced with the prospect of a $1,500 to $2,000 cost per ratepayer property, two in every three respondents or 66 per cent agreed that the benefits of undergrounding all cabling would justify such an outlay. Twenty&amp;hyphen;four per cent disagreed.

This cognate telecommunications bill will bring an end to the overly centralised and non&amp;hyphen;consultative approach of Labor.

         It was the 1991 legislation, which this 1996 legislation replaces, which has placed Australia at risk of being one of the ugliest urban environments in the world. I say that advisedly. If you have a look at the sight of these cables—the wire that they hang from, the cable itself, the connection to all the houses—it is extraordinarily ugly. It is no wonder the local councils have been up in arms trying to protect their areas from this visual scourge that has hit our cities and local residents.

         I think it is a reflection on this parliament and on politicians generally that we have allowed a situation where residents feel they no longer have any power in this country. This is what they are saying to me. An elderly resident of mine, Lorraine Woodcock, as she defied Optus cables and moved her chair and her umbrella under the roll&amp;hyphen;out, said, `I do not want this in front of my house. My neighbours do not want this in front of their houses. Why do we no longer have a voice in what is so sacred to us, which is our visual landscape, our street scapes?' They feel impotent, and that impotence results directly from the legislation enacted in this House by the now opposition, the then Labor government.

I suspect they were ill advised and never realised exactly what was going to be the outcome of what they did. The result of that roll&amp;hyphen;out has been the visual pollution which this bill today attempts in some areas to correct. Of course it is not possible to fully correct what has happened. Those cables are out there. They are in front of houses in my electorate. They are in front of houses in other electorates and the people do not like it and they feel that they have been betrayed.

          There is another aspect to that: the effect on Australia's reputation as a tourist destination. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker: as a tourist, where would you like to go to? An urban landscape? Perhaps I could direct that question to the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor), who is at the table and who was a member of the Labor government. I ask him how the tourists feel when they come to Victoria? Instead of seeing attractive cities in which the streets are good to travel down, they see this urban blight of wires and cables.

          It is not just the cables. The cables add to that already existing eyesore of the overhead powerlines. I do not know what they are like in the electorate of Corio, but in the electorate of Hindmarsh the powerlines are extraordinarily ugly and are made even uglier by the addition of these cables. In allowing this, the Labor government hit Australia at its heart, which is its tourism industry. It created an urban ugliness which tourists to this country will turn away from.

No doubt, that is partly because of its historical basis and because of its beautiful old buildings. But part of it is also that it is a very beautiful city. One of the reasons it remains a beautiful city is that it has no overhead wiring whatsoever.

I think these are peculiar to South Australia and may not be present in other states. Stobie poles, for those who do not have them in their electorates, are cement poles between which the wires are put and between which the Optus cables will be rolled out. These are extraordinarily ugly constructions. Not only are they ugly; they are very dangerous because if a car hits them it is very difficult to save the occupants from such a hard impact. The previous speaker also mentioned trees. Once you have these cables and wires, the trees cannot grow to their full size. They are stunted, creating another form of visual pollution affecting our neighbourhoods.

It is on top of an ETSA power station. At present, as I speak, residents in the area are picketing that power station to stop the erection of the mobile phone tower which will cater for Optus, Vodafone and Telstra and will be, I believe, 33 metres tall.

More than that, it devalues the property you are in.

          I go back to the Fulham tower and in doing so acknowledge the work that has been done by Gladys Spurling and Kate Barrett in this area. I mentioned that there was a family living in a house 18 metres from this proposed tower that is going up under the legislation the Labor Party provided. This family has small children and is concerned about possible health effects on their children. We do not know whether mobile phone towers do in fact affect children but, as a doctor I know said, `For heaven's sake, we don't know anywhere near 100th of the types of things that affect the developing brains of children and we should err on the side of caution.' I must agree with that.

          It may be that in the final analysis we will find that the electromagnetic radiation from these towers is perfectly safe and harmless. I hope and pray sincerely that that is so. But in

           the meantime the people whose houses are near these towers are suffering because they are worrying about the health of their children. Whether or not it turns out to be a reality, they are concerned, and their concern is increased the more information comes out. I refer particularly to an article on a study done by Dr Hocking called `Cancer and TV Towers'. My constituents acknowledge that TV tower electromagnetic radiation is not the same as mobile phone radiation, but they do see a connection between the two.

          Dr Hocking's article is very clear. I will read from the abstract of the article. Its objective, which was very clear from the study, was as follows:

          So how do Labor members think that makes my family—my family in the sense that they are in my electorate—with two small children feel? Their house is located next to what will be a triple tower that was placed there under the current legislation. Fortunately, the minister, unable to totally change the legislation, has made some alteration within his powers to do so inasmuch as the carriers will now have to consider at least two options put to them by council. I would hope that the carriers consider those options very carefully and in doing so take into account the fears that parents do hold for their children's health. Unfortunately, until 30 June the carriers do have the powers that the Labor government gave them. On 1 July that will change and the mobile phone towers will be subject to state and local laws and by&amp;hyphen;laws.

          In conclusion, I condemn the previous government for what they have done to this country at a number of levels in passing their 1991 telecommunications legislation and not studying it enough to know the ramifications. If there is a liability, it is in that. I believe they do not know what they did when they put that legislation through, and that is simply lack of due care. They did not examine the
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           ramifications, and that is why we have the situation we now have where we have a great urban ugliness that will be condemned by citizens of this country not only this year, not only next year, but for decades and possibly centuries to come. I commend the new bills, the 1996 telecommunications legislation package, to this House.

          —There being no other speakers, it falls to me to make some summing&amp;hyphen;up remarks before proposing that the bills be read a third time. There are 12 bills as part of this telecommunications package. We have been debating it here this evening and also there was a lengthy debate in the last session.

         Firstly, I would like to thank everyone for their contributions. This is a major piece of legislation and a major commitment of the government to bring it forward. In particular, I would thank those many government members who have clearly identified many of the important reforms which will arise from the passage of this legislation. I will not have time this evening, unfortunately, to canvass all the issues that have been raised but I will do my best to cover some of those points.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Some of the contributions by members of the opposition have indeed distorted and misrepresented some of those issues. Rather than focus on the benefits that will flow to Australian business, consumers and local communities from the introduction of the legislation, which effectively creates a more open and competitive telecommunications regime, they have chosen to focus on perceived negatives which on analysis are shown to be baseless. The opposition has proposed a second reading amendment. The former Minister for Communications and the Arts, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), proposed it, and I indicate that we will be opposing those amendments proposed by the opposition. There are a number of reasons behind that decision, but fundamentally, as members would be aware, the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee is reviewing the
         <break page="1123" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          legislation and it will report on 5 March, and we, of course, will review the recommendations and see what other changes may or may not be appropriate.

         Can I pick up some of the remarks from my colleagues, both opposition and government. Firstly, in relation to the transitional arrangements, if there were no transitional period, there would be a period in which the carrier was unable to proceed with either the preliminary discussion or formal approval of telecommunications structures. In practical terms, given long lead times in the construction of telecommunications network facilities, the carriers would probably have only until the end of April to lodge notifications. The transitional arrangements proposed in the bill will allow for some installations to continue provided that stringent conditions are met. I think the previous speaker, Mrs Gallus, made it quite clear what some of those conditions are. The government believes that the proposed transitional provisions meet the best interests of the community by allowing the delivery of services subject to strict tests, and that is outlined in more detail in the legislation.

         There has been some discussion and some debate in the course of this process on the provisions relating to price discrimination and what we are in fact proposing in the legislation. We allow price differentials, and anti&amp;hyphen;competitive pricing will attract the attention of the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission, the ACCC. A requirement that a carrier offer a standard local call price across its entire network has the perverse effect of denying consumers the full benefit of the price reductions they would otherwise receive. In markets where there is competition, the new entrant has only to offer a price slightly below the incumbent, knowing that it will not trigger a competitive response. Remember that this legislation is all about creating a competitive environment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Consumers will be deprived of the full benefits of competition in such circumstances. New entrants, rather than charging customers at the lowest possible rate, will instead obtain a windfall gain because their competitors are hamstrung. This is not competition and it is
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          not good public policy. We are committed, however, to retaining price caps under this legislation. This, of course, will ensure that there is no increase in the cost of local calls in those areas where there is no competition. This carries forward the price capping that is in the existing legislation.

         Item (c) in the proposed second reading amendment refers to ISDN connections. Under the Labor Party's future mode of operation program, it was not going to be completed until about 2002. We have delivered on a dramatic acceleration of that timing. The future mode of operations will be effectively completed by 30 December 1998. By December this year the same percentage of metropolitan and non-metropolitan exchanges—85 per cent—will be digitised. Indeed, this was a point that the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) made. You could never imagine the bush getting equal treatment under the former government. So by July 1997, 93.4 per cent of customers will be able to obtain an ISDN connection within 90 days of request.

        <para first-indent="16">
         At the time that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announced the coalition's policy of providing access to ISDN in the bush, he indicated that there would be a small number of users in remote areas who would not have access to digital services. He committed the government to an investigation of the most appropriate and lowest cost technical options for providing these people with enhanced telephone and digital information services. In this area, too, the government has also met its commitment to the bush.

         The Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) commissioned the review of the standard telephone service, which has reported, and he has also asked the Information Policy Advisory Council to report on rural services. We have made no decision on the standard telephone service report or the minority report it received. We are seeking further information on the costs of the digitisation recommended in the report, consistent with the approach outlined by the Prime Minister last year. We will also closely study the other recommendations of the report. I think it is appropriate to thank those members of the committee for the standard telephone

         In this vein, it is appropriate to consider the importance of the rural telecommunications infrastructure fund, which the minister announced last year. It is a program aimed at enabling rural communities to address their telecommunications concerns and develop solutions appropriate to their circumstances. This is a fund that would never have seen the light of day under the previous government. It is a direct reflection of the government's concern to make sure that rural and remote Australia will get the benefit of upgraded infrastructure to enable it to participate fully in the emerging competitive arrangements that this total package will bring in this industry.

         The issue of directory assistance has probably passed by, but I also wanted to address it as it is an item in the second reading amendment. The Prime Minister did say in the House that Telstra will not be doing anything in this area that is contrary to pre-election commitments. I think that debate has now passed us by.

         I wish to refer to some of the opposition's comments. I will not be able to do justice to them, given the constraint on time. The member for Dobell, the former minister, is here taking this through on behalf of the opposition. He did suggest that the delay in the introduction of the package was due to the government scrapping the opposition's former original draft legislation. I think he would be aware now that the draft, in some degrees, failed to address many key elements of the regulatory framework. Industry was aware of this.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The government has produced a robust package which is widely recognised by the communications industry as an advance on the current legislation and the draft proposals. Indeed, I think the former minister would appreciate that this legislation is complex. Even back in 1991 we were provided with a draft and there were changes from that. This is a process that is going forward. The government took advantage of the draft that
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

         A number of opposition speakers made several comments intended to demonstrate that the government was ignoring the needs of rural telecommunications users. I want to direct their attention to the ISDN proposals that I talked about, the standard telephone service report and the telecommunications  infrastructure fund. I reiterate that this government has met its commitments to the bush and will continue to look at ways of delivering better telecommunications services to rural users.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let me also clear up some confusion enunciated by opposition members regarding the STS report and ISDN. Our response to this report—a report which we are still considering—in no way impacts on our delivery of 93.4 per cent ISDN availability by July 1997 and effective completion of the FMO by December 1998. That is a key matter for the government and we will be pursuing that.

         I was in the House when the Independent member for Moore (Mr Filing) raised some issues. Perhaps I could deal with those quickly. He raised the possibility of conflict in that Telstra is both an Internet service provider and a carrier providing services to itself and other Internet service providers. We all know that there is a huge growth in Internet connections, so this issue is a matter of legitimate interest and concern. The legislation will give Internet service providers the right to arbitration by the ACCC on the terms and conditions of access to declared services provided by Telstra. The Trade Practices Amendment (Telecommunications) Bill, which is a central element of this package, inserts new powers in the Trade Practices Act to deal with anti-competitive conduct by carriers and carriage service providers with substantial market power.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The legislation is quite clear in relation to charging data calls on a timed basis. Residential users currently in local call zones will have guaranteed access to untimed local voice and data calls. Businesses in these areas will have guaranteed access to untimed voice calls.
         <break page="1125" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          While business has not been given the legislated right to untimed data calls, nothing requires carriage service providers to time charge business for these calls and nothing prevents them from charging on an untimed basis if they wish.

         The member for Moore also raised the issue of whether the universal service obligation will be progressively withdrawn under the new legislation. Indeed, several members mentioned this particular issue and expressed concern about the universal service obligation. The government is fully committed to the concept of universal service in telecommunications under which the standard telephone service, pay phones and other important services are reasonably accessible to all people in Australia wherever they reside or carry on business. The new legislation considerably strengthens these arrangements. Suggestions that the USO will be progressively withdrawn is fundamentally wrong. The intention of the legislation and the view of the government is clearly the opposite.

         The Independent member for Calare (Mr Andren) raised the issue of poor response times in rural areas. The proposed legislation provides a mechanism for dealing with these concerns through the customer service guarantee in part 9 of the Telecommunications Bill. The amendments implementing the CSG in the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill, which I brought before the House some time ago, have been carried over in part 9 of the new Telecommunications Bill. I am glad to say that this was a proposal that first saw its form in the office of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman.

         Finally, I want to commend the contribution of all members who have contributed to the debate. It is unfortunate that I do not have the time to canvass more fully some of the issues, but the speeches did reflect that members recognise the importance of the legislation to the growth of the Australian economy and the positive benefits for business, jobs and consumers in rural and regional Australia—indeed, all of Australia.

         Many pointed out that this package not only has significant economic benefits but also addresses the problems of the cables. The

          member for Hindmarsh, Mrs Gallus, who spoke immediately prior to me, talked at some length about these matters. We understand her concern and the concern of her constituents. In our election policy we said that we would take a number of actions to address community concerns while we preserved the community's access to new telecommunications services.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We believe we have delivered on those commitments. This legislation contains a major package of reforms relating to carrier network roll&amp;hyphen;out activities. Under these arrangements broadband cable will not be deployed aerially without the agreement of the relevant authority. There will also be greater control over the erection of mobile phone towers. I do not know if I quite share the alarm that was expressed by the member for Hindmarsh about the impact of mobile phone towers. But, as I understand it, the Minister for Communications and the Arts has this matter under close study. The member for Hindmarsh can be assured that the government will keep the matter under review and will watch the development of scientific papers in that regard.

         In conclusion, I remind members that the legislation will have significant benefits for families and businesses throughout Australia and it will assist in reducing household and business costs, which I think would be welcomed by all. It will promote growth and jobs and will deliver a whole new range of telecommunications services to our nation. The process of reform in this industry by this package I believe reaches the high watermark in this very fast moving industry.

         Local government concerns have been taken account of. Many of the concerns expressed by members on both sides on behalf of local government have been heard. We are moving to do what Labor failed to do when it had the opportunity. We are concerned about the great amenity, the aesthetics, the commitment to localism and also the commitment to good planning. All of these issues are important to local government, to consumers and to all members. We certainly care and will work through these issues to final solutions. We have sought the widest comment on what is

I want to thank them all for their sincere contributions. I therefore have pleasure in commending the bill to the House. I think it puts Australia in a firm position to take advantage of the development of the information age. What this package will do is give us a running start to take advantage of all the opportunities which will emerge, which will be so vital to all of us.

          —The opposition is disappointed that, despite the eloquence of our arguments, we were not able to persuade the majority of the government members to support our second reading amendment. Nevertheless, having listened to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith) sum up for the government, he has provoked me into raising a few issues in the third reading debate. I will go through these as quickly as I can.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The first issue is that the minister on several occasions claimed that, through this package, the government has met its commitments to the bush—and he did repeat this line on several occasions. I can understand why a member who represents Launceston might want to argue that in this House. But this minister also has a responsibility to reflect the truth.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let me make it clear that I challenge the claims which the minister has made at the dispatch box tonight because the Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard, in his speech to the National Farmers Federation—and I think it was in November 1995—promised that people right around Australia would get ISDN by 1 July 1997. That was the promise that got the National Party in the cart to privatise Telstra; and that was the promise that got the National Farmers Federation in the cart to support the partial privatisation of Telstra.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We can understand that there were deep tensions in the then opposition about this issue. We had candidates, such as the then well known Joe Hockey, now the honourable member for North Sydney, who believed that any government ownership was an example of the tentacles of socialism gripping our country—and that is still his view.

         Let me make it clear to the minister that there is no agreement on time limits on this debate, and I will certainly take this opportunity to go through all of the points that he has provoked the opposition on in his summing up in the second reading debate. That is the first thing: the false claim by the minister in his contribution tonight that the government, with this package, has met its commitments to the bush. It does not meet the commitments which your leader, John Howard, gave the Australian people before the election. You cannot walk away from the commitments that Honest John has, allegedly honestly, given the people of Australia.

         The second point I make is the bogus claim by the minister that in some way it is anti-competitive to guarantee that, wherever you live in Australia, you should have access to cheaper local calls. I challenge the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government to tell his constituents in Launceston why they should miss out on the price reductions in local calls that Joe Hockey, the member for North Sydney, will be delivering to the people in his electorate. I would also challenge the minister to visit the electorate of Robertson, the electorate of my friend and colleague Jim Lloyd, who is in the chamber at the moment. How will he explain to the pensioners in Umina?

         We are pushing this right to the limit because it is quite clear what will happen. Optus Vision is not rolling out its cable network in Launceston. It is not even rolling out its cable network in some of the capital cities. It certainly is in the electorate of Mackellar, and it certainly is in the electorate of the Prime Minister. If you go to Hunters Hill you can see the cables being rolled out. They are the people who will benefit from cheaper local calls when Optus Vision's local call system is fully operational.

         Minister, with the package you have had passed through the second reading stage here today, the package that is before the House now for the third reading debate, you will let Telstra do that: you will let Telstra offer the lower prices in the electorate of the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), in Hunters Hill, and in the electorate of the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey), but not in the Hunter Valley, not in Launceston and not on the Central Coast of New South Wales. We think this legislation is a great mistake. We believe that, since Telstra is no longer 100 per cent government owned, the government cannot ensure that those social responsibilities are met. We think that this is a measure that should be included in the Telecommunications Bill 1996. The Labor Party will be moving accordingly in the Senate.

         The other point I wish to make is that the minister in passing said that the debate about directory assistance is an issue that has probably passed us by, then he corrected himself by saying the debate on the issue has passed us by. I hate to break this to you, Minister, but as the minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) in the House of Representatives, you do not seem to be aware of the fact that Telstra is still out there lobbying, still out there briefing people, telling people about their proposal—their `informal' proposal; it is not a formal proposal, of course; it is an informal proposal—to charge people 50c when they ring directory assistance.

         I can say to my colleagues that I have already raised concerns about this issue. If Telstra does get approval from the government to introduce a 50c fee for numbers that are in the telephone white pages, sure, Telstra will offer a $5 discount on your rental. But how long will it be before Telstra claws that back through increases in your quarterly rental? They will claw that back, but you will be paying for directory assistance for all time. That certainly will not be forgiven by Telstra, and it is certainly not something that will disappear. They will claw back any reduction in the quarterly rental, but the charge will be there whenever you ring directory assistance for a number that is in the white pages.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Many do not realise how many people have difficulty in looking up numbers in the white pages. A group of constituents raised this issue with me—residents of North Entrance in my own electorate—last Friday at an afternoon tea. Many of them made the point that elderly people often have difficulty not only reading the numbers, but even being able to see some of the numbers because of the way that Telstra binds its books these days. It is very hard for some elderly people to get the books open wide enough for them to see all the numbers that are printed closest to the binding. Is it fair to charge those pensioners 50c every time they need to obtain a phone number that is in the phone book?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Telstra quite misleadingly claims that it loses $200 million on directory assistance. Telstra never factors into this that when someone rings directory assistance they do not do it because they love to talk to the operators; they do it because they like to make telephone calls—they want to contact someone. Telstra gets revenue after the subscriber has been given a number. That is not factored in when Telstra makes these misleading claims about the cost of providing directory assistance.

         But, most importantly of all, the Liberal Party and the Prime Minister made a promise before the last election—Honest John made an honest promise—that there would be no charging for directory assistance. That is one

          promise we are going to make sure he does not forget. He made the great mistake of repeating that promise in this chamber last year.

         For all those reasons, we are disappointed the government was not prepared to accept our second reading amendment. We believe that this package remains flawed. We will not be pressing amendments in detail in this House—we will keep our powder dry for the Senate—but we want to point out to the government that its sneaky attempts to claim that it has met its commitments to the bush are completely false. It has failed to deliver on its promises on ISDN. John Howard has tried to sneak and slide away from that promise which he made to the National Farmers Federation. The government is trying to break its guarantee not to introduce a charge for directory assistance. The government believes it is important for Telstra's customers in the exclusive North Shore suburbs of Sydney and suburbs like Toorak in Melbourne to get cheaper local calls, while people who live in the rest of Australia should miss out. That is the Liberal philosophy for Australia. It is a philosophy that we will seek to have amended in the Senate when this debate continues in that place.

          —I thank the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) and his staff for allowing slightly unusual treatment of these four cognate health bills. Firstly, I will speak on the first two bills of this four&amp;hyphen;bill package and then I will speak on the other two bills. The debate will take place with members being able to speak on all four bills. The reason I am doing this is to set out quite clearly that the opposition is adopting quite a different strategy in its approach to the various pairs of bills that make up this package of four. Perhaps people will understand my reasons for doing this as I go along.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Turning to the centrepiece of this particular package, these bills are really an attempt by the government to deliver what they would claim is the centrepiece of the coalition's health policy at the last election. It is a policy that the Labor Party believes has already begun to unravel and, before a year is out, we suspect there will be clear evidence that this centrepiece of the health policy of the Liberal and National parties will be in complete ruins.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There were two parts to the policy which the Prime Minister, John Howard, took to the Australian people at the last election. First, he promised to maintain Medicare in its entirety—a promise which the government has been seeking to walk away from as each day passes. Second, he promised to introduce a $1.7 billion package to provide people with incentives to take out private health insurance.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think you have to ask yourself what sort of a government would come up with a health policy that is, in effect, really an emasculated son of Fightback and certainly has the same intentions. Perhaps there was not as much courage to tell the Australian people about what they were setting out to achieve. We certainly have a private health insurance policy that is based on ignorance and prejudice and threatens long-term damage to the Medicare system. This policy must be condemned because it breaks a key election promise: a promise not to cut public funding to pay for private subsidies. It is a policy that should also be condemned because it is extremely inefficient and a waste of scarce health dollars.

          , the opposition's health policy, there was the following promise:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          The incentive will not be funded from the public hospital system or health grants to the States. Other than $50 million which will be reallocated from the Better Practice Program, the incentive will be funded entirely from savings outside the Health and Human Services portfolio.
         </para>
         <para style="Para">
          That was a promise from the Prime Minister and Dr Wooldridge. Last year's budget demonstrated how totally and cynically this promise was broken. Within months of this promise, the coalition had slashed grants to the states by $1.5 billion over three years, which in themselves represented a cut of around $500 million to the states' health funding, which comprises approximately a third of the funding on health expenditure. In addition, as a result of the coalition's budget cuts, there were direct funding cuts to our public hospitals—funding cuts of more than $300 million over four years—as well as other massive cuts to health expenditures totalling more than $3 billion over four years.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          So the promise that was made in
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           A Healthy Future
          </emphasis>
          —not to make cuts in the public hospital system to pay for these new incentives to encourage people to take out private health insurance—was a promise that has been completely and utterly broken.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The standard Liberal&amp;hyphen;National Party response to demonstrations by the Labor Party that the government has broken its promises is a claim that the deficit was larger than they expected when they were in opposition. There are the usual various references to a black hole. Then the government seeks to excuse the fact that it has walked away completely from the undertakings that were made before the election.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I think there has been a lot of focus in my own electorate on the difficulty the government has had in discovering its own black hole a little bit earlier this year. There is no denying that there was a lot of goodwill towards this government at the election. It won by a big margin. A lot of my Labor colleagues were defeated—with big swings against the Labor Party in many seats across the country. There is no doubt whatsoever
          <break page="1133" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           that there was a lot of goodwill towards the government.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Mr Howard, in no small measure, picked up votes from people who had not been prepared to trust the Liberal Party at previous elections because of what they said they would do to Medicare, because of what they said they would do to our universal health care system. So when John Howard, with that triple bypass, re&amp;hyphen;elected as Leader of the Liberal Party, put his hand on his heart and said that he would maintain Medicare in its entirety, I am sure there were a lot of people in my electorate who found that a very important factor that they took into account before making up their own minds as to how they should vote at that last election.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I am sure lots of people who voted Liberal, maybe for the first time in their lives at the last election, were worried about what might happen to health care under a Liberal government, but that commitment from John Howard might have pushed them over the limit and helped convince them to take the Liberal Party on trust, and to take on trust commitments like this, that any incentives to encourage people to take out private health insurance would not be funded by cuts in our public hospital system. That was the sort of commitment that day after day John Howard and Michael Wooldridge, as the spokesman, were making to the Australian people.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          But, within a few months of them being elected, they set out on a deliberate strategy to cut into Medicare, to wind back the rebates and to cut back federal funding for public hospitals. There is no doubt that many people are now starting to worry about whether that commitment by John Howard, the Prime Minister, will be met in this coming budget or the one after.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is common knowledge that, in addition to the billions of dollars of cuts in health funding in the last budget, right up until the last minute there was a proposal to introduce a co&amp;hyphen;payment. I am pleased that the Prime Minister apparently intervened and stopped that going ahead. If there is ever a proposal from Finance to introduce a similar charge, I hope that he also intervenes to stop that going ahead. There is already some newspaper
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           speculation about a $4 cut in rebates for GP visits.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Even if the Prime Minister does not let those sorts of co&amp;hyphen;payments come in, there would be a very clear breach of faith over that promise. Even if he does no more than he did in the last election, the cuts in the state funding for their public hospitals, the extra cuts in direct federal funding for public hospitals, the reductions in Commonwealth funding for our dental health program and the reductions in funding for our pharmaceutical benefits scheme have all been ways in which the government has cut back the public system, the universal system, to fund this massive subsidy for private health insurance. These have been breaches of the promise that was made by the Prime Minister before the last election.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It has certainly undermined some of the basic foundations of our health care system. The Minister for Health and Family Services has tried to justify some of the cutbacks that have been made to fund this initiative that is before the House tonight by saying that there has been some cost shifting in our funding of public hospitals in days gone by. He is right, there has been some cost shifting. There is no doubt about that; it is silly to deny it. In fact, I am prepared to say that I think many public hospitals have cost shifted to the Commonwealth. But there is no denying that the Commonwealth has also cost shifted onto many public hospitals. If you talk to any chief executives of any of our public hospitals around the country, they will tell you that there are many patients who are using state funded hospital beds in our public hospitals who clearly should be in nursing home beds that are funded by the Commonwealth, not by the states. So, every day one of those patients is in a hospital funded by states and not in a nursing home bed funded by the Commonwealth, that is cost shifting from the Commonwealth government onto the public hospital. In rural and regional areas—and you, Mr Deputy Speaker, from your own experience will be aware of this—there is even greater pressure on the public hospital budgets.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          So, yes, there is cost shifting from hospitals to the Commonwealth and, at the same time,
          <break page="1134" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           there is cost shifting in the other direction onto those very tight budgets that the chief executives have for hospitals around the country. Pretty well every public hospital I have ever seen is running on a very tight budget. Hospitals around the country are having to make all sorts of tough decisions just to keep beds open, to keep staff employed and to keep some of the operating theatres going.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In some cases, hospitals have had to cost shift onto the Commonwealth just to try to keep their waiting lists under control, to try to make sure that people who are on those waiting lists are not in pain. Dr Wooldridge comes in and declares cost shifting is taking place instead of giving more money to the public hospitals to fix the problem. Dr Wooldridge must be the only doctor in Australia who thinks he has solved the problem by giving less money to the public hospitals. Dr Wooldridge must be the only doctor in Australia who wants to give less money to our public hospitals, because that is what he did in the last budget.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In the last budget, the government made no attempt whatsoever to increase federal funding for public hospitals—in fact, they did the reverse. They took a total of $800 million from federal funding for public hospitals—an $800 million reduction in funding that goes towards treating patients in our public hospitals, in making sure that people are not out there on waiting lists and waiting for operations to take place.

          In considering this measure tonight of the benefits that flow from a new incentive for private health insurance, we have also got to consider what cuts have been made to pay for this incentive. As I have said before, it is a $1.7 billion incentive over the next three years from 1 July. It is being funded by an $800 million cut in funding for our public hospitals, it is being paid for by a $500 million cut in our pharmaceutical benefits scheme and it is being funded by a $400 million cut in the Commonwealth dental health program. Fancy telling people who are in pain when they chew food that they are no longer entitled to a Commonwealth funded dental health program.

           I am dwelling on these because, to get the $1.7 billion to subsidise private health insurance, they have had to make $1.7 billion of cuts in health—cuts in federal funding for public hospitals, cuts in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and cuts in the Commonwealth dental health program. These are the sorts of changes that we think are not in Australia's national interest. It is certainly totally contrary to the promise which John Howard gave before the last election not to cut from the public system to fund this new incentive for people with private health insurance.

          <para first-indent="16">
           Just look at the cutbacks to public hospitals of $800 million over three years. That is equivalent to closing 1,000 beds or turning away 66,000 people waiting for operations. That is what that sort of sum of money means. In contrast, there are six million Australians who are eligible for health concession cards today in Australia. There are also around six million Australians who currently have private health insurance.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           What this bill before the House tonight does is to take away from that first group, the six million Australians with health care cards, to deliver a benefit to the six million people in the second group, those with private health insurance. Sure, some pensioners are in both groups. Some pensioners scrimp and save to maintain their private health insurance. They are probably neither better off nor worse off as a result of this decision. The people on middle incomes who have private health insurance will probably be significantly better off. As a result of the cuts implemented by this government, there will be a very large number of people on very low incomes who will pay significantly as a result of the cuts that are being made to federal funding for public hospitals, pharmaceutical benefits and the Commonwealth dental health program. So it is not fair by any measure.

           For Liberal Party members to suggest that a single pensioner will magically find $800 to take out private health insurance simply to get the benefit of a $125 incentive is just ridiculous. It is the same sort of logic that has the Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, claiming that pensioners who are being forced to pay an extra 50c for every script will not suffer hardship. It is certainly hardship that has triggered a lot of letters to me in the last few months. Not only is the government's policy horrendously unfair; it is also incredibly inefficient. Recent figures showing the number of Australians maintaining their private health insurance are showing that it is also quite ineffective.

           At the last election, the Labor Party view was that we should give people a choice.

We believe that to offer people a choice was a much fairer mechanism, because two&amp;hyphen;thirds of Australians out there do not have private health insurance and they get nothing from this legislation.

           Even the government's own Industry Commission criticised the efficiency of the incentives when it said, `The net budgetary cost of the incentives is likely to be quite large.' This is the Industry Commission's polite way of saying that the government is wasting more than a billion dollars. On the commission's own figures, the government will spend $560 million a year on the incentives that will only lead to savings of $240 million. That is the benefit we will actually see in the public hospitals.

Why didn't they spend the money directly in assisting people who are out there waiting for surgery? Why have they wasted the difference between the $560 million and the $240 million?

A fistful of dollars is a new thing for John Howard the Prime Minister, but not a new thing for John Howard the man in public life. The Prime Minister, in a previous life when he was the Treasurer of Australia, was actually part of the Liberal Party campaign in the period between 1977 and 1980—a long time ago—a period when John Howard as Treasurer had a strong commitment to indexation of income tax thresholds. That was the last time the Liberal Party was using that fistful of dollars to try to win votes at an election.

           One of the reasons why we believe this proposal that is before the House is a cruel hoax is that it is quite clear that the government's proposals just are not going to work. The government announced with great fanfare the introduction of these incentives with the last budget, but within days we had the health funds queuing up to increase their premiums. In fact there were some suggestions that the minister actually knew before the budget that the health funds would be queuing up for these increases. A press release he issued on budget night was a dash misleading, but that is an issue we have touched on in previous question times.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The point I want to make is that, while the government was claiming that this rebate would deliver reductions in the cost of private health insurance to people, the minister was claiming that he would make sure that the full benefit of this incentive would remain in the pockets of contributors. What in fact has happened? Within days of the budget we had HBA in Victoria announcing increases of six per cent. Then we had Australian Unity increasing their premiums by 8.6 per cent.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Then we had the Prime Minister's direct intervention where he said that any future
           <break page="1137" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            increases would have to have his personal approval and the approval of the Treasurer and the health minister. What did we have as a result? The government was approving massive increases in the size of health insurance premiums. Manchester Unity had a 17&amp;half; per cent increase. HBA in Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory had increases of about nine per cent. Then in November, by coincidence, almost at the very minute President Clinton was speaking in this chamber to the joint sitting, we had a press release come out from MBF and Medibank Private announcing increases of 12.9 per cent and 15 per cent. In Victoria, where Medibank Private has a large proportion of its members, the increases were as high as 23 per cent.

          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           I still have some doubts about the figures which the minister and Medibank Private were using in trying to claim that the Medibank Private increase was only 12.9 per cent. In December last year I requested an explanation from both Medibank Private and the minister as to how they get this average increase of 12.9 per cent. Now, eight or nine weeks later, I am still waiting for an explanation. Medibank Private still cannot provide the shadow minister for health with a piece of paper telling us what the increases have been across the different tables, despite our many requests.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           You have to ask yourself whether that 12.9 per cent increase is valid. We do know that the minister and the Prime Minister have claimed that they were responsible for talking down the level of these increases, but no&amp;hyphen;one has ever been able to provide the opposition or the Australian people with any evidence that tries to back up this claim. As a result of that, we remain quite sceptical about the minister's claims  in this area.

           I certainly think that the large number of Australians out there who might have been prepared to give the government the benefit of the doubt in that they were offering this subsidy for people for their private health insurance, perhaps giving the Liberals the benefit of the doubt at the last election, 11 months later—as we are getting close to the first anniversary of the election of the government—they are saying quite clearly that there
           <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
            will be very little left of this health insurance incentive by the time it begins to be paid on 1 July. There will be very little of it left because of the increases in premiums that have taken place. So we can expect that the reduction in the number of Australians who have maintained their private health insurance will continue to erode.

           The other point that I would like to make this evening is that it has become clear to the opposition from a briefing, which I am grateful to the minister for arranging, that in order to apply for this incentive members of the public will be required to estimate their own annual income and to provide certain other information to the government. What I find amazing is that apparently Australians will have to fill out a 15&amp;hyphen;page form before they will be entitled to get this private health insurance incentive.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The government, which claims it is committed to reducing red tape, is asking people to fill out a 15&amp;hyphen;page form to get this rebate. I really do think the government has to go back and ask itself if it is trying hard enough. If you cannot get an application form for a health insurance rebate in less than a few pages, there is something seriously wrong.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           I think most Australians out there are going to be pretty outraged that they have to jump through all these hoops before they are entitled to receive the benefit from this health insurance rebate. I would certainly be concerned about how many public servants will be employed to process these 15&amp;hyphen;page forms or, if they are going to be processed by the private health funds, how many extra staff the private health funds are going to have to employ to process all these new bits of paper that the government is going to impose upon us.

          <para first-indent="16">
           For all of these reasons, we will not be seeking to block this legislation. We do not believe it would be right to punish the contributors because this government has stuffed up private health insurance. We think it would be wrong to penalise the Australians who took this government on good faith when they expected a reduction in their private health insurance premiums. But those people out there realise that, as a result of the premium
           <break page="1138" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            increases that this government has presided over, there will be very little benefit left by the time that 15-page form is filled out, completed and lodged. Certainly, if they have not got writer's cramp by the time they are through with filling out that 15-page form, they will have wallet cramp because the health insurance premium increases will have swallowed up much of that benefit by the time it comes through.

           The opposition will not be opposing this bill, but we believe it is to be deplored that these cutbacks have been made in our public hospital system, in pharmaceutical services and in the dental health system to pay for this new concession. We certainly think that, in hindsight, the government should come clean and admit that it would have been much better for us to have spent this money directly on helping people who were sick, in making sure more operations could be performed, in making sure operating theatres were operating longer and in making sure that all Australians got a benefit from the expenditure of this $1.7 billion.

         The opposition will be voting against this legislation in the House of Representatives if the government does not withdraw the bill and amend it in the way we have indicated in the second reading amendment. We are not seeking to block the imposition of the Medicare levy on people whose incomes exceed the thresholds nominated by the government if they have not taken out private health insurance, but we will only support that if the government shows it is fair dinkum about this measure by making sure that all of the money raised through this new Medicare levy is spent as extra federal funding for public hospitals.

         You are going to hear a lot about public hospitals over the next two years because the Labor opposition believes that our public hospital system is the pressure point in our health care system in Australia today. The cuts that this government has made in federal funding for public hospitals—$800 million cuts in federal funding for public hospitals—will make the pressures in the public hospital system even worse. The waiting lists will get longer. We are going to see, right around Australia, the pressures in our public hospital system get worse.

         The measures before the House are the result of broken promises. The government promised before the last election no new taxes. This is the second occasion on which we have seen the Medicare levy increased. The first occasion was for the gun buyback, and that was a measure which the Labor opposition, in a bipartisan way, agreed to support. But it makes the point that, when the government on two occasions within 12 months increases the Medicare levy, it is quite
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          clear that the undertaking made by the then shadow Treasurer, Peter Costello—that is, that there would never be an increase in taxes under John Howard as Prime Minister—has been disposed of, not as a core promise but as a disposable promise.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Despite this being a massive breach of promise, we believe that this policy is slick and cunning. By announcing this policy close to the budget, the government sought to put a ribbon around it. This is the Medicare levy ribbon wrapped around last year's budget—a nice pink ribbon and a bow—to try to make it look like this was an attractive measure to ordinary Australians because it was a new tax on people on high incomes.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The reason we say that this is slick and cunning is that, in fact, the vast majority of people earning more than the income thresholds in the bill already have private health insurance. Despite the big song and dance the Treasurer made in the week or two after the election, the figures from the health department show that only 110,000 singles and 100,000 couples and families will be affected by the increase.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That's why it is cunning: it seems to hit the rich but it is only really window dressing because most people on those high incomes already escape the test that is applied by this government. In fact, our biggest worry is this penalty levy, the nice little pink bow that people might think is a nice little narrow bow that affects only people on high incomes. It is actually starting off as a thin bow, but we are very worried that within a few years this ribbon is going to totally envelop every Australian or all Australians on quite low incomes.

         What stops this government—having introduced the levy at this income threshold of $100,000 for families this year—later claiming that the Costello black hole has meant that it has had to reconsider its position on this issue? What stops Treasurer Costello getting up on the budget this year to announce an amendment in the income threshold, bringing it down from $100,000 to $80,000? What stops Treasurer Costello, if he is still the Treasurer when the budget after is brought down, lowering it from $80,000 to
         <break page="1139" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          $60,000 in the following budget? The only thing that we can guarantee is that this new Medicare levy, which starts out with a $100,000 threshold today, is going to have a threshold a lot lower than $100,000 before this government is all through, however early we may wish that would happen.

         That is why we are going to be moving another set of amendments in the consideration in detail stage that will seek to index those income tax thresholds. We are going to try to make sure that these thresholds are maintained by an appropriate indexation mechanism that tries to apply force to this government. If, at any time in the future, this government seek to manipulate and use this Medicare levy to force more people into private health insurance, we are going make sure they stand naked and exposed. We are going to force these people to come into this chamber and argue why they want to see a two&amp;hyphen;tier health system develop in Australia, because this is the thin edge of the wedge for the introduction of a two&amp;hyphen;tier health system.

         It is no surprise that this is happening in health. In last year's budget, we saw it happening in universities. We see the introduction of full fees being charged for some Australian students and free university education for others. I am sure that this mix might also change in future years. We are seeing it in nursing homes. My colleague the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), who is present in the House, understands probably more than any other Australian the implications that the introduction of this two&amp;hyphen;tier system in nursing home care is going to have for ordinary Australians right across this country.

I certainly believe that it is a backward step for us to have this development in health care in Australia.

I have to break it to the member for Corangamite that, if he wants to do what Graham said, he must accept the opposition's amendment because the Graham Richardson proposal—however flawed it may have been and even if it did risk introducing a two&amp;hyphen;tier system in his day—was for the introduction of a higher Medicare levy for people over certain income levels who did not take out private health insurance, on the one condition that all of the money raised through that extra Medicare

            levy went back in extra funding for public hospitals.

          As we can certainly make clear, there is a billion dollar difference between this government and the Labor Party on funding for public hospitals. An $800 million cut in federal funding for public hospitals, announced in last year's budget, stands in contrast to the promise at the last election by the Labor Party to increase our funding for public hospitals by $150 million. That is the gap: a billion dollars. Just think how many extra operations could be performed for a billion dollar injection into our public hospital system—an injection which the AMA believes is overdue and an injection which the Industry Commission says should happen—rather than through this government's flawed health insurance incentive.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Finally, I turn to the second part of the last bill which makes up the government's package: the government's second attempt to introduce a tax on the sick by increasing the threshold for out&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;pocket medical expenses before people start to get the benefit of the tax rebate. I can give you the example of a pensioner in my electorate who has been forced by the government's cuts in the PBS system to pay an additional $700 a year for an antifungal cream for his wife who is bedridden, having suffered a stroke. The increase in this threshold will make things even harder for my constituent and his wife. It is of course another broken promise, another increase in taxes, another breach of the Treasurer's commitment made before the last election, and it is another attack on those who can least afford it. For those reasons, we remain hopeful that the opposition's second reading amendment will be accepted and carried by this House.

The amendments that he has moved to these particular bills seem to give an inkling of some policy direction that we might see more of. Apparently, point (3) in the first amendment he moved suggests that there should be direct subsidies for private hospital accommodation. I wonder whether that is something that he might want to enlarge on. Not tonight; you have already had plenty tonight, if you do not mind. But at some time you might want to enlarge on that.

           —Apparently the whole thesis that they are putting before us is that the money that we are putting in in this legislation to provide subsidies for private health insurance would have been better spent on the public hospital system. Up until March last year we had 13 years of Labor government—13 years when they had the opportunity to fix the problems in the public health system. They were obviously and notoriously unsuccessful at doing that.

          We have come to government with a plan to address the problems in the public health system. Apparently, they do not accept that, despite the fact that, as the member for Dobell said, Graham Richardson thought it was a good idea, not that we have necessarily taken his advice word for word. But the principle which he subscribed to—and he was absolutely correct—was that part of the problem with the public system was the fact that the private system had been strangled under Labor to such an extent that people were leaving the private system in droves and going into the public system, which was not adequately funded to cope with them.

          The Labor Party described this legislation that we have put before the parliament as a cruel hoax. But what the Australian people had imposed on them under their system—under the Medicare system—was, in fact, a cruel hoax itself because it held out to Australians that we would have this great free public health system. What happened? Quite predictably, it just could not cope. Hence, we have long waiting lists in all of our hospitals. For older constituents of mine, getting surgery like hip replacements can take up to two or three years. I have constituents still calling me, as they did in the Labor years, complaining about that two&amp;hyphen;year wait. A hip in need of replacement may not be life&amp;hyphen;threatening but it certainly is quality of life threatening and it is  totally unacceptable that people should be forced to wait, often immobile, in their homes for two or three years for a hip replacement.

           The solution to the problem is relatively simple. I hope that the member for Dobell can understand it. If he thought about it, he would acknowledge it. You have to get people out of the public hospital system—out of those queues—and back into the private system. But you never really philosophically wanted the private system to work. In 13 years the former government set about to destroy the private health system. They almost succeeded. With the election of the Howard government a year ago we set about putting in place a program which would rescue the private health system and do what the former government said originally—that Medicare and the private system would complement each other and co-exist. Whilst that was said as part of the rationale, the introduction of Medicare was never delivered because they never really wanted it to happen.

           I want to deal with a couple of things that the member for Dobell said. I am happy that he left me about six minutes in which to say these things while Australia is listening out there. He had the audacity to talk about the private health fund increases—the premium rises. He was being quite disingenuous about this. Let me ask the question: in 13 years of Labor government, how many increases in private health fund premiums did the Labor Party stop? The answer is none—n-o-n-e, none. Each premium increase that was sought by the private health funds was granted by the Labor Party. Under Labor, average private health insurance premiums rose by 12 per cent per year. Yet you have the audacity to criticise our reaction to the approval of those, I must admit in some senses, badly timed increases.

          —I will take on the honourable member any time he would care to choose. During these discussions, I am sure that many members would have harked back to the history of immigration in Australia, especially the postwar years when literally millions of migrants came to these shores from a Europe which lay in devastation.

         As we would all know, a great many of the migrants who arrived in Australia, both before and after World War II, came from Italy. And what a contribution these people have made to this country of ours. Our entire social landscape has changed beyond recognition with their presence, and for the better. There are a number of pockets in Australia which are synonymous with Italians and Italian culture—Carlton in Melbourne, Leichhardt in Sydney and Griffith in south-western New South Wales. My pocket of Sydney, the seat of Prospect in south-western Sydney, is also famous for its large Italian population.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The area in and around Prospect actually contains the largest number of Italian&amp;hyphen;born individuals in Australia—never mind the second, third and fourth generation Italian Australians who have also chosen to call that area their home. In Prospect you will find one of the major focal points of the Italian community in Australia—the Marconi Club, which I am proud to say I have been a member of for 37 years. In Prospect you will find the market gardens, which were started by Italian farmers more than 70 years ago. You will find throughout my electorate literally hundreds of small businesses, restaurants and community clubs all with names which identify their Italian heritage and each one a symbol of the hard work and determination these people brought to our community.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Over the last 50, 60 and even 70 years, the pioneers of this mass migration from Italy capitalised on the opportunities that Australia presented to them. Their sons, daughters and grandchildren are now carrying on their work. For the great majority of these pioneers, their
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          days of toiling in their market garden or manning the family business are over. The majority of them have now reached retirement age and face the same unique set of problems which confront the elderly, whatever their cultural background.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         While the need for sometimes greater care and attention is an accepted fact for the aged of all nationalities, it must be recognised that the elderly in our migrant communities—in this case, those of Italian heritage—often have specific cultural needs which must be catered for when providing aged services. With such a culturally specific and particularly large population suddenly reaching old age in south-western Sydney, I am sure members present can imagine the problems our community faces in providing for their general and individual needs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A group by the name of the South-west Italo-Australian Association, which formed in my area roughly two years ago, has stepped into the breach and set about remedying the undersupply of aged care services in south-western Sydney specifically designed for the Italian-Australian community. I am proud to offer them my full support.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The association's main aim at the moment is to build a retirement village close to the amenities and services which the members of this community know so well. So far, the association has been able to obtain a grant from the Ethnic Affairs Commission of New South Wales and is also employing a project officer whose work will help the group channel their existing resources more effectively and allow them to identify the present gaps in aged care offered to Italian Australians.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         With the assistance of the New South Wales Labor government and Fairfield City Council, the association has already secured a parcel of land of approximately 5&amp;half; acres in size adjacent to the Marconi Club. Subject to state ministerial approval, the association has also received a commitment in principle from the Department of Housing for a grant of $1.3 million—an initial contribution towards the development of the village.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So the association has obviously made a successful start. It also realises that most of
         <break page="1143" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          the money it needs will have to come through private fundraising, but it will need a great deal more assistance to get this project completed. On behalf of the association and the Italian Australian community in south-western Sydney, I call on the federal government, in particular, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), who has responsibility for nursing home grants, to give what assistance they can to help a group of Australians who are trying to help themselves and the elderly in their community. It really is an opportunity for the government to put its money where its mouth is on aged care and support the battlers of western Sydney. Its money will go some way to providing a much needed service for what is rapidly an ageing section of my constituency.

        <para first-indent="16">
         There was a commitment under the previous government for funding in the event that this committee got its act together and got up and running. I am pleased to say that at that time that commitment was also in excess of $1.5 million. I have written to the minister explaining how the group has now come together, how they have formulated their policies, how they have put into practice, with the land that they have, a committee that is worth while and how they will be able to deliver on what they have stated. I feel sure that this government will want to contribute to assist and achieve that.

          —Last Friday, it was a pleasure for me to attend a simulated aeromedical evacuation by an army Black Hawk helicopter at Wilsonton airport in Toowoomba. The occasion was the official handover of arguably the world's most advanced mobile intensive care resuscitation facility, or MIRF for short. It is pleasing to me that that facility has only been made possible through local commitment, local design and a lot of cooperation amongst various people.

That partnership involved academia, in particular, from the University of Southern Queensland in Toowoomba, industry—and, as I said before, very much from local industry—and, most importantly, the third of the triad, the Australian Defence Force.

So it has already saved a number of lives. I am very pleased that eight further MIRFs are under construction and that the two prototypes will be modified, bringing 10 in all for the Australian Defence Force.

          for publishing its photograph of the HSC students of the Mount Druitt High School; it has gained some notoriety in New South Wales. As the state member for Mount Druitt, Richard Amery, has said on a number of occasions, if these students had been charged with a serious criminal offence, the law would have prevented their photograph from being published. But their photograph was published in the

         But as distressing as this has been for the students—and I empathise with them—and, indeed, the school and the whole community, I feel that we ought to try to turn this terribly negative episode into a community positive. However, I will take some time to establish the way in which we should do it.

         The very first subcommittee I ever chaired in this place was an education, employment and training subcommittee looking into years 11 and 12. We produced a report called
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          The restless years
         </emphasis>
         . Amongst the recommendations we put in that report was an advocacy of

          senior high schools—or colleges, as they are known in some of the states. I must say that I was very privileged after the tabling of the report to address the first ever conference on senior high schools. I always have remained committed to the concept.

         Indeed, back in 1987 Richard Amery and I fought a local campaign to establish a senior high school for Mount Druitt—that is, a school dedicated to year 11 and 12 students, with the other five high schools being feeder high schools with years 7 to 10. It is a matter of extreme regret to me that it was a Labor state government and a Labor state minister who finally pulled the plug on this proposal, after outstanding community, parent and student support. But to its credit, the incoming Liberal government established the St Marys Senior High School—the first ever public senior high school in New South Wales. It did not have feeder high schools.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         At that time I was pleased to get a senior high school, but I was disappointed because it was suggested that eventually it would become an elite institution. Whilst initially struggling for students, now St Marys Senior High School can pick and choose—and I think something like 23 of its students came within the top 5,000 in the state. This senior high school has reversed the trend of students drifting from public schools to private schools—we have had a drift of private school students back to public.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I say to the House that it remains a deep regret of mine that, had we been successful back then in a Mount Druitt senior high school, we would never have had that photograph which was published by the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Daily Telegraph
         </emphasis>
         . I think it is entirely appropriate that the issue of a senior high school for Mount Druitt with feeder schools be back on the agenda, and I have certainly placed it there. It would correct the structural disadvantage existing high schools suffer of having most of their best students siphoned off to technological high schools, St Marys senior high and other elite schools.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         And we do need to do something to correct that structural disadvantage. But it has enormous benefits. The class sizes would be increased dramatically. Subject choice for
         <break page="1147" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          students would be very real. There would be competition within the classes. Of course, the great advantage of senior high schools is that they treat their students as adults. They are a good halfway house between the total freedom and responsibility of work and university, and the rigid discipline associated with junior high schools.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I remain committed to fighting for a senior high school. I certainly hope that the New South Wales state Labor government will not back out of the issue. I am particularly concerned to ensure that the inquiry into the results of Mt Druitt High, ordered by the state minister for education, receives wide publicity in my electorate. I hope that it allows the community—not just the parents of the affected students, not just the teachers in the affected high school, and not just the principal, but the whole community—to participate and comment on the recommendations. I am very confident that the community will come up with solutions for our students. Last but not least, I have to say that the young people in my electorate are, I believe, as bright as if not brighter than students from any other electorate in Australia.

          —Tonight I rise to bring to the attention of the House a coronial inquiry currently taking place in Brisbane; this is the third coronial inquest into the death of a 13&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old child by the name of Peta-Ann Devine, who died tragically in Mr Isa on 30 November 1994.

         A third inquest is unprecedented in Australian history and has been brought about through a David and Goliath battle by Peta-Ann's parents. It is a culmination of effort by Shirley and David Devine to get answers to the question of why their apparently perfectly healthy 13&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old teenage daughter suddenly, in the midst of a school swimming carnival, had something go wrong in her body and, by the time she was pulled from the water, was clinically dead. An autopsy performed 26 hours after her death recorded that Peta-Ann had died of toxic shock syndrome caused, it was claimed, by a tampon which she wore that day. Whilst the findings have been disputed by representatives of the multination

         As a direct result of that tragedy, the previous federal government, on 20 May 1995, modified legislation in Therapeutic Goods Order 51 pertaining to, among other things, identification and health risks on tampon packaging. Some of these modifications were as follows:

        <para font-size="-=2">

         In another section with regard to the information leaflet inside the packaging, it says:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         INFORMATION LEAFLET: A leaflet containing the following information shall be enclosed in each primary pack with the second paragraph being deleted from saying:

        <para style="Para">
         I have taken an interest in this case for some time. The announcement of the third inquest prompted me to check to see to what extent Therapeutic Goods Order 51 had been adhered to. To my surprise, I was able to purchase five separate brands from three different outlets, one brand being the Carefree brand used by Peta-Ann on the day of her death. I must say that none of these brands displayed the death warning.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I find it difficult to comprehend that, some 21 months after this order was implemented and 14 months after the final date for change, the product is still being sold without the death notice. While women will continue to use these products, it needs to be said that
         <break page="1148" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          many of the tampon brands target young users. Some of these youngsters are as young as 11 and 12. I have to say that the packaging itself is quite decorative and is certainly directly aimed at attracting the eye of the young consumer. I believe that we need to have very much an informed decision being made with regard to these products. I think that these youngsters should be fully aware of the consequences of their actions. I also believe that the notice about the risk of death should be clearly visible on the tampon packaging. This could mean that at least the kids are prompted to start to ask some questions and then make an informed choice as to whether or not they will continue to use this product. In doing this, I would hope that we can avoid the incidence of tragedies like that of Peta-Ann Devine.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I therefore call on all tampon manufacturers to take immediate action to have any products that do not comply with Therapeutic Goods Order 51 immediately removed from the supermarket shelves. I will certainly be discussing this with the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), and I will be looking at the possibility of forcing compliance in this area. I believe that it is something that is very serious. Given the amount of time that the companies have had to comply with the order, it is very irresponsible of them, and the outlets that market these products, to continue to do so without giving the appropriate warnings.

        (a) The earnings credit scheme has not been effective in achieving its purpose of providing an incentive for DSS customers to participate in paid employment. DSS data shows that of the estimated 4 million customers who could potentially access the scheme, only 3 per cent (approximately) actually accessed their earnings credit balance over the course of a year.
       </para>

        (b) The earnings credit scheme did assist people who undertook occasional casual work. However, there was a substantial group participating in regular casual or part time employment for whom the earnings credit scheme held little value. Where the person's regular earnings exceeded the income free area of $30 per week, no accrual of an earnings credit balance would occur.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        (c) The major incentive for DSS customers to participate in paid employment operates through the allowance income test. The more generous allowance income test tapers, which were introduced in

The current income test is a more equitable arrangement which provides a better incentive to work for DSS customers due to its  less complicated nature and generous taper provisions.
